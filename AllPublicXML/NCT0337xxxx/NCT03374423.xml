    <textblock>
      chronic pain affects the daily lives of post-surgical breast cancer patients. many of these
      patients were undertreated for pain and generally obtained poor pain relief.treated patients
      with chronic thoracic segmental pain including patients with post-mastectomy pain syndrome by
      radiofrequency for dorsal root ganglion reported longterm pain relief.

    <description>A Visual Analogue Scale is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured. For example, the intensity of pain. Operationally a VAS is usually a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by word descriptors at each end. The patient marks on the line the point that they feel represents their perception of their current state.The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimetres from the left handend of the line to the point that the patient marks.
Scoring and interpretation : using a ruler, score is determined by measuring the distance(mm) on the10 cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark ,providing a range of scores from (0_100).
A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. the following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm) .</description>

    <description>The procedure will be done under propofol sedation, under fluoroscopic guidance. The image intensifier will be rotated in a cephalo-caudal direction until the endplates of the thoracic vertebrae are aligned and the transverse processes became discernable from the ribs.
For the intercostal nerve group, the radiofrequency needle 10 cm with 10 ml active tip will then inserted to contact the lower edge of the transverse process of (T2-T5), the needle is walked off to obtain sensory stimulation between 0.3-0.6 mv and motor stimulation less than 1.2 mv .five cycle of pulsed radiofrequency will be delivered.</description>

    <description>The procedure will be done under propofol sedation, under fluoroscopic guidance.for dorsal root ganglion group, radiofrequency needle 10 cm with 10 ml active tip will inserted in a slightly medial-cephalad direction under the transverse processes, and using lateral fluoroscopic imaging, incrementally walked into the thoracic intervertebral foramen. Once correct needle position is confirmed, test stimulation will be performed at 50 Hz, during which time the needles will slightly redirected to optimize stimulation, the point of maximum stimulation will be designated to be the location of the dorsal root ganglion. five cycle of pulsed radiofrequency will be delivered.</description>
