    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib+Gemox regiment
      (gemcitabine，oxaliplatin, dexamethasone) for patients with Relapsed /Refractory Diffuse Large
      B Cell Lymphoma.

    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed /refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma usually have a bad
      prognosis. These patients cannot be treated successfully with the conventional chemotherapy
      of CHOP. The investigators have been proceeding this trial to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of the combination chemotherapy regiment Gemox regiment (gemcitabine，oxaliplatin,
      dexamethasone) with apatinib in the patients with relapsed /refractory diffuse large B cell
      lymphoma.
