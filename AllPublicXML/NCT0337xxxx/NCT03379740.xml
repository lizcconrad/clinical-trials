  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, concentration-ranging study to evaluate the nicotine PK
      profile and PD effects in healthy adult experienced users of closed tank/cartridge
      e-cigarettes using four different variants of P4M3 (nicotine concentration of 1.7%, 1.7% with
      1.1% lactic acid [LA], 3% with 1.1% LA, and 4% with 2% LA) or their own e-cigarettes.

  <detailed_description>

      The goal of the study is to evaluate the nicotine concentration profiles and derived PK
      parameters, subjective effects, behavioral parameters, including puffing topography
      parameters of P4M3 with four different variants of P4M3, in experienced e-cigarette users
      after a single-use experience with fixed puffing and after ad libitum use of P4M3.

      Four variants of P4M3 will be evaluated together with subjects' own e-cigarettes to evaluate
      the relationship between the e-liquid composition (nicotine concentrations and presence of
      lactic acid) and the amount of nicotine absorbed, the speed of absorption, and the puffing
      topography.
