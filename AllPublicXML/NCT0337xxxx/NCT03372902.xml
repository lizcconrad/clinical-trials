  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect blood and tissue to help develop tests that might be
      able to detect cancer earlier. The investigator will be collecting these samples and
      reviewing test results from participants who have had an area of concern found on breast
      imaging, as well as from participants who are scheduled to have a routine breast cancer
      screening mammogram.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Cohort I - BI-RADS 4 Cohort

          -  Females with one or more BI-RADS 4 radiographic lesions who are undergoing ultrasound,
             stereotactic or MRI-guided breast biopsy at MSKCC or at an MSK Alliance Member Site.
             If multiple imaging modalities were employed (mammogram, ultrasound, MRI) and no
             integrated score is provided, then the highest BI-RADS score will be used.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of breast biopsy

          -  Willing to provide blood samples for research purposes before biopsy.

          -  Able to provide written informed consent

        Cohort II - Reference Cohort A. Unselected BI-RADS 1/2 Cohort

          -  Females undergoing screening mammogram at MSKCC

          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of mammogram.

          -  Willing to provide blood samples for research purposes at time of mammogram

          -  Able to provide written informed consent. B. Females with Dense Breasts and BI-RADS
             1/2 Mammogram and MRI

          -  Females undergoing screening MRI at MSKCC

          -  Dense breasts (C or D) on screening mammogram performed within 3 months prior to
             screening MRI

          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of MRI

          -  Women with a BI-RADS 4 lesion who had the lesion previously biopsied

          -  Females with a current active malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancers. Females
             are considered not to have a &quot;current active&quot; malignancy if they have completed
             therapy and have no evidence of systemic disease for at least three years from the
             initial diagnosis

          -  Currently pregnant women

          -  History of bilateral mastectomy.

          -  Females with a current active malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancers. Females
             are considered not to have a &quot;current active&quot; malignancy if they have completed
             therapy and have no evidence of systemic disease for at least three years from the
             initial diagnosis.

          -  Pregnant women.
