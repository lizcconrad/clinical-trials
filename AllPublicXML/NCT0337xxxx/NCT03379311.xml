          5. Stable dose(s) of allowed AKC, VKC, or PAC medication(s) during the 14 days prior to
             screening and throughout the screening period; and commitment to remaining on the same
             dose(s) of AKC, VKC, or PAC medication(s) for the entire duration of study
             participation (unless dose modification is due to unforeseen medical necessity) per
             Section 8.1 and Section 8.2.

          9. Treatment for a clinically significant helminthic parasitic infection within 6 months
             of screening

         10. Use during the 30 days before Screening (or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) or use
             during the Screening period of topical decongestants, topical vasoconstrictors,
