    <textblock>
      Although chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects a growing number of people, epidemiologic data
      on incident CKD in the general population are scarce. Screening strategies to increase early
      CKD detection have been developed.

      Methods: From a community-based sample of 4,409 individuals residing in a well-defined
      geographical area, investigators determined the number of patients having a first serum
      creatinine value ≥1.7 mg/dL and present for at least 3 months that allowed us to calculate an
      annual incidence rate of CKD (stages 3 to 5). CKD (stages 3 to 5) was defined by estimated
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Investigators also described the
      primary care, outcomes and risk factors associated with outcomes using competing risks
      analyses for these CKD patients.
