  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most surviving hip-fracture patients experience reduced mobility and lose their functional
      ability, which increases the risk of complications and rehospitalization. Post-discharge
      transitional programs to reduce readmissions have shown some success. Telerehabilitation
      refers to the use of technologies to provide rehabilitation services to people in their
      homes. Considering the need for long-term follow-up care for people with hip fracture,
      in-home telerehabilitation could increase independence, decrease hospital stays and reduce
      the burden for caregivers.

      The purpose of this three armed randomized controlled trial is to investigate the
      effectiveness of an intervention program based on telerehabilitation on ADL, QOL, depression
      and burden on caregivers compared to face-to-face home visits and usual care of
      community-dwelling older adults after hip fracture.

      90 older people with hip fractures will be randomly assigned to a telerehabilitation group
      (N=30), face-to-face visits (N=30) and a control group.

      The aim of the intervention is to improve the transition from rehabilitation units to
      community dwelling. It will include 10 videoconferencing/ face-to-face sessions from an
      occupational therapist in the presence of the primary caregiver. Each session will be
      utilized to guide the participants to achieve their self-identified goals, focusing on
      problem-solving for daily life situations and on the ability to implement the discussed
      strategies for a variety of activities

    <description>The COPM will be used for measuring performance and satisfaction with personally identified participation goals. Participants are asked to identify goals and then rate their performance and satisfaction with current status on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 indicates optimal performance or satisfaction</description>

    <description>The aim of the FIM is to monitor the recovery of functional ability by people undergoing rehabilitation. The FIM is comprised of 18 parameters, each rated on a scale of 1-7 (range = 18-126) according to the degree of assistance required to perform a specific activity</description>
