      Despite the preliminary evidence, yoga as a treatment for schizophrenia is
      under-examined.Studies in healthy individuals indicate yoga practices to
      improveself-reflection. However, whether yoga treatment improves impairments in self-
      reflection typically seen in patients with schizophrenia is not examined. Hence, In this
      study we aim to examine whether yoga is efficacious as an add-on treatment in Schizophrenia
      in a randomized multi-centric trial and also whether yoga improves self-reflection in
      patients with schizophrenia.

      Despite the preliminary evidence, yoga as a treatment for schizophrenia is
      under-examined.Importantly, till date no randomized multi-centric trial has examined the
      efficacy of yoga as an addon treatment for schizophrenia which seriously limits the
      application of yoga in clinical practice.Moreover, the underlying mechanism by which yoga
      improves the symptoms of schizophrenia is not completely understood.

      Studies in healthy individuals indicate yoga practices to improveself-reflection. However,
      whether yoga treatment improves impairments in self- reflection typically seen in patients
      with schizophrenia is not examined.

      Thus, the overall goals of this proposal is to examine

        1. whether yoga as is efficacious as an add-on treatment in patients with schizophrenia in
           a randomised multi-centric trial

        2. whether yoga improves self-reflection in patients with schizophrenia.

      To achieve the first aim we aim to examine the efficacy of yoga as an add on treatment to
      schizophrenia in a multicentric single blind-randomized-control-trial. Five centers would
      recruit 50 patients each making a cumulative sample of 250 patients. Such a large sample
      would have the required power to examine the efficacy of yoga as a treatment to
      schizophrenia. A central stratified random sampling will be used to ensure concealed
      allocation. Subjects will be randomized to yoga therapy or wait-list control group. Those who
      are randomized to yoga will receive 12 weeks of yoga. Those who are randomized to wait-list
      control group will receive yoga after 12 weeks of waiting period. Standardized clinical
      assessments will be conducted by trained individuals to examine the changes in symptoms of
      schizophrenia. All subjects will undergo uniform assessments at baseline and after 12 weeks.
      Those who are in waitlist control group will also undergo assessment at the end of 24 weeks.
      The effect of yoga treatment compared to waitlist control group will be analysed to see the
      effect of yoga on symptoms of schizophrenia.

      To achieve the second aim (i) we will develop and employ behavioural scale to measure changes
      in self-reflection based on yoga psychology - Scale for Assessment of Self-reflection. The
      scale will be developed based on the yoga psychology. The scale would measure the dimensions
      of self-centrality, body-centrality, cognitive-centrality and content of experience. The
      scale would be developed at National Institute of Advanced studies and validated at clinical
      centres. Scale will be administered to a sample of 250 healthy controls and 250 patients (ii)
      we plan to obtain first in-vivo functional neuroimaging data using functional magnetic
      resonance imaging(fMRI) to investigate neurobiological effects of yoga treatment in brain
      regions associated with self reflection. A validated fMRI task which has been used ins
      chizophrenia patients earlier will be used in the proposed study. The task specifically
      examines the brain regions involved in the self- reflection ability. A subgroup of patients
      (n=40) and healthy controls (n=20) at NIMHANS, Bangalore will undergo fMRI scan. 20 patients
      receiving yoga treatment and 20 patients in wait list control group will undergo fMRI scan
      before and after 12 weeks to examine the changes in brain activation after yoga treatment.
      Put together, this unique study brings together experts from psychiatry, philosophy,
      psychology and neuroimaging, which are complementary to understand the efficacy and mechanism
      of yoga in Schizophrenia.
