  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim is to study correlations between Peak inspiratory flow measured during a
      spirometry (PIFspiro) and Peak inspiratory flow measured over a pre-set resistance
      (PIFresist) in COPD patients and severe asthma patients. PIFresist will be measured using 5
      different resistances, representing all DPI's relevant for the treatment of obstructive lung
      diseases. If this shows a distinct relationship between PIFspiro and PIFresist, PIFspiro
      cut-off points will be sought in an attempt to predict which patients are likely to be able
      to produce optimal flows for DPI use. If successful, this will make the actual measurement of
      PIFresist redundant in clinical practice. Also the relationship between PIFresist and device
      internal resistance in addition to PIFspiro (which corresponds to a very low resistance) will
      be examined.

      The correct use of dry powder inhalers (DPI) crucially depends on the peak inspiratory flow
      (PIF) that the patient can generate when overcoming internal resistance of the inhaler
      device.

      It has been shown that some patients cannot achieve sufficient peak inspiratory flows with
      some DPI's, especially in the elderly population. The In-check Dial device (Clement Clarke
      International Ltd, Harlow, UK) allows to measure these inspiratory flows for different
      pre-set resistances, representing different DPI's.

      Study design: interventional, single center, single visit study

      30 Severe asthmatics and 70 COPD patients will be recruited in the UZ Brussel respiratory
      outpatient clinic.

      All participants will provide written informed consent.

      Patients will perform:

        -  pre-bronchodilator spirometry for the measurement of PIFspiro as per European
           respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) guidelines for standard lung
           function5 (part of routine clinical follow-up).

        -  5 forced inspiratory manoeuvres using the In-check Dial device G16, set at 5 different
           resistances (performed in order of increasing resistance), yielding the PIFresist values
           for the different DPI's
