  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed as a long-term follow-up study of patients who will receive
      genetically modified autologous CAR-T cells as part of clinical trial at the Medical College
      of Wisconsin/ Froedtert Hospital-- Phase 1 Study of CAR-20/19-T Cells in Patients with
      Relapsed Refractory B Cell Malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to follow patients receiving CD20/CD19 lentiviral modified CAR-T cells
      (CAR-20/19-T cells) from years 2 to 15 post-treatment for persistence of CAR-T cells,
      development of secondary malignancies, or other medical complications.
