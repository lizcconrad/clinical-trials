  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to validate that PLGF is a biomarker of cerebral lesions and therefore of
      secondary developmental disorders and disabilities that will be best diagnosed at 2 and 6
      years of age.

    <time_frame>6 years</time_frame>
    <description>WPPSI - IV: The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence consist of 14 subtests. They are designated as one of three types: core, supplemental, or optional. The core subtests are required for the computation of the Verbal, Performance, and Full Scale IQ. The supplemental subtests provide additional information about cognitive abilities or can be used as replacement for inappropriate subtests. The optional subtests provide additional information about cognitive functioning but cannot be used as replacements for core subtests. Quotient and Composite scores have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Subtest scaled scores have a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 3.elow 70 is Extremely Low, 70-79 is Borderline, 80-89 is Low Average, 90-109 is Average, 110-119 is High Average, 120-129 is Superior, 130+ is Very Superior.</description>

    <description>NEPSY -NEuroPSYchological Assessment. The six functional domains are made up of 32 subtests and four delayed tasks. These domains are theoretically, not statistically, derived. The subtests were designed to assess cognitive abilities related to disorders that are typically diagnosed in childhood and that are required for success in an academic environment. These tests supposedly help detect any underlying deficiencies that may impede a child's learning</description>
