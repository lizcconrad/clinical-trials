    <description>Seizure frequency refers to 28-day adjusted frequency. Observable focal-onset seizures refer to Type IAl, IB, and IC (according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Classification of Epileptic Seizures, 1981). Focal-onset seizures include all Type I seizures.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is an adult (18 years of age or more )

          -  Subject with epilepsy who has completed 1 of the previous Padsevonil (PSL) studies
             which allow access to the present study

          -  Female subjects of child bearing potential must have a serum negative pregnancy test
             at the Entry Visit, which is confirmed to be negative by urine testing prior to
             further dispensing at each study visit thereafter. Subjects will be withdrawn from the
             study as soon as pregnancy is known. Female subjects will use an efficient form of
             contraception for the duration of the study and for a period of 3 months after their
             final dose of PSL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has any severe medical, neurological, or psychiatric condition, or laboratory
             value which may have an impact on the safety of the subject

          -  Subject has active suicidal ideation as indicated by a positive response ('Yes') to
             either Question 4 or Question 5 of the 'Since Last Visit' version of the
             Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)

          -  Subject has &gt;2x upper limit of normal (ULN) of any of the following: alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
             or &gt;ULN total bilirubin (&gt;= l.5x ULN total bilirubin if known Gilbert's syndrome) at
             the Entry Visit

          -  Subject has a clinically-significant abnormality on electrocardiogram (ECG) that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, increases the risks associated with participating in
             the study

          -  Subject has an abnormality on echocardiogram at last echocardiogram assessment, or
             foreseen in parent study as assessed by central reader that is accompanied by clinical
             symptoms or a Grade 2* (or higher)/moderate severity abnormality, or a history of
             rheumatic heart disease, or other known valvular abnormalities (*according to the ASE
             Guidelines, 2017; Zoghbi et al 2017)
