  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In obese children, excess fat on the thorax exerts an unfavorable burden on the respiratory
      system, particularly during exercise; however, it is unclear if this burden reduces exercise
      tolerance, provokes dyspnea on exertion, or contributes to respiratory symptoms that could be
      misdiagnosed as asthma, placing obese children at risk of unnecessary treatment and
      potentially a reluctance to exercise explaining reports of low physical activity and fitness
      levels, which are counterproductive to weight loss. The investigators will examine the
      respiratory effects of obesity in prepubescent boys and girls, including those with
      respiratory symptoms misdiagnosed as asthma, before and after 1) a program of weight loss and
      regular exercise and 2) continued weight gain as compared with prepubescent normal weight
      boys and girls before and after 1 year. These results will have broad and immediate clinical
      impact on the care of obese children, especially those with respiratory symptoms misdiagnosed
      as asthma, and the results could alter interventional approaches for preventing and treating
      childhood obesity.

    <textblock>
      In obese children, excess fat exerts an unfavorable burden on the respiratory system,
      particularly during exercise, potentially reducing exercise tolerance and leading to DOE
      (dyspnea on exertion), which could explain reports of low physical activity and fitness
      levels in obese children. The investigators propose that most of the respiratory effects in
      obese children are the result of low lung volume breathing, i.e., a reduction in functional
      residual capacity (FRC) at rest, and end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) during exercise.

      The overall objective of this application is to investigate the respiratory effects of
      obesity in prepubescent children, including obese children with respiratory symptoms
      misdiagnosed as asthma, before and after 1) a program of weight loss and regular exercise and
      2) continued weight gain as compared with normal weight children before and after 1 yr. The
      investigative approach will be to examine respiratory function, exercise tolerance, and DOE
      in prepubescent obese boys and girls, including those misdiagnosed with asthma (i.e., asthma
      not confirmed by lung function tests), before and after 1) weight loss (or an equivalent
      reduction in BMI percentile) and regular exercise and 2) continued weight gain (or an
      increase in BMI percentile) as compared with prepubescent normal weight boys and girls before
      and after a control period of 1 yr.

      Specific Aims: The following hypotheses will be tested in obese children as compared with
      normal weight children:

      Aim 1) Obesity will decrease respiratory function but to a greater extent in obese children
      misdiagnosed with asthma as evidenced by altered pulmonary function and breathing mechanics
      at rest; Aim 2) Obesity will decrease exercise tolerance (as evidenced by peak VO2 in
      ml/min/kg, i.e., physical fitness), but not cardiorespiratory fitness (as evidenced by peak
      VO2 in % of predicted based on ideal body wt), except in obese children misdiagnosed with
      asthma where both may be reduced during graded cycle ergometry; Aim 3) Obesity will increase
      DOE but to a greater extent in obese children misdiagnosed with asthma as evidenced by
      increased ratings of perceived breathlessness during constant load exercise cycling; and Aim
      4) Weight loss and regular exercise will improve respiratory function, exercise tolerance,
      and DOE in obese children, including those misdiagnosed with asthma, while continued weight
      gain will worsen respiratory function, exercise tolerance, and DOE in obese children,
      including those misdiagnosed with asthma, as compared with normal weight children before and
      after 1 yr.

      The long-term objective is to investigate the effects of obesity on respiratory function,
      exercise tolerance, and DOE, examine obesity-related respiratory symptoms misdiagnosed as
      asthma in obese children, and provide novel results that could alter interventional
      approaches for preventing obesity and treating obesity in obese children. Thus, these results
      will have broad and immediate clinical impact on the care of obese children, especially those
      with respiratory symptoms misdiagnosed as asthma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Otherwise healthy with normal lung function; prepubescent (Tanner equal to or less
             than 3); age and gender specific BMI &gt; 95th percentile, but less than 150% of the 95th
             percentile based on the CDC standards or age and gender specific BMI between the 16th
             and 84th percentile based on the CDC standards; and ability to perform pulmonary and
             exercise test accurately.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with significant diseases other than obesity or shortness of breath on
             exertion will be excluded. Subjects participating in regular conditioning-type
             vigorous exercise two times or more per week will be excluded (i.e., sports training).
             Children who are non-English speaking will be excluded from the study because the
             tests performed are very effort dependent, detailed, and require technical
             communication between the staff and the child.
