    <textblock>
      This study examines the effect of short burst interval treadmill training in ambulatory
      children with cerebral palsy. Half the sample will receive 20 sessions of training over 4
      weeks, while half will receive the training over 10 weeks.

    <textblock>
      Ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP) experience activity limitations which negatively
      influence their ability to physically participate in day to day life. Therefore, these
      children are at greater risk for inactivity and functional decline with age. In contrast,
      typically developing (TD) children engage in short bursts of intense physical activity
      interspersed with varying intervals of low and moderate intensity within their natural
      environment. These physical activity patterns are very different from adult patterns Despite
      these inherent differences, locomotor treadmill training (LTT) protocols designed to improve
      walking activity in children with CP simulate adult protocols, consisting of continuous low
      to moderate walking endurance activity. Body weight supported or robot assisted LTT is based
      on the underlying premise of modifying neural circuitry via spinal pathways. However, this
      type of training has not been shown to be more effective than other comparable interventions
      and presents with significant fiscal and logistical barriers to clinical translation.

      This study will determine the effect of short-burst interval LTT without body weight support
      on the primary outcomes of walking performance and capacity and the secondary outcomes of
      day-to-day mobility based participation in children with CP with functional walking
      limitations. To identify key muscular mechanisms associated with improved walking mobility,
      the investigators will examine the effects of short-burst interval LTT on quadriceps muscle
      performance and architecture. Secondarily, the study team will collect preliminary data on
      two LTT dosing frequencies.
