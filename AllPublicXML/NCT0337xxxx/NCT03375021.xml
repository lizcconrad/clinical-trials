      A Randomized, Double-Blind, Two-Period Crossover Study to Assess the Efficacy And Safety of

    <textblock>
      This study examined the clinical efficacy, tolerability and safety of CX717 in the treatment
      of adults with ADHD. The study was a double-blind, 2-period crossover study that compared 2
      different doses of CX717 with placebo. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 different treatment
      sequences: placebo - low dose; low dose - placebo; placebo - high dose; or high dose -
      placebo. Each treatment period was 3 weeks with a 2-week washout between treatment periods.
      The doses chosen were 200 mg b.i.d. and 800 mg b.i.d.

    <description>Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) with Prompts The ADHD-RS is an 18-item scale that assesses the severity ADHD symptoms based on the symptom list in the DSM-IV. It is administered by a qualified health care professional.
Each item is rated 0 - 3 (0=not present and 3=severe). Thus the scale has a range from 0 to 54.</description>
