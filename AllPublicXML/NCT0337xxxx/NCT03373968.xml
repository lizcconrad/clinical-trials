  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy study of GIVINOSTAT in
      all DMD (Duchenne's muscular dystrophy) patients who have been previously treated in one of
      the GIVINOSTAT studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Givinostat oral suspension (10 mg/mL) will be administered orally as 2 oral doses daily while
      the subject is in fed state. The subjects will continue to receive the same dose that has
      been taken in the previous study. Moreover, as givinostat exposures are influenced by
      subjects'weight, the dose will be adjusted by the subjects weight gain during the trial.

      Study drug should be permanently stopped if any of the following occur:

        -  severe drug-related diarrhoea;

        -  any drug-related Serious Adverse Event;

        -  QTcF &gt;500 msec;

        -  platelets count ≤50 x 10e9/L.

      Study drug should be temporarily stopped if any of the following occur:

        -  platelets count &lt;75 x 10e9/L but &gt;50 x 10e9/L (the treatment should be temporarily
           stopped and a platelets count has to be performed and retested until platelets will be
           normalized);

        -  moderate or severe diarrhoea. In case the study drug was temporarily stopped, the study
           drug can be resumed at a level 1/3 smaller than the one at which the Adverse Event
           leading to temporary stop occurred, once platelets are normalized or diarrhoea is mild
           (if treatment was stopped for moderate or severe diarrhoea).

      The first interim analysis will be performed after 48 weeks after the First Subject First
      Visit and then yearly till the marketing authorization will be granted. In each Interim
      Analysis all safety and efficacy variables will be analyzed.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have participated in one of the previous studies with GIVINOSTAT in DMD and have
             attended the End of Study Visit;

          -  Are able to give informed assent and/or consent in writing signed by the subject
             and/or parent/legal guardian (according to local regulations);

          -  Subjects must be willing to use adequate contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any pharmacologic treatment, other than corticosteroids, that might have had an
             effect on muscle strength or function within 3 months prior to be enrolled in this
             study (e.g., growth hormone); Vitamin D, calcium, and any other supplements will be
             allowed;

          -  Use of any current investigational drug other than Givinostat;

          -  Have presence of other clinically significant disease, which, in the Investigator's
             opinion, could adversely affect the safety of the subject, making it unlikely that the
             course of treatment or follow-up would be completed, or could impair the assessment of
             study results;

          -  Have a diagnosis of other neurological diseases or presence of relevant somatic
             disorders that are not related to DMD;

          -  Have platelets count, White Blood Cell and Hemoglobin at screening &lt; Lower Limit of
             Normal (LLN) (for abnormal screening laboratory test results (&lt;LLN), the platelets
             count, White Blood Cell and Hemoglobin will be repeated once; if the repeat test
             result is still &lt;LLN, then exclusionary);

          -  Have heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV)

          -  Have a current liver disease or impairment, including but not limited to an elevated
             total bilirubin (i.e. &gt; 1.5 x ULN), unless secondary to Gilbert disease or pattern
             consistent with Gilbert's;

          -  Have a baseline QT interval, Fredericia's correction, (QTcF) &gt;450 msec, (as the mean
             of 3 consecutive readings 5 minutes apart) or history of additional risk factors for
             torsades de pointes (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, or family history of long QT
             syndrome);

          -  Have a psychiatric illness/social situations rendering the potential subject unable to
             understand and comply with the muscle function tests and/or with the study protocol
             procedures.

          -  Have any hypersensitivity to the components of study medication;

          -  Have a sorbitol intolerance or sorbitol malabsorption, or have the hereditary form of
             fructose intolerance.
