  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study on biologics (Vedolizumab/anti-TNF) in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD) patients in Germany extends the prospective documentation of efficacy in induction and
      maintenance therapy of anti-TNF to the use of Vedolizumab with a particular interest in the
      construction of a multifactorial model to predict long-term responses and favorable disease
      outcome or to predict severe side effects caused by therapy with biologics. Little data are
      available on the efficacy and safety of biologics in Germany in a real world situation. While
      the increasing use of anti-TNF-alpha antibodies in IBD-patients the new therapy with
      Vedolizumab opens up new opportunities in IBD-therapy, it may also pose new options and
      problems in terms of efficacy and predictors of response and potential side effects.

      The IBD-patients will be prospectively documented in the BIOibd-Registry. The diagnosis is
      made in accordance with current DGVS/ECCO UC/CD guidelines. There are the following inclusion
      and exclusion criteria:

      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  IBD-patients (UC/CD) aged 18-80 years at enrollment

        -  Written informed consent is given Exclusion Criteria:Lack of adequate documentation
           possibilities

        -  Malignant disease in history

        -  Planned surgical intervention

      There are three subpopulations:

        1. IBD-patients (age at enrollment: 18-80 years) receiving a newly introduced Vedolizumab
           (VDZ) therapy (n=1.800). A former therapy with other biologics is allowed. More than 30%
           of these Vedolizumab patients will be biologics-naiv.

        2. IBD-patients (age at enrollment: 18-80 years) receiving a newly introduced
           anti-TNF-alpha therapy other than VDZ (n=350) in biologics-naiv patients.

        3. IBD patients (age at enrollment: 18-80 years) with an early disease (n=350), who were
           first diagnosed &lt; 2 years before the start of documentation in the Investigator
           initiated non-interventional study (NIS) but have not yet received and are not planned
           to receive biologics in the near future.

      Patients with IBD on Vedolizumab/anti-TNF will be documented in a prospective online
      documentation form at the participating study sites. In parallel, these sites will also
      document consecutively early disease IBD patients who were diagnosed less than 2 years
      previously. These patients will be used as a control group.The data will be documented in an
      online documentation form. After initial documentation at enrollment and during induction (0,
      2, 6 and 14 weeks), follow-up documentation using an abbreviated online follow-up form will
      be requested every 6 months during the longitudinal investigation. Any drug side effects are
      also captured online on a side effects form.
