  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Axillary lymph node status is an important prognostic factor for patients with breast cancer.
      After breast cancer diagnosis, current nodal staging consists of axillary ultrasound (US)
      combined with tissue sampling when deemed necessary. In case of positive axillary lymph
      nodes, patients will undergo axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). In case of no suspicious
      axillary lymph nodes (i.e. clinically node negative patients), patients will undergo sentinel
      lymph node biopsy (SLNB). This surgical nodal staging is accompanied by co-morbidity. In
      theory, if non-invasive imaging can evaluate the lymph node status accurately, a node
      negative patient would no longer have to undergo axillary surgery. Since MRI is suitable for
      soft tissue imaging and PET has the advantage of showing increased metabolic uptake in lymph
      node metastases, a combination of these techniques in hybrid PET/MRI would be highly
      desirable. If dedicated axillary hybrid PET/MRI is equally accurate to SLNB for the detection
      of negative axillary lymph nodes, work-up could be more efficient by bypassing SLNB. However,
      the accuracy of dedicated axillary hybrid PET/MRI needs to be compared with the pathological
      outcome of SLNB (gold standard) first.
