  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to experimentally assess whether an early parenting intervention for
      maltreating parents results in differential epigenetic marking of children's genome,
      particularly of DNA associated with immune system functioning, obesity, and mental health.

      This study assesses whether a 10-session intervention for maltreating parents effects the
      epigenome of young children who have experienced early maltreatment. Families are randomly
      assigned to the experimental condition (Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-Up) or a treatment
      control (Developmental Education for Families). Biological samples and behavioral
      observations of parenting will be collected pre- and post- intervention. Biological samples
      will be used to conduct whole genome analyses of differential DNA methylation that occur as a
      result of the intervention. Behavioral observations of parent-child interactions will be used
      to assess the efficacy of the intervention in altering parenting behaviors.

    <description>Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) is a 10-session, weekly intervention delivered in the family's home. ABC addresses three primary issues. First, young children who have experienced early adversity are especially in need of nurturance and parents who behave in synchronous ways and delight in them. Next, when parents behave in frightening ways, it is difficult for children to look to them for reassurance when distressed. This can be particularly difficult for children who have experienced early adversity. Therefore, this intervention helps parents learn how to: 1) behave in nurturing ways when children are distressed; 2) behave in synchronous, delighted ways when children are not distressed; and 3) avoid behaving in frightening or intrusive ways. Interventionists are provided with a manualized protocol, but tailor specific session content to each family's needs. Sessions are videotaped, both for playback to families, and for supervision.</description>

    <description>Developmental Education for Families (DEF) is a 10-session, weekly intervention delivered in the family's home. DEF focuses on enhancing gross and fine motor skills, cognition and language development. The age-based protocols (i.e., 6-24 months,) provide information about the developmental themes of focus for each week and suggest activities to enhance the target skills for that week. However, the protocols do not provide a direct script with which to conduct the sessions. Interventionists tailor the developmental program session to the needs of the child and family by considering the child's current gross, fine, cognitive and language skills and creatively preparing several activities that will address the session topics.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Parents will be considered potentially eligible if they have a child between the ages
             of 6 and 20 months and have a history of substantiated or unsubstantiated report of
             maltreatment or domestic violence. After obtaining informed consent, observational
             assessments of sensitivity will be conducted, allowing screening of parents with low
             levels of sensitivity (who are expected to benefit more from the intervention than
             others). Only those parents who have scores in the insensitive range will be included
             in the full study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with known serious medical issues (e.g., cerebral palsy) will be excluded
             from the sample. Also, high-risk parents will be screened for sensitivity to ensure
             that they will benefit from the intervention. Only those who are screened as
             relatively insensitive (1-2 on a 5 point coding scale) will be included in the full
             study.

          -  If the primary caregiver loses custody of the child before completion of the project,
             the participant will be withdrawn from the study.

          -  If the primary caregiver is incarcerated before completion of the study, the subject
             will be withdrawn from the study.
