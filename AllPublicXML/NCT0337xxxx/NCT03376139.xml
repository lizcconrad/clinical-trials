  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if, compared to placebo, zonisamide (400mg/day)
      is a safe and efficacious treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use
      disorder (AUD) in Veterans with PTSD and co-occurring AUD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to examine the ability of
      5-weeks treatment with zonisamide to reduce symptoms of PTSD and AUD. The study population
      will consist of 60 Veterans with combat-related PTSD and co-morbid AUD. Veterans will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive either zonisamide (up to 400 mg/day) or placebo daily for 35Â±4days,
      followed by a 14-day down-titration period with follow-up. Primary efficacy variables are
      scores on the CAPS-5, fear-potentiated startle (FPS) responses, and percent of heavy drinking
      days (%HDD).

          6. Self-report drinking heavily (5 standard units for males, 4 for females) on at least
             30% of the 42 days prior to the screening interview

          7. Score less than 10 on the revised clinical institute withdrawal assessment for alcohol
             scale (CIWA-Ar) assessed in the context of a breath alcohol concentration (BAC) less
             than or equal to 0.02% to demonstrate that they do not need medical detoxification
             (Sullivan et al. 1989)

          8. Have blood lab tests assessed at screening with ranges falling within the acceptable
             limits as noted in the protocol.

          9. Have normal vitals (heart rate 60-100 bpm, systolic blood pressure 90-140 mmHg and
             diastolic blood pressure 60-90 mmHg) and a baseline ECG that demonstrates clinically
             normal sinus rhythm, clinically normal conduction, normal QTc, and no clinically
             significant arrhythmias. Note that clinical judgement will be used when characterizing
             bradycardia among some healthy subject populations, for example, conditioned veterans.
             Thus, some individuals with bradycardia (i.e., heart rate less than 60 bpm) may be
             enrolled as determined by the admitting physician.

         10. Have a self-reported medical history and brief physical examination demonstrating no
             clinically significant contraindications for study participation, in the judgment of
             the admitting physician

             longer, depending on medication half-life) prior to enrollment

         12. Be willing/able to stop use of any sleep medication for the duration of the study

         13. Be willing to comply with all study procedures and be available for the duration of
             the study

         14. Women must either be unable to conceive (i.e., surgically sterilized, sterile, or

             birth control pills + intrauterine device, condoms + spermicide, etc.). Women can be
             receiving hormone replacement treatment (HRT) if the HRT dose has been stable for a
             period of at least 3 months

         15. Women must provide negative urine pregnancy tests prior to randomization

         16. Be willing to undergo a hearing test and be able to detect 500-2000 Hz tones at 40 dB
             or less.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. DSM-5 criteria for substance use disorders other than alcohol or nicotine or test
             positive for prescription or illegal drugs. Regarding marijuana/THC, an individual
             must test negative at the screening. If an individual's test is positive, they will be
             given a grace period where they will have the opportunity to return and test negative

             of alcohol.

             a. Note that participants may currently be seeking treatment (or already receiving a
             behavioral treatment) for AUD, but may not be taking medications used in the treatment
             of AUD (acamprosate, disulfiram, oral naltrexone, and extended-release injectable
             naltrexone, and topiramate)

          4. Have neurological or psychiatric disorders other than PTSD or AUD (except
             mild/moderate depression succeeding PTSD). Examples include:

               1. Current psychosis, bipolar illness or major depression requiring treatment.

                  which would make study compliance difficult.

               4. History of suicide attempts within the past year and/or current suicidal
                  ideation/plan

          7. Have contraindication(s) to take the study medications such as renal or hepatic
             impairment, congenital metabolic disorders, or hypersensitivity/allergies to study
             drug or similar compounds

          8. Have current epilepsy or evidence suggestive of seizure disorder

             dizziness, etc.) or past report of loss of consciousness (LOC) for greater than 30
             minutes and/or have been blast-exposed or had LOC of greater than 1 minute and current
             post-concussive symptoms
