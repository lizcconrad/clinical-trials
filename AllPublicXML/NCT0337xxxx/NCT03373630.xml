  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Midline catheter is a peripherally-inserted catheter, with the distal tip being placed at
      or below the level of the axilla. It is a relevant alternative to other catheters in case of
      limited venous access and long-run perfusions. Moreover, another significant advantage may be
      the reduction of the risk of infection.

      However, the Midline catheter is poorly described in scientific literature, essentially
      through retrospective and meta analyses including multiple types of catheters (Piccline, CVC,
      PAC). Therefore, the TIM-GHM study aims to prospectively assess the rate of infections in
      case of the Midline catheter.

      The results of this study could bring a collective benefit in terms of knowledge and
      reliability of these intravascular devices.

      Depending on these results, a randomized, controlled study will be considered, in order to
      compare the Midline catheter to its main alternative : the Piccline.
