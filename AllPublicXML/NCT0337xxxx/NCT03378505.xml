  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the impact of a mobile app (JOOL) focused on promoting purposeful
      living on student health behaviors, academic performance, self-regulation, well-being,
      resiliency, and self-efficacy.

      Participants will be recruited from a large undergraduate classroom. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of two conditions and asked to complete either online reflections or
      engage with a mobile app over the course of the semester. Students who elect to not
      participate will be provided an alternate assignment to complete, to be coordinated by their
      teaching assistant. Participants will additionally be asked to complete (1) a pre-survey, (2)
      post-survey, and follow-up survey 14 days after the class concludes. The study will examine
      changes in health-related behaviors, resiliency, well-being, and self-efficacy reported
      between the start and conclusion of semester/study.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomly assigned to two conditions. Half of the participants will be required to use a daily check-in mobile app that promotes alignment of daily behaviors with their individualized life purpose. The other half of participants will complete brief bi-weekly reflections. Alternative assignment provided for non-participating students.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in Health Behaviors</measure>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Resiliency</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks post start (1 semester)</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Resiliency Scale (BRS) used to measure resiliency, or &quot;&quot;the ability to bounce back or recover from stress&quot; (Smith et al., 2008). 6 items using Likert scale strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5). Score will be summed for one total score and can range from 6 to 30, with 6 indicating low resilience and 30 indicating high resilience. No clinical cut off. Expected increase no change in scores from pre and post.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Self-Regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks post start (1 semester)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-Regulation Scale (SRQ) short form used to measure self-regulation, or &quot;&quot;the ability to develop, implement, and flexibly maintain planned behavior in order to achieve one's goal&quot; (Brown, Miller, &amp; Lawendowski, 1999). 31 items using a Likert scale strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5), with 14 reverse coded. Scores will be summed for one total score ranging from 31 to 155. 31 indicates low self-regulation and 155 indicates high self-regulation. No clinical cut off. Expected increase or no change in scores from pre and post.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in belief of ability to perform difficult tasks or cope with diversity</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks post start (1 semester)</time_frame>
    <description>Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale used to measure self-efficacy, or &quot;the optimistic self-belief that one can perform novel or difficult tasks or cope with diversity&quot; (Schwarzer, 1992). 10 items on a Likert scale from Not true at all (1) to Exactly true (4). Responses will be summed for one total score, ranging from 10 to 40. 10 indicates low self-efficacy, 40 indicates high self-efficacy. No clinical cut off. Expected increase or no change in scores from pre and post.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Well-Being</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks post start (1 semester)</time_frame>
    <description>The WHO (Five) Well-Being Index (WHO-5) measures well-being, defined as the subjective quality of life based on positive mood (good spirits, relaxation), vitality (being active and waking up fresh and rested), and general interest (being interested in things). 5 items on a Likert scale ranging from all of the time (5) to at no time (1). Responses will be summed for one total score ranging from 0 to 25. 0 indicates low well-being and 5 indicates high well-being. Score below 13 indicates poor well-being. Expected increase or no change in scores from pre and post.</description>

    <time_frame>14 days (2 weeks) after end of study (16 weeks post start)</time_frame>
