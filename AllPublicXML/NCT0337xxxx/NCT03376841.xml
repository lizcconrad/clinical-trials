    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability
      profiles of cenicriviroc (CVC) and its metabolites (M-I and M-II) in participants with
      severely impaired hepatic function compared with matched healthy participants following
      single-dose administration
