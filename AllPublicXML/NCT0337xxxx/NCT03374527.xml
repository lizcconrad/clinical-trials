  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the link between pro-inflammatory T cells responses
      arising in the skin in patients with cutaneous psoriasis and those present in the joints of
      patients developing psoriatic arthritis.

      The study is based on the hypothesis that a fraction of T cells with memory phenotype can
      recirculate from the skin and relocalize at extracutaneous sites including enthesis or
      synovial tissue thus propagating the pro-inflammatory cycle. This could represent a
      pathogenic mechanism in the development of PsA.

      The main aim of the study is to define the phenotypic and functional differences of
      circulating T cells in patients cutaneous psoriasis, patients with psoriatic arthritis and in
      control group of healthy subject.

      To this end we analyze the expression of cell surface markers of central memory (TCM),
      effector memory (TEM) and effector (Teff) cells, within this subsets wel evaluate the
      expression of chemokine receptors as well as skin and tissue homing molecules. We also
      evaluate the T cell polarization towards Th1/Tc1 or Th17/Tc17 phenotype by evaluating the
      cytokine expression profile.

      In selected patients with PsA we analyze in parallel the phenotype and the cytokine profile
      of T cell subpopulations in peripheral blood and in synovial fluid, The results of this study
      could possibly allow us to define distinctive features of circulating T cells in patients
      with PsA and to understand the link between circulating and synovial fluid T cells in
      patients with PsA.
