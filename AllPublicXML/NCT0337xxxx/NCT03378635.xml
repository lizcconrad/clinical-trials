  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial is to demonstrate superiority of dasiglucagon compared to placebo
      following a single subcutaneous dose administered to subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus
      with insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Additionaly to compare the glycemic response observed
      after administration dasiglucagon with that of GlucaGen®.
