      A multi-center, open-label, phase II clinical study of metformin in up to evaluable 49
      patients with low-grade NMIBC with the aim to determine the overall response to
      administration of oral metformin for 3 months in a marker tumour deliberately left following

      A multi-center, open-label, phase II clinical study of metformin in up to 49 patients with
      low-grade NMIBC with the aim to determine the overall response to administration of oral
      metformin for 3 months in a marker tumour deliberately left following transurethral resection
      of multiple, papillary NMIBC tumours. All patients will receive metformin orally at doses up
      to 1500 mg twice daily. Metformin treatment will start within 2 weeks following transurethral
      resection, in which all but the marker lesion will be resected. After 3 months of metformin
      treatment, the effect of metformin on the marker lesion is evaluated by cystoscopy and biopsy
      under anaesthesia. Residual tumour, if present at this evaluation, will be resected. In case
      of complete disappearance of the marker lesion the former tumour area will be biopsied.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years.

          -  Patients with primary or recurrent multiple histologically confirmed Ta or T1
             (non-muscle invasive), G1 or G2 (low grade) urothelial carcinoma of the bladder with
             no evidence of carcinoma in situ.

          -  Patients must have at least 2 lesions but no more than 10.

          -  The resected lesions must contain detrusor muscle to confirm a Ta/T1 disease.

          -  All visible lesions must be completely removed by transurethral resection at entry to
             the study, except for an untouched marker lesion measuring 0.5-1.0 cm in its greatest
             dimension.

          -  Bimanual examination immediately following transurethral resection under anaesthesia
             should be carried out and no mass should be felt.

          -  Adequate renal function (creatinine &lt;150 Î¼mol/L and/or an eGFR &gt;60 ml/L).

          -  Adequate liver function (bilirubin &lt;1.5 times upper limit of normal, ALAT or ASAT &lt;2.5
             the upper limit of normal).

          -  Eligible patients must be fully informed of the investigational nature of the study
             and written signed informed consent must be obtained prior to any study specific
             investigations.

          -  Mentally, physically, and geographically able to undergo treatment and follow up.

          -  Patients with a history of other primary malignancy (other than squamous or basal cell
             skin cancers or cone biopsied CIS of the uterine cervix or prostate carcinoma treated
             curatively with normal PSA values at inclusion) in the last five years.

          -  Patients with active, uncontrolled impairment of the renal, hepatobiliary,
             cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urogenital, neurologic or hematopoietic systems
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, would predispose to the development of
             complications from the administration of metformin.

          -  Patients who are using loop diuretics, cimetidine, ranitidine, cetirizine,
             trimethoprim, vandetanib, kinidine and/or HIV medication, for which no reasonable
             alternative is available.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating. Individuals of reproductive potential may not
