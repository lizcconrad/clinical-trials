  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2-part study will assess the effect of formulation and food on the pharmacokinetics of
      Indoximod in healthy volunteers. Part 1 is an open-label, 3-period, 6-sequence study.
      Participants will receive single doses of Indoximod base or salt formulation, in the fasted
      or fed state. Part 2 is a randomized single ascending dose study of indoximod salt
      formulation to characterize the PK profile and determine the safety and tolerability of each
      dose in healthy male volunteers.
