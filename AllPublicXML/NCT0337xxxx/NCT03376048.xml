  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TAP block is typically performed either with ultrasound guidance (TAP-US) or laparoscopic
      visualization (TAP-LAP): comparison between these two technics showed no differences in pain
      control and use of opioid analgesics.

      The investigators hypothesize that WI is non-inferior to WI + TAP-block with respect to
      postoperative pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In colorectal surgery, laparoscopy and enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs have
      significantly improved the short-term outcomes (1). Although the laparoscopic approach
      reduces pain and recovery time, post-operative pain, nausea and vomiting still represent an
      issue. In order to reduce opioid related side effects, such as postoperative nausea and
      vomiting (PONV), constipation and prolonged post-operative ileus, non-opioid based multimodal
      analgesia have been recently introduced. Although epidural analgesia has gained good success,
      it does not seem to offer any additional clinical benefits to patients undergoing
      laparoscopic colorectal surgery compared to alternative analgesic technique within an ERAS
      program. Both local wound infiltration (WI) and TAP block are common techniques in multimodal
      postoperative pain treatment, and their association allows to achieve pain control despite a
      reduced use of opioid analgesics. Furthermore, in a recent single-blind prospective study TAP
      block resulted superior to wound infiltration alone. The TAP block is typically performed
      either with ultrasound guidance (TAP-US) or laparoscopic visualization (TAP-LAP): comparison
      between these two technics showed no differences in pain control and use of opioid
      analgesics.

      The aim of this study is to compare WI + TAP-LAP versus WI alone. The investigators
      hypothesize that WI is non-inferior to WI + TAP-block with respect to postoperative pain.
