  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large number of studies have shown that patients feel more satisfied with hydromorphone in
      the pain management. and a systematic review found that hydromorphone may be better suited
      than morphine for titration of acute analgesia. However, current researches on intraveneous
      opioid titration for cancer pain such as hydromorphone are relatively insufficient in China.
      Therefore, we conduct a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled study to assess the
      efficacy and safety of comparing patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) versus non-PCA
      intravenous hydromorphone titration for severe cancer pain
