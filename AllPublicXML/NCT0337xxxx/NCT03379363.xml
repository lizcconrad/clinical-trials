      charts of pediatric patients who have been treated with Korlym for Cushing's syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective chart review study seeks to collect data from pediatric patients treated
      with Korlym (mifepristone) to help provide clinicians with some insight on the potential role
      of mifepristone in the treatment of pediatric patients with Cushing syndrome.

      Only sites that have been identified to have patients appropriate for this protocol will be
      invited to participate and contribute data on their patients

      Data to be collected from a retrospective chart review will include:

        -  Patient demographics

        -  Medical history

        -  Pre and post treatment clinical assessments and laboratory results

        -  Radiologic findings (if available)

        -  Adverse events

      Data will be collected for all follow-up visits, up until the most recent encounter prior to
      IRB approval.
