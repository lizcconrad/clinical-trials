  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in digital dentistry coupled with increased demand for aesthetic restorations have
      led to developments in CAD CAM( Computer Aided Design and Computer Aided
      manufacturing)systems for manufacturing tooth restorations. CAD CAM restorations have the
      added benefit of digital impressions which eliminate the need to take conventional
      impressions, something patients find difficult to tolerate. CAD CAM restorations are now part
      of routine dental care. However there are no clinical studies evaluating these restorations
      on root canal treated teeth

      This study aims to compare the success and survival of root canal treated teeth and/or
      restoration with varying degrees of tooth structure loss restored using CAD CAM restorations.

      Null Hypothesis:- The amount of residual coronal dentin has no effect on the survival of root
      canal treated teeth and/or restoration.

      This study will be carried out at KCL Dental Institute at Guy's Hospital and will form part
      of the routine dental treatment done at the endodontic postgraduate unit. Potential
      volunteers will be given written information about the process and be given time to consider
      participation. Once any questions have been answered, fully informed written consent will be
      obtained if they are interested in taking part. Patients requiring endodontic treatment with
      varying degrees of tooth structure loss will be detected, diagnosed and treated by endodontic
      MClinDent postgraduate students at Guy's hospital using suitable clinical techniques. The
      teeth will then be restored using CAD CAM restorations. Dental periapical radiograph and cone
      beam computed tomography (CBCT)scans (Morita Accuitomo) will be taken at baseline, 12 months
      and 24 months. Clinical assessment and radiographical evaluation will be carried out
      immediately after endodontic treatments have been accomplished and 1 and 2 years post
      treatment and will be assessed independently by a group of examiners. It is hoped that data
      analysed from this study will provide a definitive clinical evidence base for the success and
      survival of endodontically teeth and/or restorations.
