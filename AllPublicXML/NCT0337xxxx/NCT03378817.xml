  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation (KT) has emerged as the mainstay of treatment for end-stage kidney
      disease. In an effort to address the widening gap between demand and supply of donor organs,
      there has been an increase in the numbers of &quot;marginal&quot; or functionally impaired renal
      allografts that had to be accepted for KT over the decades. The use of extended criteria
      donor (ECD) allografts is associated with a higher incidence of primary graft non-function
      (PNF) and/or delayed graft function (DGF). Hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (HOPE)
      has been successfully tested in pre-clinical experiments and in a few clinical series of
      donation after cardiac death (DCD) in liver transplantation. The present trial is an
      investigator-initiated pilot study on the effects of HOPE on ECD-allografts in donation after
      brain death (DBD) KT. Fifteen kidney allografts will be submitted to 2 hours of HOPE before
      implantation and are going to be compared to a case matched group transplanted after
      conventional cold storage (CCS).

      The present trial is an investigator-initiated pilot study on the effects of HOPE on
      ECD-allografts in DBD KT. Fifteen kidney allografts with defined inclusion/exclusion criteria
      will be submitted to 2 hours of HOPE via the renal artery before implantation and are going
      to be compared to a case matched group of 30 patients (1:2 matching) transplanted after CCS.
      Besides the clinical evaluation of HOPE-&quot;reconditioned&quot; allograft function, a targeted
      biomarker analysis is planned using tissue, serum, and urine samples as the translational and
      basic research aspect of the present study.
