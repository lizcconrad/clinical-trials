  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, single-arm feasibility trial to assess
      device safety and efficacy of the Cordella™ Heart Failure System in 10 NYHA Class III heart
      failure patients who will receive the Cordella™ Sensor implant.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to establish that the Cordella™ Sensor can be safely
      delivered, deployed, and remain stable within the target pulmonary artery (PA) segment
      through 30 days post-implant as well as to measure the accuracy of Cordella™ Sensor PA
      pressure measurements compared with fluid-filled catheter PA pressure measurements obtained
      by standard right heart catheterization (RHC) at 90 days post implant. Safety measures will
      include the frequency and rates of adverse events, both overall and for each specific event,
      which will be collected throughout the study. Subjects will remain in this trial for 24
      months.
