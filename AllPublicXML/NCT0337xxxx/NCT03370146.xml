  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motor imagery is increasingly used as a plasticity-booster to complement conventional
      rehabilitation. Here the investigators test the hypothesis that the combination of mental
      training with conventional rehabilitation may speed up the recovery in patients with total
      knee arthroplasty. The investigators also characterize the brain correlates of such recovery
      with imagery tasks for virtual reality environments.

    <description>Patients of the experimental group will be instructed to imagine walking, from a first person perspective, focusing on the kinaesthetic sensations typically associated with the movement. The motor imagery training will be performed using the support of a laptop, on which there will be presented complex static scenes, representing different kind of paths with different landmarks to reach during the mental walking.</description>

        Experimental group (MI training): 24 candidates to TKA (aged between 45 and 65 years) will
        undergo a specific MI training during the period of post-surgical rehabilitation, in
        addition to the usual physical rehabilitation.

        Control group 1 (non-specific cognitive training): 24 candidates to TKA will undergo a
        non-specific cognitive treatment during the period of post-surgical rehabilitation, in
        addition to the usual physical rehabilitation.

        Control group 2: 48 subjects with similar demographic characteristics to those of the
        previous two groups will be evaluated with the same cognitive/fMRI paradigm to assess in
        TKA candidates the presence of anomalies of cortical organization of the motor system in
        the pre-surgical phase.
