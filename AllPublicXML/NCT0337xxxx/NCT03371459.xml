          -  Must be receiving 1 of the following required inhaled asthma therapies listed below
             for at least the last 30 days; Only SABA, which is used as needed for rescue, or Low
             to medium doses of ICS (alone or in combination with LABA), used regularly as
             maintenance asthma therapy

          -  Demonstrate acceptable spirometry performance (ie, meet American Thoracic Society
             [ATS]/European Respiratory Society [ERS] acceptability/repeatability criteria

          -  Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of ≥50 to &lt;80% predicted normal value after withholding SABA
             ≥6 hours

          -  Confirmed FEV1 reversibility to Ventolin, defined as a post-Ventolin increase in FEV1
             of ≥15%

          -  Only 2 reversibility testing attempts are allowed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other significant lung disease (eg, chronic
             bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis with the need of treatment, cystic fibrosis, or
             bronchopulmonary dysplasia)

          -  Oral corticosteroid use (any dose) within 6 weeks

          -  Received any marketed (eg, omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab) or investigational
             biologic within 3 months or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, or any other medication
             specifically prohibited by the protocol

          -  Current smokers, former smokers with &gt;10 pack-years history, or former smokers who

             marijuana)

          -  Life-threatening asthma as defined as any history of significant asthma episode(s)
             requiring intubation associated with hypercapnia, respiratory arrest, hypoxic
             seizures, or asthma-related syncopal episode(s)

          -  Historical or current evidence of a clinically significant disease

          -  Cancer not in complete remission for at least 5 years

          -  Hospitalized for psychiatric disorder or attempted suicide within 1 year
