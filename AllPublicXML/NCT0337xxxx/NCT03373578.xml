  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm newborn sleep deprivation due to medical interventions and environmental
      characteristics of the Neonatal Intermediate Care Unit (NICU) can increase morbidity and
      developmental deleterious effects. The aim of this study is to test the effect of earmuffs on
      sleep pattern of preterm neonates. Prospective, randomized, controlled, crossover study
      conducted in NICU of two teaching hospitals from São Paulo, Brazil. The effect of earmuffs
      use was analyzed through polysomnography measurement during four &quot;Quiet times&quot; periods. It
      was also analyzed sleep related variables during 24 hours of the day. Preterm newborns
      characteristics and clinical characteristics were also analyzed.
