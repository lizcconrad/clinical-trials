  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of absorbable anchor compared to suturing for
           mesh attachment to vagina in robotic assisted sacrocolpopexy on the length of surgery
           for this portion of the procedure.

        2. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

           i. To assess intraoperative and ii. postoperative complication rates, iii.
           Intraoperative 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), to subjectively assess surgeon
           satisfaction with the technique iv. post-operative Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification
           (POPQ) evaluation for anatomic failure and v. a VAS of the vaginal walls overall
           appearance

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By applying a commonly used surgical technique of absorbable anchors to a new surgery,
      Sacrocolpopexy (SCP), operative time may be decreased while providing similar patient
      outcomes. Absorbable anchors have been validated in mesh fixation during laparoscopic
      surgical repair of hernias. This technique potentially takes less time than traditional
      suturing, thus decreasing cost and morbidity of anesthesia. The investigators hypothesis
      proposes that for women undergoing SCP at a large managed care organization, participants
      receiving anchor suture staples to attach the mesh to the vagina compared to participants
      receiving standard treatment will require 50% shorter surgical time for the mesh attachment
      portion of the surgery. The investigators secondary hypothesis is for women undergoing SCP at
      a large managed care organization, participants receiving anchor suture staples to attach the
      mesh to the vagina compared to participants receiving standard treatment will have similar
      rates of intra-operative and post-operative complications and surgical failure. On VAS,
      patients will not have different appearance of the vaginal walls. Surgeons will report higher
      satisfaction with the anchor technique.
