  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the explorative registry study is to investigate outcome parameters in the
      routine treatment of patients who are monitored after heart surgery for either short or
      long-term treatment in the intensive care unit for close monitoring of blood pressure.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The close monitoring of patients after cardiac surgery is regarded as standard. However,
      little is currently known about the influence on patient-related outcome parameters. Recently
      it has already been shown that intraoperative variability of blood pressure during heart
      surgery has a postoperative effect on 30-day mortality.

      The aim of this retrospective study is to investigate the effects of different hemodynamic
      measurements and management after cardiac surgery on patient-specific outcome parameters.
