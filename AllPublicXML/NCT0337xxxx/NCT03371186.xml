  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a cluster-controlled, stepped wedge implementation science
      trial of a bundled reproductive, maternal, neonatal, and child healthcare (RMNCH) delivery
      intervention within an approximate population of 300,000 people in rural Nepal. This
      intervention integrates five evidence-based approaches for reproductive, maternal, newborn,
      and child health focused on the &quot;golden 1000 days&quot; from conception through age two: 1)
      Community Health Worker model of home-based care to monitor and increase utilization of
      services, maternal and neonatal health knowledge, self-efficacy, social support, and
      emergency planning among mothers; 2) Continuous surveillance of all pregnancies and children
      via an integrated electronic medical record; 3) Delivering community-based integrated
      management of newborn and childhood illness (CB-IMNCI) via CHWs; 4) Group antenatal and
      postnatal care to improve care delivery and reduce mortality during the &quot;golden 1000 days&quot;
      from conception to age two; and 5) Balanced counseling to increase post-partum contraception.

    <description>Stepped wedge, cluster-controlled implementation science trial of 5 bundled intervention components (1. Community Health Worker, 2, Continuous Surveillance, 3. CB-Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illness, 4. Group Antenatal and Postnatal Care, and 5. Balanced Post-Partum Contraceptive Counseling) implemented across 40 village clusters in Achham District, Nepal and 40 village clusters in Dolakha District, Nepal (covering a total population of approximately 300,000) in coordination with district authorities and study staff. The investigators anticipate the experimental arm will enroll approximately 12,000 women and their children over the 18mo enrollment period.</description>

    <intervention_name>Community Health Worker</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention is designed to address these primary drivers of underutilization of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health services in rural Nepal, namely: poverty, lack of social support, and poor birth planning. The investigators have worked with a cadre of Community Healthcare Workers who, in addition to the responsibilities of local community health volunteers, have added responsibilities, training, and managerial support. These women support their community members in their homes to identify and overcome social barriers and plan for emergency healthcare needs. The goals are to increase utilization of services, maternal and neonatal health knowledge, self-efficacy, social support, and emergency planning among mothers</description>

    <description>Each patient identified by a Community Health Worker will undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation by the hospital-based clinicians and will be enrolled in the study only if they are identified as currently pregnant, have recently given birth, or have a child under the age of 24 months. Continuous surveillance systems ensure that the entire population is surveyed every three months and has a three month touchpoint with a Community Health Worker.</description>

    <description>Safe delivery care; effective neonatal resuscitation; management of childhood diarrhea, malnutrition, and pneumonia; and treatment of traumatic and congenital surgical conditions can reduce child mortality. Community Based Integrated Management of Newborn and Child Illness (CB-IMNCI) has shown substantial reductions in neonatal and early child mortality. Community Health Workers will use CB-IMNCI as the clinical protocol for ongoing care to the community.</description>

    <intervention_name>Group Antenatal and Postnatal Care</intervention_name>
    <description>The proposed model will change antenatal and pediatric care in three major ways: 1) conduct care in a group setting, 2) provide expert and facilitated peer counseling, and 3) incorporate emergency planning. The group setting is designed to create a supportive social network among women facing similar challenges. The opportunity for counseling beyond the current standard will promote detailed emergency planning and the sharing of context-specific advice from peers to overcome barriers to access care. This intervention draws on the strength within communities of women to change health-seeking behaviors.</description>

    <intervention_name>Balanced Post-Partum Contraceptive Counseling</intervention_name>
    <description>Research on interventions to improve postpartum contraception suggest strategies that bridge the continuum of reproductive health care—antenatal care, labor and delivery, postnatal care, and infant care—are more effective than short term, stand-alone counseling sessions. The structured counseling module incorporated in the intervention will be partially adapted from the Balanced Counseling Strategy, an interactive contraceptive counseling method developed by the Population Council in accordance with the World Health Organization's tiered effectiveness guidelines. Prior studies in clinical settings in Nepal have demonstrated increased uptake of modern contraceptive methods, especially of long-acting reversible contraceptives with use of balanced counseling.</description>
