  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with marginal physiologic reserve, severe frailty, and/or malnutrition may be
      regarded as unsuitable candidates for advanced cardiac replacement therapies. However, little
      data exist on precisely which measures are predictive of subsequent adverse events.
      Assessment of nutritional status and frailty is still largely predicated on crude and
      obsolete parameters, such as baseline serum albumin level or body mass index (BMI). In this
      prospective cohort study the investigators will evaluate the use of bio-electrical impedance
      spectroscopy (BIS) as a measure of body composition and assess the associations with surgical
      outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study, with study visits at Enrollment and subsequently at â‰¤10
      days , 1 month (+/- 7 days), 3 months (+/- 7 days) , 6 months (+/- 14 days) , and 12 months
      (+/- 14 days) after heart transplant surgery.

      BIS measurements will be performed on patients both in the pretransplant and post-transplant
      periods except when contraindicated in the pretransplant setting concerning patients with
      advanced heart failure. Because the use of BIS is contraindicated in the setting of permanent
      pacemaker and/or internal cardiac defibrillator (ICD) devices, BIS assessment cannot be
      performed in the pretransplant setting for patients with advanced heart failure as the
      majority of these patients already have these devices in place. However, at the time of
      cardiac transplantation, these devices will be removed from those patients with advanced
      heart failure and the BIS measurements will then be performed shortly after transplantation,
      and then serially during the post-transplant period at various time intervals for one year in
      order to track changes in body composition.

      These measurements will be compared to traditional measurements performed at the time of
      preoperative evaluation by the nutritional and dietitian support team.

    <description>BIS-derived elements such as FM and FFM will be compared with standard preoperative variables for correlation of malnutrition assessment and predictability of adverse clinical events such as mortality, primary graft dysfunction, rejection, acute kidney injury, prolonged hospital stay, and hospital readmission. Several measures of nutrition status will be measured including SGA, BMI, tricep skinfolds, midarm muscle circumference, and FFM via BIS. The methods will be compared to determine agreement among the methods in determining malnutrition. In addition, nutrition status measures will be repeated at specified times over the first year following heart transplantation to describe the changes in body composition after transplantation. These changes occur gradually and thus the initial postoperative measurement will be closely representative of the patient's initial (pre-transplant) baseline status.</description>
