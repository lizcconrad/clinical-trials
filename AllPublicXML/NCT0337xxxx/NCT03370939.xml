  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular treatment has been proven to be effective and safe for patients with acute
      ischemic stroke caused by large artery occlusion. It has become the first-line therapy in
      such patients. It is known that time from symptom onset to artery recanalization was a major
      factor that affects the efficacy of the endovascular therapy. However, optimal workflow of
      the treatment was still unclear which restrains the effect of the treatment in real world.

      The aim of this study was to determine the key element that causes the treatment delay by
      registering the major time points in the workflow and to develop an optimal workflow for the
      endovascular treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, registry study that enrolled patients with acute ischemic
      stroke caused by intracranial large artery occlusion who underwent endovascular treatment in
      about 200 stroke centers in China.
