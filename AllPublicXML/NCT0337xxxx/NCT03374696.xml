    <textblock>
      The study evaluated if interactive theater in school sex education affects student knowledge,
      attitudes and behavior regarding condom use. The intervention group got a play, value
      exercises, chlamydia games, condom school and interactive replay with professional actors and
      staff from a youth guidance center. The control group got standard sex education from school
      staff, based on the education guidelines of the Swedish National Agency for Education.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The spread of chlamydia indicates that current preventive work with condoms is insufficient.
      Research shows that reasons behind increased chlamydia include youths taking more sexual
      risks, due to altered attitudes and sexual behaviors. Since only condoms protect against both
      sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unwanted pregnancy, the goal of the World Health
      Organization (WHO) chlamydia prevention program is to increase condom use. Research suggests
      that school is the most important arena for sex education, reaching all youths early in life,
      when many values on sex and relationships are instilled. International studies on theater in
      sex education indicate effects like increased knowledge on the topic, and partially changed
      attitudes and behaviors among youths. Furthermore, several studies show that youths feel
      theater is a good method for sex education and a supplement to standard education.

    <description>The intervention SAFETY was performed in school facilities by professional actors and staff from the municipality`s youth guidance center within the county. The actors first enacted a play portraying youths and problems with condom use. Next, a value exercise was held by the youth guidance center staff. The class continued with chlamydia games held by the youth guidance center staff, providing information on symptoms, protection, how to get tested, treatment and consequences. The youth guidance center staff and the actors, playing students, then held a condom school. Lastly, the students came up with new endings to the play. All replays were enacted and the students gave feedback on the new endings. The class ended with condoms being handed out.</description>
