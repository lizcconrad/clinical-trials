  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence-based programs to prevent diabetes among high-risk individuals are less effective
      among those who also have mental health needs. This study involves developing and pilot
      testing the first adaptation of the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle
      intervention to simultaneously treat prediabetes and elevated mental health symptoms. This
      project has large potential to impact public health, given that more than half of the U.S.
      adult population has either of these conditions, and is at risk for developing comorbid
      diabetes and mental illness.

  <detailed_description>

      The overall goal of this study is to develop an effective and potentially scalable
      intervention to prevent diabetes in people with elevated mental health symptoms (EMS) and
      prediabetes. This study focuses on Latinos, a demographic group at particularly high risk for
      these related conditions. Experience from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), and related
      translational studies, suggests that the evidence-based DPP lifestyle intervention is less
      effective among depressed individuals. The proposed Promotora Intervention for Metabolic and
      Mental Health (PRIME2) will be the first adaptation of the DPP lifestyle intervention to
      simultaneously address mental health and prediabetes in a program delivered by promotoras, or
      community health workers.

    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a 14-item tool meant to measure how different situations affect participant feelings and perceived stress. Individual scores on the PSS range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from never (0) to almost always (4).The total score reported for each participant.
Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress.
Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress.
Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress.</description>

    <description>Weight loss self efficacy measured with the 11-item PANSE instrument. The PANSE was designed to address both nutrition and physical activity - a single brief instrument to assess self-efficacy for weight loss behaviors. Each item is rated on a 9-point scale ranging from not all (0) to completely (9).The total score reported for each participant. Low PANSE score indicates low self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>PLI -DPP protocol was developed from original DPP materials and culturally tailored for the target population based on formative research. The core PL-DPP curriculum includes 14 group sessions of 90 minutes duration. One promotora will lead each session in Spanish using behavioral strategies to discuss lifestyle behaviors, exploring such topics as being active, low-fat diets, portion control, self monitoring, problem solving and life-style changes.</description>
