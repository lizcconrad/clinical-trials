      Cluster headache is a primary neurological disorder characterized by intensive attacks and
      severe sharp headache, can cause a range of symptoms such as conjunctival congestion, runny
      nose, miosis, forehead sweat. The disability resulting from cluster headache can be severe
      imposing a considerable health burden upon the sufferer and society. The purpose of this
      study, using oral zolmitriptan as the control, is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
      zolmitriptan by sublingual administration for the acute treatment of cluster headache.
      Patients are asked to maintain a headache diary throughout the treatment period.
