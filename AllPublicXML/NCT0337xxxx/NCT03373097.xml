      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of GD2-CART01, a CAR T cell
      treatment targeting GD2 in paediatric or young adult patients with High Risk and/or
      relapsed/refractory Neuroblastoma.

  <detailed_description>

      The study will consist of 2 phases, a Phase I or dose escalation phase and a Phase II or
      expansion phase. Paediatric or young adult patients with relapsed High Risk and/or
      relapsed/refractory Neuroblastoma will be enrolled in the study. Eligible patients will
      undergo leukapheresis in order to harvest T cells, which will be manufactured to obtain the
      autologous CAR T product GD2-CART01, a GD2-targeting CAR T product. Briefly, the patients
      will be treated with a lymphodepleting regimen containing conventional chemotherapic agents
      and subsequently will receive a single infusion of GD2-CART01. Moreover, the product contains
      a suicide gene safety switch (namely inducible Caspase 9): in case of relevant toxicities,
      the patient will receive the dimerizing agent in order to activate the apoptotic pathway in
      the infused T cells.

      After infusion of CAR T cells, the patients will enter a 5-year active follow-up period.

             incurable, based upon the following criteria:
