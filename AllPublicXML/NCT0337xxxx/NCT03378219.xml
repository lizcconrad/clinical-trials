  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the relative risk of major structural birth defects, specifically a pattern of
      anomalies, in sarilumab-exposed pregnancies compared to disease-matched unexposed
      pregnancies.

      Secondary Objective:

      To evaluate the risk for sarilumab-exposure relative to the group of healthy pregnant women,
      and the effect of exposure on other adverse pregnancy and infants outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women enrolled in the study will participate for the duration of that pregnancy.
      Those who deliver at least one live born infant and the infants will participate for 1 year
      after delivery of that infant.
