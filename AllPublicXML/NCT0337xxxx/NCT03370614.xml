    <textblock>
      Although underutilized, what is emerging as one of the best ways of evaluating inflammation
      in the body, particularly in difficult to observe regions, is through the use of
      Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). FDG is taken up in the body much
      like glucose and is particularly taken up in areas of inflammation where there is increased
      metabolism. Therefore, this technology can be used to assess inflammation, and measure the
      reduction in inflammation as the result of integrative interventions that target dietary
      modifications designed to reduce inflammation. With this proposed study, we plan to use FDG
      PET-MRI technology to develop a more specific and sensitive approach for evaluating areas of
      inflammation associated with IBS and measuring improvements in that inflammation in response
      to effective integrative interventions.

      The typical goal of the integrative medicine approach is to develop an individualized plan to
      help restore homeostasis to the gastrointestinal system targeting a reduction in inflammation
      as an important element in helping to relieve symptoms. One of the most problematic issues
      though is to determine where in the GI tract the inflammation is occurring and then
      evaluating improvements in inflammation as any intervention proceeds.

      Participants will undergo a small battery of diagnostic tests that include magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). A secondary goal of
      this study is to evaluate the utility of FDG PET-MRI for assessing reductions in inflammation
      in patients managed with an integrative medicine approach based upon diet and nutritional
      counselling.

    <description>The Profile of Mood States (POMS) is a questionnaire of 65 single word items that asks &quot;How have you been feeling in the past week including today.&quot; The subjects will select their response to each word that describes a mood or feeling on a Lickert scale from 1= Not at All, 2= A Little, 3=Moderately, 4=Quite a lot, to 5=Extremely. The responses are scored to generate values for Tension, Anger, Confusion, Depression and Vigor. The higher scores indicate a greater presence of that mood or state.</description>
