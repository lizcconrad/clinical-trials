    <description>An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life threatening (an adverse event [AE] is considered life-threatening if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. A TEAE is defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (baseline) or (1) reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (baseline) but stopped before treatment, or (2) worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence and does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product (IP), whether or not related to the IP. AEs include pre-existing conditions that worsen. A TEAE is defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (baseline) or (1) reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (baseline) but stopped before treatment, or (2) worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous.</description>
