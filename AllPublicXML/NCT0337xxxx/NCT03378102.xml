  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if it is possible to treat an infection with a
      cell-based immunotherapy (therapy that uses the patient's own immune system to treat the
      infection). This treatment is called adoptive T cell therapy. Another purpose is to learn
      about the side effects and toxicities of adoptive T cell therapy.

      Adoptive T cell therapy is an investigational (experimental) therapy that works by using the
      blood of a donor that has immunity against the virus. The donor cells are collected and then
      the cells, called T cells, that are capable of defending against the virus are selected out.
      These selected T cells are then infused back into the patient, to try to give the immune
      system the ability to fight the infection. Adoptive T cell therapy is experimental because it
      is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

      Brief Background/Rationale: This study seeks to determine the feasibility of using antigen
      specific T cells isolated with the CliniMACS® Cytokine Capture System (CCS) for the treatment
      of adenovirus infections occurring after allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
      (HSCT).

      Primary Objective: To determine the feasibility of the treatment of opportunistic adenovirus
      infection after HSCT with adenovirus-specific, antigen-selected T cells, using the CliniMACS®
      Prodigy System.

      Exploratory Objective(s)

        -  To describe the safety profile of the infusion of virus - specific, antigen selected T
           cells.

        -  To describe the toxicities related to infusion of virus - specific, antigen selected T
           cells.

        -  To describe the rate of eradication of opportunistic adenovirus infection after
           treatment with virus-specific, antigen-selected T cells using the CliniMACS® Prodigy
           System.

      Study Design:

      This feasibility study will include a single treatment cohort including subjects who have
      failed to respond, are intolerant or have contraindications to antiviral agents used for
      treatment of Human Adenovirus (HAdV) (ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet and cidofovir).

      Patients will be enrolled in a staggered pattern to ensure safety.

        -  Patient 1 will be enrolled and observed for 30 days after infusion of virus specific T
           cells before enrollment of a subsequent patient.

        -  Patient 2 will be enrolled ≥ 30 days after treatment of patient 1 and will be observed
           for 30 days before enrollment of a subsequent patient.

        -  Subsequent patients will be enrolled in 6 cohorts of 3 subjects each. A safety period
           between cohorts of 30 days (between treatment of the last subject of one cohort and the
           first subject of the subsequent cohort).

      Study Design: Staggered enrollment of patients with an observation period of 30 days after
      infusion. Safety monitoring points planned after patient No. 5 and No. 11

    <description>Virus-specific, antigen selected cells will be obtained using the CliniMACS® Prodigy System. the donor will be screened for their ability to produce an IFN-gamma- secretion response to HAdV by testing the donor's mononuclear cells with the Miltenyi Rapid Cytokine Inspector kit. Donors with appropriate IFN-gamma secretion response will undergo a steady state leukapheresis. The investigational product (IP) will be generated using the CCS-IFN enrichment program with an approximate duration time of 15 hours. After the IP passes release criteria, the IP will be suspended in 0.9 normal saline + 2.5% albumin and distributed for infusion. The IP will be infused within 4 hours as a bolus on day 0.</description>

          -  The effects of virus-specific, antigen-selected T cells on the developing human fetus
             are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to
             use adequate contraception (double barrier method of birth control or abstinence) 4

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study. Because there is an
             unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with the agents described above, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother participates in this trial.
