  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A high degree of turnout is desired by many dancers, because enables an efficient weight
      transfer; provides an excellent extension and control; and reduces the risk of injury when
      used properly. The dancer's body conditioning is worked and acquired through various types of
      training, among which stands out the Pilates Method. Thus, the aim of the study is to
      determine the effect of a training program of Pilates Method in the range of ballerinas'
      turnout. The study will be conducted with young dancers, between 10 and 14 years, who
      practice classical dance twice a week. They will be randomly divided into two groups:
      intervention and control, but only the intervention group will do Pilates classes. To verify
      the extent of the turnout, tests will be applied in both groups, before the start of Pilates
      classes (pre-test) and after 24 sessions (post-test). In the evaluation protocol will be
      collected kinematic data, while performing the movements of demi plié and elevé.
      Anthropometric variables of height and body mass will be obtained; and also the extent of the
      passive and active turnout in dancers.

    <description>Turnout is determined as external rotation of the coxofemoral joint, and is considered perfect when reaching an angle of 180 ° between the longitudinal axis of the feet. The change in turnout will be evaluated one week before the first session of the intervention and after 12 weeks of Mat Pilates training. So, the primary outcome is the change in the range of ballerinas' turnout.</description>
