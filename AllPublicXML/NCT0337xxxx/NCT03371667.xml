  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase III randomized double-blinded trial designed to compare the efficacy of the addition of
      MTX to current standard acute GVHD first-line treatment with corticosteroids. The protocol
      will use a novel endpoint for benchmarking interventions based on a composite primary
      endpoint of GVHD-free and corticosteroids-free survival.

      The primary endpoint of the trial will be the assessment of a composite endpoint of
      graft-versus-host disease-free and corticosteroids-free survival at 12 months after
      randomization

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III randomized, multicenter, double blinded controlled study. Patients who
      develop clinically meaningful acute GVHD and who meet all other entry criteria will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive either corticosteroids and placebo (&quot;standard of care&quot;, control
      arm) or the combination of low-dose MTX with corticosteroids as first-line therapy for acute
      GVHD (MTX; &quot;experimental arm&quot;).

      The primary analysis of this hypothesis generation study is to estimate the composite
      endpoint of GVHD-free and corticosteroids-free survival at 12 months after randomization in
      both treatment arms. In fact, it is more and more established that such composite endpoint is
      a clinically very relevant one because it represents ideal recovery from allo-SCT (Stem Cell
      transplantation) (at 1 year after acute GVHD diagnosis) and a measure of cure without ongoing
      morbidity.
