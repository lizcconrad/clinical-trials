  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) is a type of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy in which there is a
      sudden temporary weakening of the myocardium. . In a recent study, women report more sexual
      dysfunction than men after 1 year after TC. Despite that a number of studies have assessed
      female sexual dysfunction (FSD) for TC , there is no information regarding prevalence and
      associated factors on FSD in women with TC. However, in a recent study on Iranian female
      patients with TC, more than 77% of these patients suffered from FSD. This study is aimed to
      assess the effectiveness of a Mindfulness-based Sex Therapy on Patients With TC.
