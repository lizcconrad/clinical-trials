  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of different treatment locations using
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to treat major depressive disorder.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently there is little standardization between rTMS treatment programs as to what is the
      best way to localize the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is the FDA-approved
      treatment location for clinical rTMS for major depressive disorder (MDD). Different targeting
      methods yield locations that can vary by up to a few centimeters. By comparing different
      treatment locations and obtaining neurobehavioral, neuroimaging, cognitive, and
      neuropsychological measures, this study would provide the opportunity to identify the optimal
      treatment targeting method when using rTMS for major depressive disorder in a clinical
      setting. This study will specifically be focusing on comparing the two most common targeting
      methods: a target 5.5cm anterior to the motor strip on the left prefrontal scalp and the F3
      target location on the left prefrontal scalp as identified using the 10-20 EEG system
      nomenclature.
