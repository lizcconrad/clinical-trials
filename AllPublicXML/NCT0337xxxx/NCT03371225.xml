  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims at understanding the mechanisms of optimized transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) (16 tDCS sessions combined with exercise)] on pain control. Optimized tDCS
      can lead to stronger engagement of the endogenous pain regulatory system that will ultimately
      lead to increased pain relief in patients with fibromyalgia (FM). Therefore, the
      investigators designed a 2x2 factorial mechanistic trial [tDCS (active and sham) and aerobic
      exercise (AE) (active and control)] to evaluate the effects of 4 weeks of tDCS coupled with
      exercise on the endogenous pain regulatory system assessed by conditioned pain modulation
      (CPM) and central sensitization as assessed by temporal slow pain summation (TSPS), and
      compared to either intervention alone and to no intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence has suggested that FM pain can be related to deficits in pain endogenous
      regulatory control and that novel non-pharmacological interventions, such as tDCS can
      modulate this system and, consequently, reduce pain intensity. Widespread pain in FM is
      thought to represent enhanced pain sensitivity that is maintained by central mechanisms. This
      suggests changes in the descending pain control mechanisms and a possible relationship with
      the central sensitization phenomenon. Recent evidence has suggested that pain inhibitory
      pathways are affected in FM; thus, further understanding these pathways' role can
      significantly change how the treatment of this condition. In this study the investigators
      will test the effects of two interventions -tDCS and aerobic exercise - on the modulation of
      the endogenous inhibitory pain system in fibromyalgia.

    <description>CPM is a neurophysiological measurement in which there is a test-stimulus and the conditioned-stimulus. For the test-stimulus, the investigators will use thermal pain thresholds (TPTs), be measured by applying a Peltier thermode (Medoc Advanced Medical Systems, Ramat Yishai, Israel) on the left forearm of subjects. Subjects will be required to verbally answer when their sensations change from heat to pain (i.e., TPT) and the investigators will stop the stimulus. This procedure will be repeated three times. For the conditioned-stimulus, the right forearm of the subject will be immersed in a bath of cold water for 2-min. Then, the same thermal stimuli will be applied on the left forearm of the subject, as for the test-stimulus. This process will be repeated three times.</description>

    <measure>Temporal Slow Pain Summation (TSPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>TSPS is a neurophysiological measurement to assess pain sensitization. Heat pulses will be generated by a TSA-II Stimulator (Medoc Advanced Medical Systems, Ramat Yishai, Israel) delivered to the right dominant proximal volar forearm. The HP-thermode will be programmed to deliver pulses rising/fall of .4-s from adapting temperatures to peak temperatures, with a plateau of .7-s. Subjects will be trained to rate single heat pulses at 44°C, 46°C, and 48°C. Subsequently, they will receive 6 trains of 5 repetitive heat stimuli at 4 Hz to the same area, in which by being suitable for eliciting TSPS in most subjects. The interval between heat stimuli trains will be 30-s. The order of repetitive heat pulse trains will be counterbalanced across hands and subjects. TSPS will be calculated as the difference between heat pain rating after the 5th stimulus minus the 1st stimulus.</description>
