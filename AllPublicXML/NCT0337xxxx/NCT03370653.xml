  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of rare inherited disorders characterized by a
      deficiency of lysosomal enzymes responsible for the normal degradation of glycosaminoglycans
      (GAGs). Medical need for treatment of MPS is still very high due to the poor penetration of
      the recombinant enzymes into the blood brain barrier as well as the ocular barriers and into
      tissues that are poorly vascularized, such as cartilages and bones. Odiparcil is an orally
      active compound that allows the synthesis of soluble glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), mainly
      chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatane sulfate (DS). The neosynthesized solubles GAGs are
      then excreted in urine. By diverting endogenous GAG synthesis to the synthesis of soluble
      odiparcil linked GAGs, odiparcil should decrease the intracellular pool of GAGs and
      consequently decrease the lysosomal GAG accumulation.

      The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of two doses of
      odiparcil in MPS VI patients and to provide evidence to enable the selection of the relevant
      dose of odiparcil for phase III study. The secondary objective of this study is to
      characterize the dose response, PK and PD of odiparcil.

      Study design: This phase IIa study consists of 2 parts performed sequentially: a preliminary
      safety assessment followed by the core study with a double-blind, randomized, dose-ranged
      cohort of patients receiving Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) and an open-label cohort of
      patients not receiving ERT.

      Preliminary safety assessment (N=2): open-label, escalating dose (2 doses) study. If
      acceptable safety profile is achieved, patients will be then included in the open-label arm
      of the core study.

      Core study

      Core study will be conducted on 2 populations in parallel:

        -  A first cohort (N=18): MPS VI patients receiving ERT assigned in 3 arms:

             -  Placebo (N=6)

             -  Odiparcil 500 mg per day (250 mg BID) (N=6)

             -  Odiparcil 1000 mg per day (500 mg BID) (N=6).

        -  A second cohort (N=6): MPS VI patient not receiving ERT (odiparcil 1000 mg per day (500
           mg BID)).

      Study duration: The overall study duration will be 16 months, including the 6-month enrolment
      period.

      For each patient, the study duration will be:

        -  Preliminary safety assessment: 6 weeks including a 4-week run-in period followed by
           2-week treatment period. Then, patients will go on treatment period in core study
           (open-label arm).

        -  Core study: 40 weeks including a 4-week run-in period followed by 26-week treatment
           period and 10-weeks of follow-up.

        Patients with MPS Type VI not receiving enzyme replacement therapy for the following
        reasons:

          1. Patients previously treated with ERT but have discontinued for more than 3 months
             either due to medical decision or personal choice

          2. Patients allergic to ERT therapy

          3. Patients that have had a previous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)

          4. Patients not treated with ERT i.e. treatment naïve

        Exclusion criteria:

             prior to screening. This will include product bought over the counter specifically
             compounds like genistein and pentosane polysulphate which may not be considered as
             investigational products by patients and some health care professionals.

          2. Concurrent disease or condition that would interfere with study participation or pose
             a safety concern for example patient with: severe cardiac insufficiency as define NYHA
             class &gt; II, and severe restrictive chronic respiratory insufficiency as reflected by
             serum [HCO3-] ≥28 mEq/L.
