  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate, in routine operational settings of treatment of uncomplicated Severe Acute
      Malnutrition (SAM) in children aged 6-59 months, the risk of nutritional recovery and
      hospitalization with non-routine use of amoxicillin compared to the risk achieved with
      systematic use of antibiotics.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon admission, all children will receive nutritional treatment and standard medical care in
      accordance with the nutritional guidelines of the national protocol, with the exception of
      the routine distribution of antibiotics. Antibiotics will be provided at admission and during
      follow-up only if clinically justified. The results of the program (ie, nutritional recovery,
      hospitalization, death and abandonment) will be monitored in all children aged 6 to 59 months
      admitted for outpatient therapy in 2 outpatient treatment sites in the Madarounfa health
      district in Niger.

      To ensure that the children included in the study receive appropriate care, the study will
      ask the children's leaders to return to the clinic for medical surveillance in the event of a
      clinical complication. Program staff will facilitate appropriate management, including
      prescription of antibiotics if clinically justified, and transfer to hospital of all children
      in need of close supervision and / or comprehensive medical management.

        All children from 6 to 59 months admitted directly for the treatment of uncomplicated
        SAM(MUAC &lt;115 mm or PTZ &lt;-3 and / or presence of nutritional edema grade + or + + and
        moderate or good appetite with no medical complications) in the 2 CRENAS chosen as study
        sites during the inclusion period of the study. A &quot;direct admission&quot; is defined as an
        admission without reference from CRENI (intensive nutritional recovery and education
        centres) to CRENAS. Readmission cases, that is, children admitted to the nutritional
        program in the last 3 months, and references from the Center for Ambulatory Nutritional
        Recovery for Moderates (CRENAM) remain eligible for inclusion of the study without
        prejudice and without notation at the previous admission.
