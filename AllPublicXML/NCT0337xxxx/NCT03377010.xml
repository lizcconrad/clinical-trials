  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, cross-sectional, non-interventional study aimed at the nutritional
      intake of long-term health of allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      (HSCT) survivors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Higher rates of comorbidity among hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) survivors support
      the need for lifestyle interventions that target this vulnerable population. Comprehensive
      evaluation of the nutrient intake will provide adequate information necessary for develop of
      a targeted nutritional intervention in order to achieve specific nutritional need and improve
      long-term health of HSCT survivors. The cross-sectional design of this study has been
      selected for the timely collection of subject reported nutrient intake data. The intended
      study is strictly observational.

    <description>Dietary intake will be assessed using 2014 full-length food frequency questionnaire. The Block 2014 questionnaire combines a full-length food frequency questionnaire with a brief physical activity screening tool. The food and beverage list includes 127 items in the past 1 month, plus additional questions to adjust for fat, protein, carbohydrate, sugar, and whole grain content.</description>

    <description>Study participants will rate their interest in learning more about dietary interventions to stay healthy using items developed specifically for this study. The items will be rated on a 3-point Likert-type scale from 3 (extremely interested) to 1 (not at all interested).</description>

        HSCT survivor is defined as subjects one or more years after allogeneic or autologous HSCT
        without disease relapse, active graft-versus-host disease, or active infection.
