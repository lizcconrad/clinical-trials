    <textblock>
      This study explores how Point of Care Ultrasound (POC-US) is used in general practice in
      Denmark and how it affects the diagnostic process and treatment of patients.

      Twenty general practitioners (GPs) will register information each time they use POC-US during
      a one month period. The information will include indications and frequencies of the performed
      POC-US examinations, change in tentative diagnosis, plan, and treatment before and after the
      use of POC-US in relation to confidence in the tentative diagnosis, findings and quality of
      the POC-US examination.

      This is an observational study without any intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational study aiming to describe: How general practitioners use
      POC-US in their daily practice, how POC-US influences the diagnostic process, and how POC-US
      affects the treatment of the patients.

      The Use of POC-US will be explored through indication, frequency, time consumption,
      modification, and findings in order to describe:

        -  Which organs the GPs scan, when using POC-US?

        -  Which tentative diagnoses entail the use of POC-US?

        -  If GPs intend to rule-in/rule-out or explore, when using POC-US?

        -  How often the GPs use POC-US?

        -  How often are the GPs able to produce POC-US pictures of relevant structures?

        -  How much time POC-US adds to the consultation?

        -  How often a difference in what the GP intends to scan and what POC-US is actually used
           for occurs (modification of the performed POC-US)?

        -  How often POC-US leads to a specific finding?

      The influences of the diagnostic process will be explored through change in the tentative
      diagnosis and change in the GP's confidence in the tentative diagnosis. The aim is to
      describe:

        -  If POC-US changes the patient's tentative diagnosis

        -  If POC-US increases the GP's confidence in the tentative diagnosis

        -  The relationship between the GP's expression of confidence and change in the number of
           tentative diagnoses

        -  The relationship between change from symptom diagnoses to disease diagnoses and the GP's
           expression of confidence in the tentative diagnosis

        -  The relationship between specific organs scanned and the GP's expression of confidence
           in the tentative diagnosis

      The effects on the treatment of patients will be explored through changes in the plan or
      treatment for the patient. The aim is to describe:

        -  If POC-US changes the GP's plan for the patient

        -  If POC-US changes the treatment for the patient

        -  The relationship between findings and change in the plan or treatment for the patient.

      Study setting:

      The study will take place in 20 different general practices in Denmark where the GPs use
      POC-US.

      Interventions

      There is no intervention in this study since the GPs are already using POC-US in their
      examination of patients.

      Sample size

      There are around 75 GPs in Denmark, who use POC-US. Of those 20 GPs will be included in this
      study.

      It is estimated that the GPs will use POC-US 2-3 times a day, and assuming a participation
      rate of 80%, there will be 640-960 US scan during the study period of one month.

      Recruitment

      Participating GPs:

      GPs using POC-US will be recruited through the continuous medical educations small-groups
      program, US networks, conferences, through teaching sessions, and through contacts via the
      Danish general practice research units. Interested GPs will be asked to register and answer a
      questionnaire including background information concerning demography,education and use of
      ultrasound. The participating GPs will be selected randomly among these registrations after
      considering in-and exclusion criteria.

      Participating patients:

      Each time the participating GP use POC-US, he/she will ask the patient for informed consent.
      No restrictions are made regarding age or gender.

      Base-line assessment of GPs

      The GPs' technical skills will be evaluated at baseline using a standardized protocol
      (OSAUS).

      Data collection

      The registration tool will be developed as a questionnaire to be used before and after the GP
      uses POC-US in the consultation. The questionnaire will include a time log to ensure the
      before and after registration. Several pilot tests will be performed both in the research
      group and with GPs using POC-US in order to ensure comprehension, feasibility and compliance.

      The GPs will be asked to access a questionnaire in the online database SurveyXact each time
      they use their ultrasound device during their daily work. The GPs can access the
      questionnaire on their mobile phone, iPad or computer, using a unique link (respondent link)
      allocated each participating GP. A key file, connecting each participating GP with the
      respondent link in Surveyxact (link), will be safely stored at the Research Unit for General
      Practice in Aalborg.

      The GPs will give each patient a unique ID-number A Key file connecting this ID-number and
      the patients CPR-number (Danish national social security number) will be safely stored at the
      GP's clinic.

      in a separate protocol).

      Follow-up

      The GPs will be asked to save patient information on the included patients (Key file) in
      order to identify the patient for an additional follow-up after six months (described in a
      separate protocol).

      The study is approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency and the Committee of Multipractice
      Studies in General Practice.

      Since the study is an observational study and does not include any intervention, approval by
      the Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics have been exempted.

      Protocol amendments

      Will be declared and all editions and changes of the protocol will be saved.

    <time_frame>2018</time_frame>
    <description>The GP's indication for using POC-US will be described through the frequencies of the GP's intention to rule-in/ rule-out or explore when using POC-US and through frequencies of the tentative diagnoses that entail the use of POC-US.
POC-US frequency is calculated as the number of consultations with POC-US (numerator) relative to all GP face-to-face consultations (denominator) during the study period. The frequency of each POC-US examination (numerator) will be compared to all types of POC-US scans (denominator).
The GPs will measure the time used for the POC-US examination. By the before and after registration of the organs intended to scan and the organ actually scanned, the extent of modification of POC-US to include e.g. opportunistic screening, can be estimated.
The findings in POC-US are measured through the categorical variables: Certain positive findings, uncertain positive findings, certain negative findings, uncertain negative findings, and incidental findings.</description>

    <measure>How POC-US influences the diagnostic process</measure>
    <time_frame>2018</time_frame>
    <description>The GPs are asked to declare the tentative diagnoses as one main tentative diagnosis and other possible diagnoses before the use of POC-US. After the use of POC-US the GPs will be shown their &quot;Before-US&quot; tentative diagnoses and asked if these diagnoses have changed. If the diagnoses have changed, they will be asked to specify this.
The tentative diagnoses are registered as ICPC-2 codes in the questionnaire. The GPs are asked to register any change in their confidence in the tentative diagnoses after the use of POC-US by choosing one of the following variables on an ordinal scale: Increased confidence, more confident, unchanged confidence, less confident, reduced confidence.
To test the reliability of the GPs' declaration of confidence, we will examine if an increased confidence is correlated to specific organs scanned (Q2.2), a reduction in the total number of diagnoses (Q1.3, Q1.4, Q2.6 and Q2.7), or a change from symptom diagnosis to disease diagnosis.</description>

    <description>The GPs register their plan for the patient by choosing one or more of the following categorical variables before using POC-US: Acute admission to hospital, subacute referral to hospital, normal referral to hospital, subacute referral to specialist, normal referral to specialist, referral for radiology, other referral e.g. to physiotherapist, follow-up in the clinic, no plan for follow-up, other.
After using POC-US the GP is shown the &quot;before POC-US plan for the patient&quot; and asked if this plan has changed. If the plan has changed, the GP is asked to specify.
The GPs register their initiated treatment before POC-US by choosing one or more of the following categorical variables: Referral for treatment in the secondary sector, medication, other treatment, no treatment, other. After using POC-US the GP is shown the &quot;before POC-US planned treatment for the patient&quot; and asked if this planned treatment has changed. If the planned treatment has changed, the GP is asked to specify.</description>

        The participating GP practices will be selected purposively aiming at a difference in
        organisation, geography, and equipment. GPs will be selected to vary in experience both
        regarding seniority as GPs and experience of using POC-US. Thus we will include
        partnerships and solo practices, urban and rural practices as well as practices with
        variable number of probes and type of ultrasound scanner.
