  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Taiwan, there are many patients suffer from pediatric atopic dermatitis. Because of the
      clinical characteristic of repetitive and scratchy, which will affect the patients' quality
      of life and lead to the medical heavy budget. TCM may play an important role in this disease
      and help patient to improved their health. In this project, we aim to establish a
      Collaborative Care Model of TCM and Western Medicine, to achieve the multiple goal in
      clinical treatment, research and medical training. By establishing a collaborative care
      model, including the Chinese medicine doctor and Western medicine doctor, nurses, pharmacists
      and case managers, to cooperative satisfy the patient needed in the medical service, to
      improve the clinical presentation, patients'quality of life, and reduce exposure to
      corticosteroid. Besides, we can also build a training environment and reduce medical cost in
      long term purpose. Furthermore, by establishing a collaborative care model, we can provide a
      medical education and training opportunity to educate the medical student and clinician the
      necessary knowledge of pediatric atopic dermatitis by caring patients and learning from
      clinical case. According to the above training program, we not only aim to strengthen the
      competitiveness of Chinese medicine doctor in Taiwan, but also make the Western medicine
      doctors comprehend the TCM characteristic and may find out the even more opportunity to
      cooperate in clinical practice. To make this collaborative care model as a beginning
      milestone of cooperation between Chinese medicine and Western medicine.
