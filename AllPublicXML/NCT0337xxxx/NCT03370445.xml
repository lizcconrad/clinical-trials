  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed study is to assess the efficacy of a low-literacy/numeracy-oriented
      intervention to promote healthy lifestyles and preventing obesity among young children in
      under-resourced communities. The study will occur in pediatric resident physician care
      practices since nationally, resident practice sites provide care to more than one-fifth of
      the socioeconomically disadvantaged families in the US.

    <description>This injury prevention program will act as an &quot;attention placebo&quot; to control against the added attention provided to the intervention group. In addition this injury prevention program will act as an incentive for Pediatric Resident Clinics to participate and maximize retention throughout the study period - as they will know that they will be randomized to one of two beneficial resident education programs.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Greenlight Intervention</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The intervention includes the following components: (1) training of pediatric resident physicians in improved health communication skills and (2) a low literacy and numeracy-oriented educational toolkit which promotes healthy diet and physical activity practices.</description>
