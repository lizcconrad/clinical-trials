    <measure>Change in Investigator's Static Global Assessment Scale (ISGA) scores of target lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ISGA is a static measurement of the psoriasis status performed by physicians. A 6-point ordinal scale from 0 (minimum) to 5 (maximum) is used for estimation with 0 representing completely clear and 5 for very severe. An ISGA score improvement of ≥2 from baseline is considered an improved outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PASI is the most extensively used tool to measure severity of psoriasis by combing the severity of lesions (erythema, induration and desquamation) and affected area into one single score. Scale ranges from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DLQI is calculated by summing the score of all questions in questionnaire to measure the impact of psoriasis on the quality of life of a patient. The score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 30 (maximum) with lower scores associated with a better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Psoriasis Disability Index questionnaire (PDI) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PDI is used to quantify the impact of psoriasis on quality of patients' daily life. The scale ranges from 0 (minimum) to 90 (maximum) with higher scores indicating impaired quality of life.</description>
