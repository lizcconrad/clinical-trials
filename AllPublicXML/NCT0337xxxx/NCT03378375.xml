      Introduction: Resting energy expenditure (REE) formulas for healthy people (HP) are used to
      calculate REE (cREE) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. In ALS an increase of
      measured REE (mREE) in indirect calometry (IC) compared to cREE is found in 50-60%. The aims
      were (i) to assess accuracy of cREE assessed using eleven formulas as compared to mREE and
      (ii) to create if needed a specific cREE formula for ALS patients.

      Method: ALS patients followed in the ALS expert center of Limoges between 1996 and 2014 and
      with a nutritional evaluation were included. mREE assessed with IC and cREE calculated with
      eleven predictive formulas (Harris Benedict (HB) 1919, HB 1984, WSchofield, De Lorenzo,
      Johnstone, Mifflin, WHO/FAO, Owen, Fleisch, Wang and Rosenbaum) were collected at time of
      diagnosis. Fat free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) were measured with impedancemetry. A Bland
      and Altman analysis was carried out. The percentage of accurate prediction Â± 10%of mREE, and
      intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated. Using a derivation sample, a new
      REE formula was created using multiple linear regression according to sex, age, FFM and FM.
      Accuracy of this formula was assessed in a validation sample.
