  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      National Jewish Health and The University of Arizona worked with Navajo Nation organizations
      to develop this program to improve the health of children with asthma. The Navajo Community
      Asthma Program will have two main parts. One will train doctors and health care professionals
      to improve the diagnosis and treatment of asthma. The second part will work with area schools
      to provide education to school nurses, teachers, and children to help them better understand
      asthma. The project also works with families to help them know how to best take care of their
      child's asthma. A major project aim is to make sure that doctors, teachers, and families work
      together to manage asthma.

        The study will be conducted within three agencies on the Navajo Nation, each of which has
        its own IHS service unit. The three agencies are Chinle, Tuba City, and Fort Defiance.
        Together, these three agencies represent 43% of the total Navajo Nation population, and
        based on IHS data include an estimated 8,443 children with asthma. Interventions will be
        population level-interventions. No interventions will be administered at the individual
        level as part of this study.

        As part of our community needs assessment, 100 individuals from Navajo Nation Agencies Tuba
        City, Chinle, and Fort Defiance will be invited to interview and share their experiences,
        thoughts and feelings about asthma care on the Navajo Nation.
