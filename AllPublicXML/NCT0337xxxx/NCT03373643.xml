  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are frequently
      encountered in patients with metabolic syndrome (MS). Several data suggest that OSA per se
      could be a risk factor of liver injury. Most previous studies evaluating the association
      between OSA severity and the severity of NAFLD used indirect markers of NAFLD including liver
      imaging or liver injury blood markers or have been performed in morbidly obese patients
      undergoing intraoperative needle liver biopsy during bariatric surgery.

      The current study propose to investigate with a full night polysomnography consecutive
      patients undergoing percutaneous liver biopsy for suspected NAFLD.
