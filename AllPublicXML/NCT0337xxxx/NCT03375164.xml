  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial is a single-dose controlled trial using
      rAAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin for DMD subjects. Cohort A will include six subjects ages 3
      months to 3 years, and Cohort B will include six subjects ages 4 to 7 years old. All subjects
      will receive intravenous micro-dystrophin vector (2X10e14 vg/kg in 10mL/kg)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the study, the gene will be infused via peripheral arm vein so that it can reach all the
      muscles in the body. Six DMD subjects ages 3 months to 3 years in Cohort A, and six DMD
      subjects ages 4 years to age 7 years in Cohort B, will be enrolled. All subjects will receive
      intravenous micro-dystrophin vector (2X10e14 vg/kg in 10mL/kg). Subjects will have infusions
      over 1 hour in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at Nationwide Children's Hospital.
      Before the gene therapy a muscle biopsy will be done at the screening visit. Subjects will
      have a second muscle biopsy to see if the gene allowed for replacement of the missing
      dystrophin protein at 90 days post delivery. After the gene transfer, patients will be
      carefully monitored for any side effects of the treatment. This will include blood and urine
      tests, as well as physical examination during the screening visits and on days 0, 1, 7, 14,
      30, 60, 90, and 180, and at months 9, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 to make sure that there are no
      side effects from the gene injection.

One-day prior to gene transfer subjects in Cohort A will be started on prednisolone (prednisone or deflazacort acceptable) 1 mg/kg and maintained for 30 days while monitoring immune response. If negative at day 30, steroids will be weaned over 1 week. If T cell response to AAV or micro-dys is &gt;125 SFC/106 PBMCs, steroids will be maintained until levels drop below this threshold.</description>
