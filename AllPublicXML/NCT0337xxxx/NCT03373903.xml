  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of BEZ235
      alone and in combination with RAD001 to support further development to reduce the incidence
      of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in elderly subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group, dose finding
      24-week study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of up to 3 doses of BEZ235
      alone and in combination with RAD001 as compared to placebo in elderly subjects who are at
      increased risk of respiratory tract infection related-morbidity and mortality. The study will
      be composed of up to a 6-week screening and run-in period, a 16-week treatment period and an
      8-week follow-up period.
