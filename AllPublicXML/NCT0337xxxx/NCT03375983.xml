  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of Plasmodium immunotherapy and
      preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness of Plasmodium immunotherapy for advanced cancers.The
      treatment will last 3-6 months from the day of successful infection and will be terminated by
      antimalarial drugs.

      This study is to enroll 20 patients. Each patient will be vaccinated with P. vivax-infected
      red blood cells containing approximately 0.3-1.0 × 10^7 Plasmodium parasites and be observed
      for the exact infection time, parasitemia condition and infection course; principal clinical
      symptoms such as fever; gastrointestinal reaction; peripheral blood parameters;heart, liver
      and kidney function; changes in lung function, and dynamic changes in the function of
      peripheral immune cells. Moreover, the tolerance of patients to Plasmodium infection and
      changes in tumor-related parameters will be observed preliminarily.The duration of the
      planned treatment of each subject is 3-6 months. Since the successful infection will be
      indicated by microscopic observation of parasitemia in peripheral blood samples, the time of
      the treatment course is based on the presence of peripheral parasitemia. After 3-6 months,
      parasitemia will be terminated by antimalarial drugs for terminating the treatment of
      Plasmodium immunotherapy ( the immunological treatment effect may persist after the
      termination of Plasmodium infection).
