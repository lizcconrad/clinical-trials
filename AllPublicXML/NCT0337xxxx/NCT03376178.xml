  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiorifice catheters have been shown to provide superior analgesia and significantly reduce
      local anesthetic consumption compared with end-hole catheters in epidural studies. This
      prospective, blinded, randomized study tested the hypothesis that, in continuous femoral
      nerve block (CFNB) under ultrasound guidance, multiorifice catheter would reduce local
      anesthetic consumption at 24h compared with end-hole catheter.

  <detailed_description>

      Eighty adult patients (aged ≥18 years) scheduled to undergo primary total knee arthroplasty
      under a combination of continuous femoral nerve block (CFNB), sciatic nerve block and general
      anesthesia were randomized to CFNB using either a 3-pair micro-hole (Contiplex, BRAUN®, 20G -
      400 mm) or an end-hole (Silverstim VYGON®, 20G - 500 mm) catheter. Once the femoral catheter
      was sited, a bolus of 20 mL lidocaine 1% was injected. An electronic pump then delivered an
      automated 5 mL bolus of ropivacaine 0.2% hourly, with 10 mL self-administered patient
      controlled analgesia boluses.

    <masking_description>All investigators, patients, and other clinical staff were blinded to the treatment group. The investigator in charge of the patient was unaware of patient allocation. He did not perform the block or open the sealed and opaque envelope, but followed the patient in the ward. An opaque skin dressing was used in order to blind the type of catheter used. End-hole catheter Vygon is white and stiff whereas six-hole catheter contiplex is yellow and flexible.</masking_description>
