  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of Physical Therapy management in
      relieving constipation among Spastic Cerebral Palsy children. There were two groups, Group A
      received routine Physical Therapy and Group B received maintenance Physical Therapy (aim to
      maintain current level of spasticity, functionality to avoid deterioration of conadition as
      approved by ASRC)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical therapy makes an integral part of the non-pharmacological, conservative management
      of cerebral palsy. Routine physical therapy aims to reduce spasticity, improve joint range of
      motion (ROM), and improve strength and mobility.

      Passive ROM and stretching of lower limb and trunk increases parasympathetic activity and
      thus improves intestinal motility in prolonged bed ridden patients.Abdominal muscle training
      improves intestinal motility by two ways: mechanically by improving fecal propulsion towards
      rectum and neurologically by inducing parasympathetic activity to improve intestinal
      motility.20 Thermotherapy of back and abdomen in chronic constipation patient improves
      intestinal blood flow and parasympathetic activity.

    <intervention_model_description>The two groups were progressive physical therapy group and maintenance physical therapy group. For any given subject, spasticity, defecation frequency and constipation severity evaluations were completed on the same day. Each subject in PPT group completed 6 weeks of physical therapy sessions which were aimed to decrease spasticity, increase ROM, and improve strength and functional activity level. Each subject was evaluated for changes in symptoms on, 2nd week, 4th week and 6th week. In MPT group same protocol was used but the aim was to maintain current status of level of spasticity, ROM, strength and functional activity. After 6 weeks of physical therapy sessions were completed both groups underwent a 2-week washout period to eliminate the effects of 6-week physical therapy. After the washout period subjects were crossed over from PPT group to MPT group and vice versa.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Spastcity Spasticity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Ashworth scale (MAS)
0 = No increase in muscle tone
1 = Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension
1+ = Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM
2 = More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved
3 = Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult.
4 = Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension</description>

    <measure>Defecation Frequency (DF)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Defecation frequency less than three times a week was considered constipation and measured by nominal scale 1= twice a month, 2= once a week, 3= twice a week and 4= daily</description>

    <measure>Constipation assessment scale (CAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>used to determine the severity of constipation. The CAS consists of eight characteristics. Each of these characteristics is given a three point rating scale (0= no problem, 1= some problem, 2= severe problem). These scores are summed up to make a range from 0 for no constipation to 16 for the most severe constipation</description>

    <description>Duration: Each child was given 40-minute session. Frequency: Two sets were performed, 5-10 active assisted sit-ups in each set at least once a day. Furthermore, the subjects were advised to use CP chair and standing frame/wall corner for sitting/standing position respectively for at least 15-30 minutes once a day. These exercises were followed by reflex inhibiting postures in sitting and lying positions.
Total 42 sessions were performed in 6 weeks (7 days/week). Intensity: The aim of the PPT was to improve the patient's level of spasticity, strength and activity level.</description>
