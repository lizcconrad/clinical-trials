    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine safety and tolerability and to establish a
      preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the following combinations: pembrolizumab
      plus binimetinib (Cohort A), pembrolizumab plus mFOLFOX7 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m^2; leucovorin
      [calcium folinate] 400 mg/m^2; fluorouracil [5-FU] 2400 mg/m^2) (Cohort B), pembrolizumab
      plus mFOLFOX7 and binimetinib (Cohort C), pembrolizumab plus FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m^2;
      leucovorin [calcium folinate]400 mg/m^2; 5-FU 2400 mg/m^2 over 46-48 hours) (Cohort D), and
      pembrolizumab plus FOLFIRI and binimetinib (Cohort E).

    <description>During Part 1, participants in Cohort A will receive a standard dose (DL1) of pembrolizumab (200 mg) intravenous (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W) plus binimetinib orally at a starting dose of 30 mg twice a day (BID). Based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) assessed during the initial 21 days of Cycle 1, the dose of binimetinib may be escalated to 45 mg orally BID (Dose Level 2 [DL2]). Once a preliminary RP2D for binimetinib is identified in Part 1 for Cohort A, participants will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W plus binimetinib orally at the preliminary RP2D during Part 2.</description>
