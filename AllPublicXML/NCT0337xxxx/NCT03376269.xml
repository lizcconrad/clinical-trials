    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) on 2 types
      of patients' population suffering from chronic pain syndrome (Fibromyalgia): patients with
      history of psychological trauma and patients with history of traumatic brain injury.

      This study is a prospective clinical trial. After signing a written informed consent, all
      patients will be invited to medical evaluation including pain sensitivity examination and a
      series of questionnaires. In addition, all patients will have chest X-ray, cognitive
      evaluation, brain MRI and brain Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)

      . A second brain MRI, brain SPECT, pain sensitivity evaluation and questionnaires will be
      done after 3 months of treatment (60 sessions of HBOT). The HBOT procedure will be performed
      at the Sagol center for hyperbaric medicine and research of Assaf Harofeh Medical Center,
      Israel.

      The following HBOT protocol will be applied for all patients: 12 weeks, 5 times per week,
      daily administration of 100% O2 for 90 minutes at a pressure of 2 absolute atmospheres (ATA)
      including 5 minutes air breaks every 30 minutes.

      Patients with history of psychological trauma are also being treated with creative art
      psychotherapy. These patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups: (1) single
      intervention with creative art psychotherapy (psychotherapy group); (2) combined concurrent
      intervention of HBOT and creative art psychotherapy. Groups 1 will serve as controls during
      the first 3 months and then will be crossed to get HBOT. Before the cross to the HBOT they
      will have 2nd full evaluation (questioners and brain imaging).
