  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Combined first-trimester screening represents the gold standard of risk assessment for the
      presence of trisomy 21, 18, and 13. The concept is based on the age risk, the measurement of
      fetal nuchal translucency (NT), and the determination of serum markers free beta-hCG and
      PAPP-A in maternal blood.

      In recent years it has been shown that the risk assessment can be improved by combining
      in-depth ultrasound and cell-free DNA analysis from maternal blood. In their latest study,
      the investigators were able to detect all fetuses with trisomy 21, 18, and 13 through this
      procedure. No normal fetus displayed an increased risk. In contrast, the detection rate in
      classic, combined first-trimester screening is about 95% and the false-positive rate is 3-5%.
      In this study the investigator examine the test quality - especially the false positives - of
      cell-free DNA analysis on trisomy 21, 18 and 13 as well as on the microdeletion 22q in 1000
      pregnancies.
