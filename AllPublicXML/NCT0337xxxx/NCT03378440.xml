  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the association between the psychosocial variables:
      quality of life, fear of movement, coping skills, self-efficacy and physical activity, with
      chronic pain and disability after a total knee arthroplasty. The prevalence of TKA has
      increased dramatically during the last two decades, its popularity can be attributed to its
      evident success regarding pain improvement, deformity correction and disability reduction in
      knee osteoarthritis subjects. However, only a third of the patients report no functional
      problems after surgery, the 20% of them are unsatisfied with its functional skills and around
      a 20% are experiencing pain, high disability degrees and a significant quality of life
      reduction. This results cannot be fully explained by mechanical processes, surgical
      procedures or surgery variations, but seems to be related to other psychological aspects.
      Chronic pain subjects often develop maladaptive thoughts and behaviours (i.e. pain
      catastrophism, kinesiophobia, activity avoidance) which contribute to make the subject suffer
      physically as well as emotionally, and affect on the intensity and persistency of pain.

      This study is a single centre, prospective observational study of subjects undergoing primary
      total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The study is designed and aimed to examine the relationship
      between pre-operative psychosocial factors and the development of post-operative persistent
      pain and disability.

    <description>Participants will be asked to rate their pain on a horizontal 100-mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The horizontal line anchors will be &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot;. The VAS is a valid and reliable instrument compared with other pain rating scales, and has been well established in clinical practice and research for measuring pain levels in arthritis populations.</description>
