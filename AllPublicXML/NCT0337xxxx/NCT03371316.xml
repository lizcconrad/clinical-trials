  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to demonstrate that ViaShield™ amnion patch is effective in
      preventing fibroblast activity and hence soft tissue adhesions after a hemicraniectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A hemicraniectomy is a surgical procedure in which part of the skull is temporarily removed
      to relieve pressure on the underlying brain. Hemicraniectomies are typically performed on
      patients experiencing severe brain injury, usually due to stroke or trauma. In these cases,
      the brain injury and swelling is so severe that it can lead to brain compression and brain
      death. As a result, a surgeon will remove the bone flap to help with brain swelling and
      increased intracranial pressure. After the patient heals, a cranioplasty will be performed to
      restore the bone flap to its original location.

      When the central nervous system is deprived of its normal covering, as is the case with
      hemicraniectomies, the exposed area becomes the site of cellular reaction from surrounding
      tissue1 and soft tissue adhesions frequently develop between the skin flap and the dura mater
      or exposed brain, which may lead to less than optimal clinical outcome.

      ViaShield™ is an amnion patch produced from human amniotic membrane. Because of its inherent
      anti-adhesive properties, amnion serves as an ideal barrier against scarring and soft tissue
      adhesions to the neural elements, anterior vessels and hardware.
