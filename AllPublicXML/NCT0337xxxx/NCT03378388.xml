      The purpose of this study is to describe in real life the effectiveness of treatment with
      vedolizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-interventional and pharmaco-epidemiological study of participants
      with IBD. The study will provide the real-life data of treatment effectiveness and safety of
      vedolizumab in adult participants with UC or CD.

      The study will enroll approximately 300 participants. All participants will be enrolled in
      one observational group:

      Vedolizumab

      Data will be collected and observed for 24 months in the participants who will be freely
      chosen by physicians to prescribe vedolizumab at the end of consultation in the recruitment
      period.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in France. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 36 months, including participant's recruitment period of 12 months and treatment
      period of 24 months. Participants will make a minimum of 4 follow-up visits to the clinic in
      treatment period at Month 6, 12, 18, and 24.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Complete Steroid-free Clinical Remission at Month 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission is defined as Harvey Bradshaw-index (HBI) score less than or equal to (&lt;=) 4 and partial mayo clinic score &lt;=3. HBI score is used to measure disease activity of CD. It consists of clinical parameters: general well-being (0-4), abdominal pain (0-3), number of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass (0-3), and complications (score 1 per item). Total score is sum of individual parameters. Score ranges from minimum score of 0 to no pre-specified maximum score as it depends on number of liquid stools, where higher scores means more severe disease. Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC and consists of 3 sub scores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and physician rating of disease activity, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed to give a total score range of 0 to 9; where higher scores means more severe disease.</description>

    <description>Participant's Quality of Life (PRO-1) will be measured by the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ). The IBDQ is a 32-item questionnaire that measures 4 dimensions: bowel symptoms (10 items), emotional disorders (12 items), systemic symptoms (5 items), and social function (5 items). Each item is measured according to the Likert technique. Within dimensions, each question presents seven possible answers/points. Each domain score is the sum of 8 responses each ranging from 1 to 7, where 1 indicates worst function and 7 the best. The sub-score ranges from 8 to 56; a higher score indicating a better quality of life. Hence, the total score ranges from 32 to 224, with higher scores representing better quality of life.</description>
