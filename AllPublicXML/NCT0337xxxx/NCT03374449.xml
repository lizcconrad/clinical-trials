  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 200 million major surgical procedures are performed annually worldwide. Many of
      these patients have comorbidities including hypertension and/or heart failure. Chronic
      treatment of hypertension and/or heart failure very often includes a Renin-Angiotensin System
      (RAS) inhibitor (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-Is) or Angiotensin Receptor
      Blockers (ARBs). To stop or not to stop these medications before major surgery remain
      unknown. Data on management of RAS inhibitors before major surgery and anesthesia remain
      lacking and matter of debate. It is much likely that the strategy regarding management of RAS
      inhibitors in the peri-operative setting have important impact on peri-operative
      complications.

      The lack of evidence leads to conflicting guidelines with respect to RAS inhibitors
      management before major surgery. While French guidelines are to stop RAS inhibitors patients
      with hypertension to avoid profound anesthestic-drugs-induced hypotension, international
      guidelines differ. The American heart association task force states that continuation of RAS
      inhibitors perioperatively is reasonable (class IIa recommendation,level of evidence: B). The
      purpose of this study is to determine the prognostic impact of withholding vs continuing ARBs
      before major non cardiac surgery.

      Multicenter, prospective, randomized, pragmatic, parallel-group clinical trial. The inclusion
      visit takes place between un month and no later than 3 days before the surgery visit.

        -  The randomization will be performed by the anesthesiologist Control group : RAS-I
           discontinuation Experimental group: RAS-I continuation

        -  A prescription for the medication strategy (stopping or pursuing the medication) will be
           handed to the patient during the anesthesiology consultation.

      Four follow-up visits are planned

        -  Immediately after the surgery (Day 0)

        -  Three follow-up visits are planned on day 1, 2, 7 (or hospital discharge) and 28 days
           after surgery will be collected data and parameters for study endpoints.

      End of research visit is the 28 days follow-up visit.
