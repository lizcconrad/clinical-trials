      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) causes patients considerable joint pain and leads to instability,
      reduced range of motion, and functional limitations. Current treatment limitations have
      generated interest in alternative options to restore function and alleviate joint pain, some
      with the aim of healing damaged articular cartilage. There has been preliminary support in
      the literature for reduced pain and improved functional performance in patients who receive
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as part of a treatment regimen. MSCs can be costly and are
      limited by complex regulatory issues. This interest in an alternative isolation method lead
      to the development of Lipogems. Lipogems is a technique to harvest, process, and inject
      minimally manipulated adipose tissue. This procedure is enzyme free and requires no clonal
      expansion or manipulation. The goal of this study is to evaluate the possible benefits of
      reduced joint pain and increased joint functionality in patients with knee osteoarthritis
      after the injection of Lipogems. In addition, given the limitations of prior research on the
      efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroids, the investigators will also include this as an
      additional study group to compare to placebo. There have been case reports published showing
      favorable outcomes. This would be the first study reporting data on the efficacy of Lipogems
      for pain relief in knee OA in a randomized, controlled clinical trial with a larger sample of
      patients.

      The investigators hypothesize that patients who receive an injection of Lipogems will
      experience a decrease in pain of the affected knee and an increase in joint functionality in
      comparison to placebo. The investigators also hypothesize that patients who receive an
      intra-articular corticosteroid will experience decreased pain or improved functionality in
      the affected joint compared to placebo.

      Objectives:

        1. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible benefits of reduced joint pain and
           increased joint functionality in patients with knee osteoarthritis after the injection
           of Lipogems. Based on limitations of prior research, intra-articular corticosteroids are
           included as a study group to be evaluated for impact on pain relief and joint
           functionality in comparison to placebo.

        2. The investigators hypothesize that patients who receive an injection of Lipogems will
           experience a decrease in pain of the affected knee and an increase in joint
           functionality in comparison to placebo. The investigators also hypothesize that patients
           who receive an intra-articular corticosteroid will experience decreased pain or improved
           functionality in the affected joint.

      Background:

      Osteoarthritis (OA) causes patients considerable joint pain and leads to instability, reduced
      range of motion, and functional limitations. Pathologic findings of OA include decreased
      articular cartilage, joint space narrowing, osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis and bone
      cysts. Currently, treatment options are confined to symptom management only. Options for
      treatment include: topical preparations, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
      intra-articular injections, and, in severe cases, total knee arthroplasty. Review of recent
      recommendations shows limitations to all available treatments. Oral NSAIDs have shown relief,
      but is limited to patients without risk factors or contraindications. Topical NSAIDs are
      recommended in elderly patients or those with GI risk factors, rather than oral NSAIDs.
      However, pain improvement took 12 weeks and was not long-lived, potentially due to compliance
      issues in application. A recent systematic review of intra-articular corticosteroids reported
      that, due to low-quality evidence, it is inconclusive whether intra-articular corticosteroids
      provided any short or long-term pain relief. Taylor's review of hyaluronic acid treatment is
      hampered by the variability of preparations currently on the market and shortage of
      double-blind placebo controlled studies, but conflicting data is reported. Osteoarthritis
      Research Society International currently recommends corticosteroid injections for short-term
      pain relief only, and is inconclusive in recommending hyaluronic acid.

      The aforementioned treatment limitations have generated interest in alternative options to
      restore function and alleviate joint pain, some with the aim of healing damaged articular
      cartilage. It is well known that articular cartilage is avascular and lacks innervation,
      which limits its intrinsic healing and repair capabilities. Chondrocytes, derived from MSCs,
      have limited potential to replicate, which also limits the intrinsic healing and repair
      capabilities of articular cartilage. The stromal vascular fraction, containing adipose
      derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has historically been isolated successfully via
      enzymatic processes. There has been preliminary support in the literature for reduced pain
      and improved functional performance in patients who received MSCs as part of treatment.
      However, approaches to isolate MSCs are costly, time consuming, require extensive lab
      equipment, and are currently limited by complex regulatory issues.

      Thus, interest in an alternative isolation method lead to the development of Lipogems.
      Lipogems is a technique to harvest, process, and inject minimally manipulated adipose tissue.
      This procedure is enzyme free and requires no clonal expansion or manipulation. Lipoaspirate
      is harvested and washed in saline solution, then processed through a closed-system device
      that micro-fragments the adipose tissue. This mechanical process retains the vascular
      architecture, mature pericytes, and MSCs for autologous injection.

      As new technologies are becoming available for the treatment of OA, it is important that
      investigators gather high-quality data on their efficacy and outcomes. The goal of this study
      is to evaluate the possible benefits of reduced joint pain and increased joint functionality
      in patients with knee osteoarthritis after the injection of Lipogems. In addition, given the
      limitations of prior research on the efficacy of intra-articular corticosteroids, the
      investigators will also include this as an additional study group to compare to placebo.
      Although Lipogems is relatively new to the United States, it has been used for a variety of
      orthopaedic arthroscopic applications overseas including the treatment of knee OA and is
      being used more frequently now in the United States. As of now, there are no published
      studies reporting the outcomes of patients who receive Lipogems for knee OA. There have been
      case reports published showing favorable outcomes. Thus, this would be the first study
      reporting data on the efficacy of Lipogems for pain relief in knee OA in a randomized,
      controlled clinical trial with a larger sample of patients. It would also be the only study
      to date comparing Lipogems to intra-articular corticosteroids and placebo injections. The
      investigators feel this study design will provide new insight into the efficacy of Lipogems
      for pain relief of symptomatic knee OA as well as offer new data on the efficacy of
      intra-articular corticosteroids in this application.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will be conducted as a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Patients will be randomized to receive either Lipogems, intra-articular corticosteroids, or a placebo injection of saline. Lipogems is cleared for use by the FDA in orthopaedics and arthroscopy and is offered as a treatment option for knee osteoarthritis. This study will be evaluating the effectiveness (not safety) of Lipogems when compared to corticosteroids and placebo. Thus, no information will be submitted to the FDA.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to procedure then post-procedure: 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Scaled pain score to assess change in a patient's knee pain over time. Pain level is marked on a 100 mm line with the 0 mm corresponding to &quot;no pain&quot; and the 100 mm corresponding to 10/10 pain. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 100 mm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. The following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm).</description>

    <description>Patient self-reported outcome measure to assess pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients with knee osteoarthritis. The WOMAC consists of 24 items divided into 3 subscales: Pain (5 items), Stiffness (2 items), and Physical Function (17 items). The following descriptors are used for all items: none, mild, moderate, severe, and extreme. These correspond to an ordinal scale of 0-4. The scores are summed for items in each subscale, with possible ranges as follows: pain=0-20, stiffness=0-8, physical function=0-68. A total WOMAC score is created by summing the items for all three subscales. Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations. The score can range from 0 to 96; however, this score is typically reported as a percentage of 100 for normalization.</description>

    <description>Patient self-reported outcome measure to assess the patient's opinion about their knee and associated issues. KOOS consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and knee related Quality of life (QOL). Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question gets a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated by adding the subscales together.</description>

It is standard to harvest three to four times more adipose tissue than is planned to be injected to account for tissue processing by the Lipogems device. The investigators plan to inject 7cc of autologous adipose tissue. Thus, the investigators will harvest between 25 and 30 cc of adipose tissue from each patient. The tissue will be processed immediately and 7cc will be injected. Any remaining adipose tissue will be disposed of immediately in biohazardous waste.</description>
