  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) planned for treatment
      with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy in curative setting will be treated with an
      adaptive radiotherapy scheme. An FDG-PET/CT scan for re-delineation and re-planning will be
      made at the end of the second and fourth of week of radiotherapy. The non-responding part of
      the tumor on FDG-PET will receive a mild dose-escalation. Depending on the metabolic
      response, the entire tumor will receive 70 Gy or the residual FDG-avid area will receive 74
      or 78 Gy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If there is a complete metabolic response on the FDG-PET after 2 weeks, the entire tumor will
      receive 70 Gy. If there is a complete metabolic response after 4 weeks of treatment, the
      residual FDG-avid area will receive 74 Gy. If there also is no complete metabolic response
      after 4 weeks of treatment, the residual FDG-avid area will receive 78 Gy.
