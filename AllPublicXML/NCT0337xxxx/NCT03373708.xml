  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy in the world, and the leading cause of
      cancer-associated mortalities among women. Hormone receptors (HR) including ER and PR are the
      main prognostic factor for breast cancer patients. Breast cancer subtype was defined by ER,
      PR, HER2 and Ki67 status since the definition of intrinsic subtypes for breast cancer. Breast
      cancer which ER are positive have less aggressive and better long-term prognoses than other
      breast cancer subtype. Luminal B1 was definited as ER Positive, PR positive &lt;20%, or Ki-67
      ≥20% , and HER2-Negative. Although standard therapy to HR positive breast cancer is endocrine
      treatment, evidence reported that Luminal B1 breast cancers with lower PR expression are less
      sensitive to tamoxifen than luminal A breast cancers with higher PR expression, and the
      specific mechanism is not clear. We previously had a clinically analysed, and we found the
      Luminal B1 breast cancer had a significant proportion with 38%. Whether we need standard
      chemotherapy or chemotherapy based intensive endocrine therapy for those patients? In our
      research, we divided the patients with ER positive, PR negative, and HER-2 negative into two
      groups. One groups will be treated with 8 cycles of chemotherapy (EC×4-T×4). The other
      received 4 cycles of chemotherapy (TC×4) then will be given the intensive endocrine therapy
      (Goserelin acetate+Tamoxifen for young patients/Letrozole for postmenopausal patients). The
      primary endpoint is to assess disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in
      different regiments, the secondary endpoint is to assess the expression of female hormone
      levels. The correlation of the expression of female hormone levels with the clinical
      outcomes, so that the investigators could optimize adjuvant treatment regiment with luminal
      B1 breast cancer.

      The trial is designed to investigative the risk and clinical benefit of chemotherapy and
      intensive endocrine therapy for Luminal B1 early-staged breast cancer. In this trial the
      investigators will randomly assign 200 primary breast cancer patients to receive four cycles
      of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) followed by four cycles of docetaxel(T), or four
      cycles of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) followed by intensive endocrine therapy
      (Goserelin acetate+Tamoxifen/Letrozole for young patients) . Patients with HER-2 positive was
      excluded. The patient's conditions will be assessed before, and after every four cycles of
      adjuvant chemotherapy to determine if there is any progression of the disease. The patient's
      conditions will be assessed every three months when they received the intensive endocrine
      therapy (Goserelin acetate+Tamoxifen for young patients/Letrozole for postmenopausal
      patients). Patients will be followed up for DFS and OS in different regiments, the secondary
      endpoint is to assess the expression of female hormone levels. The correlation of the
      expression of female hormone levels with the clinical outcomes, so that the investigators
      could optimize adjuvant treatment regiment with luminal B1 breast cancer.
