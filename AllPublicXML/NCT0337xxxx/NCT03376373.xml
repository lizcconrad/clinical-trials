  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, more prevalent than
      previously thought and heterogeneous in expression, though uniformly characterized by severe
      social disability. The social disability that defines ASD pervades other areas of adaptive
      behavior, is predictive of secondary mental health problems, and adversely affects long-term
      outcome. Although ASD is a chronic condition, there has been little research on interventions
      for adults with ASD. This study proposes to first establish the neural plasticity of specific
      brain mechanisms underlying difficulties with facial emotion recognition, a core deficit
      believed to be pivotal in the behavioral expression of ASD-social disability. The
      investigators will then develop a novel, computer-based intervention using real-time
      feedback, to the user, to ameliorate emotion recognition deficits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are known to have difficulty in the
      recognition of facial emotion. Such deficits in facial emotion recognition (FER) are thought
      to cause or exacerbate social disability in ASD by preventing 1) accurate detection of
      social/emotional information conveyed through the face and, subsequently 2) the deployment of
      emotionally appropriate responses. Consistent with this model, FER deficits are correlated
      with social disability in ASD and confer morbidity above and beyond core symptoms.

      The long-term goal is to understand how FER networks can be manipulated for therapeutic and
      preventative purposes. In this trial, investigators are testing the feasibility of an
      intervention that capitalizes on our previously developed brain-computer interface (BCI) to
      promote FER in a mixed virtual reality world. The new &quot;FER Assistant&quot; tool (deployed on a
      tablet - iPad) is intended to aid users in detecting emotions and intents of 'avatars'
      inhabiting a virtual world, and will provide users with a highly realistic testbed for
      practicing FER skills in concert with BCI.
