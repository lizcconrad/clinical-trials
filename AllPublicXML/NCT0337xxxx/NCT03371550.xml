  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CHRT) is the standard of care for unresectable locally advanced
      stage III non-small cell lung cancer. However, the optimal combination remains unclear. The
      aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 2 induction chemotherapy cycles (days 1 and
      22) with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 followed by concurrent chemotherapy
      (weekly docetaxel-cisplatin, 20 mg/m2) and 3-D conformal radiotherapy for 6 weeks (66 Gy/5
      fractions per week/2 Gy per fraction). ). The primary endpoint is the response rate.
      Secondary objectives are toxicity, time to progression, and overall survival.

    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most common malignancy among men in most countries and constitutes the
      leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Non-small cell histology represents roughly 80% of
      lung cancer cases comprising one third of patients with stage III, locally-advanced disease
      at diagnosis. Some stage IIIA cancers are considered resectable but many stage IIIA (with
      bulky N2) and stage IIIB (T4 any N M0, any T N3M0) cancers are considered unsuitable for
      surgery. However, some authors have shown that surgery after chemoradiotherapy (CHRT) is
      beneficial for at least progression-free survival (PFS). Since the 90s, CHRT has become the
      cornerstone of inoperable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A
      meta-analysis of 52 randomized studies showed a survival improvement of 3% at 2 years and 2%
      at 5 years for patients treated with CHRT versus radiotherapy alone [6]. Concomitant
      chemoradiation was demonstrated to be better than sequential administration in terms of
      overall survival (OS) in 3 out of 4 randomized studies with esophagitis as the dose-limiting
      toxicity. Nevertheless, the median survival was around 16 months and improvement is needed.
      To better control micrometastatic disease and reduce distant relapses, one possibility is to
      increase radiosensitization with higher doses of chemotherapy.The aim of this phase II study
      is to evaluate the anti-tumoral activity of a weekly docetaxel-cisplatin combination
      administered concurrently with radiotherapy after 2 induction cycles with the same drugs.
