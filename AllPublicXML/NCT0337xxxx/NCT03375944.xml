  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although clinical data demonstrate advantages of combining complete revascularization with
      optimal cardiac rehabilitation (CR) less than one-third of patients in European countries
      participate in cardiac rehabilitation programs. Therefore, in cooperation with Polish leaders
      in cardiovascular medicine, rehabilitation and medical software design we aim to introduce
      and evaluate the system of optimal cardiac telerehabilitation in addition to optimal
      treatment of coronary artery disease.

      Although clinical data demonstrate advantages of combining complete revascularization with
      optimal cardiac rehabilitation (OCR) less than one-third of patients in European countries
      participate in cardiac rehabilitation programs.

      In addition, the major limitations of current CR programs are their short duration without
      long-term follow-up, lack of appropriate clinical and functional monitoring, and structural
      problems including geographic misdistribution of available programs. Therefore, in
      cooperation with Polish leaders in cardiovascular medicine, rehabilitation and medical
      software design we aim to introduce and evaluate the system of optimal cardiac
      telerehabilitation in addition to optimal treatment of coronary artery disease. Primarily,
      the telerehabilitation system will be designed and developed. Secondly, coordinating center
      will be build and technical tests will be performed in order to evaluate its integrity with
      telerehabilitation system. Thirdly, the whole system will be validated in clinical settings
      on patients' population with coronary artery disease and completed revascularization.
      Finally, procedural steps will be executed in order to prepare the whole system of optimal
      cardiac telerehabilitation for implementation.

    <description>The purpose of this work package is to evaluate short- and long-term clinical effects of optimal, continuous and regularly controlled tele-rehabilitation, which is based on exercise training, intensive dietary and educational program focused on lifestyle and risk factors modification. The main expectations of OCR is to normalize annual mortality to the level of the low risk &quot;healthy&quot; population.</description>
