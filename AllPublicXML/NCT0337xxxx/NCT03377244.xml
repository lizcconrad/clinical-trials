    <textblock>
      The study aim is to pilot test and compare the effectiveness of achieving weight loss between
      implementation of: 1) the Diabetes Prevention Program Lifestyle Intervention (DPP-LI) and 2)
      Healthy Bodies Healthy Souls (HBHS) intervention which includes the same DPP-LI with the
      additional enhancement of working with Marshallese churches to implement
      organizational/institutional level changes to support the individual behavioral intervention
      of the DPP-LI.
