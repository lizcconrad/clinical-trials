  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seizure-related cardiac arrhythmias are one of the possible causes of sudden unexpected death
      in epilepsy (SUDEP). Identification of these patients is challenging because cardiac rhythm
      disturbances could emerge only during seizures. Furthermore, patients could have transitioned
      sinus or AV node blocks which could cause syncopes with brady-related seizures which could be
      treated as epilepsy-related seizures. Implantable loop recorders have an ability to recording
      single-channel ECG for up to 36 months which give an ability to detect these heart
      disturbances.

      The purpose of this study is to look the incidence and types of arrhythmias which occur in
      150 patients with hard-to-treat partial seizures and secondarily generalized seizures
