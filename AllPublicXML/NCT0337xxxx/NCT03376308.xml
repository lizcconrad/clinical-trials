  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During general anesthesia, intravenous (IV) medications can disrupt the patient's comfort by
      causing a pain sensation or a withdrawal response in the heart. Propofol and rocuronium are
      among the most common causes of this condition.

      In recent years, the use of ultrasonography (USG) in anesthesia has become widespread with
      the rapid advancement of technology. The use of the patient's head is a non invasive method.

      This study is aimed to evaluate whether the size of the venous diameter assessed by
      ultrasonography in our study is an effect on pain and withdrawal response after drug
      injections.

      The study was conducted in patients who underwent surgical procedures under general
      anesthesia by obtaining consent from the Adnan Menderes University Medical Faculty Ethics
      Board and written consent from the patients and then being admitted to the ASA I-II age group
      18-70 years of age.

      Patients with peripheric vascular disease, vasculitis, rheumatologic disease,
      non-cooperative, under the age of 18 and over 70, ASA III and above, allergic to general
      anesthetic agents and refusing to participate in the study were excluded from the study.

        The study was conducted on 145 patients aged 17- 70 years of ASA (American Society of
        Anesthesiologists) physical status I- II who were to undergo various elective operations.
        None of the patients was premedicated before the operation. Venous diameter measurements
        were performed in preoperative room via USG.The patients were monitored with three
        derivation electrocardiogram, non- invasive arterial pressure, and pulse oximeter.
