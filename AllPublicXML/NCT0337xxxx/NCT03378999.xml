      Objectives:

      Secondary objectives are to investigate the effects on other CVD risk parameters: total
      cholesterol, triacylglycerol, HDL-C, glucose and blood pressure. Safety will be monitored by
      measurements of markers for liver, kidney and heart function.

      Study design:

      The study is a 4-weeks randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial with a parallel
      design using 3 doses oven-dried Rhodospirillum rubrum. Prior to and after the intervention
      period, a 2-week run-in and run-out period takes place, during which all subjects will
      consume placebo capsules.

      Study population:

      Eighty (N=80) healthy men with a slightly elevated fasting serum total cholesterol
      concentration (between 5.0-8.0 mmol/l) will complete the study.

      Intervention:

      During the intervention period of 4 weeks, men will receive either placebo or capsules
      containing 0.25 gr, 0.5 gr or 1.0 gr oven-dried Rhodospirillum rubrum per day.
