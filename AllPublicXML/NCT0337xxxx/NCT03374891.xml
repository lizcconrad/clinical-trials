  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators goal is to assess real-world effectiveness of patient decision aids (PtDA)
      for high-risk decisions using the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) as a model.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose the DECIDE-ICD trial: a type II effectiveness implementation hybrid
      trial of the investigators ICD PtDAs. The Investigators will use a 6-site stepped-wedge
      design, with implementation guided by normalization process theoryÂ® and evaluation guided by
      the RE-AIM framework.

      The investigators aim to evaluate reach and effectiveness of the ICD PtDAs using a pragmatic,
      stepped-wedge design on decision quality (knowledge and value-concordance) and psychosocial
      outcomes.

        -  Hypothesis 1a: PtDAs will reach over 50% of eligible patients.

        -  Hypothesis 1b: ICD PtDAs will be effective in improving decision quality in real-world
           practice.

        -  Hypothesis 1c: Better informed patients will have lower anxiety, higher rates of
           planning for the possibility of deactivation, and increased identification of a
           surrogate decision maker.
