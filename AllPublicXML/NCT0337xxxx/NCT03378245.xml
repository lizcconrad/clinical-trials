    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of telemedicine-based intervention at
      urban and rural skilled nursing facilities to recommend multidisciplinary dementia care to
      residents with dementia who are at risk for unnecessary hospitalization due behavioral or
      neuropsychiatric symptoms and/or complications as well as caregivers and facility staff. The
      multidisciplinary team is comprised of trained behavioral neurologists, social workers,
      advanced practice providers, primary medical team and nurse coordinators.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI assesses 10 behavioral symptom domains, scoring is based on symptom frequency and severity. The total NPI score sums the products of frequency and severity scores for each domain. Higher scores indicate more behavioral disturbance</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Resource Utilization in Dementia - Formal Care (RUD-FOCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The RUD-FOCA records the care time in three areas: activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and supervision.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Life in Alzheimers Dementia (QoL-AD)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>13 quality of life items are rated on a four point scale, with 1 being poor and 4 being excellent. Total scores range from 13 to 52. It generally takes caregivers about 5 minutes to complete the measure.</description>
