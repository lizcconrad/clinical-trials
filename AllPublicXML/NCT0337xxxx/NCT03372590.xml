  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature infants are at increased risk of developing cerebral palsy (CP). Early
      interventions for at risk infants have the potential to decrease disease severity and improve
      quality of life. All infants demonstrate general movements (GMs), which are reliable
      indicators of brain function and can be reproducibly evaluated using the General Movement
      Assessment (GMA) tool.

      Prior studies have demonstrated the impact of early maternal-driven intervention strategies
      on neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants. Investigators have shown that
      interventions promoting the establishment of emotional connection between the infant and his
      or her mother, including mother/infant calming sessions with scent cloth exchange, vocal
      soothing, eye contact, and kangaroo care, can impact neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18
      months. Investigators have also shown that 60 minutes of kangaroo care leads to decreasing
      levels of the stress hormone cortisol in both mothers and infants.

      This pilot study aims to determine the feasibility of a maternal-driven early intervention
      bundle in preterm infants with abnormal GMA.

      The study objective are 3-fold:

        1. To determine the proportion of infants (&lt;32 weeks gestation and/or &lt;1500g) who have
           abnormal GMs findings using the GMA tool.

        2. To determine the feasibility of NICU based rehabilitation program in 20 infants
           determined to be at high risk for CP using the GMA tool. The intervention bundle will
           consist of a maternal-driven gestational age (GA)-appropriate intervention bundle that
           will include evidence-based interventions including vocal soothing, comforting touch,
           scent exchange, kangaroo care, and infant massage. Patients will be compared to
           contemporary and GA-matched controls receiving standard of care with a 1:2 assignment.

        3. To evaluate the short-term impact of a maternal-driven intervention bundle on the
           mother-infant dyad. Maternal stress will be measured using the Parental Stress Scale for
           NICU patients (PSS: NICU) prior to the intervention and prior to the infant's NICU
           discharge. Further, stress will be assessed by measuring maternal and infant salivary
           cortisol pre-and post-kangaroo care on 3 separate occasions (post enrollment in the
           study, mid-hospital stay, and prior to discharge). Measures of maternal anxiety and
           depression will be evaluated prior to the intervention and prior to NICU discharge using
           the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instrument.

      The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will lead to positive and measurable
      outcomes for the mother-infant dyad.
