  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain mechanisms and their clinical impact in patients with bronchiectasis have not been
      investigated yet. The aim of the research is to assess the presence of central pain
      mechanisms in patients with bronchiectasis using the Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST)
      assumptions.

      Background and objective:

      Recent findings suggest that pain can play an important role in terms of physical activity
      limitation in respiratory patients. Nevertheless, pain mechanisms and their clinical impact
      in patients with bronchiectasis have not been investigated yet. The objective of the
      observational study is to determine the somatosensorial profile in order to assess the
      presence of central pain mechanisms in patients with bronchiectasis.

      Methodology:

      Repeated-measures prospective cross-sectional study. A sample of patients diagnosed with
      bronchiectasis will be recruited and matched by age and sex with healthy controls. Pressure
      pain thresholds (PPTs), conditioned pain modulation (CPM) and referral pain will be assessed
      before and after the Incremental Shuttle Walking test (ISW). Levels of physical activity will
      be assessed using accelerometry during a 7-days period. Sleep quality (Pittsburgh sleep
      quality test), level of catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale), level of sensitization
      (Central Sensitization Inventory) and level of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression) will be assessed. The assessments will be done twice: 1) at baseline; and 2) at 6
      months follow-up period.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Punctuation obtained in Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). It comprises 13 items which focus on thoughts and feelings encountered while experiencing pain. Each item is scored from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time) with a total PCS score range from 0-52 points, where higher scores indicating higher levels of pain catastrophizing.</description>

    <measure>Level of sensitization</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Punctuation obtained in Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI). CSI assesses 25 health-related symptoms common to Central Sensitivity Syndromes. Responses are recorded about the frequency of each symptom, with a Likert scale from 0 (never) to 4 (always), resulting in a total possible score of 100. Higher scores are associated with a higher degree of self-reported symptomology.</description>

    <description>Punctuation obtained in Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD). The HAD is a 14-item self-report scale measuring the presence of symptoms of both anxiety (seven items) and depression (seven items) during the past week. Each item is scored from 0 to 3, so the final score for each subscale is between 0 and 21. The majority of the studies use the cutoffs of 7/8 for possible and 10/11 for probable anxiety or depression.</description>

    <measure>Quality of sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Punctuation obtained in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI is a 19-item, self-rated questionnaire designed to measure sleep quality and disturbance over the past month in clinical populations. Each sleep component yields a score ranging from 0 to 3, with 3 indicating the greatest dysfunction. Sleep component scores were summed to yield a total score ranging from 0 to 21 with the higher total score (referred to as global score) indicating worse sleep quality.</description>
