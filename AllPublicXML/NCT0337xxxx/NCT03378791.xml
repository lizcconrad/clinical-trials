  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anemia in pregnancy is defined by the World Health Organization as hemoglobin levels of â‰¤ 11
      g/dl. Globally, a prevalence rate of 38% was estimated by the World Health Organization for
      pregnant women.Treatment of iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy remains a main public
      health issue. Oral iron salts have been recommended for treatment of iron deficiency anemia
      e.g. ferrous fumarate. Increasing the dose of ferrous fumarate will subsequently increase the
      bioavailability of iron preparation, however it also increases the frequency of
      gastrointestinal tract side effects e.g. nausea, constipation, diarrhea, flatulence, and
      black stained stools. Besides, the increased bioavailable ferrous fumarate may decrease by
      many foods and / or chelating drugs in the gastrointestinal tract which interfere with its
      absorption leading to variability in the hemoglobin correction during the treatment.

      Ferrous bisglycinate is an iron amino acid chelate. It is formed by reaction of ferrous iron
      with two molecules of the amino acid glycine by a covalent bound in a process called
      chelation. Ferrous bisglycinate is claimed to have better patient compliance because of fewer
      gastrointestinal tract side effects. It is also claimed that ferrous bisglycinate improves
      iron absorption, storage and increase hemoglobin level better than the conventionally used
      iron salts.
