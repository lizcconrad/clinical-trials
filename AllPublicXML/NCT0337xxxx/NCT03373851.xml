  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (iv-PCA) is the gold standard for the treatment of
      moderate to severe postoperative pain. It is used in more than 20% of cases after major
      surgery. Well known disadvantages of this method include the need of intravenous line
      (invasive, infection risk), the risk of pump programming error, possible delay for
      ambulation/barrier for enhanced rehabilitation programmes, and time/resource demanding (the
      need of preparation and installation). Sublingual sufentanil based PCA (Zalviso®) addresses
      cited issues. The safety and analgesia efficiency of this system is well described. However,
      the usability and satisfaction of Zalviso® varies depending on clinical settings. The goal of
      this study is to evaluate the usability and satisfaction of patients, nurses, and physical
      therapists using Zalviso® System during the first 72 hours in the settings of Enhanced
      Recovery After Surgery protocol after major interventions associated with moderate to severe
      postoperative pain.

    <description>The Zalviso device will be provided immediately before the Post anesthesia care unit (PACU) discharge. Patients will be queried every day during three postoperative days for the ability to use the device, their satisfaction, the level of pain, and the incidence of side effects. There will be no changes in usual care.
In the end of this study ward nurses carrying Zalviso patients will be asked to provide their usability and satisfaction evaluation for Zalviso device management. Physical therapist will be asked to provide their satisfaction regarding patients' ability to follow physical therapy program.</description>
