  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational Study to investigate the technical feasibility, implementation into current
      diagnostic and treatment pathways and the diagnostic accuracy of the remote patient
      assessment by using mobile telecommunication ahead of hospitalization.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On-site, pre-hospital clinical assessment of patients with suspected acute stroke can
      accelerate further diagnostic and treatment pathways after patient arrival at the emergency
      room or the dedicated stroke center. Interactive video and audio streaming connecting on-site
      paramedics to a stroke center based stroke physicians can help to overcome these hurdles.
      Patient evaluation by simple, pre-defined assessment measures and a standardized
      questionnaire may enable a pre-hospital decision on the need of expedited diagnostic and
      treatment procedures after arrival at the dedicated stroke center.

        The current phase of the project (&quot;Feasibility&quot;) will include patients with suspected acute
        stroke already admitted to the ER of the University Hospital Basel, and patients with
        suspected acute stroke and who are referred to the Stroke Center of USB by the paramedics.
