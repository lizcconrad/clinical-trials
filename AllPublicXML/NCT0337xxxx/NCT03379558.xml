  <brief_summary>

      Primary Objective:

      To estimate the overall combined rate of major structural birth defects in infants of mothers
      with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and/or familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)
      exposed to Praluent速 (alirocumab) during pregnancy when used to treat hypercholesterolemia
      and to compare that rate to unexposed disease-matched and unexposed non-diseased comparison
      pregnancies.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Secondary objectives are to estimate the rates of the outcomes in pregnancies/infants of
           mothers with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and/or familial hypercholesterolemia
           exposed to alirocumab during pregnancy when used to treat hypercholesterolemia and to
           compare that rate to unexposed disease-matched and non-diseased comparison pregnancies,
           and secondarily to compare the rates of these outcomes in the unexposed disease-matched
           pregnancies to the rates in the unexposed non-diseased comparison pregnancies.

        -  Safety and tolerability of alirocumab.
