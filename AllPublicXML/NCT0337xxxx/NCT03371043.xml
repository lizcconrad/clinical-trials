    <description>Types of specific molecule and drug combinations: Assessment of these parameters will concern two distinct periods of time: ≤1 year after the diagnosis of cancer disease and &gt;1 year after diagnosis. The diagnosis date will either the date of the first hospitalization for cancer or the date of full expenses coverage by the health insurance system for cancer disease, whichever comes first.
Profile of prescribers: hospital or private practice Profile of patients: age groups (0-23 months, 2-5 years, 6-11 years, 12-17 years) Acute or chronic use. Chronic use will be defined by at least 3 dispensations of the same analgesic drug (ATC code 5th level) in a period of 12 months.</description>
