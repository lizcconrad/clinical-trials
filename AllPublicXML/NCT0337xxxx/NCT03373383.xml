  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to characterize the dose-response relationship with respect to
      efficacy of Padsevonil administered concomitantly with up to 3 anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs)
      for treatment of observable focal-onset seizures in subjects with drug-resistant epilepsy.

    <description>During the study, subjects will keep diaries to record daily seizure activity. Seizure frequency refers to 28-day adjusted frequency. Seizure frequency will be based on investigator assessment of subjects' reports of daily seizure type and frequency. Observable focal-onset seizures refer to Type IA1, IB, and IC (ILAE Classification of Epileptic Seizures, 1981).</description>

    <description>A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening
Requires in patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
Is as infection that requires treatment parenteral antibiotics
Other important medical events which based on medical or scientific judgement may jeopardize the patients, or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above.</description>
