      By bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) association of fluid status in patients with
      valvular heart disease and cardiovascular outcome will be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Volume overload and abnormal fluid distribution are hallmarks in the syndromes of acute and
      chronic heart failure (HF) as well as valvular heart disease (VHD). Most patients, at some
      point in their disease progression, present acutely to an emergency department, where they
      will typically show symptoms of progressive volume overload.

      Most patients respond well to standard diuretic therapy, usually at the costs of impaired
      renal function. Based on the assumption that clinically overt fluid overload is the result of
      progressive fluid accumulation, current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and American
      College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) guidelines recommend a
      correction of volume status using diuretics, to reduce the total fluid volume. However there
      is no consensus on how to define fluid overload quantitavely.

      In patients undergoing dialysis, bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy / body composition
      monitoring (BCM) is a well established tool to assess fluid status, allowing quantitative
      measurement.

      This study aims to

        1. Establish a database reflecting the fluid status assessed by BCM of patients presenting
           with valvular heart disease according to current guidelines

        2. Monitor fluid status assessed by BCM during increased diuretic treatment in patients
           presenting with cardiac decompensation due to valvular heart disease

        3. Assess the association between severity of valvular heart disease assessed by
           echocardiography and/or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, fluid status assessed by
           BCM, and clinical as well as laboratory parameters assessed during clinical routine

        4. Assess the relationship between fluid status assessed by BCM and cardiovascular outcome
