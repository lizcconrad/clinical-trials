    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the difference of imaging diagnostic quality and fertility promoting
      effect in the diagnosis and treatment of infertility by hysterosalpingography between using
      ethiodized poppyseed oil and the second-generation non-ionic monomer contrast. Half of
      participants will receive ethiodized poppyseed oil for hysterosalpingography, while the other
      half will receive the second-generation non-ionic monomer contrast for hysterosalpingography.
