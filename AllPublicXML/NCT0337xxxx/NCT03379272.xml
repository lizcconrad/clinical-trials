  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed to evaluate the performance of the Neuronaute in comparison
      with the gold standard EEG in patients with a regular appointment at the hospital. The design
      of this study is guided by two overriding factors : (i) epileptics disorders suspected or
      either (ii) epileptics already diagnosed.

      Volunteers will be asked to participate to this study. This study will enroll 35 outpatient
      subjects aged 18 to 85. Informed consent will be obtained from the patients, and assent from
      the subjects, prior to any form of assessment or intervention as part of the study.

      Patients will be submitted to the studied device record Neuronaute following by the gold
      standard EEG.

      A grid with all EEG activity recorded during the trial will be provided for evaluation after
      completion of the trial.

    <measure>Reproducibility of electroencephalographic signals interpretation recorded by the Neuronaute compared to the gold standard.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The main evaluation criteria is the reproducibility based on the interpretation of electroencephalographic signals recorded by the Neuronaute compared to the gold standard. The system will be considered effective if there are no significant differences in the physiological parameters recorded by the two systems.
A clinical expert will interpret the EEG(electroencephalography) signals and fill the EEG evaluation sheet. It includes items such as signals quality and presence of abnormal events</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Neuronaute will be considered effective if it detects inter-critical epileptic abnormalities in at least one patient.</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Neuronaute will be considered efficient if the installation time is at least as fast as the installation of the gold standard. The time will be measured from the beginning of the patient's preparation until the beginning of the recording.</measure>

    <description>The time needed to set up the clinical device and the device under test will be noted in the Case Report Form.</description>
