      Objective.To compare different therapies that employ acupuncture needles, silicon pellets and
      kinesiotherapy in patients with breast cancer submitted to taxane chemotherapy cycles.
      Methods. study will be carried out at the Oncomastology outpatient clinic of the Discipline
      of Mastology of the Department of Gynecology of the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP)
      - Escola Paulista de Medicina (EPM) and the Oncology Clinic Associated Center of Oncology,
      located at Rua Gabriel Monteiro da Silva, 454. randomized clinical trial will be conducted to

      Acupuncture or Group C: Kinesiotherapy) who will receive treatment once a week for eight
      consecutive weeks. 93 patients will be randomized in one of the three groups, after having
      signed the Free and Informed Consent Form and agreed to participate in the project, will
      respond to the evaluation form and will be submitted to physical examination. will be

      history, personal history, surgical data, pathological anatomy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy,
      hormone therapy, sensitivity and perimetry; 4º will do physical exams. Completed the

    <intervention_model_description>A computer program will produce a randomization list, which will generate random sequences for the three groups and will be recorded and placed in sealed, opaque, non-translucent and sequentially numbered envelopes. This intervention should be done by someone else and not by the principal investigator. These envelopes will be opened after the consent of the patient to participate in the research and only then will the researcher know as well as the patient the group that she will be allocated. 93 envelopes were available where 31 would contain code that allocates the patients in group A, 31 in group B and 31 in group C. This choice was chosen to avoid influences of the preference of the therapist or patient in relation to the intervention</intervention_model_description>
