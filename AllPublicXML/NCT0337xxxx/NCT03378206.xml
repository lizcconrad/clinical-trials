  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the therapeutic effect of hinged 8-figure plate by comparing with the traditional
      8-figure plate through a randomized controlled clinical trial by assessing the differences
      between preoperative and postoperative data.

      The hypothesis is that the hinged 8 plate provides low complications that this treatment is
      as good as the traditional one.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Angular deformities of the lower limb is major clinical problems encountered in pediatric
      orthopedics. Deformities can be either valgus or varus and most commonly affect the knee
      joint, which may result in patella dislocation, gait instability and serious impact on the
      appearance and function of the lower limbs. Biomechanical studies and gait analysis found
      that genu varus increased medial articular surface pressure of the knee, while genu valgus
      increased lateral articular surface pressure, and both of them are the risk factors for
      osteoarthritis. Surgical treatment techniques include osteotomy and hemiepipysidesis.
      Osteotomy surgery is the gold standard for severe angular deformity or epiphyseal closed
      patients, but it was associated with lots of complications, including osteofascial
      compartment syndrome, neurovascular injury, deep soft tissue infection, nonunion and
      requiring a long recovery time. While, for patients whose epiphyseal is not closed, the
      traditional 8 plate hemiepipysidesis has fewer complications. However, it showed some
      problems in clinical applications, such as steel plate or screw broken. The investigators
      designed a new hinged 8 plate, which has two arms and a built-in hinge. Based on the previous
      studies, investigators designed the rotation of the two arms ranged from 155째 to 170째 to
      better fit the contour of the physis in all stages of angular correction. That automatic
      change can also disperse repeated stress on the surface of periosteum and perichondrium
      during walking. The plate had been tested on animal models that the use of the hinged plate
      and screw system may be a more reliable technique with minimal complications for correction
      of angular deformities of the lower limb.
