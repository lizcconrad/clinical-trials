      EndoSearch aims to analytically validate a cluster of specific biomarkers for endometriosis
      diagnosis and disease recurrence. This signature will be tested on endometrium and blood from
      975 patients, divided in two groups : 550 patients affected by endometriosis and 225 patients
      unaffected (controls).

      EndoSearch is not about drug or medical device assessment but a research study for biomarker
      analytical validation purpose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a very common gynecological disease affecting 10% of women of reproductive
      age. Main symptoms are chronic and severe pain in pelvis area and infertility in up to 40% of
      affected women. Currently, the only method to obtain a reliable diagnosis is the analysis of
      endometriotic lesions removed during surgery under general anaesthesia. There is a real need
      to diagnosis endometriosis non-invasively and quickly in order to improve patient management.

      EndoSearch aims to analytically validate a cluster of endometrial and blood biomarkers
      identified in previous studies and specific for the endometriosis diagnosis and disease
      prognosis recurrence. During 2 years (follow up period) and 9 months (inclusion period), 15
      clinical centers worldwide will recruit patients and collect biological samples and personal
      and clinical data from these patients. The biological samples will be processed at Endodiag
      labs, Paris, France though lab biotechnology techniques. Results will allow the assessment of
      sensibility and specificity (NPV and PPV) of the biomarker signature for endometriosis
      diagnosis and disease recurrence.

    <description>EndoSearch will conduct on only one cohort divided in two groups : patients affected by endometriosis and patient unaffected (controls). All of these patients need a laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis indication (endometriosis group) or another indication which is not endometriosis (controls). However, nothing in the surgery or the patient medical care will be different between the two groups : patients will be treated exactly the same.</description>
