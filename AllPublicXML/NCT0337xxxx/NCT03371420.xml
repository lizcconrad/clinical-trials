  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in-human, open-label pilot (microdose) study of the positron-emitting agent
      124I-PU-AD in subjects with specific cancer types (solid malignancy, lymphoma, and/or
      myeloma) and/or Alzheimer's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This first in-human trial of the positron-emitting agent 124I-PU-AD is an open-label pilot
      (microdose) study. Up to 10 evaluable subjects who have active disease will be enrolled to
      evaluate the PK, metabolism, biodistribution, and radiation dosimetry of 124I-PU-AD.

      Following a 28-day screening period, eligible subjects will return to the clinic on Day 1. A
      single dose of 124I-PU-AD will be administered by intravenous (IV) injection to subjects.

      After 124I-PU-AD tracer injection, PET scans will be performed at 4 time points. At each
      time-point, an axial body image is acquired on a state-of-the-art PET-CT scanner. A low-dose
      CT will be obtained immediately-prior to PET imaging, at each time-point. Serial blood
      samples will also be obtained at multiple time points.

      Subjects will be evaluated to ensure that there are no clinically significant ongoing AEs
      prior to discharge.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with a diagnosis of cancer and/or Alzheimer's Disease, meeting trial
             eligibility criteria as specified below for either disease:

             Cancer:

               1. Subjects with eligible histologic types of cancer. Eligible histologic types of
                  cancer include solid malignancy, myeloma, and lymphoma.

               2. Cancer histology confirmed by pathology.

               3. Cancerous disease is radiologically-measurable or evaluable as defined by
                  published tumor response criteria (including but not limited to RECIST 1.1).

             Alzheimer's:

               1. Established diagnosis of mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease based upon
                  neurological and neuropsychological evaluation following the National Institute
                  on Aging - Alzheimer's disease Association criteria that recently revisited the
                  NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.

               2. Documentation of diagnosis of mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease, as above, by

          2. Subject has history of acute major illness (i.e., unstable cardiovascular condition.)

          3. Subject has concurrent participation in any interventional studies within 30 days of
