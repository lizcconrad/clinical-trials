      the aim to evaluate the effect ofempiricintralipidinfusion therapy on pregnancy outcomes in
      patient withunexplained recurrentimplantation failure (RIF) undergoIntracytoplasmic sperm
      injection (ICSI).

      A total of 142 patients with history of unexplained RIF3 or more cycles were included in the
      study. Patient were randomized into two groups, study group (n=71) and control group (n=71).
      The study groupreceivedintralipid 20%infusionon the day of embryo transfer (ET) and a second
      dose on the day of pregnancy test. The control group underwent ET without
      intralipidinfusion.Allpatientswereclosely monitored for any side effectsincluding allergic
      reactions.
