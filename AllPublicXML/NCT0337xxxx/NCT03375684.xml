  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is extensively reported in the literature that patients with chronic obstructive lung
      disease may have impairments in balance and postural control which further increase the
      disease burden. Mechanisms related to these impairments include, but are not limited to
      increased work of breathing, diaphragm weakness, peripheral muscle weakness and systemic
      inflammation. Since the similar symptoms are reported for the children with cystic fibrosis,
      it is hypothesized that balance and postural control may also be compromised in these
      patients. Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is shown to improve diaphragm strength and
      pulmonary function. Considering the relation between diaphragm which is one of the core
      muscles, and balance, IMT may also have an impact on postural control and balance alongside
      the standard clinical parameters such as respiratory muscle strength, pulmonary function and
      functional capacity in these patients. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the
      effects of inspiratory muscle training and conventional chest physiotherapy on postural
      stability, balance, pulmonary function and functional capacity in children with cystic
      fibrosis.
