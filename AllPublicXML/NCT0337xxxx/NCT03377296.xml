  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a sporozoite-challenge clinical study with the primary aim of assessing the safety
      and feasibility of controlled human P. vivax malaria infection in two healthy volunteers. The
      investigators will also assess the growth of and the immune response to P. vivax infection,
      and assess the induction of sexual gametocytaemia post-CHMI via the natural route of malaria
      infection (mosquito bite). A secondary objective is to develop a blood inoculum of P.
      vivax-infected blood for future testing of candidate vaccines.

      This is a sporozoite-challenge clinical study with the primary aim of assessing the safety
      and feasibility of controlled human P. vivax malaria infection in two healthy volunteers. The
      investigators will also assess the growth of and the immune response to P. vivax infection,
      and assess the induction of sexual gametocytaemia post-CHMI via the natural route of malaria
      infection (mosquito bite). A secondary objective is to develop a blood inoculum of P.
      vivax-infected blood for future testing of candidate vaccines.

      Two healthy, malaria-naïve adults aged between 18 and 50 years will be recruited at the
      CCVTM, Oxford. CHMI by sporozoites will be delivered by mosquito bite at Imperial College,
      London, and follow-up during the post-challenge period will be at the CCVTM in Oxford.

      The two volunteers will have blood taken at regular intervals post-CHMI to assess the immune
      response to primary P. vivax infection, and also the gametocytaemia following P. vivax
      infection, and the volunteers will be monitored closely until the volunteers meet the
      criteria for treatment. Up to 250 mL (half a unit) of blood will be taken just prior to
      treatment from the two successfully infected volunteers (as determined by measurement of the
      parasitaemia) and frozen down for future use in blood-stage CHMI trials. The volunteers will
      be treated with a standard 60-hour course of oral artemether-lumefantrine (Riamet) followed
      by a 2-week course of partially-observed oral Primaquine for radical cure of P. vivax
      hypnozoites. The volunteers will be followed up for 3 months in the clinic and email
      follow-up will continue out to 5 years to monitor for clinical relapse.

    <description>Two healthy human volunteers are exposed to the bites of five infectious mosquitoes per participant (by placing their forearms over the pot containing mosquitoes) for 5-10 minutes. Fed mosquitoes (as indicated by the presence of a blood meal in the abdomen) are individually dissected and assessed for sporozoite load (graded 0 to +4; a gland rating of +2 or more, representing 10 or more observed sporozoites, qualifies as being infectious). If, by this method the volunteer is found to have been inoculated by less than five infected mosquitoes, further mosquitoes are allowed to feed on the volunteer until a total of 5 appropriately infected mosquitoes have fed. The bite-challenge procedure continues until the subject has been bitten by 5 infectious mosquitoes.</description>

               -  Willing to be admitted to the research bay on the John Warin ward at the
                  Churchill Hospital for blood donation and clinical monitoring, until antimalarial
                  treatment is underway and their symptoms are settling.

               -  Willing to reside in Oxford for the duration of the study, until all
                  antimalarials have been completed.

               -  Answer all questions on the informed consent quiz correctly. * Female volunteers
                  are required to use an effective form of contraception during the course of the
                  study as malaria challenge could pose a serious risk to both maternal health and
                  the unborn foetus.

        Acceptable forms of contraception for female volunteers include:

          -  Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception (an
             additional form of contraception will be required when taking the antimalarial
             medication, as this can interfere with the efficacy of hormonal contraception).

          -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

          -  Total abdominal hysterectomy.

          -  Barrier methods of contraception (condom or occlusive cap with spermicide).

          -  Male sterilisation, if the vasectomised partner is the sole partner for the subject.

          -  True abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject (periodic abstinence and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
             contraception).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • History of clinical malaria (any species).

               -  Travel to a clearly malaria endemic locality during the study period or within
                  the preceding six months.

               -  Use of systemic antibiotics with known antimalarial activity within 30 days of
                  CHMI (e.g. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, tetracycline, clindamycin,
                  erythromycin, fluoroquinolones and azithromycin).

                  trait or any haematological condition that could affect susceptibility to malaria
                  infection.

               -  Venepuncture unlikely to allow a 250 mL blood donation (as determined by the
                  Investigator).

               -  Receipt of an investigational product in the 30 days preceding enrolment, or
                  planned receipt during the study period.

               -  Prior receipt of an investigational vaccine likely to impact on interpretation of
                  the trial data or the P. vivax parasite as assessed by the Investigator.

               -  Use of medications known to have a potentially clinically significant interaction
                  with Riamet and Malarone.

               -  Any clinical condition known to prolong the QT interval.

               -  History of cardiac arrhythmia, including clinically relevant bradycardia.

               -  Disturbances of electrolyte balance, e.g. hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia.

               -  Positive family history in both 1st AND 2nd degree relatives &lt; 50 years old for

               -  Any clinically significant abnormal finding on biochemistry or haematology blood
                  tests, urinalysis or clinical examination. In the event of abnormal test results,
                  confirmatory repeat tests will be requested. Procedures for identifying
                  laboratory values meeting exclusion criteria are shown in Appendix A.

               -  Any other significant disease, disorder, or finding which may significantly
                  increase the risk to the volunteer because of participation in the study, affect
                  the ability of the volunteer to participate in the study or impair interpretation
                  of the study data.

        Testing for HIV, HTLV, hepatitis B and C and syphilis will be performed at screening and
        then repeated 1 week prior to CHMI (day C-7) to ensure no new acquisition of infection
        prior to blood donation. Other infections will be screened for if the volunteer has
        recently travelled to an area where they may have been exposed to a blood-borne infection
        that could theoretically be transmitted to another healthy volunteer during a future
        blood-stage challenge.

        - Exclusion criteria on day of CHMI

        The following constitute absolute contraindications to CHMI:

          -  Acute disease, defined as moderate or severe illness with or without fever.

          -  Pregnancy.
