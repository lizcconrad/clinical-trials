  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to first identify the optimal estradiol (E2) dose that best engages the fear
      extinction network among healthy women using oral contraceptives. The second objective is to
      then evaluate the impact of this optimal E2 dose, when administered in conjunction with 5
      sessions of Prolonged Exposure therapy, on the functional activity of the fear extinction
      network of women with clinically significant posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. This
      approach will elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying effective exposure treatment for
      these symptoms, and will document how estradiol could be used as adjunct to enhance the
      outcome of extinction-based therapies.

    <textblock>
      Prolonged-exposure (PE) therapy is the treatment of choice for posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). Despite its efficacy, a significant number of individuals will not benefit from it or
      might drop out before the completion of all sessions. This underlies the importance of
      finding ways to enhance the efficacy of PE in order to improve the life quality of
      individuals suffering from PTSD. It is now widely accepted that extinction learning paradigms
      used in fundamental studies are useful laboratory analogs to PE. Studies in healthy controls
      have suggested that elevated estrogen levels benefit extinction learning by promoting its
      consolidation and thus enhancing its recall when tested later for it. This is also being
      reflected by changes in the activation of brain regions forming the fear extinction network,
      including the amygdala, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and ventromedial prefrontal
      cortex (vmPFC). It is still unknown whether estradiol (E2) administration can modulate the
      activation of the fear extinction network in oral contraceptive (OC) users and which E2 dose
      could yield the best results. The R61 phase of the current study will aim to establish which
      of two E2 doses (placebo (Plc), 2mg or 4mg) can best engage the fear extinction network in
      healthy women using OC by exposing participants to a validated fear conditioning and
      extinction protocol. Functional fMRI (BOLD signal) and psychophysiological measures (skin
      conductance responses - SCR) will be used to test the following hypotheses: 1) E2
      administration will enhance extinction recall (indexed by lower SCR) in a dose-response
      manner; 2) E2 administration will increase vmPFC and decrease dACC and amygdala activations
      during recall in a dose-response manner. Once the optimal E2 dose has been identified, the
      R33 phase will examine the impact of E2 administration (relative to Plc) in conjunction with
      5 PE sessions in OC users women having significant symptoms of PTSD. Participants will be
      exposed to the fear conditioning and extinction protocol before and after PE. BOLD signal,
      SCR as well as symptom severity will be used before and after treatment to test these
      hypotheses: 1) During extinction recall, both groups will show lower SCR at post- relative to
      pre-PE, with E2+PE group showing the strongest effect. 2) Extinction-induced activations will
      be higher in the vmPFC and lower in the dACC and amygdala in post relative to pre-PE, with
      E2+PE group showing the strongest effect. 3) Information flow between the extinction nodes
      will improve following therapy (indexed by dynamic-causal modeling), with stronger effects in
      the E2+PE group. 4) PTSD symptom severity will be lower in the E2+PE group relative to the
      Plc+PE group following treatment, as well as at the 3 and 6-month follow-up assessments. 5)
      PTSD symptom reduction will correlate with BOLD and SCR changes observed during extinction
      recall. These findings will elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying effective exposure
      treatment for fear-based symptoms, and will reveal how E2 could be an adjunct to enhance the
      efficacy of extinction-based therapies such as PE.
