    <measure>Changes from baseline in WHO Quality of Life-BREF</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, week 4, 8, 12</time_frame>
    <description>It is a international cross-culturally comparable quality of life assessment instrument. The WHOQOL-BREF instrument comprises 26 items, which measure the following broad domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. There are also two items that are examined separately: Q1 asks about an individuals overall perception of QoL and Q2 asks about an individuals overall perception of their health. The four domain scores denote an individuals perception of QoL in each particular domain. Domain scores are scaled in a positive direction (i.e. higher scores denote higher quality of life). The mean score of items within each domain is used to calculate the domain score. Meanscores are then multiplied by 4 in order to make domain scores comparable with the scores used in the WHOQOL-100.</description>
