      The overall aim of the study is to learn whether utilization of Health Surveillance
      Assistants (HSAs) for delivery of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnant
      women (IPTp) can increase coverage of three or more IPTp doses compared to IPTp delivery only
      at antenatal clinics (ANC), while at the same time improve or maintain ANC attendance. This
      will be a cluster randomized trial, including a total of 20 health facilities (HF) which will
      be randomly assigned to either the intervention (10) or non-intervention group (10); all HSAs
      affiliated with a HF will be in the same group.

      Project Background WHO recommends the use of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy
      (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to prevent the adverse effects of malaria in
      pregnancy. In 2012, in an effort to boost uptake, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated
      its policy promoting initiation of IPTp-SP as early as possible during the second trimester
      and at every scheduled antenatal clinic (ANC) visit thereafter, as long as the visits were at
      least one month apart. Despite this recommendation, progress has been slow, and no
      sub-Saharan African country has achieved the 85% coverage target set by the President's
      Malaria Initiative (PMI). Malawi was the first country to adopt IPTp-SP, and though it had
      early gains, these have remained stagnant. Coverage of 2 doses of IPTp-SP was 42.9% in 2004
      (DHS), 53.8% in 2010 (DHS), and remained only 63% as of 2014 (MIS), despite the fact that
      &gt;95% of women make 2 or more visits to the ANC, with 44% making four or more visits, and
      despite the fact that the median gestational age at the first visit is 5.6 months. Clearly, a
      novel approach to ensure earlier presentation at ANC and increase IPTp delivery is needed to
      boost coverage to the 85% target. Community delivery of IPTp has been suggested as a means to
      improve coverage, however, there is concern that this could also lead to reduced antenatal
      care (ANC) visits. Thus, it is relevant to assess whether there is a benefit of community
      delivery of IPTp-SP under the current policy advocating IPTp at each ANC visit, whether this
      approach is feasible, both from the standpoint of service delivery as well as data
      collection, and ensure that there is no adverse effect on ANC attendance prior to large scale
      roll-out.

      Study Aims Broad objective: The overall aim of the study is to learn whether utilization of
      Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) for delivery of intermittent preventive treatment of
      malaria in pregnant women (IPTp) can increase coverage of three or more IPTp doses compared
      to IPTp delivery only at antenatal clinics (ANC), while at the same time improve or maintain
      ANC attendance

      Specific objectives Primary objective

        1. Determine the effect of community-based IPTp delivery by HSAs compared with
           facility-based IPTp delivery on IPTp coverage (including 1, 2, 3, and 4 doses) and ANC
           coverage (including 1, 2, 3, and 4 visits) Secondary objectives

        2. Document the level of service delivery by HSAs

        3. Assess women's knowledge of HSAs and attitudes about receiving IPTp from a HSA

        4. Assess the feasibility of scaling-up community delivery of IPTp from the perspective of
           health facility staff, and HSAs..

        5. Assess the acceptability of community delivery of IPTp from health facility staff, HSAs,
           and women.

        6. Assess the factors which may affect the scale-up of community delivery of IPTp from the
           perspective of health facility staff, HSAs, and women.

        7. Assess incremental costs of community-based IPTp delivery compared to HF based IPTp
           delivery from both provider and household perspectives.

      Methodology Study design: This will be a cluster randomized trial, including a total of 20
      health facilities (HF) which will be randomly assigned to either the intervention (10) or
      non-intervention group (10); all HSAs affiliated with a HF will be in the same group.

      The study will use baseline and end line cross sectional household surveys, midline and
      post-intervention in-depth interviews with health facility staff and HSAs, pre- and
      post-intervention in-depth interviews with women, and focus group discussions with HSAs to
      achieve the objectives.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Pregnant women:

          -  All pregnant women residing in study catchment area are eligible to receive SP from
             HSAs, with the exception of HIV positive women.

          -  To be included in the women's question portion of the baseline and end line household
             surveys, women must be between the ages of 16-49 years, have been pregnant/delivered
             in the previous 12 months, consent to participation, and will be eligible for
             inclusion in surveys regardless of where the woman gave birth (i.e., whether at home
             or in facility). All pregnant/recently pregnant women will be included in the cross
             sectional survey, but the sample size is calculated in order to identify those who
             have completed pregnancies in the past 12 months. There were be a very short subset of
             demographic and knowledge questions which will be asked of all households during the
             baseline and endline surveys, regardless of whether there are any recently pregnant
             women in the household.

        Providers:

          -  At each facility we will randomly select one ANC provider who has had at least six
             months of work experience

          -  HSA supervisor

          -  Health facility in-charge

        HSAs:

        • All HSAs working in the study areas will be eligible; we will select at least 36 at
        random to be participate in interviews and focus groups discussions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Pregnant women: Women who experienced a delivery in the past 12 months, but are &lt;16 or &gt;49
        years will be excluded. Those who last delivered a child over twelve months ago will be
        excluded from survey questions specific to recently pregnant women, but may answer
        questions related to community perception or general demographics. For qualitative
        research, the same criteria will be used.

        Health facility providers: Those who have been working in the health service for less than
        six months will not be interviewed due to low levels of relevant experience or exposure to
        the intervention.

        HSAs: All HSAs are eligible to participate.
