  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, single arm, open-label, single institution, phase I study to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ET190L1-ARTEMIS™ T cells in patients ≥ 18 years
      of age with relapsed or refractory CD19+ Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will follow a traditional dose-escalation model to establish the MTD and
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of infused ET190L1-ARTEMIS™ T cells following
      lympho-depleting chemotherapy. Two sequential cohorts of patients will be recruited to
      fulfill this study, those in the dose escalation cohort (for determination of MTD and RP2D)
      and those in the expansion cohort (treated on the RP2D). The study will have concurrent
      phases of screening, pre-treatment, treatment, primary follow-up, safety, and survival
      follow-up. The total duration of the study involvement for the patient is 15 years. Efficacy
      will be assessed until progression and safety will be assessed throughout the full duration
      of the study. Twelve to 24 patients will be treated to determine the MTD. Following
      determination of the MTD, an expansion cohort consisting of 6 patients per disease subtype
      (n= 30) will be recruited.

             study. Women of child-bearing potential and all male participants must use effective
             methods of contraception for at least 12 months following infusion of ET190L1-ARTEMIS™
             T cells and until ET190L1-ARTEMIS™ T cells are no longer present by PCR (with

                    1. Surgical sterilization (such as a tubal ligation or hysterectomy).

                    2. Approved hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pills, patches,
                       implants, or injections).

                    4. An intrauterine device (IUD).

               2. Contraceptive measures such as Plan B, sold for emergency use after unprotected
                  sex, are not acceptable methods for routine use. If the woman does become
                  pregnant during this study or if the woman has unprotected sex, she must inform
                  the study physician immediately.

                  sex, are not acceptable methods for routine use. The man should inform his
                  partner of the potential for harm to an unborn child. She should know that if
                  pregnancy occurs, he will need to report it to the study doctor, and she should
                  promptly notify her doctor.
