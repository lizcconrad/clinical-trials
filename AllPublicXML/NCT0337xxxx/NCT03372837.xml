      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of SyB L-0501 in combination with
      rituximab in patients with recurrent/relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective is to determine the efficacy, as measured by overall response rate on the
      basis of Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, of SyB L-0501 at 120 mg/m^2/day on
      Day 2 and Day 3 in combination with rituximab at 375 mg/m^2 on day 1 of each 21-day cycle in
      patients with recurrent/relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
