    <textblock>
      Background:

      The adrenal gland makes the hormone aldosterone. This helps regulate blood pressure. An
      adrenal gland tumor that makes too much aldosterone can cause high blood pressure and low
      potassium. The cause of these tumors is unknown, but sometimes they are inherited.

      Objective:

      To study the genes that may cause primary aldosteronism in Black individuals.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18-70 who:

      Are Black, African American, or of Caribbean descent

      And have difficult to control blood pressure or primary aldosteronism

      Relatives of people with primary aldosteronism

      Design:

      Participants who are relatives of people with primary aldosteronism will have only 1 visit,
      with medical history and blood tests.

      Participants with primary aldosteronism or difficult to control blood pressure (suspected to
      possibly have primary aldosteronism) will be screened with a 1 2 hour visit. If they qualify,
      they will return for a hospital stay for 7 10 days. Tests may include:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood tests: Participants will have a small tube (IV catheter) inserted in a vein in the arm.
      They may drink a glucose-containing liquid or get a salt solution. If medically indicated,
      they may have invasive blood tests with a separate consent.

      Urine tests: Some require a high-salt diet for 3 days.

      Heart tests

      Scans: Participants lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body. A dye may be injected
      through a vein.

      Small hair sample taken from near the scalp.

      Kidney ultrasound

      Bone density scan: Participants lie on a table while a camera passes over the body.

      If the doctors feel it is medically necessary, they will offer participants treatment
      depending on their results. These treatments may cure the patient of their disease and may
      include:

        1. &lt;TAB&gt;Having one adrenal gland removed by the Endocrine surgeon under anesthesia.
           Patients will have follow-up visits 2 4 weeks after surgery.

        2. &lt;TAB&gt;Taking drugs to block the effects of aldosterone

      Participants may return about 1 year later to repeat testing.

    <textblock>
      Primary Aldosteronism (PA) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension, accounting for
      6-8% of hypertension and 14-25% of resistant hypertension. This prevalence translates to
      approximately 1 in 30-50 adults or about 4,000,000 Americans with PA. Until recently, the
      deleterious effects of PA were thought to derive solely from aldosterone-mediated sodium
      retention and associated blood pressure rise. However, animal studies and clinical trials
      demonstrate that mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blockade has cardio- and reno-protective
      effects that clearly exceed those expected from blood pressure reduction alone. Growing
      evidence supports the concept that excess aldosterone, in the presence of elevated blood
      pressure, initiates a cascade characterized by fibrosis, oxidative stress, and activation of
      pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways, leading to morbidity via worsened insulin
      sensitivity, impaired bone formation, and accelerated cardiovascular remodeling. Recent
      studies have identified several new genetic underpinnings of PA, both germline and somatic,
      including mutations in KCNJ5, ATP1A1, ATP2B3, CACNA1D, and ARMC5. As the effects of chronic
      hyperaldosteronism differ between races, it is not surprising that the relative prevalence of
      these mutations differs among cohorts. African Americans (AA) in particular have increased
      susceptibility to end-organ damage from aldosterone excess-induced cardiovascular remodeling.
      They are more likely to have congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and
      atherosclerotic events than age-matched Caucasians. However, to date no comprehensive
      analysis of mutations in PA has been performed in AA. (Note: for the purposes of this
      protocol, the terms Black or African American incorporate individuals who self-identify as
      Black, African American, or the Caribbean diaspora).

      The aims of this study are to identify the germline and/or somatic mutations causing PA in
      AA, define the effects of these mutations on aldosterone production in AA, and to identify
      effective pharmacologic agents that will inhibit inappropriate aldosterone production in
      target cells. Aldosterone producing adenoma (APA) and other adrenocortical tumor (ACT)
      specimens will be gathered from archival (collected under protocol 00-CH-160 and other
      related NIH studies) and prospective research subjects with PA that will be evaluated at the
      NIH Clinical Research Center under the proposed protocol. Samples will be analyzed using
      state-of-the-art next-generation sequencing (NGS). Human adrenal cell lines (H295R and
      others, as appropriate) will be used to study the mutations effect on aldosterone production.
      Additionally, this will help identify possible effective pharmacologic therapeutics to treat
      PA. Animal models of novel genetic causes of PA may also be created to study the molecular
      mechanisms underpinning the disease.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Inclusion criteria for main study:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18y.

          -  Self-described Black race. Those with reported other racial backgrounds may enroll in
             protocol 00-CH-0160 instead.

          -  Evidence supportive of the diagnosis of PA (e.g. HTN, hypokalemia, known adrenal
             nodule, elevated ARR, etc).

          -  Willing and able to return to the NIH for follow-up evaluation.

        Inclusion criteria for blood (peripheral) DNA only study:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 7y.

          -  Relative of a patient that participates in the main study (above) (i) with family
             history of hypertension, ACTs, or both, or (ii) with a genetic mutation identified in
             the course of the genetic investigations described in the main study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Exclusion criteria for main study:

          -  Individuals over the age of 70 years will be excluded because of the possibility of
             comorbidities that may significantly affect appropriate initial work-up and
             post-operative management. In addition, research data may be compromised by the
             inability to interpret data collected from patients over the age of 70 years that may
             be on multiple medications for a variety for reasons.

          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing will be excluded for safety concerns with
             hyperaldosteronism workup.

          -  Individuals whose medical status will not allow them, for safety reasons, to
             participate in the provocative testing (e.g. NYHA Class III or IV heart failure, or
             CKD Stage 3b or worse), or who in the opinion of the investigators have unacceptably
             high risk for surgical morbidity and mortality (e.g. Revised Cardiac Risk Index Class
             IV or above, or American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Class 3 or
             above) will be excluded from the protocol, as they will not be able to participate
             profitably in the research aspects of this protocol.

          -  Individuals who have current substance abuse or a psychiatric disorder or any other
             condition that in the opinion of the investigators would impede competence,
             compliance, or participation in the study.

          -  Individuals found to have a known inherited syndrome as the cause for hormone
             over-secretion will be excluded from participation in this protocol, as the mechanisms
             of hormone over-secretion and tumorigenesis is likely to be distinct in these
             individuals. Specific examples of syndromes that may be excluded from this protocol
             include individuals with Carney complex, McCune-Albright syndrome, and MEN-1. If
             inquiries are received from such patients, they will be referred to the appropriate
             ongoing protocols, if possible.

          -  Family members who end up being diagnosed with PA will be referred to the 00-CH-0160
             protocol, to avoid selection bias in genetic mutation analyses for PA.

          -  Patients unwilling or unable to abide by procedures of the protocol.

        &lt;TAB&gt;

        Exclusion criteria for the DNA only study:

        -Patients unwilling or unable to provide peripheral blood for DNA studies.
