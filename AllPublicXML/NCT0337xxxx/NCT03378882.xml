    <textblock>
      Hospitals in the French West Indies (Fort-de-France (Martinique); Basse-Terre and
      Pointe-à-Pitre (Guadeloupe); and French Guiana (Cayenne, Saint-Laurent du Maroni)) have noted
      the emergence of eosinophilic meningitis cases in recent years. This finding is part os
      eosinophilic meningitis cases emergence and meningoencephalitis caused by the parasite
      Angiostrongylus cantonensis on the American continent and in the Greater Antilles.

      In 2013, the investigation of an eosinophilic meningitis case by the Basse-Terre hospital
      team with a positive specific PCR in the CSF (CDC, Atlanta, USA) showed the first case of
      neuromeningeal angiostrongylosis in Guadeloupe. A similar case was diagnosed by serology at
      Pointe-à-Pitre University Hospital a few years earlier without having been published, and
      another serious case diagnosed also at Pointe-à-Pitre University Hospital Center in January
      2017. The team at the Martinique University Hospital Center also reported several cases of
      eosinophilic meningitis with positive serologies for A. cantonensis carried out in
      laboratories outside Martinique (Laboratory of Parasitology, Gonesse, France; Thailand; and
      Tropical Institute and Public Health, Switzerland) in recent years.

      The emergence of this parasitosis is related to the introduction of the intermediate host
      Achatina fulica on the American continent and the geographical evolution of the
      angiostrongylosis cases is intrinsically linked to that of the Achatins. To date, only two
      studies report the environmental presence of Angiostrongylus cantonensis in the Lesser
      Antilles. One proved the presence in rats (23.4%) on the island of Grenada, and the other in
      Guadeloupe, showing that 32.4% of Achatina fulica collected carried the parasite by specific
      PCR. In Martinique, where the number of cases is increasing, and in French Guiana, where
      there is an increase in the number of cases in neighboring countries, especially Brazil, no
      study has been conducted on this parasite.

      In parallel with this finding, several serious digestive tables associated with strong
      hypereosinophilia were reported in Martinique and Guadeloupe in the 90s but also in recent
      years, the last case in December 2016. Etiological diagnoses were established by the
      discovery of Angiostrongylus costaricensis parasite in ileal pathological specimens. However,
      these cases could never be investigated by serology or specific PCR due to lack of diagnostic
      tools available in the French West Indies and Guiana region, and more broadly in metropolitan
      France.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Angiostrongylosis is a parasitosis caused by the nematode Angiostrongylus sp. The adult
      parasite lives in the rat's arteries (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus), its definitive
      host, where it breeds. Stage 1 immature larvae are released into the environment in rat
      droppings. Stage 3 larval maturation, which is essential for the re-contamination of final
      hosts, is mainly carried out in the Buyina fulica mollusc (common name: Achatine).

      The mode of contamination in humans is by ingestion of stage 3 parasitic larvae according to
      various modes: accidental ingestion of molluscs or salads soiled by &quot;molluscan slime&quot;
      (example: by consumption of salad, vegetables, non-washed fruits), voluntary ingestion of
      molluscs, manipulation of molluscs (children or fishermen), use of drinking water drawn from
      natural and non-disinfected water bodies. Hand-carried transmission after handling of
      Achatines is most often reported in young children.

      In humans, these larvae have a different preferential tropism depending on the species of
      Angiostrongylus. The two main pathogenic species for humans are Angiostrongylus cantonensis
      and Angiostrongylus costaricensis.

      Angiostrongylus cantonensis:

      After ingestion by man, the larvae of Angiostrongylus cantonensis migrate to the central
      nervous system. They cause eosinophilic angiostrongyl meningitis and meningoencephalitis,
      which can lead to severe neurological sequelae (paralysis) or even death.

      These clinical features are associated with eosinophilic pleocytosis in CSF (eosinophilic
      meningitis) and blood eosinophilia.

      Angiostrongylus cantonensis was first described in Canton, China in 1935. To date, it is
      present in the Pacific Islands, Australia, Africa and recently on the American continent.

      Angiostrongylus costaricensis:

      After ingestion, the larvae of Angiostrongylus costaricensis migrate intestines and into the
      abdominal cavity. They cause severe abdominal pain mimicking those of appendicitis,
      haemorrhage and perforation digestive that can lead to death (2 to 8% of cases).

      A major eosinophilia usually accompanies these unspecific clinical pictures. Angiostrongylus
      costaricensis does not have the same geographical distribution as Angiostrongylus
      cantonensis. It was first described in Costa Rica in 1967 and is endemic on the American
      continent, where it is at the origin of many human cases.
