  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the use of conventional radiotherapy technique with volumetric
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (VMAT) in the treatment of painful cancer metastases. Half
      of the patients will receive radiotherapy using a conventional technique, while the other
      half will receive their treatment using a the VMAT technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy to painful sites of metastasis can provide pain relief.

      Side-effects from radiotherapy is dependent on the volume and dose received by normal
      tissues. Conventional radiotherapy techniques delivers similar doses of radiation to the
      targeted cancer lesion and the normal tissues along the entrance and exit paths of the
      radiation.

      Volumetric intensity-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is an advanced technique of radiotherapy
      that spares normal tissues from receiving high-dose irradiation. However, VMAT increases the
      volume of normal tissues receiving low-dose irradiation.

      This study aims at comparing the quality of life and side-effect profiles of patients treated
      by palliative radiotherapy using the conventional technique vs. VMAT.
