  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter related infections (CRIs) were found to be associated with several risk factors,
      including patient related risk factors such as age, gender, clinical status and catheter
      related risk factors such as the vascular access location, dwelling time, catheter type and
      number of lumens. In addition to the inserted solution type and the experience of the
      professional who performs the procedure ,These factors constitute important strategic points
      for actions to compare the infectious complications of peripheral versus central venous
      catheters in critically ill patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nosocomial (hospital-acquired) bloodstream infections (BSIs) are an important cause of
      morbidity and mortality, with an estimated 250,000 cases occurring each year in the United
      States.

      BSIs may be either primary or secondary. Secondary infections are related to infections at
      other sites, such as the urinary tract, lung, postoperative wounds, and skin. Most nosocomial
      BSIs are primary, as illustrated by the United States Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention's National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system, in which 64 percent of the
      nosocomial BSIs reported were primary BSIs. While some primary BSIs have no identifiable
      source, most are associated with intravascular catheters, and central venous catheters (CVCs)
      in particular.

      Critically ill patients require intravenous administration of fluids and drugs.This can be
      achieved via peripheral or central catheters. Each device is associated with both mechanical
      and infectious complications. Complications associated with central lines are judged to be
      more severe. Some patients actually require the insertion of a central line due to the venous
      toxicity of the drugs or to the necessity of making sure that the infusion is regularly
      administered (example: high dose catecholamine infusion). Some physicians believe that most
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients should have a central venous line inserted, whereas others
      feel that some patients may receive active drugs via a peripheral line in selected instances.

      Endpoints are the rate of mechanical complications (difficulty in inserting the line, need
      for repeat insertion attempts, occurrence of arterial puncture, occurrence of pneumothorax)
      and of infectious complications (local catheter infection or catheter-related bloodstream
      infection).
