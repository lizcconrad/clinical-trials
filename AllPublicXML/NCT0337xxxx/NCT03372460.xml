  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of combining non-invasive brain stimulation, called
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), with virtual reality exposure as a treatment
      for Veterans with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Investigators will test
      whether this intervention improves PTSD symptoms and improves quality of life. Results from
      this study may be used to develop a new non-medication approach to treating chronic PTSD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is highly prevalent in Veterans and is associated with significant psychiatric and
      medical comorbidity, as well as poor quality of life. Despite its prevalence and impact, the
      success of currently available treatments is mixed, highlighting the need for novel
      approaches that aim to reduce symptoms and improve outcomes. Prior research has demonstrated
      that reduced activity in a part of the brain, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), is
      associated with an inability to regulate fear responses, preventing the generation of safety
      memories and allowing PTSD symptoms to persist. Targeting the VMPFC with non-invasive
      electrical brain stimulation may therefore alleviate these symptoms.

      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a type of non-invasive brain stimulation
      that may enhance the likelihood of neuronal activity in the VMPFC. In doing so, tDCS prepares
      the brain to respond to external stimuli and to facilitate learning and memory. Because
      therapeutic success from exposure to trauma-related content - as used in exposure-based
      therapy for PTSD - is thought to be based on an adaptive learning process, applying tDCS in
      combination with exposure to trauma cues may effectively boost exposure-based learning. To do
      this, investigators at the Providence VA Medical Center will use a standardized virtual
      reality (VR) setting to deliver trauma-related content. The virtual reality setting involves
      three, 8-minute driving scenarios, which consist of VR stimuli (sights, sounds, smells, etc.)
      often encountered in combat training and in theater.

      Eligible participants will be randomized to receive six sessions of either active tDCS plus
      virtual reality (tDCS+VR) or sham tDCS+VR. Clinical and self-report assessments will be
      completed at baseline, midpoint, and endpoint, as well as 1 and 3 months following the final
      tDCS+VR session. Participants will also undergo a MRI before and after completion of all six
      tDCS+VR sessions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Average 2.5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD. Items are rated on how much the symptom bothered the respondent in the past month (0 = &quot;not at all bothered by&quot; to 4 = &quot;extremely bothered &quot;). A total symptom severity score (range: 0-80) can be obtained by summing the scores for each of the 20 items, with higher scores indicating more severe PTSD symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Average 2.5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 16-item QLESQ (short form) evaluates quality of life and other areas of change related to functioning outside of symptom domains (e.g., physical health, mood, leisure time activities, social relationships, etc.). Items are rated on how satisfied the respondent has been in the past week (1 = &quot;very poor&quot; to 5 = &quot;very good &quot;). A total raw score (range: 14-70). The raw total score is transformed into a percentage maximum possible score using the following formula: (raw total score minimum score)/(maximum possible raw score minimum score). Higher outcomes indicate better quality of life, greater enjoyment, and satisfaction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychophysiology (Skin Conductance Reactivity; SCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Average 2.5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Psychophysiology will include skin conductance reactivity to specific trauma context virtual reality (VR) cues presented in the VR scenario. SCR to VR events will be measured by the phasic responses that occur after the presentation of discreet VR events. SCR will be compared from baseline to endpoint, to correlate these measures and evaluate changes attributable to active tDCS+VR compared to sham.</description>
