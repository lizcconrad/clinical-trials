  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the efficacy of three-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) compared
      to three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) imaging. This proposed study is a prospective,
      unrandomized, single-blinded, self-controlled, and single-armed diagnostic radiological
      evaluation study.

    <measure>Differences in glenoid erosion and version measurements between of 3D CT and 3D MR</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) Paired sample t-test to compare measurements by model and ANOVA to assess differences among modalities. Patients will have both 3D CT and 3D MR scheduled on the same day. MRI 3D Post-processing: The water-only source images from the Dixon sequence were post-processed using standard subtraction software on a syngo MMWP workstation (VB 3oE, Siemens). The 3D MRI glenoid version is measured by the two observers with the same method used for CT 3D glenoid version measurement following generating a new 2D axial MR images form the 3D MRI model using the three-point method.</description>

    <description>MRI is performed using 3T scanners with a dedicated 16-channel shoulder array coils. The MRI sequences include 3-mm slice thickness and 0.5-mm gap width with a field of view of 14 or 15 cm. There were 6 diagnostic sequences with axial, coronal, and sagittal proton density weighting as well as coronal T2 with frequency selective fat suppression and sagittal T1 images.</description>

    <description>The CT protocol consists of 3-mm axial images of the glenoid reconstructed into 1-mm sagittal and coronal 2D reconstructions using the following parameters: 120 kV, 280 mA, and pitch of 0.9. The CT data were also used to produce a 3D reconstruction of each glenoid.</description>
