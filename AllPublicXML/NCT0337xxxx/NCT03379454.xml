  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An observational, non-interventional registry study to collect real-world data from people
      living with melanoma and its treatment, which will be available to researchers to further the
      knowledge of melanoma and improve patient care.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The registry uses Vitaccess' MyRealWorld(tm) digital real-world evidence platform, and has
      been developed in collaboration with the patient advocacy group Melanoma UK.

      Eligible participants install a study app on their smartphone or tablet. Researchers access
      aggregated, anonymised data via a cloud-based research portal.

      The platform provides benefits to participants, which it is hoped will encourage persistence
      with data submission; these include options to upload electronic documents such as scans, and
      access an online melanoma community.

      The aggregated data are available in close to real time via &quot;dashboards&quot; and can be analysed
      according to a number of pre-set criteria (e.g. disease stage, age, geographic location).

      State-of-the-art technologies and security policies are used in the platform to ensure
      industry-standard data storage and privacy for all users. Participants' personally
      identifiable information will remain confidential at all times, and researchers will not be
      able to identify individuals.
