      This is an open-label clinical trial to determine the safety of rTMS and efficacy in
      improving depression symptoms, quality of life and cognition deficits among patients with
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative disorders.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the role of repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) for symptom reduction of depression and cognitive loss among patients with
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and other Neurodegenerative Diseases. Behavioral symptoms
      in ALS have been under scrutiny since its earliest descriptions, nearly 30 years ago (1). The
      importance of these symptoms among subjects with ALS has been also been under steady
      scrutiny. Studies have shown that the rates of anxiety and depression are significantly
      higher among subjects with ALS than the general population (1-23). Anxiety symptoms are
      related to depression, quality of life, and satisfaction with life (4, 9, 11, 15, 20, 24-26).
      Depressive symptoms are closely related to the ALS disease process (2).

      rTMS has been shown to be a promising tool in modulating mood, memory, and cognitive
      performance (27). Current approaches to the management of ALS involve addressing
      symptomatology associated with the disease process. Among patients with ALS and other similar
      Neurodegenerative disorders, it is therefore important to understand if rTMS as an
      intervention is capable of:

        1. Symptomatic improvement in mood,

        2. Causing a significant positive change in disease progression or

        3. Helping improve quality of life.

    <description>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive procedure used to stimulate small regions of the brain. It is a FDA approved for treatment resistant depression (K061053). We hypothesize that stimulation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) will be safe and effective in patients with ALS and other Neurodegenerative disorders. We will follow the FDA rTMS guidance for industry guidelines. All adverse events from all 15 patients enrolled in the study as assessed by the CTCAE v4.0, and as well, any occurrence of any new seizure in 2 or more patients, as reviewed and assessed by PI and medical monitor.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To understand the impact of rTMS in addressing the mood symptoms associated with ALS.</measure>
    <time_frame>recorded once a week for the 4 week duration of the study.</time_frame>
    <description>rTMS is known to ameliorate depressive symptoms in patients with treatment resistant depression. It may also ameliorate depressive symptoms in subjects with ALS. This is measured using MQOL (Montreal Quality of life scale). This is a patient-reported instrument designed to assess overall well-being over a two day time scale. this single item scale is scored from 0-10 with higher score representing higher quality of life ratings. percent change from baseline to study completion will be measured to assess the efficacy of rtms in improving overall quality of life.</description>
