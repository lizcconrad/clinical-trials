  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The world prevalence of obesity in adult population in 2014 was nearly 13% while in
      Indonesia, it has reached 32.9% in the same year. Obesity is an established risk factors for
      cardiovascular diseases. A large proportion of people who had succeeded to reduce body weight
      failed to maintain it (weight cycling). Studies were inconclusive about the best composition
      in the diet for such people to have a better life quality and reduce risk factors from
      non-communicable disease. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the body composition
      changes, Inflammation marker and oxidative stress marker changes resulted from low calorie
      high protein and standard protein diet programme in obese people with history of weight
      cycling.

      This is an open-randomized clinical trial of weight loss program as a part of a larger study
      researching the effect of low calorie high protein diet to body composition, oxidative
      stress, inflammation marker and metabolic syndrome in obese with weight cycling. Subjects
      were assigned to low calorie diet and were randomly distributed into two intervention groups,
      namely high protein group (22-30 % of total calories intake) and standard protein group
      (12-20%). Anthropometry, body composition data, and blood sample (for inflammation marker
      (HsCRP) and oxidative stress (malondialdehyde and glutathione)) were taken at baseline and at
      the end of the study. Subjects were followed up to 8 weeks with daily reminder and weekly
      counselling

    <description>Subjects were given nutrition consultation, diet recipes, and logbook. Counseling was performed once weekly. During 8 weeks of diet program, subjects were instructed to reduce their daily caloric intake by 500 - 1000 kcal from their previous usual daily intake with limitation in low calorie diet range (800-1500 kcal.day) of calorie intake.Follow-up for each subject was performed once daily by person-to-person encounter. Besides, subjects were contacted by everyday cellphone texting and telephone twice a week to control subject's compliance. After 8 weeks of intervention, subjects were invited to revisit the clinic for anthropometry and body composition measurement after completing the program.</description>
