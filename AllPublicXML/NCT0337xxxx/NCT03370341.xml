      This study investigates whether Introspective Accuracy (IA) can be improved in individuals
      with schizophrenia by stimulating the brain via transcranial Direct Current Stimulation
      (tDCS).

      Self-awareness is markedly impaired in severe mental illness including schizophrenia and
      schizoaffective disorder. This impairment spans awareness of symptoms as well as deficits in
      the estimation of abilities and capabilities, which we refer to as introspective accuracy
      (IA). Recent work has provided evidence of IA deficits in schizophrenia spectrum disorders,
      specifically in the abilities to retrospectively judge everyday functioning and
      neurocognitive impairment, as well as the ability to make correct real-time judgments of
      performance on neurocognitive tests.

      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a form of noninvasive neurostimulation
      which has been proposed as a therapeutic procedure in numerous psychiatric disorders. TDCS in
      healthy adults has been demonstrated to improve cognitive and memory performance, and in
      schizophrenia, tDCS has been found to improve emotion recognition ability. TDCS thus appears
      to be a promising therapeutic technique that may be useful for improving IA. This study will
      compare IA performance in individuals with schizophrenia across two conditions: active anodal
      tDCS and sham tDCS.
