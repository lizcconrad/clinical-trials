  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the whole body vibration exercise
      on cortical activity and gait function in patients with chronic stroke.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whole body vibration exercise can provide proper somatosensory stimulation and improve muscle
      strength and postural control in stroke patients. However, there has not yet been a report on
      the cortical activity changes induced by whole body vibration exercise.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. One group will go through whole
      body vibration with exercise and the other will only perform exercise. The primary outcome
      measurement of this study was cerebral cortex activity based on changes in oxygenated
      hemoglobin concentration using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Behavioral assessments
      were performed before and after the intervention session using the 10-meter walk test, timed
      up and go test, Fugl-Meyer Assessment, and Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment.

    <intervention_model_description>Eligible patients were randomly assigned to one of the two groups in a 1:1 ratio using an odd or even random numbers table. Whole body vibration group performed a single session of whole body vibration exercise via a vibrating platform (Galileo® Advanced Plus, Novotec Medical, Pforzheim, Germany) with a magnitude of 20 Hz and an amplitude of 4 mm. The control group performed the same session without vibration.</intervention_model_description>
