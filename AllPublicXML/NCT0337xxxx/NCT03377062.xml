  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A CVA occurs when there is a sudden interruption of blood supply to the brain. Fast
      identification of CVA is crucial in order to refer the patient to an appropriate medical
      center as well as to direct him/her to a suitable treatment upon arrival to the Medical
      Center, in order to minimize the permanent damage to the brain. In this study, we are
      evaluating a tool for detecting CVA based on EEG (electroencephalograph) data analysis using
      innovative algorithm. The system is comprised of four electrodes, reference electrode and
      earphones for auditory stimulation. In the study, 120 patients arriving to the emergency room
      with decreased consciousness, severe headaches or dizziness will be monitored for five-minute
      each, with EEG accompanied with auditory stimulation. The EEG analysis will be performed
      based on the synchronization of the front and back hemispheres. During CVA, specific
      hemisphere is damaged, therefore desynchronization is expected. The purpose of this study is
      to develop a tool for identifying CVA in patients who have no clear CVA related signs.
