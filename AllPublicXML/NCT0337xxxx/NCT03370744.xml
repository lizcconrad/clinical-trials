      To establish models of normal and pathological cognitive aging.To collect the longitudinal
      data of SCD population, to study the dynamic changes of brain networks so as to explore the
      progressive mechanisms of AD on brain networks and to construct a high-precision multi-modal

      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, which severely injures
      multiple domains of cognitive functions in the aging people, bringing heavy burden to the
      society and families. Studying the cognitive brain damage mechanism of subjective cognitive
      decline (SCD), the preclinical stage of AD, would provide great opportunities for
      understanding the pathogenesis of AD and clinical value for early diagnosis and intervention
      in AD. The project intends to utilize amyloid-PET for screening and then employ the
      comprehensive neuropsychological examination combined with multi-modal neuroimaging
      techniques to study the brain functions and structures of the normal aging and SCD. The
      imaging data would be analyzed from several levels, including the cognitive dimensions, brain
      activation patterns, and especially functional and structural networks to establish the
      models of normal and pathological cognitive aging, which mainly be modulated by
      frontal-parietal control system. We aim to establish models of normal and pathological
      cognitive aging. Furthermore, the longitudinal data of SCD population would be collected to
      study the dynamic changes of brain networks so as to explore the progressive mechanisms of AD
      on brain networks and to construct a high-precision multi-modal model for early diagnosis

    <description>Using multimodal brain imaging methods, including structure magnetic resonance Imaging (sMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional (rfMRI) and task function MRI (tfMRI), based on brain structure, gray matter morphology, brain function activation model, and functional connectivity to establish normal aging model and pathological aging model of SCD. At the same time to compare the dynamic alteration of brain network between normal aging, SCD, MCI and AD dementia patients result from conversion, combining with objective cognitive performance, to improve the brain network of normal aging model and pathological aging model.</description>
