    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe haemophilia A (&lt;1% FVIII:C) according to medical history

          2. Male patients aged 1 to &lt;12 years

          3. Previous treatment with a FVIII concentrate for at least 50 exposure days (EDs)

          4. Immunocompetence (CD4+ count &gt;200/μL)

          5. Voluntarily given, fully informed written and signed consent obtained by the patient's
             parent(s) or legal guardian and, depending on the children's developmental stage and
             intellectual capacity, informed assent by the patients before any study-related
             procedures are performed

        The interval between the Screening Visit and the PK Visit should not exceed 30 days. If the
        30-day interval is exceeded, determination of the CD4+ count is to be repeated and must be
        &gt;200/μL for patients to be enrolled (i.e., inclusion criterion no. 4).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any coagulation disorders other than haemophilia A

          2. History of FVIII inhibitor activity (≥0.6 BU) or detectable FVIII inhibitory
             antibodies (≥0.6 BU using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay) at
             screening, as determined by the central laboratory

          3. Severe liver or kidney diseases (alanine aminotransferase [ALAT] and aspartate
             transaminase [ASAT] levels &gt;5 times of upper limit of normal, creatinine &gt;120 μmol/L)

          4. Patients receiving or scheduled to receive immunomodulating drugs (other than
             antiretroviral chemotherapy), such as alpha-interferon, prednisone (equivalent to &gt;10
             mg/day), or similar drugs
