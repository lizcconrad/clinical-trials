  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is related to host genetics, constitution of the dental biofilm and
      environmental factors such as smoking. DNA methylation is a mechanism of genetic expression
      that can inhibit or silence gene expression. In this way several researchers have been
      dedicated to study the genetic influence on the susceptibility and / or increased risk to
      periodontal disease. Studies have reported association between several epigenetic biomarkers
      with periodontal inflammation. Considering the hypothesis that there is an association
      between smoking and methylation in genes related to periodontal disease, the objective of
      this study was to verify the DNA methylation pattern in oral epithelial cells of patients
      with chronic periodontitis (CP) in the promoter of a specific gene involved in the control of
      inflammation, as suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 1 in smokers and nonsmokers
      patients.

      This was an experimental type study with parallel controls, comparing two groups, a group
      with consumption of 10 minimum cigarettes per day, with a diagnosis of chronic periodontitis.
      And another control group were non-smokers with chronic periodontitis. For this, genomic DNA
      was purified from oral epithelial cells obtained by rinsing with 3% sucrose, for a single
      time of collection, patients received periodontal treatment after collection and data
      analysis. The DNA was modified by Sodium bisulfite and the methylation patterns of the DNA
      were analyzed with the MSPCR technique (Polymerase chain reaction). This study was approved
      by the Institutional Review Board of the School of Dentistry of Ribeirão Preto
      (CAAE:57171816.2.0000.5419 ), and all patients need to provide written informed consent.

    <description>Epithelial cells were collected after mouthwash with 5ml dextrose autoclaved 3% and stored under refrigeration at -20ºC. After collection, the samples were taken to the Epigenetics and Reproduction Laboratory of the Department of Genetics of the Medical School of Ribeirão Preto-USP (FMRP-USP) where nucleic acid extraction and molecular analysis were performed.
After thawing the saliva, 2ml of each sample collected were transferred separately to eppendorf tubes, for processing. The material was then diluted in 50 μl of cobalt Mili-Q water, incubated at 37 ° C in a water bath for 1 hour and stored in a freezer at -20 ° C. At the end, DNA quality, purity and integrity were measured using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 2000-Thermo Scientific), using OD 260/280 and 260/230. Considering ideal values for both reasons, between 1.8 and 2.2.</description>
