  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In case of respiratory distress, patients are intubated to be connected to an artificial
      respirator to ensure gas exchanges. Before any ventilatory weaning, a breathing test in
      spontaneous ventilation under artificial nose is practiced. The patient keeps the
      endotracheal tube but is no longer assisted by the ventilator. Mortality is markedly
      increased with the prolongation of the weaning period. Despite the presence of all weaning
      criteria and the success of a breathing test in spontaneous ventilation under artificial
      nose, failure of extubation occurs in 20% of patients.

      Experimental application of an additional inspiratory load in awake healthy subjects causes a
      compensatory increase in respiratory work to maintain effective ventilation, and the subject
      does not develop hypoventilation. This respiratory drive to breathe has been demonstrated by
      quantified electroencephalography in inspiratory load tests in the form of pre-inspiratory
      negative deflections of low amplitude similar to the potential described during the
      preparation of the voluntary movement of a limb. These inspiratory pre-motor potentials begin
      about 2.5 seconds before the start of a movement in the additional motor area.

      Does the simple and noninvasive analysis of inspiratory cortical control during the
      spontaneous ventilation breath test under artificial nose predict the outcome of this test as
      well as weaning at 7 days?
