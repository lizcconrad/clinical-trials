      Primary Objective:

      To assess in overweight to obese subjects the change in sleep energy expenditure after
      repeated subcutaneous (SC) doses of SAR425899.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the change in resting, basal and total daily energy expenditure.

        -  To assess the change in respiratory quotient, fat, protein and carbohydrate oxidation.

        -  To assess the change in body composition and core temperature.

        -  To assess the pharmacodynamic effects on fasting plasma glucose, biomarkers of lipid
           metabolism and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetic parameters for SAR425899 after repeated SC doses.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability.

          -  Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≤6.5%.

          -  Obesity associated mild concomitant diseases allowed (eg, mild hypertension, mild
             hypercholesteremia, and hyperlipidemia).

          -  No concomitant medication allowed except stable treatment with statins or
             antihypertensive drugs (except ß-blocker).

          -  Females should be either postmenopausal, or, if perimenopausal should have a normal

             monophasic oral contraceptive.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Elevated liver enzymes, lipase, amylase, or calcitonin at screening.

          -  Current participation in an organized diet / weight reduction program or clinical
             trial of weight control or weight loss attempt, plans for major changes in physical
             activities or significant change in body weight in the 2 months prior to screening.

          -  Any condition possibly affecting gastric emptying or absorption from gastro-intestinal
             tract (eg, gastric surgery, gastrectomy, bariatric surgery, malabsorption syndromes,
             gastroparesis, abdominal surgery other than appendectomy or hysterectomy.
