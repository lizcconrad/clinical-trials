  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single arm, phase II trial, of 45 patients with locally advanced pancreatic
      ductal adenocarcinoma. The efficacy of the novel drug and mitochondrial inhibitor, CPI-613,
      in conjunction with standard-of-care FOLFRINOX, as a first-line therapy will be evaluated.
      Pre-treatment, diagnostic biopsy tissue will be collected when available, and clinical data
      will be evaluated to determine if the combination results in improved overall survival
      compared to historical experience.

      Primary Objective:

      1) To determine if CPI-613 increases overall survival (OS) when used in combination with
      mFOLFIRINOX, in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

      Secondary (Exploratory) Objectives:

        1. To assess the safety of CPI-613 + mFOLFIRINOX combination in patients with locally
           advanced pancreatic cancer.

        2. To collect tissue specimens for future correlative studies

        3. To estimate median progression free survival (PFS) when CPI- 613 is used in combination
           with mFOLFIRINOX, in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

        4. To estimate the percent resected when CPI-613 is used in combination with mFOLFIRINOX in
           patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer
