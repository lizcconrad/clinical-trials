  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacillus species are ubiquitous gram-positive spore-forming organisms. They rarely cause
      disease in the immunocompetent and are more frequently isolated as a culture contaminant.
      However, Bacillus Species can cause severe systemic infections in immunocompromised patients
      including preterm infants.

      The purpose of this study is to identify the risk factors of these infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-anthrax Bacillus Species bacteria can be responsible for food poisoning and local
      infections. Rarely, they lead to severe infections like blood stream infections and
      meningitis especially in immunocompromised patients like preterm infants.

      Bacillus Cereus is the most common members of the genus Bacillus. Only few reports studied
      these systemic infections in premature neonates. In order to identify the risk factors for
      severe Bacillus Species infections, we studied retrospectively eleven cases of these
      infections in our NICU and reviewed series and report cases in literature.
