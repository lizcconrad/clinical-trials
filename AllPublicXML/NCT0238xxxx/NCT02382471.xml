      The aim of this study is the comparison between the effects of supplementation with omega 3
      or placebo for 8 weeks in serum level of BDNF، Follistatin، Irisin in patients with
      cardiovascular disease. In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial, placebo-controlled,
      single-center, and phase two trials, 42men aged 45-65 years with Coronary Artery Disease are
      enrolled in the study from Tehran Heart Center. After signing informed consent all
      individuals complete a general information form , 24-hour food recall for 3 days will be
      taken from the participants at the beginning and the end of the study,. Selected samples are
      randomly classified into 2 blocks of groups receiving supplement and placebo. The supplement
      group, will receive 4 g/day omega 3 fatty acid for 8 weeks and the placebo group will also
      receive placebo (containing 4 g of edible paraffin) (similar in terms of color, shape and
      size). Patients are recommended to sustain their diets and medication dose (s) during the
      study and also advised to maintain a constant level of physical activity. Blood samples will
      be collected after 8-12 hours fasting and anthropometric variables, biochemical parameters
      and physical activity before and after the trial will be measured.
