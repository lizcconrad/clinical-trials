    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to determine whether depth of anesthesia (DOA) monitoring
      such as Bispectral Index (BIS) and entropy are accurate in patients with neuro-psychological
      conditions such as Parkinson's disease by comparing these monitoring with standard clinical
      monitoring like heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain simulation (DBS) is an increasingly popular treatment for movement and psychiatric
      disorders such as Parkinson's disease and dystonia. These patients are quite sensitive to
      anesthetics and use of depth of anesthesia monitors are often needed to titrate the
      anesthetics. The calibration of BIS and entropy monitors has been done only on subjects with
      no neurological diseases. The investigators plan to record BIS and entropy readings during
      general anesthesia (GA) for the internalization of DBS electrodes. This would be useful as
      there are very few studies in this subset of patients with regards to DOA monitoring. Ashraf
      argued that the EEG may be altered under these circumstances and hence produce invalid BIS
      readings. Pemberton et al. studied patients undergoing tumour surgery using a sleep-
      awake-sleep anaesthesia technique. They found a poor correlation between BIS values and the
      observer's assessment of anesthesia level, suggesting that BIS is not a reliable tool for
      patients with brain abnormalities. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether BIS
      and entropy are helpful in titrating DOA in patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures or
      suffering from neurological diseases as they were frequently excluded from validation studies
      of the BIS monitoring device.
