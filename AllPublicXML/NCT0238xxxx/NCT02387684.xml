  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most important method to slow down and stop the liver disease progression in patients
      with chronic hepatitis B is antiviral therapy, by which to achieve maintaining viral response
      during treatment or obtain sustained viral response after treatment. The aim of the therapy
      with interferon is make patients obtain immune control to HBV defined as sustained viral
      response after treatment, however, most patients can't get this target after 48 weeks of
      interferon treatment, and some patients need extended treatment in clinical practice to
      enhance the rate of sustained viral response or HBsAg loss occurred during treatment. In this
      cohort study, the efficacy of extended therapy of interferon in HBeAg negative chronic
      hepatitis B patients will be evaluated.

      In this cohort study, the HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B patients would be treated with
      peginterferon alpha 2a(PEG-IFN a-2a) for 96 week and followed 24 weeks after treatment. Serum
      HBV DNA load, HBsAg/anti-HBs level, HBeAg/anti-HBe will be tested at enrollment and every 3
      months during treatment and follow period. Parameters of liver and kidney function, and liver
      ultrasound examination will be tested with intervals 1-3 months. The efficacies were
      evaluated by the rate of HBsAg loss during treatment and the rate of sustained viral response
      after treatment and follow up.
