    <textblock>
      This is an open label single arm observational study of longitudinal immunologic responses to
      influenza vaccine in healthy adult subjects. This study will enroll males and non-pregnant
      females, 18-49 years old. The subjects will be screened at enrollment with a history and
      physical exam and laboratory testing to ensure they are healthy enough to participate.
      Qualifying subjects will be vaccinated with an FDA approved seasonal inactivated influenza
      vaccine (IIV) according to the package insert. The study will enroll 10 healthy volunteers
      per vaccination season in years 1, 2 and 4 through 6 of this study, for a total enrollment of
      50 subjects. The primary objective of the study is to characterize HA-specific plasmablasts
      and memory B cells after influenza vaccination.

      This is an open label, single arm, observational study of longitudinal immunologic responses
      to influenza vaccine in healthy adult subjects. This study will enroll males and non-pregnant
      females, 18-49 years old. The study duration is 6 years and participant duration of 180 days.
      The subjects will be screened at enrollment with a history and physical exam and laboratory
      testing to ensure they are healthy enough to participate. Qualifying subjects will be
      vaccinated with an FDA approved seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) according to the
      package insert. Approximately 450 ml of blood will be collected for the research assays
      during the course of the study. Specifically, 16 ml will be collected for screening; 48ml
      will be collected at enrollment; 96ml will be collected at visit days 7 and 14; and 64 ml
      will be collected at 28, 90, and 180 days post vaccination. The study will enroll 10 healthy
      volunteers per vaccination season in years 1, 2, and 4 through 6 of this study, for a total
      enrollment of 50 subjects. Individuals who complete the study will be given the option to
      re-enroll in subsequent years as long as they continue to meet all inclusion/exclusion
      criteria. Re-enrolling subjects will be re-consented, given new subject identifiers, and
      counted towards the enrollment number goal for each year of participation. The primary
      objective of the study is to characterize HA-specific plasmablasts and memory B cells after
      influenza vaccination and secondary objective investigate the longevity of humoral immunity
      to influenza virus in humans.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Male or female subjects between 18 and 49 years of age, inclusive 2. Subjects capable of
        providing written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures. Subjects
        able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for all study
        visits 3. Screening labs within normal limits per the local laboratory normal ranges or
        considered to be not clinically significant by the investigator. Normal laboratory ranges
        are as listed below: A. Hematology: - Hemoglobin: Male- 12.9-16.1 gm/dL, Female- 11.4-14.4
        gm/dL - White blood cells (WBC): Male- 4.2-9.2/uL, Female- 4-10/uL - Platelet count:
        150-400/uL B. Chemistries: - Kidney function:Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt;/= 60
        mL/min/1.73 m^2; - Liver enzymes: Albumin &gt;/= 3.5 g/dL; ALT &lt;66 U/L; AST &lt;62 U/L 4.

        are not suspected to have had an influenza infection in the current flu season. 5. Female
        subjects of child bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the
        screening visit, enrollment visit and all subsequent study visits longer than 14 days since
        the last pregnancy test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Known infection with HIV, HCV, or HBV. This information will be obtained verbally from

        immunoenhancers. 4. Have any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the site
        principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, is a contraindication to study
        participation. This includes any chronic medical disease or condition, defined as
        persisting 3 months (defined as 90 days) or longer, that would place the subject at an
        unacceptable risk of injury, render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the

        investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, within 72 hours prior to study vaccination.
        An acute illness which is nearly resolved with only minor residual symptoms remaining is
        allowable if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate
        sub-investigator, the residual symptoms will not interfere with the ability to assess
        safety parameters as required by the protocol. 6. Persons taking anticoagulants, long-term
        aspirin therapy, or long-term systemic steroids (greater than 3 months in the past 12
        months and any within 30 days). 7. Have known hypersensitivity or allergy to eggs, egg or
        chicken protein or other components of the study vaccine; 8. Have a known latex allergy; 9.
        Have a history of severe reactions following previous immunization with licensed influenza
        virus vaccines 10. Have a history of Guillain-Barre syndrome 11.Subjects who had or are
        suspected to have had an influenza infection in the current influenza season 12. Subjects
        who, at screening, have abnormal vital signs and/or physical exam, including a temperature
        &gt;= 38.0 C, Systolic blood pressure &lt;=90 or &gt;=160 mmHg, pulse &lt;= 60 or &gt; 110 beats per
        minute, new rash, signs of infection. 13. Subjects who have already received the seasonal
        influenza vaccine in the current influenza vaccination season.
