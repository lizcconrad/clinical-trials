      P1106 is Phase IV prospective pharmacokinetic (PK) study of low birth weight infants who are
      receiving or will be receiving as part of clinical care nevirapine (NVP) prophylaxis,
      tuberculosis (TB) prophylaxis or treatment and/or combination antiretroviral (ARV) treatment
      containing lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). The study is designed to describe the
      pharmacokinetics and safety of NVP, INH, RIF, and LPV/r in these infants receiving the
      drug(s) as part of clinical care.

      Cell pellets from PK sampling once will be combined and stored for a DNA extraction,
      amplification, and gel electrophoresis. The genotype analysis will be completed one time per
      study participant. All subjects receiving INH will be genotyped for NAT2. All subjects
      receiving NVP will be genotyped for CYP 2B6. These genotypes will be used as covariates in
      the population PK analyses of NVP and INH to determine their impact on CL/F (clearance
      [apparent]).
