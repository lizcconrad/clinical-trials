      This is an openly randomized controlled parallel group study evaluating the effectiveness of
      using a guided approach and free-hand approach in performing upper extremity regional blocks.
      Potential subjects for this study are the patients who are scheduled for upper extremity
      surgeries requiring supraclavicular and interscalene brachial plexus blocks at Montefiore
      Medical Center.

      Rotating residents who are participating in the study will be randomly assigned either to
      perform block under guided approach (with the help of needle guidance) or free-hand without
      the needle guidance. All the blocks will be single injection blocks utilizing the in-plane
      technique for needle insertion which is the usual protocol in our institution. Each resident
      will be performing one interscalene block with the device and one without the device and one
      supraclavicular block with device and one without the device. An independent observer will be
      present during the case and will be responsible for recording the time taken to perform the
      block, number of times the needle has been redirected and the number of times the needle is
      reinserted. This observer will also administer the satisfaction questionnaire. Number of time
      needle is redirected and number of times reinserted is also a self reported assessment by the
      physician who is performing the block. Efficacy of the block will be assessed by the standard
      of care practiced at our center.

      Objectives

        1. The primary end point of the study is to evaluate the time taken to complete blocks with
           and without the use of the needle guidance device. (Start time is considered as the
           first skin touch by the needle until the completion of the block. Completion of the
           block is defined as withdrawing the needle completely out of the body). The principal
           investigator/co-investigator and an independent observer will be recording the time
           taken to complete the block.

        2. Ease of the technique- (Will be assessed with a short questionnaire survey at the end of
           the procedure). Immediately after the block is finished, the performing physician will
           be requested to fill out the questionnaire.

        3. Number of times needle needs to be re-directed. This is self a reported measurement. The
           person performing the block, investigators (attending physician) and an independent
           observer will be recording number of times the needle was manipulated.

        4. Number of times needle was pulled out entirely out of the body and reinserted. This is
           also a self reported measurement.

        5. Efficacy of the blocks performed will be assessed (This is part of the routine standard
           of care assessing the blocks.)

        6. Total amount of time taken to complete the whole procedure (Starting from the first time
           the ultrasound probe was placed on the patient to the withdrawal of the needle after
           completing the procedure)
