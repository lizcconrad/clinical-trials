    <textblock>
      This study aims to understand better the effective results from the IMELDA MO22223 P-trial
      (NCT00929240) and see if the anti-cancer therapies given during its follow-up time after
      study treatments were terminated possibly had an effect on efficacy results.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 78 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from start of the study to the first documented occurrence of disease progression. The retrospectively collected data was pooled with the data collected within the IMELDA (MO22223) P-trial to allow a statistically meaningful analysis.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 78 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival was defined as the interval between start of the study and the date of death from any cause. The retrospectively collected data was pooled with the data collected within the IMELDA (MO22223) P-trial to allow a statistically meaningful analysis.</description>
