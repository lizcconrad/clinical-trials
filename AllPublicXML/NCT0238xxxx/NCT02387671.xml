  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this research is to develop, evaluate and implement effective mHealth
      technology interventions that improve cancer management outcomes by changing lifestyle
      behaviors among urban health- disparity facing populations. To accomplish this goal, the
      investigators will need to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an
      intervention in which breast cancer survivors receive counseling about lifestyle behaviors
      (weight, nutrition, and physical activity) from a health counselor trained in evidenced-based
      behavioral counseling methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tremendous advances in detection and treatment of breast cancer have led to an increasingly
      large cohort of survivors focused on health promotion and reducing the risk of recurrence.
      While adjuvant therapy, such as hormone therapy, is often used to prevent cancer recurrence,
      modification of lifestyle is an effective tool to increase quality of life, prevent future
      cancer recurrence and increase long-term health. However, translating these recommendations
      into population-wide, inexpensive, sustainable programs for cancer survivors has to date
      proven largely unrealized. These programs are particularly needed in health disparity-facing
      populations (i.e., low socio-economic status and/or racial/ethnic minority groups) due to the
      high burden of cancer incidence and mortality they face. Limited translation is due to many
      factors including the complexity of lifestyle habits, high patient burden of many behavioral
      interventions, low levels of engagement and adherence to interventions, and the lack of
      integration of behavior change tools into daily lifestyles. In this context, there is great
      promise of tools that are mobile, simple, and embedded into daily life routines. The
      long-term goal of this research program is to develop, evaluate and implement effective
      mHealth technology interventions that improve cancer management outcomes by changing
      lifestyle behaviors among urban health- disparity facing populations.

      The mHealth intervention for cancer survivors devised by the investigators consists of
      several components: 1) a commercially available smart phone app that captures patients'
      behavioral data (steps, sleep, weight) using devices (a FitBit and a FitBit scale), 2) text
      messages to participants to collect additional data (foods eaten, eating habits), and 3)
      phone sessions with a non-professionally trained health counselor about diet and physical
      activity behaviors.

      The investigators propose to test the feasibility and preliminary outcomes on weight,
      behaviors, psychological factors as well as participant engagement in the intervention of our
      mHealth counseling intervention among 20 breast cancer survivors.

    <description>The study team will send participants daily text messages regarding their dietary intake. Each message will contain five questions that yield a yes, or no response. Messages will be sent daily during the 8 week study period. Responses from the messages will be recorded and monitored by the study team to enhance the behavioral counseling intervention.</description>

    <description>Participants will engage in four phone calls with the study counselor to discuss behavioral several topics (physical activity, sleep, fatigue &amp; dietary patterns) and to reflect on their data recorded by the FitBit devices. The calls will take place on a bi-weekly basis. During the weeks between calls, the counselor will maintain contact with the participants through asynchronous text messages to monitor their progress in the study.</description>
