  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and its associated conditions have reached epidemic proportions. Estimates are that
      about one third of the adults in the United States have obesity. At this moment there are
      many therapeutic approaches for the treatment of obesity. But, efficacy of most treatment
      options are limited and so far surgical intervention has been proven to be the only strategy
      to overcome severe obesity. However, bariatric surgery has limitations and risks, which might
      be minimized by non-incisional endoscopic procedures.

      BaroSense developed a new device, called the Articulating Circular Endoscopic (ACETM)
      Stapler, which can be used in the treatment of obesity. It is a trans-oral procedure, which
      intends to reduce the ability of the stomach to expand by creating plications in the region
      of the fundus and greater curvature. In contrast with other bariatric surgery it is
      endoscopically performed, reversible and if it fails most future surgical options are still
      open.

      The main study ('Open, prospective study to evaluate the safety and preliminary effectiveness
      of the BaroSense ACE™ Stapler for the treatment of obesity', multicenter study (MUMC+, AMC
      and St. Antonius), accepted by MEC AMC) seeks to determine the safety and efficacy of this
      plicating system for patients with severe obesity.

      In this sub-study the investogators want to unravel the exact mechanism and provide more
      information about the efficacy of the BaroSense ACE™ Stapler. Therefore the authors will
      measure changes in various parameters that are known to affect weight loss and metabolism,
      before and after gastric plication (by using the BaroSense ACE™ Stapler) in overweight
      subjects (these parameters will only be measured in patients at MUMC+). These parameters are
      post-prandial satiety, food-reward and related brain signalling, gastric emptying, behaviour
      towards food, food intake, satiety hormone release, microbiota composition and inflammatory
      markers.

      Objectives:

      Aim of the present study will be to assess the effect of the BaroSense ACE™ stapler on
      postprandial satiety, food-reward and related brain signalling, gastric emptying, behaviour
      towards food, food intake, hormone release, microbiota composition and inflammatory markers.
