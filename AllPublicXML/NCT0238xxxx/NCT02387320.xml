  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) in newly-diagnosed breast cancer patients seeks to
      determine the effectiveness of a self-care toolkit on specific symptoms associated with
      surgery as compared to a standard care group.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main research questions focus on whether the toolkit provides short-term benefits on
      symptoms associated with surgery (i.e., pain, anxiety, nausea) and whether it impacts
      emotional distress and other symptoms (i.e., pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, global health,
      quality of life) at a two-week post-operative time point. This study will be conducted at San
      Antonio Military Medical Center (SAMMC) in active duty, veteran, and military dependent women
      newly diagnosed with breast cancer for whom surgery (e.g., lumpectomy or mastectomy) is the
      initial treatment option. One to two weeks prior to surgery, women diagnosed with breast
      cancer at SAMMC Oncology Department will be invited to participate in this study. Those who
      meet criteria and agree to participate will be enrolled on-study and randomly assigned to
      either the surgical toolkit group or standard care group. During the pre-operative period,
      women in the intervention group will be asked to read through the manual, listen to each of
      the 8 audiofiles at least once but as many times as desired, and to wear the acupressure
      wristbands during surgery. Women randomized to the standard care group will not receive an
      intervention prior to surgery but will receive the toolkit at study completion. The rationale
      for providing women in the standard care group with the toolkit at their post-operative visit
      is that the skills of breathing, meditation, and guided imagery might be potentially
      beneficial for them to use during their subsequent treatment or a future surgery.
      Additionally, qualitative interviews will be conducted in a cohort of women from the
      intervention group, at a two-week post-operative time point to assess their impressions and
      satisfaction with the toolkit; questions will focus on whether the individual used each of
      the toolkit's components, frequency of use, how she would rate the product's attributes
      (e.g., ease of use, clarity of instructions, quality rating, helpfulness), and perceptions
      about the helpfulness and usefulness of learned mind-body skills.

    <description>The Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) is a graphic tool to facilitate self-reported pain rating from patients. The instrument uses a scale from 0-10, 0 being &quot;no pain&quot; to 10 being &quot;as bad as it could be, nothing else matters.&quot; This instrument will take up to 1 minute to complete.</description>

    <description>The self-care toolkit was designed and created for individuals undergoing surgery and/or invasive medical procedures. It provides individuals with guided instruction to learn several evidence-informed mind-body skills (e.g., breathing, relaxation, meditation, guided imagery) and tools (e.g., acupressure wristbands, journal) in order to regulate their own physiologic and emotional reactions to stressful situations and to lessen symptoms associated with surgery (principally pain, anxiety, nausea, fatigue, sleep disturbance).</description>
