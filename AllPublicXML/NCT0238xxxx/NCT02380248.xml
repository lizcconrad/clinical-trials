    <measure>Change From Baseline in Corneal Staining at All Study Time Points</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 45, Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal staining was assessed by the Investigator through slit-lamp examination and reported on a scale of 0-3, where 0=normal (no staining) and 3=severe (numerous coalescent macropunctate areas and/or patches), for the 5 quadrants of each eye. The scores at each visit were summed by eye for each subject. The overall corneal staining score for the subject at each visit was then computed as the average of the sum from both eyes. Thus, the overall scores ranged between 0-15 with higher scores reflecting more damage to the corneal surface.</description>

      <time_frame>Adverse Events (AEs) were collected from the time of informed consent for the duration of a subject’s participation in the study (up to 90 days). AEs are reported as pre-treatment and treatment-emergent.</time_frame>
