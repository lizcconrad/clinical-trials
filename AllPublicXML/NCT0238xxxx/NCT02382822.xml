  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite efficient antiretroviral treatment for HIV infection, decrease in life expectancy
      remains. Excess mortality is mainly due to non-AIDS co-morbidity including cardiovascular,
      pulmonary, and liver related diseases. Both HIV-unrelated and HIV-related risk factors
      probably contribute to this pattern. At present, most evidence regarding co-morbidity in HIV
      infection rely on cross-study comparisons of HIV-infected persons with published population
      rates and few prospective studies in U.S. cohorts. Using well characterized participants from
      the Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS) as controls, we aim to include &gt;1500
      HIV-infected persons in the COCOMO study to determine if co-morbidity is more prevalent or
      develops at a higher rate in HIV-infected persons. The study will asses 1) cardiovascular, 2)
      pulmonary and 3) liver-related co-morbidity using uniformly collected data in the two
      cohorts. The investigators aim to study the relative impact of HIV-unrelated and HIV-related
      factors on development of co-morbidity.

      Primary hypothesis

        1. HIV infection is independently associated with higher prevalence of coronary
           atherosclerosis (assessed by CT angiography)

        2. HIV infection is independently associated with higher prevalence of COPD, and
           independently associated with loss of lung function

        3. HIV infection is independently associated with liver fibrosis

      Secondary hypothesis

        1. Cardiovascular

             -  Viral load and CD4 are independently associated with coronary atherosclerosis
                (assessed by CT angiography) in HIV-infected individuals.

             -  Levels of inflammatory markers can predict coronary atherosclerosis in HIV-infected
                individuals.

             -  Microbial translocation and metabolism are associated with coronary atherosclerosis
                in HIV-infected individuals.

             -  Endothelial dysfunction (assessed by arterial elastography) can predict coronary
                atherosclerosis in HIV-infected individuals

        2. Pulmonary

             -  Viral load and CD4 is independently associated with emphysema

             -  HIV is independently associated with pulmonary hypertension (assessed by CT
                angiography), and obstructive lung disease is independently associated with airway
                obstruction

             -  PCP colonization in HIV infected patients is independently associated with
                obstructive lung disease, emphysema and loss of lung function.

             -  Inflammatory markers in HIV infected patients are associated with obstructive lung
                disease and loss of lung function
