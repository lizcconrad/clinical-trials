    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of enoblituzumab (MGA271) in combination
      with Yervoy (ipilimumab) when given to patients with B7-H3-expressing melanoma, squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other B7-H3
      expressing cancers. The study will also evaluate what is the best dose of enoblituzumab to
      use when given with ipilimumab. Assessments will also be done to see how the drug acts in the
      body (pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics) and to evaluate potential anti-tumor activity
      of enoblituzumab in combination with ipilimumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1 open-label, dose escalation, and cohort expansion study of
      enoblituzumab administered intravenously (IV) on a weekly schedule for up to 51 doses in
      combination with IV ipilimumab administered on an every-3-week schedule for 4 doses.

      The dose escalation phase is designed to characterize the safety and tolerability of the
      combination of enoblituzumab and ipilimumab and to define the maximum tolerated or
      administered dose (MTD/MAD) in patients with B7-H3 expressing mesothelioma, urothelial
      cancer, NSCLC, SCCHN, Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), ovarian cancer, melanoma,
      thyroid cancer, Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, soft
      tissue sarcoma, or prostate cancer.

      The cohort expansion phase, 2 cohorts of 16 patients each will be enrolled to further
      evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of the combination administered at the MTD/MAD
      dose in patients with melanoma and NSCLC.

      All tumor evaluations will be carried out by both Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) and immune-related response criteria (irRC).

        Inclusion Criteria - Cohort Expansion Phase:

          -  Histologically-proven, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic melanoma or NSCLC

               -  Melanoma: Advanced or metastatic melanoma patients may be systemic therapy na√Øve
                  or may have received systemic treatment for unresectable locally advanced or
                  metastatic disease. A patient who previously received systemic therapy must have
                  had progression on a checkpoint inhibitor (e.g., anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-1,
                  anti-CTLA-4) as the most recent prior therapy.

               -  NSCLC: NSCLC that has progressed during or following 1 or more prior systemic
                  therapies for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. Patients who
                  are intolerant of, or have refused treatment with standard first line cancer
                  therapy, will be allowed to enroll. Patients must not have had more than 5 prior
                  systemic regimens (excluding experimental therapies) for unresectable locally
                  advanced or metastatic disease.

          -  Active viral, bacterial, or systemic fungal infection requiring parenteral treatment
