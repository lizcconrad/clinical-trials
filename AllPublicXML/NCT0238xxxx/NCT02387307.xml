  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase I study of rSIFN-co (3 times a week via subcutaneous
      injection for 21 days, with 1 week of washout per cycle).

      The Dose-Escalation Cohort will consist of the Pretreatment Phase, the Treatment Phase, the
      Extension Phase, Discontinuation and Follow-up. The Pretreatment Phase will include a Consent
      and Screening Period. The Treatment Phase will consist of the Lead in Period and first 21-day
      cycle of treatment during which subjects will be monitored for the development of
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) following 1 week of washout. The Extension Phase will start from
      the start of Cycle 2 with intra-subject dose-escalation performed until discontinuation of
      study treatment. Upon discontinuation of study treatment, discontinuation visit assessments
      should occur within 7 days of treatment discontinuation or confirmation of discontinuation
      criteria. End of treatment information will also be collected for all subjects who
      discontinue treatment after completion of cycle 1 treatment. Follow-up visit/final visit
      evaluations will be performed 28 (±5 days) days after the last rSIFN-co administration. The
      decision to undergo dose-escalation to the next dose level will be based on the safety
      information obtained during Cycle 1.

      Dose escalation in solid tumors utilizing a &quot;3+3&quot; design with intra-subject dose escalation.
      3 dose levels of rSIFN-co are planned for determining the RD. 3-6 subjects will be assigned
      to each dose level and followed up for 4 weeks after starting administration in Cycle 1. Each
      cohort will be started after the tolerability of that dose level has been confirmed in
      subjects with advanced solid tumors. For subjects starting in the lower dose cohorts,
      intra-subject dose escalation will be allowed till grade 3/4 toxicity is encountered or 24µg
      TIW is reached. In order to minimize the risk of allergic reactions, the sponsor has advised
      a lead-in period starting from 15µg. When the tolerability of each dose level has been
      confirmed by the observation of no DLT among 3 subjects, escalation to the next dose level
      will occur.

      The Expansion Cohort will be initiated at the RD. Depending on the RD, the lead in period
      will occur accordingly. After the lead in period, a period from Cycle 1 to the final
      administration will be performed as the Treatment Phase during which subjects will undergo a
      standardized evaluation for the safety and efficacy of rSIFN-co at the RD. If subjects are
      discontinued from the study treatment, discontinuation visit assessments should occur within
      7 days of last rSIFN-co administration or confirmation of discontinuation criteria. End of
      treatment information will also be collected for all subjects who discontinue treatment after
      completion of cycle 1 treatment. Follow-up evaluations will be performed 28 days (±5 days)
      after the last rSIFN-co administration.

             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of r-SIFN-co
             administration. WOCBP must have a negative urine pregnancy test at Visit 1
             (Screening).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to start of rSIFN-co administration or those who
             have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks
             earlier.

          2. Subjects receiving other investigational drugs within 5 times the half-life of the
             investigational drugs or within 4 weeks, prior to start of rSIFN-co administration.

          3. Subject must not have known untreated brain or meningeal metastases. CT scans are not
             required to rule out brain or meningeal metastases unless there is a clinical
             suspicion of central nervous system disease. Subjects with treated brain metastases
             that are radiographically or clinically stable for at least 4 weeks after therapy and
             have no evidence of cavitation or hemorrhage in the brain lesion(s) are eligible,
             provided that they are asymptomatic and do not require corticosteroids (must have
             discontinued steroids at least 4 weeks prior to start of rSIFN-co administration).

          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to interferon.

          5. Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, interstitial pneumonia or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements.

          6. HIV-positive subjects on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the increased risk of lethal infections when treated with immunomodulatory therapy.
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in subjects receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          7. The investigator or sub-investigator considers the subject's physique as inappropriate
             for investigational product treatment or any other reason(s) that may render the
             subjects inappropriate for participation in the trial.

          8. Subjects who may have autoimmune disorders, decompensated liver diseases or
             life-threatening neurologic diseases.
