      The investigators propose a prospective, multicenter, single arm Phase II design to evaluate
      the feasibility of repeated breast-conserving surgery combined with re- irradiation using
      IORT after local recurrence of breast carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) after breast- conserving
      surgery and radiotherapy remains at 10% at 10 years to 15% at 20 years, respectively. IBTR is
      an independent predictor of poor survival with a 3 to 4.6 increased risk of cancer-related
      death.

      In a heterogeneous population, local control remains a major therapeutic challenge for these
      relapses, especially those considered of better prognosis, namely occurring late and of low
      histological grade. Therapeutic de-escalation is possible for these relapses to avoid a
      mutilating and often traumatic mastectomy.

      However, this second conservative surgery has a high rate of second local relapse (19 to 50%
      at 5 years) due to the absence of a re-irradiation, rendered impossible by the problem of
      tolerance of previously irradiated tissues.

      Retrospective or prospective studies on partial breast irradiation (PBI) in adjuvant setting
      report promising results, both in terms of tolerance (saving healthy tissue) and local
      control (74% to 100% at 5 years). Used techniques include brachytherapy, external beam
      radiotherapy and intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT).

      IORT is now the subject of renewed interest in breast cancer. It has the advantages of
      high-precision ballistics on the operated area and of preservation of healthy tissue. To
      date, no prospective data, however, have been published in the indication of ipsilateral
      breast recurrence.

      A prospective, multicenter, single arm Phase II design will evaluate the feasibility of
      repeated breast-conserving surgery combined with re- irradiation using IORT after local
      recurrence of breast carcinoma.

    <description>Surgery :
Tumorectomy will be performed according to the current standards, obtaining &quot;clear&quot; margins. The axillary lymph node control will depend on the initial management (clinical and ultrasound) of these N0 patients, chosen by the teams.
Intra Operative Radiotherapy (IORT):
After the excision of the tumor, IORT will be delivered. A single dose of 20 Gy by 50 kV photons (Intrabeam™) will be administered in tumor bed. The addition of IORT does not modify the surgical procedure.</description>
