    <textblock>
      A 12 week Internet based self help program based on cognitive behavioral therapy and relapse
      prevention is tested among Internet help seekers as well as among patients seeking help in
      addiction care.The design is a one armed pilot study, and outcomes are measured in terms of
      changes in alcohol consumption, problematic alcohol use, self efficacy, craving, as well as
      depression and quality of life. 20 participants are recruited entirely online from an open
      access website and 20 participants are recruited through information given to them at an
      addiction clinic. All participants have access to the same self help program and have access
      to a licensed psychologist who guides the person all the way through the program.
