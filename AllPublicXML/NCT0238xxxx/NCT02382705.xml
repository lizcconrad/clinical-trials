  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capsule endoscopy (CE) is a non-invasive means of visualizing the small bowel. Common
      indications for CE include obscure gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease
      like crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, and polyposis syndrome.

      While CE has high diagnostic value for small bowel lesions, a significant limitation of this
      technology is the finite battery life which results in incomplete examination of the small
      bowel approximately 16.5% of the time. Numerous attempts of using pharmacological (e.g.
      prokinetics, purgatives) as well as non-pharmacological measures (e.g. real-time viewer,
      chewing gum) to improve completion rates, defined by entry of CE into the cecum, led to mixed
      results. Currently routine use of prokinetics (agents that speeds up gut motility) is not
      recommended.

      This study aims to determine whether longer battery of the newer generation capsule endoscopy
      system improves study completion rate and diagnostic yield.
