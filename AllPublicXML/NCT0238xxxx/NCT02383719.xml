    <description>With the questionnaire we desired to discern the clinicians perception of use of the experimental oro-nasal mask. The questionnaire featured the ease of installation, the ease of use, and the perceived comfort of the patient. Each of the scores were on a scale from 1-5 and each were recorded to be used for individual assessment. Thus each patient has multiple assessment scores individually reported as outcomes.
The clinicians were asked on a scale of 1-5 please rate their agreement with the statements The mask was easy to use. 1 strongly disagree, 2 somewhat disagree, 3 neutral, 4 somewhat agree, 5 strongly agree Your perception of patient comfort was acceptable. 1 strongly disagree, 2 somewhat disagree, 3 neutral, 4 somewhat agree, 5 strongly agree</description>
