    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury(AKI) is one of the most common complications that occur up to 35% of
      critically ill patients. Septic AKI accounts for one third of them. Patients with septic AKI
      are widely treated with Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). However, previous
      studies have hardly documented improvement of mortality in septic AKI patients. Otherwise,
      Fluid overload in septic shock patients who are undergoing CRRT is proven to be a significant
      predictor for mortality. Recent studies showed efficacy of bioelectrical impedance analysis
      and lung ultrasound in assessing fluid status of the patients. Thus, hypothesis of the study
      is that fluid assessment and control of fluid status using BIA and Lung Ultrasound could be
      related to the outcome of septic AKI patients who undergo CRRT. In this study, the
      investigators measure the fluid status of the patients by bioelectrical impedance analysis
      and lung ultrasound for experimental group, while for control group, fluid status would be
      determined clinically by the physician. Ultrafiltration rate of experimental group is
      adjusted to be equal to the value of overhydration measured by BIA.

    <description>In this study, investigator measure the fluid status of the patients by bioelectrical impedance analysis and lung ultrasound. The patients are assigned into two groups, BIA and Lung Ultrasound based versus clinical-based assessment group. Ultrafiltration of BIA and Lung Ultrasound based group is adjusted to be equal to the value of over hydration measured only by BIA, not by Lung Ultrasound, because Lung Ultrasound cannot determine exact amount of the patient's fluid excess. Total amount of ultrafiltration will be removed from the patient for three days evenly. On the other hand, Ultrafiltration amount will be decided by the physician in the clinical based group. Amount of fluid removal for a day will be adjusted not to exceed 2000ml, so that total fluid removed from the patient will not exceed 6000ml for three days.</description>
