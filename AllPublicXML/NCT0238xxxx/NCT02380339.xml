  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uncontrolled diabetes is associated with increased risk for micro-vascular complication.
      Hypoglycemia is one of the major barriers in achieving good glucose control. Hypoglycemia is
      associated with a range of unpleasant symptoms including palpitations, tremor, hunger,
      sweating, confusion, difficulties in thinking as well as other idiosyncratic symptoms. Fear
      of hypoglycemia (FOH) refers to phobic avoidance reactions associated with hypoglycemia FOH
      may increase behavioral attempts to avoid hypoglycemia including decreased consumption of
      insulin and/or increased consumption of carbohydrates, resulting in poor glycemic control and
      an increased risk of diabetic complication. In this study, the investigators present a novel
      system, which simultaneously employs BioFeedback and Virtual Reality in order to cope with
      fear of hypoglycemia.

    <description>Participants in the control group will undergo Psych-Educational and BF sessions in which they will receive information about FOH and about ways of coping with FOH and BF training. More specifically, they will learn about factors associated with FOH, behavioral manifestations of FOH, negative consequences of these behavioral manifestations and about ways of coping with FOH. They will be instructed to practice BF for 15 minutes, at home for 5 initial training sessions during a week. After which they will receive another session of BF training and will be instructed to practice it at home for 10 sessions course, (5 weekly sessions for 2 weeks). Each session will be for 15 minutes.</description>

    <description>Participants in the intervention group will receive Psych-Educational session as the control group and in addition they will participate in training for VR system and will be asked to use it at home for 5 initial training sessions during a week. During this week, they will practice reducing their GSR levels as indicated by the BF device. Following this they will receive a combined biofeedback-virtual reality system and use it at home for a 10 sessions course, (5 weekly sessions for 2 weeks). Each session will be for 15 minutes.</description>
