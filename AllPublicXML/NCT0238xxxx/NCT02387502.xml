  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tracheal intubation requires alignment of oro-pharyngeal-laryngeal axes. When these three
      axes are not aligned, intubation becomes difficult. In the researchers' study, the
      investigators simulated difficult laryngoscopy situation by using a rigid neck collar. This
      neck collar renders intubation difficult not only by restricting neck movement, but also
      reducing mouth opening. The investigators compared the performance of Macintosh, MacCoy and
      Airtraq laryngoscope in simulated difficult laryngoscopy using a rigid neck collar.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Airtraq laryngoscope is an optical laryngoscope which allows visualization of vocal cord as a
      reflected image through multiple lenses and prisms. MacCoy laryngoscope is a modification of
      Macintosh laryngoscope. It has a lever which, when pressed, moves its flexible tip. In the
      investigators' study, the researchers compared the performances of Airtraq laryngoscope with
      MacCoy and Macintosh laryngoscopes in simulated difficult laryngoscopy using a rigid neck
      collar. The researchers recruited 120 patients and randomly divided those patients into three
      equal groups i.e. 30 patients in each group. These three groups are 1-Airtraq, 2-MacCoy and
      3-Macintosh. The researchers compared efficacy and safety in these three laryngoscopes. The
      researchers compared efficacy in terms of time of intubation, ease of intubation, overall
      success, Intubation difficulty score, visualization of vocal cord in terms of POGO
      (percentage of Glottic Opening) score. The researchers compared safety in terms of
      hemodynamic pressor response and airway trauma.

            <description>After randomization, 40 patients were included in this group. After application of rigid neck collar, all patients were intubated with Macintosh laryngoscope. We observed and documented ease of intubation, time of intubation, overall success, number of attempts, Intubation Difficulty Score and POGO score. We also observed hemodynamic response in terms blood pressure and pulse rate. We assessed airway trauma after extubation.
Intubation- Macintosh laryngoscope: Difficult intubation was simulated by using rigid neck collar. Then patients were intubated according to the assigned laryngoscopes. In Macintosh group, tip of the laryngoscope blade was placed in the vallecula and epiglottis was lifted. After visualization of the vocal cord, patients were intubated.</description>
