  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop in the generation of tremor, gait impairments
      and postural instability has been made evident. The current study will use a Magstim Rapid 2
      to deliver rTMS with the aim of modulating the activity in the vermal/paravermal region of
      the cerebellum, and consequently the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway. Analysis of the
      effects of an acute session of stimulation will be made to determine the therapeutic
      potential of the protocol. Motor symptom improvement will be assessed immediately following
      stimulation to detect motor symptom improvement up to one hour following stimulation,
      providing insight into the effectiveness of the protocol to produce benefits which outlast
      the period of stimulation.

      Participants will each receive one session of stimulation in the ON state of medication. A
      pre-assessment will be performed before beginning the session and a post-assessment will be
      performed immediately following stimulation. There will be two groups, which will both
      undergo the exact same protocol, however one group will receive real stimulation, and one
      group will receive sham stimulation.
