      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of single increasing doses
      of intravenously administered rolapitant in healthy male and female subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a SAD, up to 6
      cohorts,of rolapitant IV (2 mg/mL solution) administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes.

      In Part 2 of the study, the safety and tolerability of the highest safe and well-tolerated
      dose established in Part 1 will be evaluated in an expanded cohort. The highest safe and
      well-tolerated dose established in Part 1 will be ascertained by the following criteria: an
      upper limit of 90% confidence interval (CI) for Cmax. A minimum of 40 subjects will be
      enrolled in Part 2.

             requirements.

          -  Subject must be in general good health as determined by the Investigator based on
             pre-study medical, medication, and surgical history; physical examination; and
             clinical laboratory tests.

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must not have been dosed with test drug or blinded study drug in another
             investigational study within 30 days or 5 half-lives of the biologic activity of the
             test drug, whichever is longer, before the time of first study dose.

          -  Subject must not have a history of hypersensitivity to rolapitant IV or any of its
             excipients or who have completed a study visit as part of a previous rolapitant study
             within the 6 months prior to first study drug administration (Day

          -  Subject must not have poor venous access or consider venipuncture intolerable.

          -  Subject must not have a history of significant complications or anxiety associated
             with the IV administration of medications that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             could make the subject unable to complete dosing requirements.

          -  Subject must not be pregnant or lactating.
