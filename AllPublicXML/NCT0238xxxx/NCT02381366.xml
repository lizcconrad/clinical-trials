  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PNEUMOSTEM® consists of ex vivo cultured allogeneic, unrelated, human umbilical cord
      blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) and it is intended for use as a cellular
      therapy product for prevention of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD). This study is an
      open-label, single-center, dose escalation study to evaluate of safety and efficacy of
      PNEUMOSTEM® in premature infants at high risk for BPD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A male or female infant whose postnatal age is 3 to 14 days, inclusive (for treatment
             between 5 and 14 days after birth)

          -  A subject whose gestational age is between 23 and 28 weeks (23 weeks ≤ gestational age
             (GA) &lt; 28 weeks)

          -  A subject whose birth weight is between 500g and 1000g, inclusive

          -  A subject who is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation within 5-14 days after
             birth, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.25 or greater at Screening

          -  A subject who has had either a deterioration or no change in the setting of mechanical
             ventilation within the 24 hours before trial enrollment

          -  A subject whose parent/guardian can give a written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A subject who has a congenital heart defect, except for patent ductus arteriosus
             (PDA), atrial septal defect (ASD) or a small, restrictive ventricular septal defect
             (VSD)

          -  A subject who has a serious malformation of the lung such as pulmonary
             hypoplasia/aplasia congenital diaphragmatic hernia, or other congenital lung anomaly

          -  A subject who has a chromosomal abnormality (e.g., Trisomy 18, Trisomy 13 or Trisomy
             21) or a severe congenital malformation (e.g., hydrocephalus and encephalocele,
             tracheo-esophageal fistula, abdominal wall defects, and major renal anomalies)

          -  A subject who has had a severe congenital infectious disease (i.e., herpes,
             toxoplasmosis rubella, syphilis, HIV, etc.)

          -  A subject who has evidence of severe sepsis or septic shock due to an active infection
             at Screening

          -  A subject who underwent a surgical procedure within 72 hours before study drug
             administration or who is anticipated to have a surgical procedure within 72 hours
             before or following study drug administration

          -  A subject who was administered surfactant within 24 hours before study drug
             administration

          -  A subject who has had a bilateral grade 3 or 4 intracranial hemorrhage

          -  A subject who has active pulmonary hemorrhage or an active air leak syndrome at

          -  A subject who is currently participating in any other interventional clinical trial

          -  A subject who is, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, considered
             inappropriate for the trial due to any reasons other than those listed above
