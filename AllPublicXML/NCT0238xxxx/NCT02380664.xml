  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Swimming training is associated with decreased bone mass and lower bone mass acquisition
      during growth periods, mainly when compared to other weight-bearing sports. Little
      information is available in adolescents pointing in the same direction but still
      controversial.

      On the other hand, bone strength do not only depends on bone mass but on bone structure and
      microarchitecture. The cross sectional area, cortex thickness or trabecular density are
      important aspects of bone health. There are few studies on the effect of swimming on bone
      architecture of adolescents. This information is relevant for present and future health of
      adolescents practicing swimming and for all the organizations promoting this sport. Jumping
      and whole body vibration training programs seem to elicit important osteogenic effects;
      however, there is little information on this regard in adolescent population, even less in
      these adolescents with potentially decreased bone acquisition such as swimmers.

      The main aims of this research project are therefore, to analyze the effect of swimming
      training on bone mass, metabolism, structure and architecture in adolescents analyzing
      possible relationships among them. Secondly, to test whether including short boots of jumping
      or whole body vibration may be able to palliate the possible deleterious effects of swimming
      and facilitate a normal or even healthier bone development. And finally to study the
      durability of training-related bone gains over time.
