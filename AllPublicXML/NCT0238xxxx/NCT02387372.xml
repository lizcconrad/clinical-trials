  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, prospective, multicenter, non-comparative, open-label study to
      characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics and intrapulmonary penetration of
      ceftolozane/tazobactam in two groups of participants.

      Group 1: approximately 25 ventilated participants with suspected or proven pneumonia
      receiving concurrent standard antibiotic therapy. Within Group 1, efforts will be made to
      enroll approximately 5 participants with a CLCR ≥ 150 mL/min (as calculated by the
      Cockcroft-Gault equation).

      Group 2: 8-10 critically ill participants with CLCR ≥180 mL/min (as calculated by the
      Cockcroft-Gault equation).
