    <textblock>
      This is an open label, investigator-sponsored, pilot study. Subjects agreeing to participate
      in the study and meeting the eligibility criteria assessed at the screening visit will be
      enrolled in the study. The length of time between screening and treatment will last between 0
      days to a maximum of 12 weeks. Subjects who enter the screening phase during a cluster
      headache episode and meet the study eligibility criteria can immediately enter the treatment
      phase and may opt to treat their cluster headache episode in the clinic. Subjects who are not
      in a cluster headache episode, who meet initial screening eligibility criteria, can remain in
      the screening phase for up to 12 weeks until their next cluster episode begins. Upon
      initiation of a cluster headache episode, subjects will enter the treatment period. Subjects
      will be trained on the proper use of the hand-held dispenser containing carbon dioxide (CO2
      )calibrated to deliver 0.5 standard liters per minute (SLPM). This dispenser will be provided
      for use in the clinic or home. Subjects will be instructed to use the nasal CO2 dispenser, 10
      seconds/nostril, as needed up to 6 times to treat one attack. Each dose must be separated by
      3-5 minutes. Subjects should treat only one attack in a 24-hour period. Subjects may treat up
      to three cluster headache attacks during the treatment phase of this study. One hour after
      the first dose, subjects can choose to treat with investigator-approved rescue medication.
      Subjects will be asked to complete an online diary after the completion of the dosing. Diary
      assessments will collect pain severity, nasal CO2 usage, acute medication usage, satisfaction
      of treatment, number of cluster attacks, and unusual symptoms. Subjects will be contacted by
      phone within 3 days of the first use of the nasal CO2 dispenser to assess adverse events
      (AEs) and medication usage. A total of 25 subjects will enter the treatment period and be
      instructed to treat up to 3 cluster headaches with nasal CO2. Within 7 days of treating their
      last cluster headache episode, subjects will return for an end of study visit.

    <description>Greatest change in headache pain intensity post treatment (at any time point within 30 minutes of Nasal CO2 administration) - pre-treatment. Pain intensity will be measured as follows: 0 = no pain, 1 = mild pain, 2 = moderate pain, and 3 = severe pain. Full Range values were calculated change values, and do not represent the full range of the scale, i.e., at best some subjects experienced full relief (-3), and at worst some subjects experienced a 1 point headache pain intensity post treatment.</description>
