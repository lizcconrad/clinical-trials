      This study aims to determine normative values of oxygen saturation in late preterm infants,
      and evaluate the frequency of hypoxic events in infants requiring caffeine at discharge and
      those not requiring it.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apnea of prematurity is a common morbidity among premature infants. Recent studies suggest an
      association between apnea and neurodevelopmental impairment. Our objectives are to determine
      normative values of oxygen saturation in late preterm infants -reference group. In infants
      born 28-35 weeks requiring caffeine- study group and infants born 28-35 weeks not requiring
      caffeine-control group we will be evaluating the frequency of hypoxic events. Recruitment
      time: February 2015 until December 2016.

      After consent a pulse oxymeter will be placed on the infant's right wrist. For those infants
      that will receive caffeine prior to discharge, this medication will be instituted after 12
      hours of the initiation of the study and continue for the remaining of the hospitalization.
      For all other infants, the pulse oxymeter will be done continuously until discharge. After
      discharge, the recording will be done at home once a week until 46 weeks corrected age in the
      three groups.

      All the data will be reviewed by a blind observer to the groups from which that data comes.
      The data will be analyzed by a statistician.

      Normative values will be developed on the reference group until 46 weeks post conceptional
      age.

      Any medical problems encounter by the patients while on the study or in the following 6
      months will be recorded to establish the safety of caffeine use at home and its
      discontinuation at 44 weeks post conceptional age.
