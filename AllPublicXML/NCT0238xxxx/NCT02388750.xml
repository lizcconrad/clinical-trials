  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II study will investigate the use of palonosetron in the efficacy of prophylaxis
      or rescue of single or multiple fraction radiation induced nausea and vomiting. This
      prospective study employs a parallel arm design, allowing for inclusion of patients with
      pre-existing nausea and vomiting versus no current nausea or vomiting. Eligible patients
      receiving radiotherapy known to have a low or moderate emetogenic risk will receive every
      other day dosing of 0.5 mg palonosetron for the length of treatment. Nausea, vomiting, use of
      rescue medication, and impact on quality of life will be monitored during and after radiation
      treatment completion.
