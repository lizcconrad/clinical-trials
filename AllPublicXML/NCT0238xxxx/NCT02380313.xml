  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to characterize the safety and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)
      of combining afuresertib, independently with 2 approved drugs: enzalutamide (Xtandi®, &quot;Xtandi
      is a trademark of Astellas Pharma, Inc.&quot; ) and abiraterone (Zygita®, &quot;Zytiga is a trademark
      of Janssen Biotech, Inc.&quot;). The study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1, a dose
      escalation phase, will establish RP2D of afuresertib when administered with enzalutamide or
      abiraterone. Part 2, a dose expansion phase, will further evaluate long-term safety of the
      combinations at the RP2Ds in additional subjects. Dose-finding cohorts will be studied in
      parallel and will evaluate safety and pharmacokinetic to guide selection of the dose regimens
      for further evaluation. Part 2 will begin once the RP2Ds have been established in Part 1.
      Additional doses and/or schedules may be explored if warranted, based upon the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments or emerging preclinical evidence.
      Overall, approximately 60 chemotherapy-naïve subjects with mCRPC and who are receiving either
      enzalutamide or abiraterone will be enrolled into the study.
