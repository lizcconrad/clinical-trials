      The purpose of the aeRobic Exercise and Cognitive Health (REACH) study is to understand how
      an aerobic exercise intervention might help promote brain health and cognition, thereby
      delaying the onset of clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence and costs associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are projected to increase
      exponentially owing to the unprecedented expansion in the elderly segment of the United
      States' population. Given this looming specter, delaying the onset of AD symptoms and curbing
      the progression of the underlying disease process has become a national public health
      imperative (U.S. DHHS 2014). Delaying symptom onset by as little as 5 years could reduce the
      prevalence of AD by half (U.S. DHHS 2014, Khachaturian 2009). Unfortunately, currently
      available drug treatments for AD are not curative. Similarly, clinical trials testing novel
      disease-modifying therapeutics have been disappointing (Sperling 2011). The urgency of
      alternative approaches for halting the global crisis posed by AD cannot be overstated.

      Animal studies have demonstrated that aerobic exercise (EXER) is a low-cost, low-risk
      intervention capable of altering the AD pathological process (Adlard 2005, Wu 2008).
      Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of EXER in older adults have also revealed its beneficial
      effects on AD-relevant measures such as brain glucose metabolism and memory/executive
      function (Erickson 2011, Baker 2009). Importantly, a recent evidence review found that of 7
      key modifiable risk factors for AD, physical activity had the highest impact on reducing the
      national prevalence of AD (Barnes 2011). However, there are presently no RCTs examining the
      effects of EXER in middle-aged, asymptomatic individuals at increased risk of AD. This is an
      important knowledge gap for several reasons. Interventions to halt the AD pathological
      cascade are more likely to be effective if implemented prior to pervasive neuronal damage
      (Sperling 2011). Secondly, persons with specific risk factors for developing AD (such as
      parental family history (FH)) represent a choice target population for any credible attempts
      at reducing the growing burden of AD (Jarvik 2008). Lastly, a key limitation of prior EXER
      RCTs is the failure to adequately account for participants' physical activity levels outside
      of the intervention.

      Accordingly, the main objective of this study is to pilot a 26-week trial of EXER among
      asymptomatic, middle-aged adults with and without family history (FH) of AD enrolled in the
      Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP) or the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease
      Research Center (WADRC). The investigators' near-term goal is to assess the feasibility and
      acceptability of this structured intervention and preliminarily evaluate (i) its effect on
      AD-relevant outcomes such as glucose metabolism and (ii) the mechanism for such effects. The
      investigators' longer-term goal is to use the data gathered via this pilot to further refine
      the intervention, estimate effect sizes for key outcomes, and seek NIH funding for a longer
      and more definitive assessment of whether EXER can effectively curtail AD progression in
      midlife. The specific aims are:

      AIM 1: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of a 26-week, 3-4 days per week,
      structured EXER regimen among middle-aged adults with FH of AD. Hypothesis: The investigators
      will successfully enroll the 30 participants (15 each in EXER and usual physical activity
      groups) targeted for this study. At least 90% of the participants within the EXER group,
      called the enhanced physical activity group, will complete â‰¥80% of scheduled training
      sessions.

      AIM 2: Preliminarily characterize the effect of the EXER intervention on AD-related brain
      alteration. Hypothesis: Compared to participants randomized to the usual physical activity
      group, those randomized to the enhanced physical activity group will demonstrate preserved
      brain glucose metabolism. Similar effects will be seen in secondary outcomes including
      cerebral blood flow, hippocampal volume, vascular health, memory/executive function, and
      mood.

      AIM 3: Preliminarily evaluate (i) the biological mechanisms by which EXER affects brain
      health and cognition, and (ii) the individual difference factors that potentially moderate
      EXER's effects. Hypotheses: (i) Persons in the enhanced physical activity group will exhibit
      significant increases in circulating neurotrophins and improved cardiorespiratory fitness,
      and (ii) the beneficial effects of EXER will be more pronounced for participants with
      decreased sedentary behaviors outside of the intervention (measured via accelerometry).

      AIM 4: Preliminarily determine whether EXER improves vascular health. Hypothesis: Individuals
      in the enhanced physical activity group will exhibit comparatively increased cerebral blood
      flow, and improved endothelial function.

    <description>Those assigned to the enhanced physical activity group will train 3-4 days per week with the goal of attaining current public health recommendations of 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise by the 7th week of training, and maintaining this level of exercise for the remainder of the 26-week intervention. A gradual increase in exercise intensity and duration will be used throughout this twenty-six week exercise intervention, with the initial speed and duration calibrated to each participant's baseline aerobic capacity. Training will occur in individual sessions supervised by exercise specialists with the appropriate education and experience.

    <description>This is a 26-week aerobic exercise intervention. The primary mode of training is treadmill walking, with the initial speed and duration calibrated to each participant's baseline aerobic capacity. Participants will train 3-4 days per week with the goal of attaining 150+ minutes of exercise per week by the seventh week. Exercise will be set between 50-60% of maximum heart rate reserve for weeks 1-4, 60-70% for weeks 5-8, and 70-80% for weeks 9-26. Exercise duration will be approximately 15-20 minutes per session during the first week and then increase by 5 minutes each week until a duration of approximately 38-50 minutes per session is reached. Each training session will begin with a 5-minute warm-up and end with a 5-minute recovery period.</description>
