  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn whether using body cement on the largest
      part of the vertebra (a procedure called vertebral body cement augmentation) can help to
      prevent a fracture following stereotactic spinal radiosurgery. Researchers also want to learn
      if the procedure can lessen pain and improve quality of life in patients receiving this
      surgery.

      Study Groups:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a
      coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better,
      the same, or worse than the other group.

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive stereotactic spinal radiosurgery alone (the
           standard of care treatment).

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive vertebral body cement augmentation within 4
           weeks before or after your stereotactic spinal radiosurgery.

      You will have an equal chance of being in either group.

      Stereotactic Spinal Radiosurgery:

      Both groups will receive standard of care stereotactic spinal radiosurgery. You will sign a
      separate consent for this that will explain the procedure and the risks.

      Study Procedure:

      If you are in Group 2, your vertebral body cement augmentation will be performed by a
      specialist. You will receive a local anesthetic and mild sedation. A small cut is made in
      your back and, guided by x-ray images, the specialist will inject body cement into the
      largest part of the vertebra to strengthen it. The specialist may also expand the vertebra if
      it is at all collapsed. You will lie flat for several hours. You will most likely be
      discharged on the same day of the procedure, but you may need to stay overnight in the
      hospital.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      No matter which group you are in, you will return to the clinic for follow-up visits every 3
      months for 2 years. At these visits, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to check the status of your spine.

        -  You will complete 3 questionnaires about your quality of life and any pain you may be
           having. The questionnaires should take a total of about 10 minutes to complete.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Your participation in this study will be over after your follow-up visit at 2 years.

      This is an investigational study. Body cement is FDA approved for the treatment of vertebral
      body fractures. It is investigational to study if body cement may prevent vertebral body
      fractures.

      Up to 80 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
