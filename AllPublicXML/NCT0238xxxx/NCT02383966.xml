    <textblock>
      This trial aims to assess efficacy and safety of cetuximab when given in combination with
      chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone in Chinese subjects with recurrent and/or
      metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) as the first-line treatment.

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS) time, as assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 weeks (± 3 days) starting from the first dose of trial treatment until occurrence of PD, assessed up to 60 days after the last tumor assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The duration from the first dose of trial treatment until first observation of progressive disease (PD) (as assessed by an IRC), or death due to any cause when death occurs within 60 days after the last tumor assessment or the first dose of trial treatment (whichever is later). PD is defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on trial; and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or the presence of new lesions.</description>

    <measure>PFS time, as assessed by the Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 weeks (± 3 days) starting from the first dose of trial treatment until occurrence of PD, assessed up to 60 days after the last tumor assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The duration from the first dose of trial treatment until first observation of radiologically confirmed PD (as assessed by the Investigator), or death due to any cause when death occurs within 60 days after the last tumor assessment or the first dose of trial treatment (whichever is later).</description>

    <measure>Overall survival (OS) time</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose of trial treatment to the date of death, assessed up to 12 months after the last subject randomized</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best overall response (BOR) rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 weeks until occurrence of PD, assessed up to 60 days after the last tumor assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The BOR will be based on imaging and classified according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 criteria. The BOR rate is defined as the number of subjects whose BOR was either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), relative to the number of subjects belonging to the trial set of interest. CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeters (mm). PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters without unequivocal worsening of non-target lesions, or detection of new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease control rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 weeks until occurrence of PD, assessed up to 60 days after the last tumor assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The DCR will be based on imaging and classified according to RECIST Version 1.1 criteria. The DCR is defined as the number of subjects whose BOR is either CR, PR or stable disease (SD), divided by the number of subjects belonging to the trial set of interest. SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on trial.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 weeks until occurrence of PD, assessed up to 60 days after the last tumor assessment</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response will be determined for subjects whose BOR was either CR or PR. It is defined as the time from the first assessment of CR or PR until the event defining PFS time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious AEs, AEs Leading to Death and AEs Leading to Discontinuation</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose of trial treatment until 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition, whether or not related to study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
