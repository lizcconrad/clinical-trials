      Phase III clinical trial to study quality of life in prostate cancer patients by randomizing
      anti-androgen versus total androgen blockage prior to curative intended radiation therapy.

    <textblock>
      Primary objective: To study the difference in quality of life in relation to anti-androgen
      versus total androgen blockage.

      Exploratory parameters: ▪ Time to PSA relapse

        -  Time to symptom giving metastasis

        -  Overall survival

      Patients with localized /locally advanced prostate cancer were subject to treatment with
      curative intention. They could be divided into three groups according to the risk of
      metastasis. Mainly intermediate risk group of patients were included in this study. Patients
      with low risk could be included if they were subject to neo-adjuvant hormonal therapy.
      Different risk groups were defined as below:

      Low risk group: PSA ≤10 ng/ml Gleason score ≤ 6 Tumour stage ≤ T2b Intermediate risk group:
      Presence of 1-2 factors of high risk. High risk group: PSA &gt;10 ng/ml Gleason score ≥7 Tumour
      stage T2c - T3b

    <criteria>

        1. Histopathologically verified prostatic adenocarcinoma.

          2. All consecutive patients referred for radiation therapy with combination method i.e.
             both external beam RT and HDR brachytherapy or other fractionation with curative
             intention.

          3. Patients with intermediate risk group of prostate cancer will mainly be included in
             this study where radiotherapy with intention to cure is indicated and possible to
             perform. The intermediate risk group is defined as having 1-2 high risk factors for
             metastasis. Patients with low risk can only be possible to include if there is an
             indication of neo-adjuvant hormonal therapy.

          4. No signs of distant metastasis.

          5. Informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Failure to fulfill inclusion criteria.

          2. Severe hepatic or renal failure, according to clinical and laboratory examinations,
             serum creatinine &gt; 225 mmol/l.

          3. Concomitant diseases that would influence the planned treatment (e.g. Inflammatory
             bowel disease, urinary incontinence, severe atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction
             within last 6 months.

          4. Previous diagnosis of other malignant diseases excluding patients who are free from
             relapse after at least 5 years of diagnosis. Patients with basal cell carcinoma are
             includable.

          5. Inability of the patient to cope with the study rules, due to abuses, mentalstatus or
             other reasons

          6. Participation in other clinical studies at the same time if it considers may hamper
             the assessment of QoL.
