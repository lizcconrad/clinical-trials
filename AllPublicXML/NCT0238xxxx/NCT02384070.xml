  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the routine use of procedural anti-coagulation and anti-platelet therapy for FFR
      calculation, no study has evaluated the optimal anti-thrombotic regimen in patients
      undergoing FFR. Therefore, the aim of the Evaluation of Simplified Anti-Thrombotic Therapy
      for Coronary Fractional Flow Reserve (SMART-FFR) study was to evaluate the safety of using a
      simplified anti-thrombotic regimen with only upstream dual anti-platelet therapy (DAT) with
      aspirin and clopidogrel, compared with anticoagulation plus single- or- DAT therapy in
      patients with intermediate coronary artery stenosis undergoing FFR calculation during
      elective coronary angiography.

    <description>Fractional flow reserve tracings were calculated using a Volcano pressure wire intra-coronary system after ensuring proper calibration of the aortic pressure transducer and the guidewire, using 6 Fr-guide catheters. Before crossing the stenosis, baseline pressure was measured by the guide catheter and the pressure guidewire were equalized according to the manufacturer's specifications. After advancing the pressure sensor across the stenosis, coronary hyperemia was induced using intravenous adenosine (140μg/kg/min until a steady state was reached for at least 3 minutes). Fractional flow reserve was considered positive if it was less than 0.80.</description>

             coronary stenosis in any major native epicardial coronary artery between 50-70%
             determined by quantitative angiography that was an adequate target for FFR at the
             discretion of the operator.
