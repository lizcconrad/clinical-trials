      Aims

        -  assessment of renal artery stenosis incidence in consecutive AMI patients included in
           the Romanian National Programme of Primary Percutaneous Revascularisation;

        -  generating a cardio-renal-metabolic profile in patients with renal atherosclerotic
           disease;

        -  creating a local registry (based on European CARDS percutaneous interventional
           registries) which also includes renal, metabolic and vascular data;

        -  reporting long-term follow-up data on major cardiac adverse events (MACE) in the study
           group.

      Gathered data:

        -  descriptive general demographic data;

        -  previous pathologies (ischemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, heart
           failure, previous percutaneous coronary interventions, coronary artery bypass grafting -
           CABG, known renal disease), cardiovascular risk factors (age, weight, height, abdominal
           perimeter, body mass index, smoking, sedentariness, diabetes, hypertension,
           dyslipidaemia);

        -  routine biological data and specific non-genetic biomarkers;

        -  information regarding primary PCI (less than 12 hours of ischemic symptoms):
           coronarographic details, type of used stent, periprocedural specific complications,
           final TIMI - thrombolysis in myocardial infarction - flow);

        -  echocardiography at admission (LVEF);

        -  metabolic data (obtained from body composition monitoring) - body water, body fat
           tissue;

        -  renal arteries angiographic details (two independent operators evaluate stenosis based
           on a predefined scale);

        -  renal dimensions;

        -  measurement of arterial stiffness through Sphigmocore pulsed-wave-velocity (24 hrs
           post-procedural, 2 velocities: carotid - femoral and carotid - radial);

        -  heart rate variability;

        -  in-hospital and one month follow-up MACE;

    <intervention_name>renal artery angiography</intervention_name>
    <description>preprocedural renal arteriogram is obtained after sterile preparation and draping of the patient, conscious sedation, infiltration of local anesthetic (lidocaine solution) at the femoral access site, placement of an arterial sheath in the femoral artery, and advancement of the renal guide catheter over a 0.035-in guidewire under fluoroscopic guidance. After the tip of the guide catheter is positioned at the ostium of the renal artery, an angiogram is obtained. After the guidewire is removed, the proximal end of the catheter is connected to a manifold, and 4-8 mL of contrast is manually injected during cineangiographic recording. An intravenous antithrombotic agent, usually heparin, is administered before the clinician proceeds with angioplasty.</description>
