  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As recommended in the Guidelines on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infective
      endocarditis (IE) patients with IE should be evaluated and managed by a multispecialty team
      including an cardiologist, infectious disease specialist, and cardiac surgeon. Our registry
      is a prospective, national registry of patients with IE. From January 2013 data from
      endocarditis board were prospectively recorded using standard definitions during the
      hospitalization. Patient demographics, clinical, laboratory, and imaging data at the time of
      IE diagnosis, as well as treatment outcomes were entered into the ER-UHC database.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary endpoint will be the 1 year all-cause mortality after treatment begins of IE. We
      will use 1 year all-cause mortality as the primary endpoint because it has been demonstrated
      that a period of at least 6 months is necessary to offset the early postoperative mortality
      related to valve surgery. We also looked at all-cause in-hospital mortality as a secondary
      endpoint.
