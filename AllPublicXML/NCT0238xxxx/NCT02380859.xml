  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects diagnosed with Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease, between ages of 40-85 inclusive, who
      have been referred for gait training. Since there can be subtle differences in the brain
      organization of left- and right-handed people that may influence some of the measurements,
      right handed participants are preferred. However, a left handed participant may be
      considered. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups to undergo two weeks
      of twice-daily sessions. Group A receiving goggles fitted with lenses that distort vision and
      Group B patients receiving sham goggles

      The participants will be trained to undergo two daily sessions of visual adaptation at home
      for 14 consecutive days. For each adaptation session, subject will sit in a chair within
      reaching distance of a wall or cabinet upon which two dime-sized targets will be placed (one
      above the other, approximately ten inches apart). While wearing goggles, you will point
      rapidly to one target then the next, bringing the hand back to his/her torso between each
      pointing movement. They will be instructed to perform these movements &quot;as quickly as
      possible&quot; for a total of 50 pointing movements in each treatment session. After performing
      the 50 pointing movements, they will remove their goggles. Throughout the treatment period
      they will be asked to keep a diary in which they will log the time and duration of each prism
      adaptation session. At the first and second site visits, participants will be assessed for
      posture, gait and activities of daily living which will include some questionnaires.
      Questionnaires will be sent via mail after post-treatment at one week,1 month and 3 months.

    <description>The clinical assessments will be taken by an experienced physical therapist. One will be aTimed up and Go test - starting from a seated position, the person is required to stand up, walk to a line 10 meters away, turn around, walk back and sit down. Person is timed. A second assessment is the Functional Gait assessment. This is a reliable and valid assessment of assessing ten gait-related measures (e.g. stepping over a box, climbing stairs). A total score out of 30 is calculated, with lower scores indicating greater impairment. An assessment of gait using ActiveStep. This system is a mobility stimulator that enables safe measurement of walking and propensity to fall with and without environmental perturbations. A number of parameters are measured, including trunk extension and flexion velocity and step length and speed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's Disease

          -  Referral for gait training

          -  Aged 40 -85

          -  If the subject is taking CNS-acting medications (benzodiazepines, hypnotics,

          -  Subjects with Stage 11.5 - Stage IV (Hoehn and Yahr scale) where stage II.5 is
             bilateral involvement with axial involvements, but without balance difficulty, to
             Stage IV where one has severe disability but is still able to walk or stand unassisted

             Stability; subjects with Timed up and go test &gt;12 seconds

          -  Right handed participants are preferred due to the cortical lateralization of
             functions related to sensorimotor adaptation and postural control.

          -  However, we will recruit left-handed participants if there are insufficient
             right-handed volunteers.

             compromise participation in the study; subjects with a neurologic diagnosis, other
             than Parkinson's disease that can cause imbalance and gait impairment (e.g., multiple
             sclerosis, stroke, subdural hematoma, peripheral neuropathy)

          -  Injury or impairment to the right arm (other than that which is due to Parkinson's
             disease) that would affect pointing movements; subjects with normal score on UPDRS
             part III

          -  Classified as legally blind or lacking sufficient visual acuity to view the target and
             pointing hand during prism adaptation
