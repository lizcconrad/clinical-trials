    <textblock>
      This study will examine how the supplement Shroom Tech Sport (STS) affects body composition
      and different performance and health measures over the course of 12 weeks. The supplement
      will be combined with a concurrent training regime consisting of resistance and high
      intensity interval training. Subjects will be tested for percent body fat to determine body
      composition. Further, they will also be tested for maximal strength (squat and bench),
      maximal power output and fatigue, lactate threshold and maximal oxygen volume consumption
      (VO2max). And finally, subjects will be tested for health and hormone markers in the blood.
      All of these measures will be compared against a placebo group participating in the same
      exercise intervention.
