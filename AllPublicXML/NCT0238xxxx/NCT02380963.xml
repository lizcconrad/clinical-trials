  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary protein is a key element of most effective weight loss regimens. This study will
      investigate the effects of consuming soy protein on body composition and cardiometabolic
      health within the context of an effective weight loss and maintenance program called the
      Colorado Diet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study comparing the efficacy of inducing weight loss of two treatment
      arms all based on the Colorado Diet. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two study
      arms and instructed to follow the Colorado Diet by participating in weekly State of Slim
      group classes. Subjects will be followed in the study for one year. The Colorado Diet
      consists of 3 phases: phase 1 (week 1-2), phase 2 (weeks 3 - 8), and phase 3 (weeks 9 - 16).
      The maintenance phase lasts from months 5 - 12. Body weight will be monitored at each study
      visit and body composition will be determined using DXA. Blood lipid and lipoprotein
      concentrations, health &amp; wellness questionnaires, and fitness measures will also be assessed
      throughout the study.
