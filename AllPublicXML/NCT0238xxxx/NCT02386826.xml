  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of two agents, INC280 and
      bevacizumab, is safe and effective when administered to patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme
      (GBM) who have progressed after receiving prior therapy or who have unresectable GBM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains an incurable malignancy with a
      short expected survival. c-MET signalling promotes invasive growth and has been described in
      various cancers. INC280 is a highly potent and selective c-MET inhibitor which also
      penetrates the blood-brain barrier. In this open-label, multicenter Phase 1b study,
      investigators determined the optimal dose of the INC280/bevacizumab combination to administer
      to patients. Enrollment has now expanded in order to treat 3 cohorts of GBM patients: those
      who progressed after ≥ first-line standard therapy, those who progressed after ≥ second-line
      therapy with INC280/bevacizumab, and those with unresectable GBM.
