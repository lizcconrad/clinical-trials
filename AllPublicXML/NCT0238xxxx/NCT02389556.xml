  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 are emerging molecules involving lipid metabolism. In previous in vivo
      study using mice, ANGPTL8 regulated the activation of ANGPTL3 which was known to inhibit
      lipoprotein lipase activity and stimulate lipolysis of adipose tissue. Besides, glypican 4
      was identified as a novel adipokine modulating adipocyte differentiation. Thus, the
      investigators postulated that different serum concentrations of ANGPTL3, ANGPTL8 and glypican
      4 might affect progression of obesity in children. The investigators measure these molecules
      in Korean children, and investigate the association between these molecules and development
      of obesity.

      Participants in this study were selected from the Korean Metabolic disorders &amp; Obesity Study
      in Elementary School children (KMOSES), the main aim of which was to comprehensively assess
      obesity-related metabolic risk factors and to evaluate clinical outcomes in Korean children
      prospectively. Korean children who were participated in a school-based health examination,
      were reexamined for the 3-year follow-up assessment.
