      To understand 295 gene mutation mutation status (include EGFR, HER2, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA,ect)
      by deep sequencing in Chinese patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma and their relationships
      with the patients' clinical features (including sex, age, smoking history and adenocarcinoma
      subtype), specify the predictive significance of the genes mutations for new targeted
      therapies in NSCLC patients, and better understand the molecular mechanism drug resistance to
      EGFR-TKIs.

      This study is prospective to identify biomarkers to resistant to afatinibï¼Œgefitinib and
      erlotinib in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Mutations of whole exon of 295 gene are
      analysed by deep sequencing in Chinese patients with non-small cell lung cancer and their
      relationships with the patients' clinical features (including sex, age, smoking history and
      adenocarcinoma subtype), specify the predictive significance of the genes mutations for new
      targeted therapies in NSCLC patients, and better understand the molecular mechanism drug
      resistance to EGFR-TKIs.
