  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study will have been diagnosed with advanced breast cancer that has
      become worse while being treated with fulvestrant. Participants will have estrogen-receptor
      positive disease, and have completed menopause.

      There is information from research labs which suggests that drugs that work like MLN9708 help
      kill breast cancer cells that have been treated with fulvestrant. The purpose of the study is
      to determine the proper dose as well as the good and bad effects of MLN9708 when it is given
      in combination with fulvestrant. The Investigators also want to learn more about how the drug
      combination affects tumor cells.

      The amount of MLN9708 participants receive will be determined by when they enter this study.
      Three different doses will be given to different participants. The Investigators expect to
      enroll a total of 12-18 people.

  <detailed_description>

      Subjects with metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer with disease progression on Fulvestrant, for
      whom continuation of endocrine therapy would be an appropriate treatment, will be treated
      with the combination of MLN9708 (proteasome inhibitor) and Fulvestrant (anti-estrogen).
      Subjects with visceral or soft tissue disease will have a tumor biopsy while on treatment
      with Fulvestrant but prior to initiation of MLN9708 to confirm ER/PR/HER2 status, and to
      provide a baseline specimen for molecular analysis. A biopsy of the same tumor will be
      obtained after 2 days of treatment with MLN9708 plus Fulvestrant (i.e. on day 3). Patients
      with bone-only disease will be eligible for the study, but will not be biopsied.

      The Investigators propose a 3x3 dose-escalation trial to assess the safety and efficacy of
      Fulvestrant and three dose levels of MLN9708 (2.3, 3, and 4mg) Subjects will be treated with
      Fulvestrant (500mg) once every four weeks on day 1. The dose of MLN9708 will start at 2.3mg,
      which is about 50% of the phase 3 dose in another ongoing study. If 2.3mg MLN9708 does not
      induce any grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity, or any grade 4 hematologic toxicity by CTCAE
      v4.0 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0) in any of the 3 subjects
      treated for 1 cycle, the Investigators will treat another 3 subjects with the combination of
      Fulvestrant and MLN9708 (3mg); and if no grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity, or any grade 4
      hematologic toxicity by CTCAE v4.0 is seen over the first cycle, the Investigators will treat
      another 3 subjects with Fulvestrant and MLN9708 (4mg, which is the phase 3 dose). If
      dose-limiting toxicity is observed in 1/3 subjects, the Investigators will treat an
      additional 3 subjects at that same dose. If dose-limiting toxicity is seen in 2 of 6 subjects
      at any dose level, that dose level will be considered the maximum tolerated dose, and a total
      of 6 subjects will be treated at the prior dose. Plasma pharmacokinetic profiles of MLN9708
      will be determined over 21 days after the first dose of the combination.

      Pre- and post- treatment tumor biopsies will be formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Tissue
      sections will be analyzed by H&amp;E (Hematoxylin and eosin) staining and immunohistochemistry
      using antibodies against markers of proliferation, apoptosis, estrogen receptor alpha
      activation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and polyubiquitin. Proteasome activity of whole
      blood will be determined using samples acquired prior to treatment initiation, and on day 3.
      Tumor-specific plasma DNA will also be measured prior to treatment initiation and after the
      first two doses of MLN9708.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female post-menopausal patients 18 years or older. Voluntary written consent must be
             given before performance of any study related procedure not part of standard medical
             care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time
             without prejudice to future medical care.

          2. Patients must have either A) histologic documentation of metastatic or locally
             advanced breast cancer by needle or incisional biopsy, or B) history of breast cancer
             with radiologic evidence of bone-only metastatic disease.

          3. Patients must be post-menopausal based on either a history of an oophorectomy, or at
             lease one year of amenorrhea. An elevated serum gonadotropin level can be used to
             confirm menopausal status in a subject with one year or more of amenorrhea.

          4. The invasive cancer must be HER2-negative, defined as IHC0-1+, or with a FISH ratio of
             &lt;1.8 if IHC is 2+ or if IHC has not been performed.

          5. Metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer for which endocrine therapy is an
             appropriate treatment option.

          6. Patients must have been treated with Fulvestrant for at least 56 days as their most
             recent anti-cancer treatment, and they must be tolerating Fulvestrant with at most
             grade I toxicity by CTCAE v4.0.

          7. Disease progression based on RECIST criteria while the subject has been taking
             Fulvestrant, and for which continuation of endocrine therapy would be appropriate.

          8. The subject must agree to undergo pre- and post- treatment research biopsies if a
             non-osseous metastatic site is available for biopsy.

          9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1

               -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/mm(3) and platelet count ≥75,000/mm(3)

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal range (ULN).

               -  Alanine aminotranserase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 x ULN.

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min

             of prior chemotherapy or endocrine therapy, except for Grade 2 or greater anemia.

          2. Major surgery within 14 days before enrollment.

          3. Radiotherapy within 14 days before enrollment. If the involved field is small, 7 days
             will be considered a sufficient interval between treatment and administration of the
             MLN9708.

          4. Central nervous system involvement.

          5. Infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy or other serious infection within 14
             days before study enrollment.
