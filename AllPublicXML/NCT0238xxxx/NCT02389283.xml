  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by intra and
      peri-articular synovial inflammation. Synovitis can damage the articular cartilage, bones,
      joint capsule, tendons and ligaments leading to the consequential functional joint
      deterioration.

      The main goal of RA treatment is to achieve disease remission. The treatment of RA consists
      of synthetic and biologic disease modifying drugs (DMARDs), being the second ones selected
      when low disease or remission is not achieved with the first ones. Therapeutic response
      monitoring in RA should be closely managed. It is classically based on clinical exploration
      and laboratory tests. During the last decade, the resolution improvement of musculoskeletal
      ultrasound (MSUS) imaging has led to the gradual incorporation of this technique in the
      evaluation and monitoring of patients with RA, mainly due to its better capacity to detect
      synovitis than clinical exploration . Ultrasound imaging is highly available, non-invasive,
      reproducible, affordable and well accepted by patients. Ultrasound doppler mode detects
      pathological synovial flow, which reflects synovial inflammation and has a demonstrated
      sensitivity to change in multiple longitudinal studies. Sonographic evaluation of patients
      with RA includes the detection of synovitis in B and Doppler mode in the joints accessible by
      ultrasound. There has been high variability in the literature regarding the number of joints
      that should be evaluated for an appropriate monitoring of the RA patients. The validity for
      monitoring the therapeutic response in long standing RA has been demonstrated in three
      reduced joint counts, including 12, 7 and 6 joints. However, in shorter evolution RA, the
      sensitivity to change of any of these reduced ultrasound evaluations has never been studied

      Primary objectives

      • To evaluate the sensitivity to change of the Doppler Ultrasound evaluation of 12, 7 and 6
      joints counts in RA patients with more than 6 months and less than 5 years of evolution,
      which initiate an effective treatment for the disease according to indication (biologic DMARD
      in monotherapy or combined with methotrexate).

Second and third metacarpophalangeal (dorsal recess)
Second and third proximal interphalangeal of hands (dorsal and palmar recesses)

        Rheumatoid arthritis patients with more than 6 months and less than 5 years of active
        evolution (DAS28 &gt; 3.2 or SDAI &gt; 11) and which start treatment with biologic therapy for
