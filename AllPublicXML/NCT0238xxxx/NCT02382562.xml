  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression and other unhealthy behaviors, such as not taking medication as prescribed and not
      attending doctor visits have been suggested to increase the worsening of allergic diseases
      (e.g. asthma, urticaria). We intend to determine whether a one-session behavioral
      intervention is effective in helping with depression and controlling disease symptoms. We
      will measure this using pre- and post-intervention surveys.

      The purpose of this research study is to investigate whether a one-session behavioral
      activation intervention for depression can successfully reduce depression and improve asthma
      or urticaria disease-relevant outcomes (medication adherence, doctor's visits, substance
      abuse) in clinical patients with asthma or urticaria who report heightened levels of
      depression and are seen in the UMMC Allergy Clinic.
