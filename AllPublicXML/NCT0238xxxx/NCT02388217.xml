      This is a prospective, observational, open-label study carried out at the ambulatory pain
      clinic of Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center Pain Relief Unit.

      Study population: Patients suffering from chronic pain that has not been relieved with other
      analgesic medications, who are eligible for treatment with medical cannabis (cigarettes, oil
      or cookies) following approval of Israeli Ministry of health.The patients will receive a
      prescription to be dispensed at pre-approved cannabis distribution points by a certified
      provider.

      In this study, the efficacy of the cannabis treatment on pain and related quality of life
      (QoL) outcomes will be assessed by administering the S-TOPS questionnaire (Haroutiunian, Pain
      2012), and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) before the treatment (baseline), and on expected
      follow-up visits at approximately 6 and 12 months.
