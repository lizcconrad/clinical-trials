  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current etiological pathological model of anorexia nervosa is poly-factorial involving
      individual genetic and psychological factors, in close interaction with environmental, family
      and socio-cultural factors.

      Among these factors, this study focuses on the central coherence process (cognitive ability
      to integrate complex information into a comprehensive meaning), in the active phase of the
      disease. Therefore, patients followed in the addiction service of the Nantes University
      Hospital will perform neuropsychological tests assessing executive functions involved in the
      process of central coherence.

      Impairment of central coherence process could act as a maintenance factor of the disease,
      particularly in connection with body dysmorphic disorder. The therapeutic perspectives acting
      on the central coherence process like cognitive remediation deserve to deepen knowledge on
      the cognitive profile of patients with anorexia nervosa.
