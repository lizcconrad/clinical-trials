  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare the Softform Premier mattress (in static mode)
      and AIRSOFT DUO mattresses in terms of skin pressures measured at the sacral area.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to compare the two devices in terms of:

      A. contact surface. B. heel pressure. C. On the occurrence of pressure ulcers anywhere on the
      body at month 1. D. patient comfort after 1 month (visual analog scale ranging from 1 to 10).

    <description>Patients randomized to this arm will be placed on the Airsoft Duo mattress, and the investigator will proceed with 2 series (for reproductibility) of measures for 30 minutes with the bed headboard at 0°. A pause, consisting of ten minutes of sitting and 1 minute of verticalization is then carried out. The bed is then positioned at 30°, and the 2 series of measures over 30 minutes are repeated. The next day, all of the above are repeated with the Softform Premium mattress (in static mode). The patient will then continue his/her stay with the Softform Premium mattress (in static mode) for 1 month.
