  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present aim is to perform at small clinical safety trial in heart failure patients with
      allogeneic adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with heart failure will be treated with culture expanded adipose tissue derived
      mesenchymal stem cells from healthy donors stored in nitrogen until use. The cells will be
      injected directly into the myocardium using the NOGA XP method.

      The patients will be followed for 6 months for safety and efficacy registration.

             angiography less than one month before inclusion or at least four months after the
             intervention to rule out early restenosis

             cerebral ischemia within six weeks of inclusion

          3. Other revascularisation treatment within four months of treatment

          4. Moderate to severe valvular disease or valvular disease with option for valvular
             surgery

          5. Diminished functional capacity for other reasons such as: coronary obstructive
             pulmonary disease (COPD) with forced expiratory volume (FEV) &lt;1 L/min, moderate to
             severe claudication or morbid obesity

          6. Clinical significant anaemia, leukopenia, leukocytosis or thrombocytopenia

          7. Clinically significant abnormal prothrombin or partial thromboplastin time or
             anticoagulation treatment that cannot be paused during cell injections

          8. Patients with reduced immune response or treated with immunosuppressive medication

          9. History with malignant disease within five years of inclusion or suspected malignity -
             except treated skin cancer other than melanoma

         10. Pregnant women

         11. Other experimental treatment within four weeks of baseline tests

         12. Participation in another intervention trial
