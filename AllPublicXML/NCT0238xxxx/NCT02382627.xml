      This study plans to learn more about the thickness of the choroid in patients with optic
      neuropathy. The choroid is a layer of blood vessels that supplies oxygen and nourishment to
      the outer layers of the retina. Patients are being asked to be in this research study because
      they have optic neuropathy and are receiving care at the University of Colorado Hospital.
