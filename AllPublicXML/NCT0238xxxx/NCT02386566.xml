  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the association between prospectively
      measured disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS]) with quality of life (Multiple
      Sclerosis International Quality of Life Questionnaire [MusiQoL]) at 3-month intervals up to 1
      year in a real life setting of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients treated with natalizumab. The
      secondary objectives of this study are as follows: To evaluate the cumulative probability of
      sustained EDSS changes at 1 year following natalizumab treatment initiation; To evaluate the
      association between disability (EDSS), fatigue (Fatigue Scale of Motor and Cognitive Function
      [FSMC]), sexual dysfunction (Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire-19
      [MSISQ-19]), depression (Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen [BDI-FS]) and neurocognitive
      function (Symbol Digit Modalities Test [SDMT]) with EuroQol-5D Questionnaire (EQ-5D) at 3 to
      6-months intervals up to 1 year after initiation of natalizumab treatment; To assess the
      relationship between clinical disease-free status (no EDSS increase of 1.0 and no relapse)
      and MusiQoL at 1 year following natalizumab treatment initiation; To record the number of
      clinical relapses and relapses requiring steroid treatment at 3-months intervals up to 1 year
      after initiation of natalizumab treatment; To describe changes in work impairment (Work
      Productivity and Activity Impairment in MS [WPAI-MS]) at 3-months intervals up to 1 year
      after initiation of natalizumab treatment; To describe any change in the percentage of
      disability pension and occupation after 1 year of natalizumab treatment; To record the
      incidence and number of Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse
      Reactions (SUSAR) throughout the study

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare EDSS change categories with changes in MusiQoL</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 year after initiating natalizumab treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. Scoring is based on measures of impairment in eight functional systems on examination by a neurologist. The MusiQOL is a multidimensional Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) instrument that provides information based on the views and perceptions of the participants.</description>

    <measure>Compare EDSS change categories with EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year after initiating natalizumab treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a two-part instrument that consists of the following administered together: 1) EQ-5D-5L- The descriptive system comprises the same 5 dimensions as the EQ-5D-3L (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension now has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. EQ-VAS describes the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical visual analog scale (VAS).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare FSMC score with EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year after initiating natalizumab treatment</time_frame>
    <description>FSMC provides differential quantification and graduation of cognitive and motor fatigue. The total score ranges from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating more fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Compare MSISQ-19 scores with EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year after initiating natalizumab treatment</time_frame>
    <description>MSIS-Q is a 19-question survey to assess sexual QoL in MS patients. The scoring is based on a scale ranging from 1 (never interfered with my sexual activity or satisfaction) to 5 (always interfered with my sexual activity or satisfaction).</description>

    <measure>Comparison of BDI-FS with EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year after initiating natalizumab treatment</time_frame>

    <measure>Compare SDMT scores with EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year after initiating natalizumab treatment</time_frame>
    <description>SDMT is a screening test for cognitive impairment. It assesses key neurocognitive functions that underlie many substitution tasks, including attention, visual scanning, and motor speed. SDMT scores are highly correlated to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) derived measures of disease burden and disability progression in MS patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the WPAI questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year after initiating natalizumab treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI questionnaire is a validated instrument to measure impairments in work and activities. The WPAI yields four types of scores: 1. Absenteeism (work time missed) 2. Presenteesism (impairment at work / reduced on-the-job effectiveness) 3. Work productivity loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus presenteeism) 4. Activity Impairment. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>
