  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 70 patients with HR+ advanced breast cancer will be enrolled. All patients will
      receive either fulvestrant (500 mg IM every 2 weeks x 3 then every four weeks) or tamoxifen
      (20 mg PO daily by physician choice). Pre-menopausal women must be in chemical menopause.

      Arm 1 will receive palbociclib 100 mg qd, days 1-21 every 28 days. Arm 2 will receive
      palbociclib 125 mg qd, days 1-21 every 28 days. Restaging will be performed every 8 weeks.
      Therapy will be continued until PD or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to take either 100 mg or 125 mg of
      palbociclib. Randomized treatment assignments will be made by permuted blocks, generated by
      our collaborating statistician at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, including recent or
             active suicidal ideation or behavior, or laboratory abnormality that may increase the
             risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or
             may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.

          -  Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) (Phases 1-4) within 2
             weeks before randomization the current study.
