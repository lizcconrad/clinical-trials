  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic constipation is a strong public health problem. Its prevalence is about 15% in
      Western countries with a significant impact on quality of life and health care costs . Two
      subtypes of constipation can be identified: slow transit constipation (STC), characterized by
      impaired propulsion of stool and due to dysfunction of colonic smooth muscle (myopathy) or
      its innervation (neuropathy), or both; and evacuation disorders, characterized by difficulty
      or inability with stool expulsion. They include disorders of the anorectal function such as
      dyssynergic defecation, as well as structural disorders such as rectocele, descending
      perineum syndrome and rectal prolapse .

      The first line therapy of chronic constipation is based on medical treatment combined with
      laxatives and dietary rules. However, these treatments are often disappointing. In case of
      failure, few treatment options are currently available. Surgery can sometimes be discussed
      for intractable chronic constipation. Sub-total colectomy can be proposed in case of STC but
      is associated with a significant morbidity. In case of pelvic floor disorders, a specific
      surgical treatment can be indicated. However, surgery is invasive, has a significant
      morbidity and the results are inconsistent. Recently, some studies have assessed the efficacy
      of sacral neuromodulation in the treatment of chronic constipation with some success, but
      this technique is expensive and requires the surgical implantation of a medical device . More
      recent works, including a randomized trial have showed, in children, the efficacy of
      interferential current stimulation in the treatment of chronic transit constipation . This
      treatment is used daily, at home, and uses four adhesive surface electrodes, two abdominal
      (placed below the costal margin) and two paraspinal (placed between T9 and L2) producing two
      sinusoidal currents crossing the body, 1 hour per day for 1-3 months. To date, only one
      open-label study has evaluated this technique in adults and has shown encouraging results in
      three months with an efficiency on 7/11 patients (63.6%) in the number of stools, severity
      score of constipation, quality of life's score associated with improved bowel transit time
      measured by radio-markers.

      Interferential therapy is a new treatment that has demonstrated its efficiency in the
      treatment of chronic constipation in children. Our team has published the first and only
      pilot study in adults that also demonstrated encouraging results. These data are of
      particular interest since laxative treatments are often disappointing, are expensive and may
      have adverse events.

      This study would be the first randomized study to evaluate a non-invasive and
      non-pharmacological treatment of chronic constipation in adults.

      If its effectiveness is demonstrated, it will provide, for the first time, a new non-invasive
      step for patients with laxative treatment failure before considering surgical treatment.
