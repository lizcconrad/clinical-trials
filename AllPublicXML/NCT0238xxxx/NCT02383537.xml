      The aim of the research is to study the effect of miRNA, fat tissue and insulin resistance on
      the pathophysiology of diabetes during pregnancy. During the study fat tissue, Umbilical cord
      blood, placenta tissue and subcutaneous fat will be taken from pregnant diabetic woman over
      going a C-section. Healthy pregnant women will serve as a control group.

      The aim of the research is to study the effect of miRNA, fat tissue and insulin resistance on
      the pathophysiology of diabetes during pregnancy. During the study:

        1. fat tissue, Umbilical cord blood, placenta tissue and subcutaneous fat will be taken
           from pregnant diabetic woman over going a C-section.

        2. Bloods will be analyzed for insulin, c-peptide, glucose and fat profile

        3. Placenta and fat tissue will be analyzed for miRNA and total RNA

        4. Clinical and anthropometric measurements will be taken from the mother

        5. Placenta status will be taken
