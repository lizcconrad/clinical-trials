      Objective : To assess the analgesic effect of maternal breast milk odor in preterm neonates
      Design : A prospective, randomised, controlled, double blinded, monocentric trial.

      Méthods : The neonates were included from 01/01/2012 to 31/12/2014. Inclusion criteria were:
      neonates fed with their mother breast milk, gestational age between 30 weeks of amenorrhea
      and 36 weeks + 6 days, a postnatal age ≤ 10 days and a birth weight greater than the 5th
      percentile according to Olsen curves et al. They also had to be: clinically stable, with 48
      hours withdrawal of nasal CPAP, without administration of any analgesic or sedative drug in
      the last 48 hours and without any underlying disease. The two legal representatives must have
      signed an informed consent. The study excluded the neonates for whom no video was recorded
      during the venipuncture.

      In the first group &quot;breast milk&quot;, venipuncture was performed to the neonate while his
      mother's milk odor was being diffused. In a second control group, the same gesture was made
      with an odorless diffusor. The primary outcome was the clinical score assessment PIPP
      (Premature Infant Pain Profile). The secondary outcomes were the DAN score (Acute Pain of
      Newborn) and the salivary cortisol level.
