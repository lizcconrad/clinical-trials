      Background : Patient with hypoxemic respiratory failure treated with NIV receive between NIV
      session oxygen therapy. Gaz exchange disorder with a decrease of the ratio between Partial
      Pressure of Arterial Oxygen (PaO2) and Inspired Fraction of Oxygen (FIO2) are noticed when
      NIV is stopped at the end of the session du to alveolar derecruitment Optiflow is a high flow
      oxygen delivery system used a heated humidifier and heated breathing circuit. In
      observational studies, Optiflow increase oxygenation of patients with hypoxemic respiratory
      failure. Oxygenation is better than under high-concentration mask and work of breathing is
      reduced.

      The aim of the study is to compare in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, optiflow to oxygen
      therapy under high-concentration mask, on patients oxygenation between NIV sessions (measured
      as the difference between PaO2/FiO2 ratio at the beginning and at the end of the session),
      during the first two NIV sessions

      Study design : Prospective, randomized, controlled, multicentric, open clinical trial with
      two groups:

        -  control group with conventional clinical management, oxygen therapy and sequential used
           of NIV

        -  Optiflow group with high flow oxygen delivery system, conventional clinical management
           and sequential used of NIV for a period of 36 hours at least.

      Number of subjects: 100 (50 patients per group) patients admitted in intensive Care Unit for
      hypoxemic respiratory failure.

    <description>Average of oxygenation differences measured as the delta between PaO2/FiO2 ratio at the end of the first NIV session and at the end of the first oxygen therapy session (according group of treatment) on the one hand and on the other hand the delta between PaO2/FiO2 ratio at the end of the second NIV session and at the end of the second oxygen thrapy session
Five measurements of PaO2/FiO2 ratio are realized with arterial blood gases:
at the time of inclusion,
at the time of the end of first NIV session,
at the time of the end of first oxygen therapy session, or at the time of rescue NIV or at the time of r√©intubation
at the time of the end of second NIV session,
at the time of the end of second oxygen therapy session These five measurements are usually realised, and they are important to optimize patient management. The primary endpoint is based on these five measurements.</description>
