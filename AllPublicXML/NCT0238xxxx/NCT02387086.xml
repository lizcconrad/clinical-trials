    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether thalidomide can improve the effectiveness
      of the gefitinib in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations.

    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To determine the 1 year progression-free survival(PFS) rate of the combination of thalidomide
      with gefitinib in patients who harbors EGFR mutations.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the objective response rate and 2 years overall survival of this combination
           therapy;

        2. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of this combination therapy;

        3. To acquire preliminary data regarding the effects of thalidomide on interleukin-2 level
           in serum.

      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Thalidomide starting at a dose of 50mg
      QD at night. After one week, increase the dose to 100mg QD at night.

      Aspirin will be administered at 100mg QD continuously. Gefitinib will be administered at
      250mg QD continuously. Maintenance Therapy patients responding to this therapy will be
      maintained with gefitinib、thalidomide and aspirin.

      Duration of Therapy

      In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until one of
      the following criteria applies:

        1. Disease progression,

        2. Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,

        3. Unacceptable adverse events(s),

        4. Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or

        5. General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Patients must have an international normalized ratio (INR) &lt; 1.5 and a partial
             thromboplastin time (PTT) no greater than upper limits of normal within 1 week prior
             to randomization.

          -  Patients with a history of hypertension must be well-controlled (&lt;150 systolic/&lt;100

          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation. Prophylactic anticoagulation of venous
             access devices is allowed provided Section 3.10 is met. Caution should be taken on
             treating patients with low dose heparin or low molecular weight heparin for DVT
             prophylaxis during treatment with bevacizumab as there may be an increased risk of
             bleeding.

          -  Patients cannot administer aspirin for the risk of bleeding or having stomach ulcers.

          -  Prior use of chemotherapy.

          -  Patients receiving immunotherapy, hormonal-therapy and or radiotherapy within 2 weeks
             prior to entering the study. Note: Those who have not recovered from adverse events
             due to these agents administered will be considered ineligible.

          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled brain metastasis. Note: Patients with brain metastases must
             have stable neurologic status following local therapy (surgery or radiation) for at
             least 2 weeks, and must be without neurologic dysfunction that would confound the
             evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar
             chemical or biologic composition to thalidomide、gefitinib and aspirin or other agents
             used in the study are excluded.

          -  Women that are pregnant or breastfeeding Note: Pregnant women are excluded from this
             study because the agents used in this study may be teratogenic to a fetus. Because
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary
             to treatment of the mother with thalidomide, breastfeeding women are also excluded
             from this study.

          -  HIV-positive Patients that are on combination antiretroviral therapy due to the
             potential for lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.
