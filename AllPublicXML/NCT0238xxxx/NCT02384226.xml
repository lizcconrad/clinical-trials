  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Refine content and delivery of the mHealth delivered lifestyle intervention program through
      iterative testing with small groups of users who provide feedback through on-line
      asynchronous focus groups.

      Participants are asked to:

        -  Use mobile app for 4 weeks

        -  Receive support from the lifestyle coach

        -  Provide weekly and ongoing feedback via an online asynchronous user group platform on
           usability, navigability, acceptability, and satisfaction.

    <measure>Usability of the Application</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Usability is defined via Young's Mobile Phone Usability Questionnaire (MPUQ) as how easy the app is to use and how easy it is to learn. The investigators will assess components of usability including: 1) learnability (how easy is it to accomplish basic tasks the first time the app is used?); 2) efficiency (once users can use the app, how quickly can they perform tasks?); 3) memorability (if a user returns to an app after not using it for some time, how easy is it to re-establish proficiency?); 4) errors (how many, how severe, how easy to recover?); and 5) satisfaction (how pleasant is it to use the app?).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Engagement with the Application</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The quantitative assessment of the daily use of the mobile application, including the response to prompts, interactions with lifestyle coach, points earned, and tracking of weight, diet, and physical activity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Navigability of the Application</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Navigability is defined via Young's Mobile Phone Usability Questionnaire (MPUQ) as whether people can easily and quickly find what they need. The investigators will assess components of navigability including: 1) Is it relatively easy to move from one part of a task to another? 2) Are the operations of this application (app) simple and uncomplicated? 3) Does the app enable the quick, effective, and economical performance of tasks? 4) Is it easy to access the information that you need? 5) Does the app have all the functions and capabilities you expect it to have? 6) Is it easy to navigate between menus and content?</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of the Application</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability is defined whether the intended audience finds the content accessibleâ€”meaning that it is written in a way that is easily understood and resonant for this population of postpartum women.</description>
