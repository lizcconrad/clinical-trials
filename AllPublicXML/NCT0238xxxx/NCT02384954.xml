  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II, open-label, multi-center, competitive enrollment and dose escalation
      study of ALT-803 in patients with relapse/refractory indolent B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in
      conjunction with rituximab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, identify the Maximum
      Tolerated Dose (MTD) or the Minimum Efficacious Dose (MED) and designate a dose level for
      Phase 2. Also characterize the immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic profile, and biomarker serum
      levels of ALT-803 in treated patients.

      The effect of ALT-803 on the peripheral absolute lymphocyte counts and white blood cell
      counts, the number, phenotype and repertoire of peripheral blood T (total and subsets) and NK
      cells will be evaluated. In addition, a subset of patients will be evaluated for changes in
      lymph node immune composition. Anti-tumor responses and survival data will also be collected
      in this trial.
