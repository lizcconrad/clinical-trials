  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry is to evaluate long-term clinical events in patients with acute
      myocardial infarction who were treated with percutaneous coronary intervention.

      Although numerous articles have been published by using nationwide Korean myocardial
      infarction registries, such as the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry (KAMIR),
      limitation of previous registries is that these have little data beyond the first year of MI.
      Therefore, current registry was designed to assess long-term clinical events in patients with
      acute myocardial infarction.

      Because most of myocardial infarction patients were treated by revascularization in real
      world of Korea, this registry limits the inclusion criteria to patients who were treated with
      percutaneous coronary intervention to reduce the bias.

      Cardiovascular center with high-volume percutaneous coronary intervention of following
      hospitals were participated.

        -  Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, Seoul, South Korea

        -  Yeoido St. Mary's Hospital, Seoul, South Korea

        -  Uijongbu St. Mary's Hospital, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea

        -  St. Paul Hospital, Seoul, South Korea

        -  Bucheon St. Mary's Hospital, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea

        -  Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, Incheon, South Korea

        -  St. Vincent Hospital, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea

        -  Deajon St. Mary's Hospital, Daejeon, South Korea

        -  Cheonnam University Hospital, Gwangju, South Korea

           8 hospitals of the Catholic University of Korea already have web-based coronary
           intervention registry (NCT01239914). And Cheonnam University Hospital is one of leading
           hospitals to design and manage the web-based previous Korean nationwide myocardial
           infarction registry, such as such as the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry
           (KAMIR) (http://www.kamir.or.kr/).

      All consecutive acute myocardial infarction patients had been enrolled in each registries
      prospectively.

      Using these previous data, current registry update new clinical and angiographic variables
      and assess long-term clinical follow-up data retrospectively.
