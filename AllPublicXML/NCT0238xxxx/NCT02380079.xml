      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and clinical effects of SCD-101 when
      given to adults with sickle cell disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is single site, dose- escalation study of SCD-101 in participants with homozygous sickle
      cell disease (S/S) or S/beta 0 Thalassemia. All participants will be monitored for safety,
      tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities.

      The study is divided into two parts. Part A is an open-label, non-randomized,
      non-placebo-controlled dose escalation study with a 28-day treatment phase and 14-day
      follow-up phase with five cohorts . Part B is a randomized, placebo-controlled, confirmatory
      2x2 crossover cohort with a 28 day washout between periods, and a 28-day follow-up phase.
