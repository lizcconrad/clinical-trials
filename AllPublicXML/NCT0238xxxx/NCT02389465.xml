  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 18% of Americans aged 65 years and older have depression. Recent evidence suggests that
      there is a link between depression and inflammatory disease. This study investigates the
      relationship between inflammation in the brain and depression. Comparing biological and
      psychological differences in depressed and non-depressed people allows researchers to find
      better ways to treat and prevent depression. All participants will have: neuropsychological
      tests, an EKG, a spinal tap, a blood draw, and, if depressed, given either an antidepressant
      coupled with an anti-inflammatory medication or an anti-depressant coupled with a placebo for
      six weeks. The investigators are trying to correlate brain function with depression levels
      and biomarkers from the blood and spinal fluid.
