  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. In the US, it is
      estimated that as many as 3 million adults may suffer from the disease. Fortunately in the
      last few years, a shift in strategy toward the earlier institution of disease modifying drugs
      and the availability of new classes of medications have greatly improved the outcomes that
      can be expected by most patients.

      The goal of treatment now aims toward achieving the lowest possible level of arthritis
      disease activity and even remission, if possible as early on as possible. Research has shown
      that this translates into minimized joint damage and enhanced physical function and quality
      of life for the RA patient. This also requires that a diagnosis of RA be made as early on as
      possible, and herein lies the challenge, i.e. identifying the RA patient early on in the
      course of their disease.

        Most patients will have been referred by their primary care providers (PCP) for an
        expedited assessment and all will have met inclusion criteria. If the patient is
        appropriate for inclusion into the cohort, the study will be explained to the patient by
        the rheumatologist or designate. If he/she is interested, the information sheet and consent
        form will be reviewed with the study nurse or coordinator and consent will be obtained. As
        this is a study of usual care, study data is the information collected during regular
        clinic visits. Therefore, the patient will be consenting to have the data from their
        regular assessments entered into the study database. A schedule of regular visits has been
        identified in advance in keeping with best clinical practice and management of ERA.
