  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the persistence of immune response against the three
      pertussis antigens (anti- pertussis toxoid (PT), anti-filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and
      anti-pertactin (PRN)) in subjects who received a booster dose of either aP or Tdap study
      vaccines or BoostrixÂ® during V113_01 study.

      There was only one Clinic Visit at day 1. Eligible subjects went undergo a single blood draw
      after which they were observed for approximately 15 minutes. Approximately 10.0 mL of blood
      was withdrawn.

      No vaccine was administered and no safety data was collected in this study.

        <description>Geometric Mean Ratios of anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN antibody were calculated to measure the changes in immunogenicity concentrations within subjects from all V113_01 time points to V113_01E1 day 1.
Note: The mean and confidence intervals of Licensed Tdap for the same antigen can be different (from aP to Tdap table) since two different statistical model were fitted within each antigen: one with aP and Licensed Tdap groups and one with Tdap and Licensed Tdap groups.</description>

        <description>Geometric Mean Ratios of anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN antibody were calculated to measure the changes in immunogenicity concentrations within subjects from all V113_01 time points to V113_01E1 day 1.
Note: The mean and confidence intervals of Licensed Tdap for the same antigen can be different (from aP to Tdap table) since two different statistical model were fitted within each antigen: one with aP and Licensed Tdap groups and one with Tdap and Licensed Tdap groups.</description>
