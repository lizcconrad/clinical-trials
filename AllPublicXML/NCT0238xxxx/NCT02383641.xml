      Wolman disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by complete absence of an enzyme
      known as lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA or LAL). This enzyme is required to breakdown
      (metabolize) lipids in the body. Without the LIPA enzyme, lipids may abnormally accumulate in
      the tissues and organs of the body causing a variety of symptoms. Wolman disease may cause
      bloating or swelling of the stomach (abdominal distention), vomiting, and significant
      hepatosplenomegaly. Life-threatening complications often develop during early childhood.
      Wolman disease is caused by mutations of the lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA) gene. The disorder
      is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.Wolman disease is the most severe expression of
      LIPA deficiency. Milder forms of the disorder are known as cholesteryl ester storage
      deficiency. The symptoms of Wolman disease usually become apparent shortly after birth,
      usually during the first few weeks of life. Affected infants may develop bloating or
      abdominal distention and may have significant hepatosplenomegaly. Fibrosis of the liver may
      also occur. In some cases, fluid may accumulate in the abdominal cavity (ascites).Infants
      with Wolman disease have serious digestive abnormalities including malabsorption, a condition
      in which the intestines fail to absorb nutrients and calories form food. Malabsorption
      associated with Wolman disease causes persistent and often forceful vomiting, frequent
      diarrhea, foul-smelling, fatty stools (steatorrhea) and malnutrition. Because of these
      digestive complications, affected infants usually fail to grow and gain weight at the
      expected rate for their age and sex (failure to thrive).

      Hepatosplenomegaly and protrusion of the abdomen can cause umbilical hernia, a condition in
      which the contents of the stomach may push through an abnormal opening or tear in the
      abdominal wall near the bellybutton. Additional symptoms may also occur in Wolman disease
      including yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes and whites of the eyes (jaundice), a
      persistent low-grade fever, and poor muscle tone (hypotonia). Infants may exhibit delays in
      the development of motor skills.

      A distinct finding associated with Wolman disease is the hardening of adrenal gland tissue
      due to the accumulation of calcium (calcification). The adrenal glands are located on top of
      the kidneys and produce epinephrine and norepinephrine. Other hormones produced by the
      adrenal glands help to regulate the fluid and electrolyte balance in the body. Calcification
      of the adrenal glands is not detectable by physical examination, but can be seen with x-ray
      study. Calcification may prevent the adrenal glands from producing enough essential hormones
      and can affect metabolism, blood pressure, the immune system and other vital processes of the
      body.

      Infants with Wolman disease may experience the loss of previously acquired skills required
      the coordination of muscle and motor skills (psychomotor regression). The symptoms of Wolman
      disease often get progressively worse eventually leading to life-threatening complications
      during infancy including extremely low levels of circulating red blood cells (severe anemia),
      hepatic dysfunction or failure, and physical wasting away and severe weakness often
      associated with chronic disease and marked by weight loss and loss of muscle mass (cachexia
      or inanition).

      Wolman disease is caused by mutation of the lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA) gene. It is
      inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Genetic diseases are determined by the combination
      of genes for a particular trait that are on the chromosomes received from the father and the
      mother. The LIPA gene contains instructions for producing the enzyme lysosomal lipase acid.
      This enzyme is essential for metabolizing certain fats in the body, especially cholesterol
      (specifically cholesteryl esters) and to lesser degree triglycerides. Without proper levels
      of this enzyme, these fats abnormally accumulate in and damage various tissues and organs of
      the body. Mutations of the LIPA gene result in the lack of production of the LIPA enzyme or
      production of a defective, inactive form of the LIPA enzyme. Wolman disease is an extremely
      rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. More than 50 cases have been
      reported in the medical literature. However, cases may go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed making
      it difficult to determine the disorder's true frequency in the general population. Wolman
      disease is named after one of the physicians who first identified the disorder in the medical
      literature in 1956.

      Symptoms of the following disorders can be similar to those of Wolman disease. Comparisons
      may be useful for a differential diagnosis.

      Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by
      deficiency or inactivity of an enzyme known as lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA). This enzyme is
      required to breakdown (metabolize) certain fats (lipids) in the body. Deficiency of the LIPA
      enzyme causes these fats to abnormally accumulate in the tissues and organs of the body
      potentially causing a variety of symptoms. The symptoms of CESD can vary greatly depending on
      how much residual enzyme activity remains. The key finding (and sometimes the only clinical
      sign) is an abnormally enlarged liver (hepatomegaly). Some individuals may not be diagnosed
      with CESD until adulthood. CESD is caused by different mutations of the same gene [lysosomal
      acid lipase (LIPA) gene] that causes Wolman disease. CESD is inherited as an autosomal
      recessive trait.

      Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) is a group of rare inherited disorders of fat metabolism. At least
      five types of Niemann-Pick disease have been identified (NPD types A, B, C, D, and E).
      Symptoms of types A and B occur as a result of a deficiency of the enzyme acid
      sphingomyelinase (ASM), which is needed to break down sphingomyelin, a fatty substance found
      mostly in the brain and nervous system. This deficiency results in abnormal accumulation of
      excessive amounts of sphingomyelin in many organs of the body such as the liver, spleen, and
      brain. Symptoms of type C occur because of impaired trafficking of large molecules within
      cells, which results in the accumulation of excessive amounts of cholesterol and
      glycosphingolipids tissues throughout the body. The metabolic defect in type C can lead to a
      secondary reduction in ASM activity in some cells. Symptoms common to all types of
      Niemann-Pick disease include yellow discoloration of the skin, eyes, and/or mucous membranes
      (jaundice), progressive loss of motor skills, feeding difficulties, learning disabilities,
      and hepatosplenomegaly. The different types of Niemann-Pick disease are inherited as
      autosomal recessive traits.

      Chanarin Dorfman syndrome is a rare genetic disorder of fat (lipid) metabolism. It is
      characterized by ichthyosis, myopathy, and abnormal white blood cells with small spaces
      (vacuoles) filled with lipids. Additional symptoms may occur including hearing loss, vision
      abnormalities, hepatomegaly and a condition in which fat accumulates in the liver (liver
      steatosis or &quot;fatty&quot; liver). Cognitive decline may occur in some cases. Chanarin Dorfman
      syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.

      There are several types of metabolic disorders in which secondary accumulation of certain
      triglycerides in the body. These disorders include galactosemia, fructose intolerance, and
      specific disorders of amino acid metabolism.

      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic
      alterations in the blood (plasma) of affected patients that allow diagnosing in the future
      the disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity.

      Therefore it is the goal of the study to identify and validate a new biochemical marker from
      the plasma of the affected patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose
      and thereby with an earlier treatment. Examining saliva samples will allow determining
      whether measurement is feasible in saliva samples and will further promote early detection of
      Wolman disease.
