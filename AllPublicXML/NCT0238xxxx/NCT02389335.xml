    <textblock>
      The mechanism of β cell destruction in Type 1 diabetes is not exactly known, Our hyphotesis
      is that interferon gamma, interleukin-2 and tumor necrotizan factor alpha have impotant roles
      in β cell destruction.

      T helper (h)1 cells are known to have important roles in the destruction or/and
      dedifferentiation of β-cells in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Significant increase in
      IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells in the pancreas and in the serum levels were determined in type 1
      diabetic patients at diabetes oneset. This data indicated that this proinflammatory mediator
      serve as a biomarker of advanced autoimmunity. We aimed to investigate the relationship
      between Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α) and T1D and the effect of those cytokines on
      β-cell function.

        The study included 98 T1DPs and 30 healthy subjects (CG). All subjects

        were matched on age and gender. β-cell function of 98 T1DPS was assesseed by measuring
        C-Peptide levels

        after mixed-meal tolarence test (MMTT)s. T1DPs were divided into 3

        groups according to the C-Peptide levels after MMTTs and the groups

        were as follows: patients with undetectable ≤0.1 ng/mL(group 1a, n=30)

        C-Peptide levels; minimal 0.1-0.8 ng/mL(group1b, n=30); and sustained

        ≥0.8ng/mL(group1c, n=38) C-peptide levels which increased at the 90th

        minute after the meal ≥150% of fasting C-peptide level.
