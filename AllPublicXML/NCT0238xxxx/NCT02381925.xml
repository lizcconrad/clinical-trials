      The study aims are:

        1. To compare the diagnostic performance of parathyroid four-dimensional CT (4D-CT),
           scintigraphy, and ultrasound in patients who underwent parathyroid surgery for primary
           hyperparathyroidism.

        2. To compare 4D-CT, scintigraphy, and ultrasound for the ability to perform focused
           parathyroidectomy, and for rates of persistent hyperparathyroidism and complications
           from parathyroid surgery.

      Methods The investigators will create a multicenter registry consisting of patients having
      parathyroid surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism from July 2009 to June 2016. Initial
      participating centers include Duke University Medical Center, University California Los
      Angeles (UCLA) and University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS).

      There will be no intervention in the patient's treatment or imaging. The management will be
      determined by the surgeon or clinician supervising the patient's care.

      The registry will consist of patient data regarding basic demographics, history of prior
      neck/chest surgery or radiation, parathyroid imaging, biochemical evaluation, intraoperative
      surgical findings, parathyroid pathology, and surgical outcomes within the first 6 months
      (persistent disease, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and hypoparathyroidism). Data will be
      entered into REDCap with no PHI. The investigators expect to include 3000 patients in the
      registry (1000 from Duke).
