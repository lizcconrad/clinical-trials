  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine the safety and immunogenicity of a series of 3 primary
      vaccinations and a booster vaccination of Recombinant ricin toxin A-chain 1-33/44-198 (rRTA
      1-33/44-198) vaccine (RVEc) at 10 or 20 μg intradermally (ID). This study is evaluating if
      RVEc will display an acceptable safety profile as determined by adverse event (AE) data and
      if RVEc will elicit anti-ricin antibody titers and ricin toxin-neutralizing antibodies in
      vaccine recipients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Study participants must read and sign an approved informed consent.

          -  Study participants must be at least 18 years old at time of screening and no older
             than 50 years old at time of first study vaccination.

          -  Participants must weigh at least 110 pounds at time of screening.

          -  Participants must be in good health as judged from medical history, physical
             examination, electrocardiogram, chest x-ray, hematology, clinical chemistries,
             urinalysis, hepatitis serology, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody test
             and must be medically cleared for participation by an investigator.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test on screening and
             the morning of each vaccination prior to receipt of the vaccine and must agree to use
             a highly effective method of birth control from screening through 3 months following
             last study vaccination. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one
             with a failure rate of less than 1% per year. Acceptable birth control methods that
             meet this criterion include hormonal implants and injectables, combined oral
             contraceptives, intrauterine devices, female sterilization (tubal ligation), sexual
             abstinence, or a vasectomized partner.

          -  Female participants must also agree not to breastfeed from screening through 3 months
             following last study vaccination.

          -  Study participants must be willing to return for all follow-up visits.

          -  Study participants must agree to report any adverse events (AE) that may or may not be
             associated with administration of the investigational product through the duration of
             study participation.

          -  Study participants must agree to abstain from excessive exercise (more than the usual
             routine) and excessive alcohol consumption (exceeds 2 drinks for males or exceeds 1
             drink for females daily or binge drinking) for the duration of study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute or chronic medical conditions or immunodeficiency from a medical condition or
             medical treatment, medications, or dietary supplements that, in the investigator's
             opinion, would impair the subject's ability to respond to vaccination. Use of
             corticosteroids, other than inhaled or topical corticosteroids or eye drops, will not
             be permitted.

          -  Severe hypersensitivity to any vaccine.

          -  History of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or other current/residual
             diseases of the lungs.

          -  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory tests. (Normal reference ranges are
             determined by the local clinical laboratory.)

          -  Current smoker, to include use of electronic cigarettes.

          -  Any known allergies to sodium succinate, Polysorbate 20 (a detergent), Alhydrogel, or
             kanamycin.

          -  Receipt of any vaccine or investigational product within 30 days before or after
             vaccination with RVEc (the only exception is the inactivated influenza vaccine that
             can be received at least 30 days after RVEc Dose 3 or 4).

          -  Creatine phosphokinase levels that are consistently elevated more than 2 × normal.

          -  Previous vaccination with RVEc or any other ricin vaccine candidate by any route.
