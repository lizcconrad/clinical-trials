      An Investigation of Return to Play Exertion Protocol in Concussed Adolescents

      Written informed parental consent and assent will be obtained for all subjects. The PI or
      Co-I will administer ImPACT (Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing), the
      PCSS (Post Concussion Symptom Scale), and the VOMS (Vestibular Ocular Motor Screening) to
      each subject during their first clinical visit. In addition to demographic variables such as
      age and gender, groups will be matched based on ImPACT and VOMS performance as well as the
      number, type, and severity of symptoms reported on the PCSS. Subjects will be assigned to
      receive either the currently accepted standard of care (Heart Rate Exertion group) or the
      newly developed exertion protocol (Dynamic Exertion Group). Participants will be matched
      according to PCSS total, VOMS symptom report, and by demographic variables including age and
      gender. The first participant will be assigned to the dynamic exertion group and the next to
      the standard of care group, alternating accordingly as covariates allow. The physical
      therapists will be responsible for administering the assigned exertion protocol to each
      subject across four time points (one week between each session). Follow-up data regarding
      recovery time (i.e., clinical return to normal activity) will also be collected.
      Neurocognitive testing will take place on 3-4 week intervals as is consistent with clinical
      practice. The current study will include a pre-exertion neurocognitive evaluation and a
      post-exertion protocol neurocognitive evaluation.

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To empirically assess the efficacy of the current standard of care as it relates to a gradual increase in physical activity relative to a newly developed program. The current standard of care focuses on heart rate and duration of physical activity where all athletes are progressed in the same fashion based on ability to tolerate symptoms while running on a treadmill; by contrast, the newly developed program emphasizes dynamic movement (incorporating lateral movement and planar changes in addition to treadmill running) that more closely approximate movements made while playing sports where rehabilitation is based on specific symptom deficits.</description>

    <description>Exertional Physical Therapy Protocol. Dynamic exertion protocol includes the treadmill running aspect, but also incorporates other exercises that involve lateral movement (e.g., side lunges, lateral speed training exercises) as well as planar changes (e.g., burpees, squat thrusts) . Recovery on these exercises is measured based on time subjects are able to tolerate the exertion without symptom increase. Across all exertion protocols additional measures of subjective physical effort and objective measurement of heart rate are taken.</description>
