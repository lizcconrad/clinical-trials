      The purpose of this study was to determine whether a 10-week internet-based program based on
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in the treatment of alcohol problems, and if
      having therapist guidance leads to greater effects.

      Objectives: An 10 week Internet-based self-help program based on cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT) was tested among Internet help seekers.The design was a three-armed randomized
      controlled design, and outcomes were measured in terms of changes in problematic alcohol use,
      as well as depression, anxiety and quality of life. 80 participants were recruited entirely
      online from an open access website and randomized into three different groups. All
      participants had access to the same self-help program. However, one group was given a choice
      between two forms of therapist guidance (messages or weekly chat sessions), one group
      received therapist guidance in the form of secure messages, and one group received no
      therapist guidance.
