  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to document the bone in-growth into the BIOSURE™ HEALICOIL PK screw as
      measured by CT scans. Patients' improvement in pain and function will also be followed
      through various outcome measures.

      The primary objective of the current study is to assess bone in-growth in the BIOSURE™
      HEALICOIL™ Interference screw in the tibial tunnel of patients undergoing ACL reconstruction
      with soft tissue grafts; tunnel widening and change in IKDC knee and subjective scores will
      also be documented.
