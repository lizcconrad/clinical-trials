    <textblock>
      Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) affects over 700,000 Americans every year and is the leading
      cause of long-term disability. Early neurological deterioration after AIS typically occurs
      within 72 hours of stroke onset and affects 30% of all stroke patients, who have a higher
      rate of death or poor outcome. Several mechanisms account for early neurological
      deterioration, including hemorrhagic conversion, systemic illness, cerebral edema, and
      seizure, but the most common cause is extension of the stroke into the &quot;penumbra,&quot; a region
      of salvageable brain tissue surrounding the core of irreversible ischemic infarct. The
      penumbra is tenuously perfused by collateral blood vessels. AIS management is primarily
      focused on recanalizing the occluded artery causing the stroke, but an alternative and
      relatively unexplored approach is optimization of collateral blood flow.

      Over 60% of AIS patients present with a transient acute hypertensive response, which is
      theorized to be the result of either increased sympathoadrenal tone, poorly controlled
      underlying hypertension, or an unknown stroke-specific mechanism related to augmenting
      cerebral perfusion through collateral blood flow. Epidemiological data suggests worse stroke
      outcomes are associated with extremes of sustained hypo- or hypertension, which has led to
      dozens of clinical trials involving over 20,000 patients to determine if pharmacologically
      lowering blood pressure after AIS is beneficial. The results have been persistently neutral
      or negative. In contrast, there have been no major clinical trials on the efficacy of using
      vasopressor medications to maintain or increase baseline blood pressure after AIS, despite
      promising preclinical data and pilot studies that showed no increase in cerebral hemorrhage
      or edema. The only randomized trial of vasopressor use after AIS demonstrated an improvement
      in clinical outcomes, but there was no difference in mean blood pressure between the control
      and intervention arms, suggesting the beneficial effect was not exclusively related to
      induced hypertension. One possibility is that the vasopressor reduced blood pressure
      variability, which preliminary data has shown to be detrimental after AIS, although that
      aspect of neurovascular coupling has not been adequately studied in the acute phase after
      AIS.

      The reliance on IV vasopressors, which are only administered in the intensive care unit, is a
      fundamental limitation of prior research. An alternative, but untested, approach is to use
      the oral vasopressor midodrine hydrochloride. We hypothesize that frequent midodrine dosing
      after AIS can optimize collateral blood flow and help salvage the ischemic penumbra. The
      objective of this study is to develop tools to quantify midodrine's effect on blood pressure
      and the ischemic penumbra.
