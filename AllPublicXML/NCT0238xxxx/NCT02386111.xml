  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the clinical benefit (how well the drug works), safety, and
      tolerability of combining varlilumab and sunitinib. The study will enroll patients with
      metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Varlilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called CD27 found on
      certain immune cells and may act to promote anti-tumor effects.

      Sunitinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) some of
      which play a role in tumor growth and progression of cancer.

      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the anti-CD27 antibody
      varlilumab in combination with sunitinib.

      Eligible patients that enroll in the dose escalation portion of the study will be assigned to
      one of three dose levels of varlilumab in combination with 50 mg of sunitinib. The first
      phase of the study will test the safety profile of the combination and determine which dose
      of varlilumab will be studied in Phase ll of the overall study.

      During Phase ll, up to 40 patients will be enrolled and receive the recommended Phase ll dose
      of varlilumab in combination with sunitinib 50 mg.

      All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if there is a
      response to the treatment as well as for any side effects that may occur.

    <description>During the treatment phase of the study, eligible patients will receive varlilumab for up to 8 cycles. Treatment cycles are 6 weeks each with varlilumab administered once every 3 weeks and sunitinib administered daily for 4 weeks followed by a 2 week rest. There is no limit on the number of cycles of sunitinib. Patients may be discontinued from receiving study treatment (sunitinib or varlilumab) based on the results of disease assessments or if experiencing side effects that make study therapy intolerable.
Phase l Dose: The planned dose of varlilumab will be dependent on the cohort assigned at enrollment. Varlilumab doses are 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg.
Phase ll Dose: The planned varlilumab dose will be established from the outcome of the Phase 1 portion of the study.
All patients will receive sunitinib at a dose of 50 mg.</description>
