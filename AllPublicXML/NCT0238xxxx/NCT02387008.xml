    <textblock>
      Purpose: The goal of guided bone augmentation is to provide an alveolar ridge of sufficient
      dimension to permit dental implant placement. While a wide variety of bone graft and barrier
      membrane products are commercially available, limited evidence exists supporting the use of
      one technique over another. The purpose of this study is to radiographically define the
      dimensional bone changes following horizontal bone augmentation using a synthetic GUIDOR®
      (Sunstar, Inc.) membrane. Secondary outcome measurements will include the assessment of
      inflammation, infection, or other wound healing complications.

      Participants: A total of 60 patients requiring bone augmentation of a single bound edentulous
      site prior to dental implant placement will be selected for this study. This is a multicenter
      study with 30 patients receiving treatment at each study site.

      Procedures (methods): Patients will be randomly allocated to receive horizontal bone
      augmentation with synthetic GUIDOR® membrane + freeze dried bone augmentation (FDBA),
      synthetic GUIDOR® membrane alone, or xenograft BioGide® membrane + FDBA. CBCT imaging will be
      obtained at baseline and 6 months post-operatively to assess dimensional alveolar ridge
      changes. Additionally, post-operative appointments at 1, 2, and 4 weeks post-grafting will be
      completed to assess the presence of inflammation, infection, wound dehiscence, or membrane
      exposure.
