  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food habits form early in infancy and are likely to track into childhood until the beginning
      of adulthood. Understanding the factors driving the acceptance of foods in the early years is
      therefore of particular importance, since these foods will form the basis of a child's future
      food repertoire. This is especially important for vegetables, which consumption is
      recommended at all stages of life but is below the recommended levels and which acceptance is
      difficult to promote during late childhood.

      The objective of the present study was to unravel the respective contribution of maternal
      feeding practices, of children's rate of exposure to vegetables and of children's sensory
      reactivity factors over the course of the first two years, to explain the development of
      liking for vegetables at the age of 2 years. This analysis took advantage of data recorded in
      a prospective cohort of children recruited before birth and followed up longitudinally until
      the age of 2 years.

      This study is a cohort study with the aim to evaluate prospectively food liking in children,
      at to relate this outcome to children's food experience, acceptance of taste and olfactory
      stimulation, and to parental feeding style.
