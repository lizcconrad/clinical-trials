  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine clinical factors affecting quality indicators of
      colonoscopy including adenoma detection rate, and whether quality of colonoscopy could be
      elevated by improving related factors.

      This study is an extension of quality assurance program in Seoul National University Hospital
      Healthcare System Gangnam Center. This study is composed of five periods. First, quality
      indicators of colonoscopy in experienced endoscopists will be analyzed retrospectively from
      January 2011 to december 2014. Individual differences and changes of quality indicators in
      every endoscopist will be verified. In second period, from January 2015 to March 2015,
      quality assurance program will be activated. Endoscopists will be educated by EQUIP
      (Endoscopic Quality Improvement Program). Also split-regimen bowel preparation instead of
      same-day regimen and Boston bowel preparation scale will be introduced to standardize
      disparity of grading. Third, prospective trial starts from April 2015 to March 2018. All
      endoscopists will receive feedbacks of their own adenoma detection rates in every 3 months.
      Changes of quality indicators for each endoscopist will be investigated, and annually
      monitored by institutional review board. If there is a significant improvement of quality
      indicators in interim assessment, prospective trial will be extended until April 2018. Fourth
      is wash-out period from April 2018 to march 2019. Feedbacks will be stopped and adenoma
      detection rates and quality indicators of endoscopists will be compared with those from
      prospective period. Finally, cumulative rate and mortality rate of colorectal cancers will be
      investigated until December 2019.
