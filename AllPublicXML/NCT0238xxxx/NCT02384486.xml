  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to reduce stress in mothers of children with autism in Saudi Arabia. The
      researcher has designed a training programme for mothers whose children are young and just in
      their early stage at the autism organisations they are attending. The programme will include
      stress reduction tips, behavioural modification strategies for children with autism, and
      financial resources available to parents (how they can access government funding). The study
      will have two parts. Part one involves conducting an experiment by dividing the participants
      into two groups, one group will receive the training and the other group will wait until the
      end of the study then they will also receive the same training. Both groups will fill
      questionnaire at the beginning of the study, then after the first group finishes training,
      and then again 6 weeks later. Part two of the study will involve interviewing mothers of the
      first group who attended the training session. They will be interviewed by the researcher
      asking them about their experience with the training programme and their suggestions for
      future improvements. Mothers will be given a training manual at the beginning of the
      training. Training involves attending five sessions, one of which is a face to face session
      at the autism organisation their children are attending and the other four sessions will be
      through a Smartphone application called whatsapp which is widely used in Saudi Arabia.
