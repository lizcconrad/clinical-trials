  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized clinical study with two stages to assess the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD), efficacy, and safety of selinexor, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone
      (SLd) in patients with relapsed/refractory (RR) multiple myeloma (MM). The stages are dose
      escalation (Phase 1) and expansion (Phase 2).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Phase 1 (Dose Escalation), patients will be randomized to either once-weekly (Arm A) or
      twice- weekly (Arm B) dosing with selinexor. Dose escalation will be performed within each
      arm for both lenalidomide and selinexor to determine the selinexor MTD for that arm. Each arm
      will be expanded until approximately 17 patients have been treated at the MTD in each arm.
      The Sponsor and Investigator will review the MTD, efficacy, and safety data from Phase 1 to
      determine which dose schedule (Arm A or B) to be used as the RP2D dose in the Expansion
      Phase.

      In Phase 2 (Expansion), patients who had received the MTD dose that was nominated for RP2D
      will continue at the same dose. Patients who did not receive the RP2D for that arm will stay
      on their Phase 1 dose. Additional patients will be accrued, as needed, to achieve the target
      population size of approximately 34 patients at the RP2D.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Lenalidomide will be dosed initially at 15 mg daily, and if that dose is tolerated per dose-limiting toxicity (DLT criteria,) it will be increased to 25 mg for that arm. Selinexor will be started at 80 mg (~45 mg/m2) once weekly in combination with dexamethasone 40 mg once weekly with each dose of selinexor. If the selinexor 80 mg dose is tolerated per DLT criteria, the dose will be increased to 100 mg (~60 mg/m2) and evaluated for MTD, tolerability and efficacy.</description>

Selinexor will be started at 60 mg (~35 mg/m2) twice weekly in combination with dexamethasone 20 mg twice weekly with each dose of selinexor; dexamethasone 20 mg will also be given, without selinexor, on Days 22 and 24. If the selinexor 60 mg dose is tolerated per DLT criteria, the dose will be increased to 80 mg (~45 mg/m2) and evaluated for MTD, tolerability and efficacy.</description>

             disease is defined as ≤ 25% response (i.e., patients never achieved minimal response
             or better) or progression during therapy or within 60 days after completion of
             therapy.

          -  Symptomatic MM, based on IMWG guidelines. Patients must have measurable disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Smoldering MM.

          -  Multiple myeloma that does not express M-protein or FLC (i.e., non-secretory MM is
             excluded), and quantitative immunoglobulin levels cannot be used instead.
