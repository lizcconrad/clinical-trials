    <description>Objective Response Rate (ORR) was defined as the number of participants with a best overall response of confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (per RECIST 1.1 criteria) divided by the number of all treated participants. RECIST 1.1 = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. CR= Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm. PR= At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. BIRC= blinded independent review committee</description>

    <description>PFS was defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of the first documented tumor progression, based on BIRC assessments (per RECIST 1.1), or death due to any cause. Progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.
