      ABSTARCT Background: Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A
      reductase. Lately, it has shown to have anti-inflammatory and bone stimulatory effects. The
      aim of the current study is to explore the effectiveness of 1.2% atorvastatin (ATV) as an
      adjunct to scaling and root planning (SRP) in the treatment of mandibular degree II furcation
      defects.

      Method: A total of sixty subjects were randomly assigned to two treatment groups. 1. SRP plus
      placebo gel 2. SRP plus 1.2% ATV gel. Clinical parameters like probing depth (PD), relative
      vertical clinical attachment level (RVCAL) , relative horizontal clinical attachment level
      (RHCAL), modified sulcus bleeding index (mSBI) and site specific plaque index were recorded
      at baseline and then at 3, 6 and 9 months. The radiological assessment of bone defect fill
      was done at 6 and 9 months, using a computer-aided software.

      Two groups were made. One was delivered with ATV after SRP, the other was delivered with
      placebo gel after SRP.
