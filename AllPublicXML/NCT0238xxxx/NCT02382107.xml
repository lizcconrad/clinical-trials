  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) and especially the detection of drug resistance of
      tuberculosis mycobacteria can be time consuming and costly. New and rapid diagnostic tests
      are needed to improve early case detection and correct initiation of treatment.

      In the planned cross-sectional diagnostic evaluation study the investigators are aiming for
      the assessment of several new TB diagnostics (e.g. new AID strip assays and TrDNA assay in
      urine) in TB suspects who are presenting themselves to the pulmonary ambulance (TB dispensary
      for sector 4) at the Marius Nasta Institute (MNI). The study will be conducted in a
      co-operation between the MNI and the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF).

      Up to 400 TB suspects will be consecutively screened for their eligibility for participation
      in the study. In those who are eligible (according to the criteria listed above) to
      participate, 2 sputum samples and one urine will be collected for standard diagnostic testing
      for TB in sputum (smear, Line Probe Assays and culture methods, as defined in the national
      guidelines) and for the evaluation of the new assays; one blood sample will be collected for
      analysis of lipoprotein profiles in serum of TB patients. Further, a HIV test and a clinical
      examination will be performed in all study subjects. Information on risk factors for TB
      disease (co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, co-medication such as steroids and risk
      behaviour such as smoking) will be also documented.

      All TB tests results and data which are generated in the study will be collected on
      standardized study forms and entered in a password-secured data base. TB tests results will
      be also shared with the medical staff treating the patients who are participating in the
      study.

      One follow up visit will be performed after 8 weeks in order to evaluate the clinical
      progress of the participants, either on TB treatment (if TB was confirmed) or alternative
      therapy, in participants who were not diagnosed with TB.

      The isolated TB strains will be sent to the Research Center Borstel in Germany for evaluation
      through sequencing and phenotypic methods. The remnants of collected samples will be stored
      in the National TB Laboratory for future evaluations of new tests.
