  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the efficacy of an 8-week course in Mindfulness-Based Cognitive
      Therapy (MBCT) for adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) by ;measuring change from
      baseline to completion of treatment at 8 weeks in terms of depression severity using the
      Hamilton Depression Ratings Scale. We will measure change in C-Reactive Protein, a measure of
      inflammation, over the same time period.

      This study will investigate the effectiveness of MBCT as a primary treatment for MDD. Twelve
      unmedicated subjects with MDD were enrolled in the study. All subjects with MDD underwent
      depression severity assessment at baseline and after the 8-week intervention was complete to
      measure change. In addition, the subjects underwent blood sampling at the same time points to
      measure C-Reactive Protein change over the 8 weeks.

      The primary goal of this pilot study is to determine the efficacy of MBCT as a primary
      treatment for adults with MDD. We will also measure change in the inflammatory biomarker
      C-Reactive Protein for an examination of the effects of depression treatment on this measure.
