      This phase II clinical study will include fifteen healthy light skinned adult volunteers. At
      screening subjects will be given a sunburn test. This procedure involves exposing eight 1
      square cm areas of skin over increasing doses of simulated solar radiation (SSR). SSR is
      delivered by a 1,000-Watt xenon arc lamp, which emits ultraviolet wavelengths from 290-400
      nm, closely resembling natural sunlight. The Minimal Erythema Dose (MED) will be determined
      approximately 24 hours after initial exposure by using a chromometer. The MED is calculated
      by linear regression. Each test site is a one inch square area on the buttock or lower back.
      Sites 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 will be irradiated with 2 MED of SSR. Site 1 will not receive any ACCS
      treatment. Sites 2 and 3 will be treated with ACCS immediately after irradiation. 8-12 hours
      later or at bedtime, Sites 2,3,4,5 with ACCS at home. ACCS will also be applied 24 hours
      after SSR. Between 24-36 hours after SSR, subject returns to the Skin Study Center for
      Minolta chromometer assessment of erythema at all test sites, as well as for high resolution
      digital photography (Canfield). These assessments will be repeated at 48 hours and 72 hours
      post SSR. Data will be graphed to quantify rate of erythema resolution. Punch biopsies will
      be obtained at Site 1 (control) and Site 2 (SSR + immediate ACCS Rx). If a difference in
      erythema is observed between Site 1 and Site 4, a biopsy will also be obtained from Site 4
      (SSR + delayed ACCS Rx). Biopsy samples will be tested using Reverse Transcriptase
      -Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and/or immunohistochemistry for markers of UV
      inflammation such as Interleukin (IL)-6, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) -alpha, etc. Subjects
      will continue to apply the ACCS twice daily on Sites 3 and 5 until study visit 5. An
      additional normal control skin biopsy may be performed in a subset of volunteers (4-5) to
      serve as reference control for the tissue analysis.

      This phase II clinical study will include ten to fifteen healthy light skinned adult
      volunteers who will be recruited through Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved
      advertising. At screening subjects will be given a sunburn test. This procedure involves
      exposing eight 1 square cm areas of skin over increasing doses of simulated solar radiation
      (SSR), while the rest of the body is draped. SSR is delivered by a 1,000-Watt xenon arc lamp,
      which emits ultraviolet wavelengths from 290-400 nm, closely resembling natural sunlight. The
      Minimal Erythema Dose (MED) will be determined approximately 24 hours after initial exposure
      by using a chromometer that records the values of redness associated with each 1 square cm
      area exposed to the SSR the previous day. Once the MED is calculated by linear regression,
      the actual UV exposure of test sites will be conducted. A test site consists of a one inch
      square area on the buttock or lower back. Sites 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 will be irradiated with 2 MED
      of SSR while the rest of the body is draped. Site 1 will not receive any ACCS treatment at
      all. Sites 2 and 3 will be treated by investigators with ACCS immediately after irradiation.
      8-12 hours later or at bedtime, subject will treat Sites 2,3,4,5 with ACCS at home. ACCS
      application will also be done by subject on Sites 2,3,4,5 the next morning approximately 24
      hours after SSR. Between 24-36 hours after SSR, subject returns to the Skin Study Center for
      Minolta chromometer assessment of erythema at all test sites, as well as for high resolution
      digital photography (Canfield). These assessments will be repeated at 48 hours and 72 hours
      post SSR and data will be graphed to quantify rate of erythema resolution. Punch biopsies
      will be obtained at Site 1 (control) and Site 2 (SSR + immediate ACCS Rx). If a difference in
      erythema is observed between Site 1 and Site 4 (i.e. if even the delayed treatment seems to
      effectively decrease inflammation), a biopsy will also be obtained from Site 4 (SSR + delayed
      ACCS Rx). These biopsy samples will be tested using RT-PCR and/or immunohistochemistry for
      markers of UV inflammation such as IL-6, TNF-alpha, etc. The test sites that have been
      biopsied will no longer undergo chromometer assessment post biopsy because the inflammation
      from the biopsy itself may confound the erythema readings. Meanwhile, subject will continue
      to apply the ACCS twice daily on Sites 3 and 5 until study visit 5. An additional normal
      control skin biopsy may be performed in a subset of volunteers (4-5) to serve as reference
      control for the tissue analysis. This will not be required of all volunteers.
