  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance (MR)-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation is
      increasingly being used worldwide to treat symptomatic uterine fibroids because of its
      excellent therapeutic efficacy in controlling symptoms and its excellent safety record.
      Despite the benefits, it should be recognized that MR HIFU ablation does not always yield
      good therapeutic outcomes. High signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images and a high volume
      transfer constant (or Ktrans) on dynamic contrast material-enhanced MR images are the most
      well-known risk factors for poor ablation outcomes as measured with the non-perfused volume
      (NPV) ratio (ie, NPV divided by fibroid volume).

      The aim of this study is to assess the influence of fibroid perfusion (evaluated by MRI and
      contrast enhanced ultrasound), apparent diffusion coefficient (evaluated by MR-diffusion
      imaging) and fibroid stiffness (evaluated by ARFI) on ablation efficiency during uterine
      fibroid treatment by MR-HIFU.

      Preprocedural predictors of treatment efficacy will be useful for excluding in advance
      patients who would not benefit from this treatment, thereby contributing to improved overall
      clinical outcomes. During ablathermy treatment lost of energy depend of tissue perfusion and
      thermic diffusion while energy laying depend of tissue absorption coefficient. Study these
      parameters before treatment could bring important information to the treatment difficulty and
      its efficacy. The investigators will study and compare fibroid perfusion with dynamic
      contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). CEUS
      will be performed with contrast agent (SONOVUE). Thermic diffusion could be linked with
      fibroid stiffness. Fibroid stiffness will be quantified with velocity of shear wave measured
      by acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI). Tissue absorption coefficient is correlated with
      the architecture and the cellularity of the tissue so the investigators think that apparent
      diffusion coefficient (computed with diffusion weighted imaging) could be correlated with
      ablathermy efficiency and other intra procedural thermal parameters.
