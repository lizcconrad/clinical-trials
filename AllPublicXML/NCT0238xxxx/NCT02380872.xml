  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study was to evaluate the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8, and
      -9, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase and interleukin-1beta levels in gingival
      crevicular fluid during the early and late stages of healing for gingival recession sites
      treated by coronally advanced flap plus platelet rich fibrin (PRF) compared to CAF plus
      connective tissue graft. As PRF consists of several growth factors, it may enhance the
      healing potential of soft tissues, the investigators hypothesized that using PRF in the
      treatment of gingival recessions might regulate inflammation and promote wound healing.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of PRF by assessing gingival crevicular
      fluid (GCF) levels of MMP-8, MMP-9, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP-1) and
      interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) during the early and late stages of healing following coronally
      advanced flap (CAF) plus PRF or CAF plus connective tissue graft (CTG) treatment.

      Primary outcome variables were biochemical parameters, such as: GCF MMP-8, -9, TIMP-1 and
      IL-1β levels. The secondary outcome variables were change in gingival recession expressed as
      recession reduction in millimeters at follow-up visits.

      Sample size has been estimated in 24 subjects per treatment groups. Random allocation of the
      treatment sites to test (CAF+ PRF) and control (CAF + SCTG) groups will be performed using a
      computerized selection of random numbers for allocation of the study groups.

      Biochemical parameters: GCF samples were obtained from each recession defect in each subject
      immediately prior to treatment of recessions and at 10 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months
      after surgery.

      Periodontal parameters including probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and
      gingival recession parameters including recession depth (RD), recession width (RW), and
      keratinized tissue width (KTW),were assessed by a calibrated examiner. At baseline and at 6
      months, PD, RD, RW and KTW were evaluated by clinical assessment.

      Follow-up of subjects: 6 months.
