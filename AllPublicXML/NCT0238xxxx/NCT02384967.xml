      Phase II trial assessing the efficacy of a reduced dose strategy of darunavir to 400 mg/d in
      HIV-1 infected patients virologically suppressed under a once daily regimen including
      darunavir 800 mg/d and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), to maintain
      the viral load lower than 50 copies / mL at 48 weeks of treatment.

    <textblock>
      Principal objective: To evaluate the proportion of subjects virologically suppressed at week
      48 (viral load=VL ≤ 50 cp/mL) under a tri-therapy containing the darunavir at the dose of 400
      mg/d.

      Secondary objectives: To evaluate between baseline and week 48: proportions of subjects: in
      virological failure (confirmed VL &gt; 50 cp/mL) confirmed by a 2nd measure made between 2 to 4
      weeks, with VL ≤ 50 cp/mL and between 20 and 50 cp/mL, emerging drug resistance if
      virological failure, CD4 cell count evolution, HIV DNA evolution, morphological and
      glucido-lipid parameters modifications, digestive treatment tolerance , adherence to
      treatment, overall cost of antiretroviral therapy, factors associated to virological failure
      including baseline and nadir CD4 cell count, darunavir plasma level, baseline HIV DNA viral
      load.
