    <textblock>
      This Study evaluate the non-inferiority of Test product (Chloroprocaine 2%) versus Reference
      product (Ropivacaine 0.75%) in terms of proportion of subjects with a successful block for
      distal upper limb surgeries, without any supplementation in the first 45 min (see definitions
      below), calculated from the time of readiness for surgery (complete sensory block).
      Successful block: anaesthesia adequate for the surgery (complete sensory block), without any
      supplementation in the first 45 min (even if surgery lasts for &gt; 45 min), calculated from the
      time of readiness for surgery (complete sensory block). Supplementation: i.v. premedication
      or general anaesthesia or pre- or intra-operative systemic analgesia or additional local
      anaesthetic infiltration
