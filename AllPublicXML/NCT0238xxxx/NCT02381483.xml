      Vitamin A metabolites (retinoids) have shown to activate brown fat function in preclinical
      studies, however the role of retinoids in human brown fat physiology and energy metabolism
      remains elusive. This study aims to identify a possible association between retinoid
      metabolism, brown fat activity, and energy expenditure in lean and obese subjects by using
      FDG-PET-CT, PET-MR Scans and indirect calorimetry. Additionally we will analyze the genetic
      profile of white and brown neck fat biopsies at room temperature and cold conditions in a
      subset of the study participants. More detailed molecular studies (involving other potential
      browning markers) will also be performed in adipocytes derived from human SVC.

      The optimal duration of cold exposure will be determined in a pilot study. Therefore subjects
      will be repeatedly exposed to cold and circulating retinoid levels and other plasma
      parameters will be measured at various time points.

    <description>This is a very exploratory aim that involves a number of molecular tests. Therefore no single outcome measure can be defined here. Briefly, we will perform mRNA and miRNA analyses from BAT biopsies and plasma before and after cold exposure to identify new factors related to BAT function. Potential candidates will be tested in loss- or gain-of-function models in isolated human and/or murine adipocytes. In addition, the thermogenic effects of commercially available peptides, hormones, lipids, or steroid acids, will be tested in primary adipocytes.</description>
