      The Investigators have designed this exploratory study in patients suffering from
      zygapophysial joint mediated pain to investigate if a correlation exists between
      inter-individual genetic variability (genotype) with treatment response (phenotype). More
      specifically, the investigators aim to identify any form of correlation between a specific
      SNP of the BDNF gene (Val66Met) and the effectiveness and/or duration of radiofrequency facet
      joint neurotomy. The study population is patients suffering from chronic low back pain who
      have been scheduled for radiofrequency neurotomy following the diagnosis of facet joint
      mediated pain (using medial branch block test). The investigators will evaluate if a common
      variant of BDNF gene (Val66Met) can be directly correlated to a significant degree of pain
      relief following RF treatment, and whether the result of such a procedure can be predicted
      from a specific genetic profile.

      Study Hypothesis It is possible to predict individual responsiveness to radiofrequency
      denervation for zygapophysial (facet) joint mediated pain on the basis of a specific genetic
      pattern (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism, [SNP])?

    <description>Numerous studies have concluded that facet joint pain can be accurately diagnosed if a significant (but temporary) reduction in pain is achieved with a procedure called a Medial Branch Block (MBB). The clinician delivers a targeted injection of local anesthetic to the joint itself, or in close proximity to the medial branch of the posterior rami of the dorsal root. A significant decrease in pain confirms that the pain originates from the facet joint. If or when the pain returns after successful MBB treatment the patient may be considered for radiofrequency denervation (neurotomy) which selectively disrupts the joint's nerve supply and provides longer-term sustained relief</description>

        Patients suffering from chronic and debilitating low back pain with a diagnosis of lumbar

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with chronic low back pain which is unresponsive to conservative treatment
             (including suitable analgesics and physical therapy);

          -  Willing to provide consent

          -  Subject is capable of comprehending the patient information sheet and has the capacity
             to give their informed consent to all study procedures in English

          -  Be 18 years or older at the time of enrolment;

          -  Have specific low back pain that is aggravated by hyperextension and rotation of the

          -  Patients with another significant cause of low back pain (like spinal stenosis, disc
             herniation, spondylolisthesis, malignancy, infection or trauma);

          -  Radicular pain (pain with neuropathic characteristics following one or more nerve root
