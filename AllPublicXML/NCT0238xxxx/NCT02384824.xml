      The purpose of this study is to characterize the plaque morphology in patients with acute
      STEMI by OCT after aspiration thrombectomy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current guideline for treating acute STEMI is primarily PCI and stent placement in the
      infarct-related coronary artery. But, the underlying plaque morphology is not routinely
      identified due to the limited resolution of conventional imagine modalities. However, autopsy
      studies have shown that there are different atherosclerotic plaque morphologies involving in
      acute thrombotic occlusion of coronary arteries other than atherosclerotic plaque rupture,
      such as plaque erosion, calcified nodule, etc. Some studies have suggested that PCI and
      stenting might not always be necessary in about 30 - 40% of ACS patients, and an alternative
      treatment strategy is needed for these patients based on the characteristics of plaque
      morphology.

      100 subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will undergo emergent angiography and
      followings: If no thrombus was observed, OCT examination will be performed in the target
      vessel;

      If thrombosis was confirmed, the subject will undergo manual aspiration thrombectomy and
      antiplatelet therapy, and TIMI flow will be assessed:

      If TIMI flow grade &lt; 3, the subject will receive stent implantation as the standard of care
      followed by OCT examination; If TIMI flow grade of 3, the subject will not receive stent
      implantation but will be sent to CCU for monitoring and antiplatelet treatment, and have a
      repeat angiography and OCT examination at Day 7; within the 7days post STEMI, ischemia-driven
      angiography and/or PCI are allowed, and an OCT examination will be performed in these subject
      before PCI.

      Patients without undergoing initial stent implantation will have scheduled 30-day and
      12-month follow-ups for clinical outcomes.
