    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate the comparative clinical effectiveness of pharmacopuncture for
      severe non-acute sciatic pain patients diagnosed with lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with usual
      care of conventional medicine and that of Korean medicine (acupuncture). Sixty patients with
      severe non-acute sciatic pain patients diagnosed with LDH (NRS ≥5, 4 weeks - 6 months) will
      be recruited, and randomized 20 each to the Shinbaro pharmacopuncture, acupuncture, and usual
      care group, respectively. The 2 acupuncture groups will receive 2 sessions/week of
      acupuncture alone or with pharmacopuncture for 4 weeks, and the usual care group will receive
      conventional medication 2 times/day and 2 sessions/week of physical therapy. Post-treatment
      evaluations will take place 5, 7, 9, and 12 weeks after randomization.

      This study is a three-armed, randomized, patient, physician, and assessor-blinded, controlled
      pilot to the aim of evaluating the comparative clinical effectiveness of pharmacopuncture for
      severe non-acute sciatic pain patients diagnosed with lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with usual
      care of conventional medicine and that of Korean medicine (acupuncture). Sixty patients with
      severe non-acute sciatic pain patients diagnosed with LDH (NRS ≥5, onset between 4 weeks and
      6 months) will be recruited, and randomized 20 each to the Shinbaro pharmacopuncture
      (pharmacopuncture+acupuncture), acupuncture, and usual care group, respectively. The 2
      acupuncture groups will receive 2 sessions/week of acupuncture alone or with pharmacopuncture
      for 4 weeks (total 8 sessions), and the usual care group will receive conventional medication
      2 times/day and 2 sessions/week of physical therapy (total 8 sessions). The initial
      acupuncture physician will administer acupuncture at 5 acupoints (GB30, BL40, BL25, BL23,
      GB34) in the 2 acupuncture groups, and mark an additional acupoint. A second acupuncture
      physician will administer pharmacopuncture to the marked acupoint in the pharmacopuncture
      group, and acupuncture in the acupuncture group. Post-treatment evaluations will take place
      5, 7, 9, and 12 weeks after randomization.
