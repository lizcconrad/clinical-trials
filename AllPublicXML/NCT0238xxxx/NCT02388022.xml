      The purpose of the study is to gather clinical and radiographic outcome data from patients
      who have undergone treatment with an expandable interbody spacer.

      This is a multi center retrospective study with 200 patients. Sites will screen their patient
      records for patients who have had a TLIF utilizing the CALIBER® expandable interbody spacer
      in conjunction with the REVOLVE® or REVERE® posterior stabilization systems and subsequent
      follow-up visits.

      The study aims to collect both pre-operative and post-operative data at the 6, 12 and 24
      month time points according to existing standard of care and the surgeon's custom and
      practice.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Objective evidence of degenerative disc disease at 1 or 2 level(s) between L2 and S1
             resulting from degeneration of disc confirmed by history and radiographic studies.

          -  At least 18 years of age and maximum 80 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Presence of systemic or localized infection at the site of surgery

               -  More than 2 levels to be instrumented

               -  Previous fusion attempt at the involved level(s)

               -  Spondylolisthesis unable to be reduced to Grade 1

               -  Previous documentation of osteopenia, osteoporosis, or osteomalacia to a degree
                  that spinal instrumentation would be contraindicated

               -  Diagnosis of a condition or on postoperative medication(s), which may interfere
                  with bony/soft tissue healing

               -  Presence of a disease entity or condition which totally precludes possibility of
                  bony fusion (e.g. metastatic cancer, HIV, long term use of steroids, etc.)
