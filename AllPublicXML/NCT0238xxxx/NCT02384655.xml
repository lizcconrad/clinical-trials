  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Feeding human milk to preterm infants does reduce the risk of serious and costly neonatal
      intensive care unit acquired morbidity such as NEC and the late onset sepsis.

      It is often difficult to obtain sufficient quantities of human milk from mothers of preterm
      infants most of whom are breast pump-dependent for weeks or months. Mothers will try to use
      galactogogues in an attempt to increase milk production. Fenugreek (Trigonella
      foenum-graecum) seeds is the most commonly used herbal galactogogue and is a member of the
      pea family. Our experience at the NICU is that around 30% of preterm mothers desperately
      looking for ways to increase their breast milk supply will eventually took fenugreek (Hilbe)
      as food supplement. Although widely recommended, there is limited evidence to support the
      effectiveness of fenugreek as a galactogogue.

      The aims of this study are to evaluate whether maternal consumption of fenugreek seeds has
      any effect on macronutrients composition of breast milk and whether fenugreek is transferred
      to the infant via mother milk. In addition any changes in mother and infant health status
      will be assessed.
