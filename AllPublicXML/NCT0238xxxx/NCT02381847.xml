    <textblock>
      Patients with histological proven advanced gastric cancer (including cancer of the
      esophagogastric junction (AEG) without evidence of distant metastases, who fulfill the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, can be recruited in this study. There are two treatment
      groups (A and B). The D2 radical gastrectomy will be applied in both groups. Patients
      randomized into group B will be treated with an intraperitoneal (in the abdominal cavity)
      chemoperfusion with cisplatin(75mg/m2 max 150mg/m2 max 5L ). Patients randomized into group A
      will not accept intraperitoneal chemoperfusion. Patients in both groups receive 6 cycles of
      postoperative chemotherapy (SOX or XELOX) within 4-12 weeks after the surgical procedure and
      are followed up for 24 months.

      The objective of the trial is to compare the treatment of patients with advanced gastric
      cancer without evidence of distant metastases treated with D2 radical gastrectomy and
      intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (HIPEC) and postoperative chemotherapy (Group B) and patients
      treated with D2 radical gastrectomy alone and postoperative chemotherapy (Group A).

      The hypothesis of the trial is that D2 radical gastrectomy with intraperitoneal
      chemoperfusion (Group B) is superior to D2 radical gastrectomy (Group A) in terms of overall
      survival.

      The trial is designed as a prospective, randomized, open, multicenter and parallel group
      study.
