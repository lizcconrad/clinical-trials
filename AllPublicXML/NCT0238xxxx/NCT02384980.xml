  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will take the first step to improve public health for millions of Americans with
      Peripheral Arterial Disease who have extreme difficulty walking due to leg pain. The
      investigators will assess a proof of concept, home administered, functional electrical
      stimulation (FES) system to resolve pain, improve walking, and enhance quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate an innovative approach to reduce the debilitating symptoms of
      peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and ischemic pain during walking (intermittent
      claudication) by using a new Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) system. The
      investigators hypothesize that combining the FES and walking one hour/day (FES+Walk) will
      significantly reduce pain during walking, improve locomotion, and enhance quality of life
      when compared to walking one hour/day (Walk) alone after 8 weeks of intervention.

    <description>This group of patients are part of the walk group. They will be encouraged to walk and will receive standard care, defined as conservative (non-surgical) management of signs and symptoms, including prescriptive medications to improve circulation and manage pain, determined by their attending physician on a case by case basis.</description>

    <description>This group of patients will participate in Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) and exercise. This group will receive functional electrical stimulation as an intervention. The FES device will stimulate (activate) the calf and shin leg muscles of both legs while the patient is walking. This group will also receive standard care, defined as conservative (non-surgical) management of signs and symptoms, including prescriptive medications to improve circulation and manage pain, determined by their attending physician on a case by case basis.</description>
