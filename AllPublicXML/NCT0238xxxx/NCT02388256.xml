    <textblock>
      Background:

      Patients who undergo laparoscopic surgical resection of colorectal cancer may experience
      various post-operative symptoms (e.g., pain, nausea and vomiting, and anxiety) and limitation
      of daily activities (e.g., walking capacity). There is also a risk of post-operative
      complications and a prolonged hospital stay due to complications. Patients who underwent
      surgical resection may have experienced chronic pain, anxiety/depression, or diminished
      quality of life. The physical, psychological, and functional aspects of patients' disorders
      imply the necessity of multidisciplinary care, including complementary or traditional
      medicines such as acupuncture. This study aims to assess whether acupuncture treatment,
      combined with an enhanced recovery program after surgery in an inpatient care setting is
      effective than only an enhanced recovery program after surgery.

      Objective:

      To assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture combined with an enhanced recovery
      program after surgery to reduce postoperative symptoms and improve functional recovery and
      the patients' quality of life.

Electrical stimulation with alternating frequency of 2 to 100 Hz will be applied to the selected points (LI4 to LI11, ST36 to ST37, and bilateral SP6).
Rationale of acupuncture treatments will include both traditional theory of harmonizing gastrointestinal function and strengthening vital energy as well as modern experimental and clinical evidence of regulating gastrointestinal motility and other symptom managements. Treatments will be provided by qualified hospital staff (Korean medical doctors) with more than 10 years of clinical experience.</description>
