      This study will test whether selected allogeneic bone marrow derived MSCs are safe by
      assessing the composite end point Biopsy Proven Acute Rejection (BPAR)/ graft loss at 12
      months.

      Kidney transplantation has improved survival and quality of life for patients with end-stage
      renal disease. However, despite advances in immunosuppressive therapy, long-term allograft
      survival outcomes have not improved over the last decade.

      A promising novel therapeutic immunosuppressive option in the treatment of renal recipients
      with a profound effect on the fibrosis reaction is the clinical application of mesenchymal
      stromal cells (MSCs). Allogeneic MSCs offer the advantage of availability for clinical use
      without the delay required for expansion.

      Although it is believed that allo MSCs are immune privileged, they could possibly elicit an
      anti-donor immune response, which may increase the incidence of rejection/ graft loss and
      impact the allograft survival on the long term. These safety issues should be studied before
      further studies are planned with allogeneic MSCs in the transplant setting.

      MSCs are infused at a time point when immune suppression is lowered and the kidney is at
      increased risk for developing immune mediated injury. In addition, a large amount of the
      kidneys already has signs of fibrosis at this time point and MSCs might reduce the fibrosis
      which so importantly affects long term survival. MSCs will have no Human Leucocyte Antigen
      (HLA) sharing with the mismatches of the donor and the recipient should have no antibodies
      directed to the MSCs to reduce the anti-donor immune respons risk.
