    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open label, prospective, randomized study on adult post operative
      subjects who are expected to require oral opioid analgesia for at least 48 hours after
      surgery. The main study drug of interest in this study is MNK 155. Norco® 7.5mg/325mg is
      being utilized only as active comparator.

      Subjects will be at least 18 years of age and will be scheduled to undergo elective surgery.
      The following surgical types will be allowed, although the list is not all inclusive:

        -  Abdominal surgery

        -  Soft tissue surgery

        -  Orthopedic surgery

        -  Spine surgery

        -  Genitourinary surgery
