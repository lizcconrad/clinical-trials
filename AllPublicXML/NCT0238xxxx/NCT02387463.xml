  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most important method to slow down and stop the liver disease progression in patients
      with chronic hepatitis B is antiviral therapy, by which to achieve maintaining viral response
      during treatment or obtain sustained viral response after treatment. The aim of the therapy
      with interferon is make patients obtain immune control to HBV, in clinical practice, it was
      expressed as HBeAg seroconversion, HBsAg loss and sustained viral response in HBeAg positive
      patients. However, those targets can't be get in most patients by 48 weeks of interferon
      treatment, and some patients need extended treatment to enhance the rate of HBeAg
      seroconversion and HBsAg loss. In this cohort study, the efficacies of extended therapy of
      interferon in HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B patients will be evaluated.

      In this cohort study, the HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B patients would be treated with
      peginterferon alpha 2a(PEG-IFN a-2a) for 96 week and followed 24 weeks after treatment. Serum
      HBV DNA load, HBsAg/anti-HBs level, HBeAg/anti-HBe will be tested at enrollment and every 3
      months during treatment and follow period. Parameters of liver and kidney function, and liver
      ultrasound examination will be tested with intervals 1-3 months. The rates of HBeAg
      seroconversion, HBsAg loss, and sustained viral response will be evaluated after treatment
      and follow up.
