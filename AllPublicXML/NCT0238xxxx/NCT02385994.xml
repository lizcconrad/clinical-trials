      The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate safety and efficacy of the Cutera enlighten
      dual-pulse duration, dual-wavelength 532nm KTP/1064nm Nd:YAG laser for the treatment of
      melasma and lentigines on the face in Asian skin.

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center prospective, 2 cohort study in 80 male or female subjects of
      Asian-descent, who desire laser treatment for moderate to severe melasma (all types) or
      lentigines (all types) located on the face. Forty subjects will be enrolled in cohort 1 and
      randomized to either treatment or control arm. Forty subjects will be enrolled for treatment
      of facial lentigines in cohort 2.
