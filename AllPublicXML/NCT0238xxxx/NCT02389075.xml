    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about the relationship between systemic autoimmune disease,
      such as inflammatory bowel disease and ankylosing spondyloarthritis, bacteria in the colon,
      and the changes in colon tissue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Changes in human gut bacteria has been shown in patients with autoimmune diseases, such as
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The gut flora in ankylosing spondylitis (AS), an arthritis
      that can occur with IBD, has not been well studied. The immune cells in the colon directly
      interface with bacteria and may be influenced by them. The interactions between the colon
      immune system, bacteria and autoimmunity hasn't been studied. The study goal is to
      specifically study the link between bacteria, the colonic immune system, and the autoimmune
      diseases of AS and IBD. This will be done by collecting clinical data by questionnaires,
      blood samples, colonic tissue during endoscopy, and microbiome data in subjects with IBD, AS,
      and controls.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>IEL characteristics in IBD, AS, and healthy controls</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour after colonoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>The primary goal for this measure will be to demonstrate characteristics of IEL (intraepithelial lymphocytes) subtypes of healthy individuals and compare those with AS or IBD. IEL characteristics will be based on cell marker outcomes using flow cytometry for CD3, CD4, CD8α, CD8β, CD44, CD45, CD62L, CD69, CD103, TCRαβ, and TCRγδ.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Microbiome Differences in IBD, AS, and healthy controls</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour after colonoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>The primary hypothesis is that the microbiome population will differ between controls, IBD, and AS; outcomes for this hypothesis will include relative abundance (RA) of individual bacterial species and the Shannon Index for community diversity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Microbiome changes are reflected in IELs</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour after colonoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>The primary hypothesis is that dysbiosis will be reflected in the IEL populations in AS and IBD by having a different predominant phenotype (as seen by cell markers) compared to healthy controls; the investigators will evaluate the IEL outcomes determined to be significantly different among AS, IBD, and healthy controls as identified in Outcome 1 (Primary Outcome).</description>
