  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aspiration of gastric content is a rare but serious complication of anesthesia. In this
      context, preoperative fasting for elective surgery is well defined. In an emergency
      situation, international guidelines recommend rapid sequence of anesthesia to reduce the risk
      of aspiration. In semi emergency situation, there is no consensus about the anesthetic
      procedure even if a preoperative fasting has been observed due to uncertainty of gastric
      emptying related to stress or painful condition. The choice of anesthesia induction technique
      depends mainly on the anesthetist. Ultrasonography is a non invasive bedside tool that can
      provide reliable quantitative information about the volume of gastric content.
