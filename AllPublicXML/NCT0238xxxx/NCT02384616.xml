  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aiming at assessing the effect of inspired oxygen fraction during general
      anesthesia on children's lung mechanics and volume. More specifically, the temporal change in
      end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) and respiratory system resistance and elastance during the
      perioperative period will be characterized in order to define the the effect of high inspired
      fraction of oxygen on lung function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High-enriched oxygen fractions (FiO2)are common practice during general anesthesia both to
      ensure normoxemia despite intrapulmonary shunts and to provide security in case of adverse
      events. However, high-inspired oxygen fraction may decrease ventilation-perfusion ratios and
      its benefits are still unproven in children.

      The investigators aim at assessing the benefits and potential adverse effects of
      high-inspired oxygen fraction in two groups of children receiving either 30% FiO2 or 80% FiO2
      during maintenance of anesthesia. Nitrogen multiple breath washout technique and forced
      oscillation technique will be used to measure end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) and airway
      resistance (Rrs) and respiratory elastance (Xrs) respectively. These measurements will be
      obtained before the general anesthesia, one hour and one day after the procedure.
