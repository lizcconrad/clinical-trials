    <description>Point accuracy of Sensor based glucose values versus fingerstick blood glucose determined as % within Consensus Error Grid zone A.
The Consensus Error Grid was developed from a survey of 100 clinicians to evaluate the accuracy of glucose measurements. Glucose results from the system under test (y) are paired with those from a reference method (x) and each (x,y) point is plotted on a grid. The grid has 5 risk categories, assigned by the clinicians surveyed. Risk categories (in order of increasing severity) are: Zone A: no effect on clinical action; Zone B: altered clinical action or little or no effect on clinical outcome; Zone C: altered clinical action likely to effect clinical outcome; Zone D: altered clinical action, could have significant medical risk; Zone E: altered clinical action, could have dangerous consequences.
Result were calculated for all subjects ie total number of sensor results and fingerstick blood glucose results divided by the total number of results x 100.</description>

    <description>Subjects will wear the Abbott Sensor Based Glucose Monitoring System masked for 14 days.
During these 14 days subjects will be asked to perform 4 blood glucose tests (meals time and before bedtime) per day. At the same time as the blood glucose test a sensor scan is performed.</description>
