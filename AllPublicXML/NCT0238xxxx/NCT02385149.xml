    <textblock>
      This study investigates the health benefits of whole grain wheat on cardiovascular/
      cardio-metabolic health, including glucose metabolism, by means of applying a mixed meal
      challenge. This study also investigates the health benefits of whole grain wheat (WGW) on
      liver- and adipose tissue health and evaluates the potential of do-it-yourself (DIY) devices
      in quantifying health effects in a nutritional intervention study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled, double blind, parallel trial. A 4-week run-in period
      with refined wheat (RW) products will be included prior to the intervention for all subjects.
      Thereafter, two different treatments will be evaluated e.g. a 12-week intervention with whole
      grain wheat (WGW) products (98g of WGW per day) and a 12-week control intervention with RW
      products. Two experimental visits will be planned before and two experimental visits will be
      planned after the 12-week intervention period. In the first experimental visit the
      investigators will determine liver fat and abdominal fat distribution by magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy (MRS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the second experimental visit the
      investigators will comprehensively phenotype the participants which will include the response
      to a mixed meal challenge test.

        The inclusion of subjects with mildly impaired cardio-metabolic risk profiles enables
        detection of improvements in health after WGW consumption. The investigators therefore aim
        to include 50 middle aged and overweight males or postmenopausal females (45-70yrs and BMI
        between 25-35 kg/m2) that have mildly elevated levels of cholesterol (cholesterol levels &gt;
        5 mmol/L). In case the inclusion of subjects with mildly elevated levels of total
        cholesterol is too difficult, normal levels of total cholesterol (&lt; 5 mmol/L) can be
        accepted, but with a minimum total cholesterol level of 4.5 mmol/L.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or postmenopausal females (target 50: 50 for both genders) For females:
             menstrual cycle absent for more than 1 year

          -  Not having a general practitioner

          -  Having a history of medical or surgical events that may significantly affect the study
             outcome

          -  Smoker

          -  Use of cholesterol lowering medication

          -  Mental status that is incompatible with the proper conduct of the study

          -  Aversion, intolerance to gluten, whole wheat or other items in the intervention
             products

          -  Alcohol consumption of &gt; 21 glasses a week

          -  Abuse of drugs

          -  Recent use of antibiotics (&lt;1 month prior to day 01 of the study)

          -  Reported weight loss or weight gain of &gt; 5 kg in the month prior to pre-study
             screening

          -  Reported slimming or medically prescribed diet

          -  Reported vegan or macrobiotic life-style
