  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of GC021109 in subjects with mild
      to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (as determined by 2011 National Institute on Aging-
      Alzheimer's Association [NIA-AA] criteria and Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE]). The
      Investigator, study site staff, (with exception of a designated pharmacist/pharmacy
      technician) and all study subjects will be blinded to randomized study medication assignment
      until database lock. Treatment assignments may be unblinded for select pre-authorized
      individuals involved in the safety and PK data reviews in order to accurately determine how
      to proceed with dose escalation.

                  Moderate defined as 12-19)

               3. Documentation in the clinic notes of mild/moderate AD

          3. If on AD therapy, stable dose for at least 3 months prior to screening.

               2. Patients who are not capable of providing assent are still allowed to participate
                  provided the patient's legally authorized representative agrees to participation.

             Investigators must document the reasons for any patient that is unable to provide
             assent and maintain this documentation with the consent/assent documents.

             the Investigator), including:

               1. any values for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
                  that are 1.5 times above the upper limit of the reference range

               2. any values for total or direct bilirubin that are 1.5 times above the upper limit

             Investigator.

         11. Any conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the subject
             unsuitable for enrollment or could interfere with the subject's participation in or
             completion of the study.

         12. Positive urine screen for prohibited drugs (cocaine, cannabinoids, nicotine [urine
             cotinine is the detection mechanism for nicotine], opiates, barbiturates,
             amphetamines, and benzodiazepines) or positive alcohol Breathalyzer on Day 1.
