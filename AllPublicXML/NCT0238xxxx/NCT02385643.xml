      Background: Interactive and mobile technology to manage alcohol use problem potentially
      provide continuing care by offering emotional and instrumental support anywhere and in time,
      but the effectiveness for maintaining abstinence has not been examined. the investigators
      will evaluate in this study whether the smartphone-based support system would improve
      outcomes for people in recovery for alcohol dependence. To enable continuous self-monitoring
      and self-management, the phone support system prompts subjects to take Breath Alcohol
      Concentration (BrAC) tests using a phone application and a Bluetooth sensor unit. The system
      also offers instantaneous feedback, self-management strategies, and anonymous mutual social
      support from other subjects.

      Methods: This three-year project will be conducted in three stages, including pilot study,
      efficacy evaluation (12 week), and post-intervention follow-up (12 week) stage. Participants
      will be given a smartphone (if the subject does not have one), breathalyzer and training
      session. In the pilot study stage,10 subjects will be enrolled to validate the system. In the
      efficacy evaluation stage, the investigators will conduct a 12-week by enrolling 100
      post-detoxification alcohol dependent patients who are randomized to (1) standard treatment
      (ST) group or (2) standard treatment plus phone-based support group (technology intervention,
      TI group). Participants will be assessed by Time-Line Follow-Back (TLFB) to record the
      frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption, visual analogue for craving, Beck Depression
      Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and
      Quality of life Scale (WHOQOL-BREF) and compared for outcome measures. After the 12-week
      trial, the investigators will take back the support system and follow the all subjects in
      both groups for another 12 weeks, i.e. post-intervention stage, to further understand the
      sustaining benefit from intervention. In addition, the investigators will identify the
      clinical variables or system factors that are associated with outcome measures.

      Expected results: In this study, the investigators expect that in treatment-seeking alcohol
      dependent patients, a smartphone-supported self-management program, adding on to conventional
      treatment, will be beneficial in improving the drinking outcomes such as a higher abstinence
      rate, a lower relapse rate, and a lower drinking frequency and quantity.
