    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the
      combination of dasatinib, cyclophosphamide, and temsirolimus that can be given to patients
      with advanced solid tumors. The safety of this drug combination will be studied. As secondary
      aim the study will evaluate treatment response to this combination and biological markers.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of temsirolimus and dasatinib based on when you join this study. Up to 2 dose levels of
      both drugs will be tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled in each group. The first
      group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of both drugs. If no intolerable
      side effects are seen, the next group will receive a higher dose level of temsirolimus. If no
      intolerable side effects are seen in this second group, the third group will receive the
      higher dose level of temsirolimus and a higher dose level of dasatinib.

      All participants will receive the same dose level of cyclophosphamide.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Every study cycle will be 28 days.

      You will take tablets of dasatinib 2 times each day on Days 1-21 of each cycle while you are
      on study, with or without food. Each dose should be taken about 12 hours apart. The tablets
      should be swallowed whole, not crushed or broken. If you are unable to swallow the tablets
      whole, they can be placed and allowed to dissolve in 1 ounce of lemonade, apple juice, or
      orange juice (note that any juice must be preservative-free). You will receive detailed
      instructions about how to prepare the liquid form of dasatinib.

      You will take tablets of cyclophosphamide by mouth 1 time each day on Days 1-21 of each cycle
      when you take the second dose of dasatinib.

      You will receive temsirolimus by vein over about 30-60 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each
      cycle.

      Study Visits:

      Every week during the study, blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Every week during Cycle 1, you will also have a physical exam and urine will be collected for
      routine tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  Urine and blood will be collected for routine tests.

      On Day 15 of Cycles 2 and beyond, you will have a physical exam and blood will be collected
      for routine tests.

      Every 2 cycles:

        -  You will have an MRI or CT scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have an ECHO, if the study doctor thinks it is needed.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a spinal tap to compare to the
           earlier samples taken.

      If the study tests show abnormal results, you may need to have some of them performed more
      frequently.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the end-of-treatment visit.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      About 4 weeks after you stop receiving the study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an MRI or CT scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a spinal tap.

      This is an investigational study. Dasatinib is FDA-approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of various types of leukemia. Cyclophosphamide is FDA-approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of several types of cancer, including brain cancer and many types
      of blood cancers. Temsirolimus is FDA-approved and commercially available for the treatment
      of kidney cancer. The use of these drugs in combination against solid tumors is
      investigational.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 36 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

         11. Exclusion #8 continued: g. Drugs are not recommended but can be used with caution; 1.
             Antacids: Use of H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors is not recommended because
             systemic antacids (H2 inhibitors, proton pump inhibitors) decrease dasatinib
             absorption. Patients who require antacids should use short acting, locally active
             agents (e.g., Maalox, Mylanta etc.). However, these agents should not be taken within
             either 2 hours before or 2 hours after the dasatinib dose. 2. Drugs prolong QT
             interval; erythromycin, clarithromycin, pentamidine, ondansetron, granisetron, and
