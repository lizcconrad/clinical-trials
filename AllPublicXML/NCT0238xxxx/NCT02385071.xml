  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the relative bioavailability (the extent to which a
      drug or other substance becomes available to the body) of simeprevir (SMV) following single
      dose administration of age-appropriate oral formulation candidates compared to the 150
      milligram (mg) capsule, and to assess the effect of food on the bioavailability of SMV
      following single dose administration of a selected age-appropriate oral formulation
      candidate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized
      (study medication assigned to participants by chance), 2-panel, 3-way crossover (participants
      will receive different interventions sequentially during the trial) study in healthy adult
      participants. Participants will be equally divided over 2 panels, and will not be randomized
      between panels. Participants will not be allowed to switch panels. The study consists of 3
      parts: Screening Phase (that is, 28 days before study commences on Day 1); Open-label
      Treatment (in subsequent 3-treatment periods in each Panel, each separated with washout
      period of 7 days); and Post-Treatment Phase (up to 7 days after last study drug intake). The
      duration of the study per participant will be at least 19 days, screening and follow-up not
      included. All the eligible participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 6 treatment
      sequences in each Panel. In fasted conditions, study drug will be administered following a
      10-hour overnight fast. In fed conditions, participants will also fast from food for 10
      hours, but will consume a high fat/high calorie breakfast within a 30-minute period. Study
      drug will be administered 30 minutes after the start of breakfast. Participants will not be
      allowed to have food until at least 4 hours after study drug administration. Blood samples
      will be collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetics at pre-dose and post-dose of study
      treatment. Relative bioavailability of SMV formulations will be evaluated primarily.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history,
             12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and vital signs performed at screening (after signing
             the ICF), and on Day -1 of the first treatment session, if applicable. If there are
             abnormalities, the participant may be included only if the Investigator judges the
             abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant. This
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents

          -  Participants must be willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions
             specified in the protocol and study procedures

          -  Female participants, except for postmenopausal women, should have a negative serum
             pregnancy test at screening

          -  All female participants should have a negative urine pregnancy test on Day -1 of the
             first treatment session

          -  Male participants heterosexually active with a woman of childbearing potential must
             agree to use two effective methods of birth control and all men must not donate sperm
             during the study and for at least 30 days after receiving the last dose of study drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female participants who are pregnant or breast feeding at screening or on Day -1 of
             the first treatment session

          -  Participants with current hepatitis A infection (confirmed by hepatitis A antibody
             immunoglobulin [IgM]), or hepatitis B infection (confirmed by hepatitis B surface
             antigen [HBsAg]), or hepatitis C infection (confirmed by HCV antibody), or human
             immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) or HIV-2 infection

          -  Participants with a history or evidence of current or past abuse of alcohol, or
             recreational or narcotic drugs, which in the Investigator's opinion would compromise
             the participant's safety and/or compliance with the study procedures

          -  Participants with any history of clinically relevant skin disease such as, but not
             limited to, dermatitis, eczema, drug rash, psoriasis, food allergy, and urticaria
