  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a primary invasive melanoma are recommended to undergo excision of the primary
      lesion with a wide margin. There is evidence that less radical margins of excision may be
      just as safe. This is a randomised controlled trial of 1 cm versus 2 cm margin of excision of
      the primary lesion for adult patients with a primary invasive cutaneous melanomas &gt;=1mm thick
      to determine differences in the rate of local recurrence and melanoma specific survival. A
      reduction in margins is expected to improve quality of life in patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether there is a difference in local recurrence rates and
      melanoma survival rates for patients treated with either a 1cm excision margin or 2cm margin
      for both intermediate &amp; high risk melanomas. The study is designed to be able to prove or
      disprove that there is no difference in risk of the tumour recurring around the scar or
      anywhere else in the body between the two groups of patients. This study is designed to show
      that the risk of long-term pain associated with surgery can be halved. If the study shows no
      risk of the tumour recurrence then we will also be able to determine how much of an impact
      the narrower excision has on patients in terms of improved quality of life and reduced side
      effects from the surgery and melanoma disease. This trial will also evaluate and determine
      the economic impact of narrower excision margins on the health services and society in
      general.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a treatment which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the treatment timing, whether or not considered related to the treatment. An AE is any adverse change (developing or worsening) from the participant's pre-treatment condition, including intercurrent illness.
AEs and any pre-existing medical conditions will be recorded at the Baseline assessment and routinely at Follow Up, until the participant completes the study, withdraws or dies.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a primary invasive cutaneous melanoma of Breslow thickness greater
             than 1 millimetre as determined by diagnostic biopsy (narrow excision, incision or
             punch biopsy) and subsequent histopathological analysis.

          2. Patients must have had the invasive primary completely excised, including any in situ
             component but excluding melanocytic atypia, with a narrow margin, either in one stage
             or more than one stage in the case where an incision or punch biopsy has previously
             been performed. This information, including measured margins of lateral and deep
             clearance must be documented on the pathology report.

          3. Must have a primary melanoma that is cutaneous (including head, neck, trunk,
             extremity, scalp, palm, sole).

          4. An uninterrupted 2cm margin must be technically feasible around biopsy scar or primary
             melanoma.

          5. Randomisation and the primary study intervention, including staging sentinel node
             biopsy, must be completed by 120 days of original diagnosis.

          6. Patients must be 18 years or older at time of consent.

          7. Patient must be able to give informed consent and comply with the treatment protocol
             and follow-up plan.

          8. Life expectancy of at least 10 years from the time of diagnosis, not considering the
             melanoma in question, as determined by the PI.

          9. Patients must have an ECOG performance score between 0 and 1.

         10. A survivor of prior cancer is eligible provided that ALL of the following criteria are
             met and documented:

               -  The patient has undergone potentially curative therapy for all prior
                  malignancies,

               -  There has been no evidence of recurrence of any prior malignancies for at least
                  FIVE years (except for successfully treated cervical or non-melanoma skin cancer
                  with no evidence of recurrence), and

               -  The patient is deemed by their treating physician to be at low risk of recurrence
                  from previous malignancies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Uncertain diagnosis of melanoma i.e. so-called 'melanocytic lesion of unknown
             malignant potential'.

          2. Patient has already undergone wide local excision at the site of the primary index
             lesion.

          3. Patient unable or ineligible to undergo staging sentinel lymph node biopsy of the
             primary index lesion.

          4. Desmoplastic or neurotropic melanoma.

          5. Microsatellitosis as per AJCC 2009 definition

          6. Subungual melanoma

          7. Patient has already undergone a local flap reconstruction of the defect after excision
             of the primary and determination of an accurate excision margin is impossible.

          8. History of previous or concurrent (i.e., second primary) invasive melanoma.

          9. Melanoma located distal to the metacarpophalangeal joint, on the tip of the nose, the
             eyelids or on the ear, mucous membranes or internal viscera.

         10. Physical, clinical, radiographic or pathologic evidence of satellite, in-transit,
             regional, or distant metastatic melanoma.

         11. Patient has undergone surgery on a separate occasion to clear the lymph nodes of the
             probable draining lymphatic field, including sentinel lymph node biopsy, of the index
             melanoma.

         12. Any additional solid tumour or hematologic malignancy during the past 5 years except
             T1 skin lesions of squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, or uterine/cervical
             cancer.

         13. Melanoma-related operative procedures not corresponding to criteria described in the
             protocol.

         14. Planned adjuvant radiotherapy to the primary melanoma site after Wide Local Excision
             is not permitted as part of the protocol and any patients given this treatment would
             be excluded from the study.

         15. History of organ transplantation.

         16. Oral or parenteral immunosuppressive agents (not topical or inhaled steroids) at any
             time during study participation or within 6 months prior to enrolment.
