      To evaluate if a rapid urine Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (NAAT) is non-inferior to the
      traditional swab NAAT for gonorrhea and chlamydia when performed in the Emergency Department.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients presenting to the Emergency Department during the study period who are tested
      for gonorrhea and chlamydia by the traditional swab NAAT will concurrently have their urine
      tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia using the Cepheid GeneXpert rapid NAAT. The result of both
      tests will be compared to determine if the rapid assay is non-inferior to the current
      traditional NAAT. Both the traditional and Cepheid GeneXpert rapid NAAT are FDA and CDC
      approved for evaluation of gonorrhea and chlamydia. However, the Cepheid GeneXpert rapid NAAT
      has not been prospectively validated in the Emergency Department setting. We intend for both
      the provider obtaining the sample and the technician running the rapid assay sample to be
      blinded to the result of the traditional NAAT. The Cepheid GeneXpert rapid NAAT will not be
      used in patient care decisions.
