      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of onalespib when given together
      with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and cisplatin in treating patients with
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck that has spread from where it started to nearby
      tissue or lymph nodes. Onalespib works by blocking a protein called HSP90. HSP90 helps
      protect cells from stress and supports many other proteins that cause cell growth. When HSP90
      is blocked, tumor cell growth may be slowed or stopped and may die more easily when treated
      with chemotherapy and radiation. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. IMRT is a specialized radiation
      therapy that delivers beams of radiation of different intensities aimed at the tumor from
      many angles and may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving
      onalespib with cisplatin and IMRT may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of onalespib (AT13387) in
      combination with concurrent cisplatin and radiotherapy in patients with locoregionally
      advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA-SCCHN). (Dose Escalation Phase) II.
      To preliminarily evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of AT13387 in combination with
      concurrent cisplatin and radiotherapy in patients with LA-SCCHN. (Dose Expansion Phase)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of AT13387 in combination with cisplatin and
      radiotherapy.

      II. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin in combination with AT13387 and
      radiotherapy.

      III. To assess for pharmacodynamics biomarkers for proof-of-mechanism. IIV. To assess for
      potential predictive biomarkers of efficacy. V. To document the toxicities associated with
      the administration of AT13387 in combination with cisplatin and radiotherapy in patients with
      LA-SCCHN.

      VI. To explore and characterize predictive biomarkers for individual cancer patients
      utilizing genomic sequencing technologies.

      VII. To provide preliminary disease-free survival, locoregional control, distant
      metastases-free survival, and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of onalespib.

      Patients receive onalespib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days -7, 3, 10, 24, 31, and 38
      and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43. Patients also undergo IMRT
      once daily (QD), 5 days a week over 7 weeks for a total of 35 fractions. Treatment continues
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 8 weeks, every 3 months for
      1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year. Beyond the first 2 years, patients may be
      followed up every 6 months for up to 3 years per institutional standards.
