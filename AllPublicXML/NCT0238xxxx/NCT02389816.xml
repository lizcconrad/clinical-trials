  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change from baseline (i.e. the start of double-blind treatment) in the MADRS(Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale) total score after 8 weeks of treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 8</time_frame>
    <description>The change between MADRS scores at week 8 relative to baseline. MADRS is a 10-item clinician rated scale to measure overall severity of depressive symptoms rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 0 (normal) to 6 (most abnormal) with a total score range from 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MADRS response (defined as a ≥50% decrease in the MADRS total score from Baseline) after 8 weeks of treatment (Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)).</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 8</time_frame>
    <description>The change between MADRS score at week 8 or final visit relative to baseline. MADRS is a 10-item clinician rated scale to measure overall severity of depressive symptoms (i.e., apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, etc.) rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 0 (normal) to 6 (most abnormal) with a total score range from 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MADRS remission(defined as a MADRS total score ≤10) after 8 weeks of treatment (LOCF).</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 8</time_frame>
    <description>The change between MADRS score at week 8 or final visit relative to baseline. MADRS is a 10-item clinician rated scale to measure overall severity of depressive symptoms (i.e., apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, etc.) rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 0 (normal) to 6 (most abnormal) with a total score range from 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Hamilton Rating Scale (HAM-D17) total score after 8 weeks of treatment (LOCF).</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 8</time_frame>
    <description>The change between HAM-D 17 score at week 8 to baseline. HAM-D 17 is a 17 item rating scale to quantify anxiety symptomatology severity (i.e., anxious mood, tension, fear, insomnia, etc.) with a total score range from 0 to 50. Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement (CGI-I) score after 8 weeks of treatment (LOCF).</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I assesses the clinician's impression of the subject's state of mental illness improvement and consists of one question for the investigator: &quot;Compared to his condition at the start of the study, how much has this patient changed?&quot; which is rated on a seven-point scale (1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change relative to baseline; 5=minimally worse; 6= much worse; 7=very much worse). Higher scores indicate greater severity of illness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in CGI-S score after 8 weeks of treatment (LOCF).</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S assesses the clinician's impression of the subject's current state of mental illness and consists of one question for the investigator: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?&quot; which is rated on a seven-point scale (1=normal, not ill at all; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill). Higher scores indicate greater severity of illness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) total score after 8 weeks of treatment (LOCF).</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 8</time_frame>
    <description>The change between the Sheehan disability scale total score at week 8 to baseline. The Sheehan disability scale is a 3 item rating scale to assess functional impairment (panic, anxiety, phobic and depressive symptoms) over three inter-related domains (work/school, social life, and family life/home responsibilities) rated on an 11 point scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) with a total score range from 0 to 30. Higher scores indicate greater severity of impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) score after 8 weeks of treatment (LOCF).</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 8</time_frame>
    <description>Digit symbol substitution test (DSST) is a neuropsychological test to assess cognition function. It consists of nine digit-symbol pairs. Under each digit the subject should write down the corresponding symbol as fast as possible. DSST is scored by the number of correct symbols in the allowed time with a total scores range from 0 to 133.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Perceived Deficits Questionnaire (PDQ-5) total score after 8 weeks of treatment (LOCF).</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 8</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived Deficits Questionnaire (PDQ-5) is a self-administered, 5-item questionnaire to assess cognition function with a total scores range from 0 to 20. The total score for the PDQ-5 is the sum of the scores for the 5 items. Individual subscale scores for attention/concentration, retrospective memory, prospective memory, and planning/organization can also be generated by calculating the sum of specific sets of items.</description>
