  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy and safety of Carvedilol and Propranolol in patients with
      cirrhosis-related esophagogastric varices after multiple endoscopic treatments for secondary
      prophylaxis.

    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled trial. Patients randomly enter into two treatment
      groups: 1)the Carvedilol group and 2)the Propranolol group. Treatment allocation is by block
      randomization, with an equal number for Carvedilol and Propranolol. The results are concealed
      in opaque envelopes. The dose of non-selective β-blocker(NSBB) is titrated according to
      systolic arterial blood pressure (ABPsys) and heart rate (HR). Doses are increased every 2-3
      days until ABPsys is not less than 90 mm Hg and HR is not less than 55 bpm. Carvedilol is
      started at a dose of 6.25mg/d, and titrated to a maximum dose of 25mg/d. Patients receiving
      propranolol start at a dose of 30 mg/day and the dose will be increased to a maximum dose of
      160 mg/day. Patients will be followed up with telephone calls every 2 months. After taking
      these 2 drugs for 6 months, patients come for clinic visits, receiving laboratory tests and
      endoscopic examinations, and events of primary and secondary outcomes will be analyzed.
