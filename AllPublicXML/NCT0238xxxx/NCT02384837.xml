  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although drug-eluting stents have reduced rates of restenosis and late lumen loss compared
      with bare metal stents, late stent thrombosis (LST), a life-threatening complication of this
      technology, has emerged as a major concern. Researches indicated incomplete neointimal
      coverage of stent struts as the most important morphometric predictor of LST. Pathological
      research showed stenting disruption of adjacent vulnerable plaques can precipitate LST,
      Meanwhile, thin-cap fibroatheromas (TCFA) as the most important predictor of Major Adverse
      Cardiovascular. Therefore, there is a hypothesis that TCFA may impair intimal healing which
      are prone to LST in vivo.

      Optical coherence tomography (OCT)is a high-resolution (&lt;10 µm), catheter-based imaging
      modality capable of investigating detailed coronary plaque morphology in vivo.This study
      aimed to observe that TCFA will arise what of the effect on intimal healing of stent struts
      on the lesions which fractional flow reserve (FFR)≤0.75 after EXCEL biodegradable
      polymer-coated sirolimus-eluting stent was implanted at 9 months follow up: evaluated by OCT
      and FFR

      Quality assurance plan that addresses data validation and registry procedures, including any
      plans for site monitoring and auditing.

      Data checks to compare data entered into the registry against predefined rules for range or
      consistency with other data fields in the registry.

      Source data verification to assess the accuracy, completeness, or representativeness of
      registry data by comparing the data to external data sources (e.g., medical records, paper or
      electronic case report forms, or interactive voice response systems).

      including the source of the variable, coding information if used and normal ranges if
      relevant.

      Standard Operating Procedures to address registry operations and analysis activities, such as
      patient recruitment, data collection, data management, data analysis, reporting for adverse
      events, and change management.

Proprietary software will be used to analyze cross-sections at 1-mm intervals(every 5 frames) within the stented segment. In each cross-section, the number of struts was counted. Struts were classified as uncovered if any part of the strut was visibly exposed to the lumen, or covered if a layer of tissue was visible all over the reflecting surfaces.</description>
