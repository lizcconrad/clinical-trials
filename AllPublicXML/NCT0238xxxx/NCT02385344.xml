    <textblock>
      The purpose of the registry is to collect information regarding the number and type of
      coronary artery bypass (CAB) surgical procedure changes that are made based on intraoperative
      guidance information using transit time flow measurements (TTFM) and ultrasound image
      capabilities provided with the Medistim device.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has been scheduled for coronary bypass surgery

          -  Subject understands the nature of the procedure and has signed the subject informed
             consent prior to the procedure

          -  Subject has been diagnosed with 2-3 vessel disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is scheduled for other surgical procedures during the bypass surgery (valve
             replacement/repair, carotid endarterectomy, etc.)

          -  Subject is known to be suffering from any psychological, developmental, physical, or
             emotional disorder that the investigator feels would interfere with surgery or
             follow-up testing

          -  Subject is undergoing an emergency cardiac bypass surgery

          -  Subject has history or presence of muscle disease (i.e. myopathy, myalgia, myasthenia,
             rhabdomyolysis) with or without concomitant CK-elevation &gt; 5 ULN that cannot be
             ascribed to any other medical condition (e.g. myocardial infarction)

          -  Subject has any condition that the investigator believes should exclude him/her from
             this registry
