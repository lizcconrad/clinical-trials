  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Freezing of gait (FOG) is among the most disabling motor features of Parkinson disease (PD)
      and is present in other forms of parkinsonism as well. FOG is a brief (usually lasting &lt;30
      seconds) episode of absence or a greatly reduced forward movement of the feet despite
      intention to walk. It typically occurs when patients initiate gait (so-called &quot;start
      hesitation&quot;) and when attempting to turn. It is a leading cause of falls and often results in
      a wheelchair-dependent state. FOG greatly interferes with activities of daily living, causes
      social isolation and poor quality of life.

      FOG is one of the least understood features of PD. It possibly may develop independent of the
      other motor features of the disease, and be caused by specific pathological changes in the
      brain. Previous studies on FOG have shown conflicting information and have not lead to clear
      understanding of the pathophysiology. One key reason for this is that there appears to be
      multiple subtypes which have rarely been taken into account.

      The purpose of this study is to show that different types of FOG exist and to see if there is
      a connection to cognitive differences or gait patterns.

    <textblock>
      This study is an observational study to assess FOG via using multiple methods such as:
      clinical features, imaging, cognition and dopamine blood levels. The study consists of four
      parts (plus an optional fifth part) that will be completed over two-three separate days
      within a 30 day span. The four parts will not necessarily be performed in this order. Part
      one will be clinical and written questionnaire assessments of PD and FOG followed by 3D
      motion capture evaluations. Part two are cognitive or neuropsychiatric assessments. Part
      three is a magnetic resonance image (MRI) to examine the brain structure. Part four is
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging scan that measures norepinephrine transporter
      levels. The optional part 5 is a lumbar puncture that will measure cerebrospinal fluid
      catecholamines and proteomics.

    <measure>Dot Counting task score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Dot counting is a verbal working memory task where the examinee looks at a computer screen with a mixed array of green circles, blue circles and blue squares, and instructed to count all of the blue circles on the screen one at a time and remember the final total. Once the examinee finishes counting the blue circles on one screen, the examiner switches the display to a different mixed array of green circles, blue circles and blue squares. The examinee is instructed to count the blue circles in the new display. The number of different displays presented to the examinee in each trial increases from two to seven over six trials. After counting the blue circles on all of the displays presented within a trial, the examinee recalls the total number of blue circles in each of the different displays in the order in which they were presented. The task includes six trials with possible scores ranging from 0 to 27.</description>

    <measure>N-back task score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The n-back paradigm is a widely used measure to assess spatial working memory. The 1-back requires maintaining and updating 1 location at a time. The examinee is shown a series of 2.4 cm white squares that appear in 15 different locations on a black computer screen. Each square is presented for 1000 ms. All of the locations are equidistant from the center of the screen. The 1-back consists of one block of 30 trials, ten of which match the location of the previous square, and 20 that are in a different location. Scoring is based on the number of accurate responses out of 30 trials.</description>

    <measure>Flanker task score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Flanker task assesses an individual's ability to inhibit a prepotent response. A row of five arrows is presented in the center of the screen. The examinee is required to indicate whether the centrally presented arrow is pointing either to the left or right by pressing the left or right arrow key. The examinee is presented with two different conditions during the task, incongruent and congruent. In the congruent trials, the non-target arrows point in the same direction as the target arrow and in the incongruent trials they point in the opposite direction.The stimuli are presented in a random order with each condition being presented 24 times resulting in 48 total trials. Scoring is based on the number of accurate responses out of 48 trials.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dimensional Set Shifting task score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Dimensional Set Shifting task requires the individual to alternate between responding to shape vs. color of stimuli. Examinees are required to match a stimulus on the top of the screen to one of two stimuli in the lower corners of the screen. In task-homogeneous blocks, participants perform either Task A (e.g., classifying shapes) or Task B (e.g., classifying colors). In task-heterogeneous blocks, participants alternate between the two tasks pseudo-randomly. The combination of task-homogeneous and task-heterogeneous blocks allows measurement of general switch costs (latency differences between heterogeneous and homogeneous blocks) and specific switch costs (differences between switch and non-switch trials within the heterogeneous block). Scoring is based on the number of accurate responses out of 104 trials.</description>

    <measure>Digit Span Test score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The digit span test forward assesses attention and short-term memory. The digit span test backward assesses measures working memory. For the forward test, the examinee is told to listen carefully because the examiner will say a series of numbers and ask him/her to repeat them back to in the same order. For the backward test, the examiner will ask the examinee to repeat the numbers backwards, that is, by starting with the last number said and going backwards to the first number said. This process continues until the examinee can no longer remember either the full sequence of numbers or the correct order. Both forward and reverse trials are given twice. The Digit Span test is scored by the amount of numbers the examinee was able to remember in each test. The examiner must add the total number of correct sequences, backwards and forwards.</description>

    <measure>Number of seconds required to complete Trail Making Test (TMT): Trails A and Trails B</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Trail A assesses scanning ability and psychomotor speed. Trail B assesses executive function. In Part A, the circles are numbered 1 - 25, and the participant should draw lines to connect the numbers in ascending order. In Part B, the circles include both numbers (1 - 13) and letters (A - L); as in Part A, the participant draws lines to connect the circles in an ascending pattern, but with the added task of alternating between the numbers and letters (i.e., 1-A-2-B-3-C, etc.). The participant should be instructed to connect the circles as quickly as possible. The participant is timed as he or she connects the &quot;trail.&quot; If the participant makes an error, point it out and allow the participant to correct it. Errors affect the participant's score only in that the correction of errors is included in the completion time for the task. Participants are scored by the number of seconds taken to complete the task, with high scores revealing greater impairment.</description>

    <measure>Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The WCST measures cognitive flexibility and problem solving skills. The WCST consists of a pack of 4 stimulus cards and 48 response cards which are devised so that each card contains from 1 to 4 identical figures of a single color. Individually administered, it requires the participant to sort the cards according to different principles (ie, by color, form, or number). As the test progresses, there are unannounced shifts in the sorting principle which require the participant to alter his or her approach.The 'number of categories' measures the number of correct responses. The percentage of perseverative errors provides the concentration of perseverative errors in relation to the overall test performance.</description>

    <measure>New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (NFOG-Q) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The NFOG-Q is used to quantify FOG severity and frequency in the daily living. It is a self-report measure that begins with the presentation of a short video to illustrate FOG during walking, turning and starting gait and then follows with questions related to frequency and duration of each type of FOG episode. Part I detects the presence of FOG using a dichotomous item in which individuals are classified as a freezer (FR) or a non-freezer (NFR). Parts II and III are designed for FRs only, providing a total summed score between 0 and 28. Part II (items 2-6, scoring range 0-19) rated the severity of FOG based on its duration and frequency. Part III rates the impact of FOG on daily life (items 7-9, scoring range 0-9).</description>

          -  Hoehn &amp; Yahr Stage I-IV parkinsonism

          -  Limited response to Levodopa but FOG unresponsive, but may be on levodopa or other
             dopaminergic medications

          -  Age 18-85 years

          -  Presence of FOG by history and seen by examiner at their clinical office visit or in a
             video taken at home

          -  MRI scan demonstrating no structural lesions: stroke, tumor or hydrocephalous

          -  Able sign a consent document and willing to participate in all aspects of the study

          -  Able to have an MRI scan (no pacemakers or history of claustrophobia).

        Exclusion Criteria for subjects with freezing of gait (FOG) but not Parkinson disease (PD):

          -  Dementia that precludes completing study protocol

          -  Stage V Parkinsonism - unable to walk independently.

          -  Treatment with medications that cause parkinsonism: drug-induced parkinsonism

          -  MRI scan demonstrating structural lesions or hydrocephalous

          -  Notable levodopa response suggesting a diagnosis of PD including motor fluctuations or
             dyskinesia.

          -  Any neurological or orthopedic disorders that interfere with gait.

          -  Treatment with medications that will interfere with NET-PET ligand binding.

          -  Any contraindications for MRI scan including pacemaker, deep brain stimulator, bladder
