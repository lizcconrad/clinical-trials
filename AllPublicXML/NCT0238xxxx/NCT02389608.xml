  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is currently considered a
      beneficial method for patients with neurological problems due to the modulation of cortex
      activity as well as the enhancement and prolongation of functional gains achieved during
      physical therapy. Purpose: The aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the immediate effects
      of a session of tDCS over the primary motor cortex combined with functional electrical
      simulation (FES) on electrical activity of the tibialis anterior muscle, balance and
      distribution of plantar pressure in individuals with hemiparesis stemming from a stroke. A
      further aim is to determine whether the effects of the combination of both stimulation
      methods are better than those achieved when each method is employed alone. Methods/design: A
      randomized, double-blind, crossover, cross-sectional study will be conducted involving 30
      stroke survivors with hemiparesis who meet the eligibility criteria. Evaluations will involve
      an identification and screening chart, the classification of motor impairment using the
      Fugl-Meyer Scale, the determination of spasticity of the triceps surae muscle (modified
      Ashworth scale), electromyography of the tibialis anterior muscle, static balance and
      cognitive dual-task balance (stabilometry) and plantar pressure. After the initial
      evaluations, the participants will undergo four interventions: 1) anodal tDCS + placebo FES +
      active tibialis anterior contraction; 2) placebo tDCS + active FES + active tibialis anterior
      contraction; 3) anodal tDCS + active FES + active tibialis anterior contraction; and 4)
      placebo tDCS + placebo FES placebo + active tibialis anterior contraction. tDCS will be
      administered over the primary motor cortex and FES will be administered over the tibialis
      anterior muscle. The order of the different protocols will be randomized and both the
      evaluator and patients will be blinded to which protocol is being administered.

    <description>Transcranial stimulation ( tDCS ) will be administered using Tct Research 1 CH tdcs Simulator model 101. tDCS will be performed for 20 minutes and intensity 2mA associated active contraction of the TA muscle. Placebo tDCS will follow the same procedures as active tDCS with active, but the tDCS device will only be switched on for 20 seconds.
Functional electrical stimulation (FES) will be administered using QUARK® FES VIF 995 DUAL device. The duration of active FES will be 20 minutes, associated with active contraction of the TA muscle. The pulse width will be 250 µs, modulated at a frequency of 50 Hz, with one to two stimulation cycles (6 seconds on and 12 seconds off) and the intensity will be increased until reaching the motor threshold. Placebo FES will follow the same procedures as active FES , but the FES device will only be switched on for 20 seconds, following which the intensity will be gradually reduced to 0 mA.</description>
