      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a single layer dermally sutured wound
      results in superior outcomes to a layered closure. Our aims are to compare outcomes using a
      split wound model, where half the wound is sutured with one technique and the other half is
      sutured with the other. This will be measured via the physician observer scar assessment
      scale, a validated scar instrument and via wound width. Our hypothesis is that wounds with a
      single layer closure will result in cosmetically superior wound outcomes.

    <measure>Assessment of Scar on the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>After surgical procedure, half of the subject's wound will be closed by single layer suturing, while the other half is closed by layered cutaneous closure. After 3 months, subjects will return to clinic for evaluation of the cosmesis of both types of closure techniques.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>After surgical procedure, half of the subject's wound will be closed by single layer suturing, while the other half is closed by layered cutaneous closure. After 12 months, subjects will return to clinic for evaluation of the cosmesis of both types of closure techniques.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of Scar Width</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The width of the scar will be measured 1 centimeter from the midline on both sides. There is no defined width that is considered satisfactory or not satisfactory. The measurements will be compared between subjects.</description>
