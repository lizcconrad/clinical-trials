  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of preventative nutritional strategies to promote healthy ageing is becoming
      increasingly important. Elevated thresholds for taste and smell, coupled with swallowing
      difficulties and masticatory dysfunction, often result in nutritionally imbalanced diets
      among the elderly. This can induce great changes in the composition and metabolic activities
      of the gut microbiome, leading to decreased intestinal motility and impaired bowel function.
      This can result in constipation or diarrhoea, increased basal levels of inflammation,
      immunosenescence and morbidity. The objectives of this study are to use dietary modification
      to improve gut health in older people. Diets high in resistant starch or dietary fibre will
      be given to 50 elderly volunteers (70-95 years) living in the community, in a randomised
      double-blind cross-over study. The aim is to investigate the effects on microbiome
      composition and functionality through fermentation, reduced putrefaction, and modification of
      blood markers associated with obesity and diabetes.
