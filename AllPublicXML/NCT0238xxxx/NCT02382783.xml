      This project is aimed at developing an improved multilevel care process model for the
      management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity by implementing systematic
      self-monitoring of flare experiences by RA patients, combined with continuous
      patient-tailored adjustments of treatment modalities by a coordinated team of rheumatology
      health care providers (RHCPs).

    <description>The occurrence of flares over the follow-up time (flare rate). The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology(OMERACT-9) definition of flare will be applied to both groups to determine how many occurrences indicate worsening of disease activity, leading to initiation, change, or increase of therapy by RHCPs. This definition will allow for parallel comparisons of flare rates in both groups.</description>

    <description>In the FLARE Intervention Group, we ask that you participate in all of the following, over the course of two years:
Baseline Study Visit
Monthly: Complete FLARE Questionnaires, at home, and report results. The last question on this questionnaire will ask you if you feel you are having a flare of your disease.
FLARE Study Visit (if applicable): We will schedule you to be seen when/if you feel you are having a flare of your disease.
Follow-up Visits (minimum of every 6 months): These are done as the standard of care for your RA.
At one time-point, during your first return visit after the baseline visit you will have an examination by ultrasound
Patient Satisfaction Surveys at three time-points: Baseline, 1 year, 2 year
Also, your rheumatology health care provider (RHCP) will be asked to participate in the study by completing three satisfaction surveys over the course of two years.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Standard of Care (SOC) Group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>If you are randomized to the SOC Group, your care will not be any different than your usual care of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). You will be seen by a rheumatologist at a minimum of every six months, which is the standard of care for RA.
Additionally (for research), we ask the following of you...
At one time-point, during your first return visit after the baseline visit you will have an examination by ultrasound
Patient Satisfaction Surveys at three time-points: Baseline, 1 year, 2 year
Also, your rheumatology health care provider (RHCP) will be asked to participate in the study by completing three satisfaction surveys over the course of two years.</description>

    <description>Everything being completed in this group is also being completed in the Standard of Care (SOC) Group except for the following...
The participants randomized to this group will be asked to complete FLARE Questionnaires on a monthly basis and will call us each month with their results. The last question on the questionnaire asks if the patient feels he/she is having a flare. If the patient says &quot;yes&quot; to this question, then the study coordinator will arrange for an appointment to be scheduled with a rheumatology health care provider at Mayo Clinic Rochester. The goal will be to have this appointment take place within seven days of the FLARE Questionnaire results being reported.</description>
