  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the in-line fluid pressure (pressure of the fluid
      going through the tubing) and leakage (observation of fluid on and around the device) during
      and after subcutaneous infusion using two types of infusion sets. One infusion set is
      investigational, developed by BD, and the other is the Quick-set (Medtronic), which is
      commercially available. These infusion sets will be used with a commercially available
      insulin pump to deliver insulin diluent (an inactive liquid with no medication) for
      approximately 4 1/2 hours. During this time pressure and leakage will be continuously
      monitored.

      This is a single center, open label study.

      Each subject is to receive up to 4 basal/bolus diluent infusions in the abdomen with the BD
      Scarlett and the Medtronic Quick-setÂ®; 2 Scarlett infusion sets and 2 Quick-set infusion
      sets. The order of device placement will be randomized.

      After insertion, insulin diluent will be delivered at a rate of 0.01 mL/hour (equivalent in
      volume and rate to 1.0 unit/hour of U-100 insulin) via the insulin pump for a minimum of 3
      hours. After 3 hours of basal infusion, a bolus of 0.1 mL (equivalent to 10 units) will be
      delivered via the insulin pump and basal infusion continued for a minimum of 1 additional
      hour.

      At the end of the final basal infusion period, the infusion set tubing will be clamped to
      mimic an occlusion event and allowed to run until either an occlusion alert (&quot;no delivery&quot;)
      is signaled by the pump, or a minimum of 30 minutes, whichever comes first. Infusion pressure
      data will be collected during the entire infusion period, including the time the tubing is
      clamped. After removal of the device from the body, the presence of fluid on the application
      site skin (Leakage) will be determined by visual assessment then measured using gravimetric
      analysis, if applicable.

    <time_frame>Continuous measure for 4-5 hours after insertion</time_frame>
    <description>Infusion pressure profiles will be measured by an inline pressure transducer and recorded by a data logger. Pressure profiles will be evaluated by type of infusion set. The occurrence of pressure events (continuous pressure rises or flow interruptions of at least 30 minutes) will be assessed.</description>

    <measure>Leakage</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately upon device removal</time_frame>
    <description>Upon removal of the infusion set, the infusion site and device will be checked for fluid leakage. If leakage is observed, the infusion site device hub/skin interface will be swabbed for fluid with a pre-weighed swab. The swab will be re-weighed to determine the amount of fluid. Fluid collected at infusion site and the device/skin interface will not be classified as leakage if the measured volume is less than 0.005 mL (equivalent to 0.5 units U-100 insulin).</description>
