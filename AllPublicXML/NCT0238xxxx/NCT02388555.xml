  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there is paucity of information on the prevalence of pre-operative coronal
      imbalance in patients with degenerative lumbar scoliosis (DLS) and its influence on surgical
      outcomes. This study aims to investigate in DLS, the prevalence of coronal imbalance, to
      propose a novel classification system and to investigate whether pre-operative coronal
      imbalance affects clinical outcomes following osteotomy. A total of 284 DLS patients were
      recruited.

      A total of 284 DLS patients were recruited into this two-stage study, among which 69 patients
      were treated by posterior-only correction and the remaining 215 patients received
      conservative treatment. Using pre-operative long-cassette X-ray films, all patients were
      classified based on coronal balance distance (CBD) defined as the horizontal distance between
      C7 plumb line and central sacral vertical line: Type A, CBD &lt; 3cm; Type B, CBD &gt; 3cm and C7PL
      shifts to the concave side of curve; Type C, CBD &gt; 3cm and C7PL shifts to the convex side of
      curve. The prevalence of pre-operative coronal imbalance was calculated for stage I study.
      Post-operative CBD in patients who received surgery was measured to evaluate clinical
      outcomes for stage II study.

    <measure>The relationship between coronal balance classification and immediate post-operative imbalance using radiographic measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This part of the study aims to analyze the immediate imbalance after surgery, most of the patients took post-operative films two weeks after surgery, but there were some patients who could not stand at that timepoint and the follow-up time was then at 3 months after surgery.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relationship between post-operative imbalance and quality of life using quality of life questionnaires including SF-36, ODI and VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life measurements were obtained using questionnaires, and the correlations between coronal imbalance and quality of life were analyzed at 1 year follow-up.</description>

    <description>The prevalence of coronal imbalance was analyzed in this cross-sectional study. Only a small part of the patients were with longitudinal follow-up. Most of them were without follow-up.</description>
