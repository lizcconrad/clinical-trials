  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who present with an unstable cervical spine following an accident need a general
      anesthesia for the necessary surgery.

      Commonly, the management of the tracheal intubation is performed by a fiberoptic technique.

      However, changes in equipment availability and quality may challenge the fiberoptic
      intubation technique.

      The investigators wish to compare the tracheal intubations performed with the Airtraq in
      comparison with the fiberscopic technique.

      Patients who present with an unstable cervical spine following an accident need a general
      anesthesia for the necessary surgery.

      Commonly, the management of the tracheal intubation is performed by a fiberoptic technique
      (historic gold standard technique).

      However, changes in equipment availability and quality may challenge the fiberoptic
      intubation technique.

      We wish to compare the tracheal intubations performed with the Airtraq in comparison with the
      fiberscopic technique.

      Primary outcomes will be the changes in neurophysiologic responses monitored by a
      neurophysiologist in 5 specific phases:

        1. Basal potential (BM): neuromonitoring while the patient is anesthetized, no movements

        2. Ventilation potential (VM): neuromonitoring while the patient is anesthetized and a
           bag-mask ventilation is performed

        3. Intubation potential (IP): neuromonitoring while the patient is being intubated with one
           of the two randomized devices

        4. Post Intubation (PI): neuromonitoring after the patient has been intubated

        5. Post Positioning (PP): neuromonitoring after the patient has been properly positioned on
           the operating table and is ready for surgery
