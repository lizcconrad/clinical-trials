  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Eustachian tube links the middle ear to the back of the nose and is designed to open to
      allow the pressure in the air-filled middle ear to be equal to external (atmospheric)
      pressure. In some people this system fails to work properly leading to abnormal pressure in
      the middle ear, and complications such as middle ear fluid ('glue ear') or damage to the ear
      drum. The abnormal function of the Eustachian tube is called 'Eustachian tube dysfunction'.
      An affected person may feel pressure, pain or other symptoms in their ear, and their hearing
      can be temporarily or permanently reduced.

      This study is designed to find out which of a number of simple tests is best at detecting if
      the Eustachian tube is performing normally. Both patient-completed questionnaires and
      clinical tests using specialist machines will be compared as a way of diagnosing Eustachian
      tube dysfunction.

      A group of adults aged 18 and above, and children aged 5-17 years with normal ears, and a
      similar group of people that are already known to have Eustachian tube dysfunction, will both
      take six different tests and complete four different questionnaires. The differences in the
      results between the group with ETD and the healthy group will be compared. The results for
      each test or questionnaire will be compared to see which is best at telling the healthy and
      Eustachian tube function groups apart, and therefore at diagnosing Eustachian tube
      dysfunction. The investigators will also look to see if a combination of one or more of the
      tests or questionnaires is best at diagnosing the disease.

      The results of this study hope to provide a test or combination of tests that can be used on
      a daily basis by ENT doctors. The assessment technique would also be helpful in researching
      and comparing new treatments for ETD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Cases: Adults or children diagnosed with ETD:

        Patients will be assessed on a 'per ear' basis, with some patients being recruited
        bilaterally, and others only unilaterally. Inclusion will be based on expert assessment.

          1. Children with middle ear effusion (or ventilation tube in situ for effusion), tympanic
             membrane retraction pockets, tympanic membrane perforations, recurrent acute otitis
             media.

          2. Adult patients with otological disease caused by ETD - middle ear effusion (or
             ventilation tube in situ for effusion), tympanic membrane retraction pockets, tympanic
             membrane perforations, cholesteatoma.

          3. Adult patients with symptoms consistent with ETD.

        Controls:

        Separate adult and child control groups will be recruited. Controls will be a mix of
        otologically healthy individuals presenting to clinic for an unrelated issue (e.g. thyroid
        disease) and patients with an otological disorder not associated with ETD (e.g.
        Sensorineural hearing loss, Otosclerosis, Meniere's, Labyrinthitis, BPPV). Controls will be
        screened for ETD prior to inclusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Cases:

          -  Current upper respiratory tract infection

          -  Discharging ear (active chronic suppurative otitis media)

          -  Severe bilateral nasal obstruction

          -  Nasopharyngeal mass or excised malignancy

          -  Radiation therapy to the head and neck

          -  Cleft palate or repaired cleft palate

          -  Craniofacial syndrome including Down syndrome

          -  Ciliary dysmotility syndrome

          -  Acute disease/symptom duration &lt;3months

        Controls, as above plus:

          -  No reported current symptoms or history of ETD or middle ear disease

          -  No rhinitis or nasal allergic symptoms

          -  No nasal polyposis

          -  No gastro-oesophageal reflux disease or symptoms suggestive of laryngo-pharyngeal
             reflux.
