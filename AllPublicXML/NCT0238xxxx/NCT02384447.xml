  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are proposing to conduct this study to compare the ultrasonographic
      appearance of the sciatic nerve with their corresponding histologic architecture. Patients
      that are scheduled to undergo above knee amputation due to complications associated with
      diabetes will be enrolled. We intend to do an ultrasound examination of the sciatic nerve at
      its bifurcation (about 4 inches above the knee). The investigators would mark the area on the
      skin where the image is obtained. Following surgery we will conduct a histologic examination
      of the nerve at the same site.

      Ultrasound examination is not standard of care, but is a fairly noninvasive procedure and
      does not add any risk to the subject. Histologic examination of the nerve is also not
      standard of care, but is conducted on a pathology specimen

    <description>There is outcome measure pe se. This is an observational study. We intend to study the ultrasonographic appearance of the sciatic nerve and compare this ultrasonographic appearance with the histologic appearance of the nerve. We know the nerve in diabetic neuropathy appears ultrasonographically different than a normal nerve. We just want to study the changed appearance of the nerve under ultrasound examination with the corresponding appearance of the nerve under the microscope.</description>
