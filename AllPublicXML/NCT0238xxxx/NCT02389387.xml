    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to facilitate coordination of transplant centers in North
      Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia to share kidney transplant referral data in patients
      with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) who are candidates for kidney transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disparities exist in access to kidney transplantation where poor and minority patients are
      less likely to access each step of the kidney transplant process. Current national
      surveillance data does not capture information on transplant referral, and it is unclear to
      what extent dialysis facility-level factors may influence disparities in access to
      transplantation. Due to significant variability in the standardized transplant ratios
      observed at each facility, the investigators hypothesize that there may be facility-related
      reasons that impact disparities in access to the first step of the kidney transplant process
      -- referral to the transplant center to undergo an evaluation for the suitability for
      transplant.

    <description>Two hundred twenty (220) dialysis facilities will follow standard of care practices and the intensive intervention in their management of ESRD patients. The intensive intervention will consist of 1) A multi-module, secure, web-enabled software application called Transplant Referral EXchange (T-REX) to enhance coordination between dialysis and transplant staff and track ESRD patients through the seven primary steps to transplant , 2) educational webinars/seminars for staff, 3) facility-specific performance feedback reports, 4) assistance with and review of center-specific action plans to increase transplant referral, 5) scheduled bi-annual phone calls with an SETC member to monitor progress, 6) patient education on transplant via creation of an Education Station in facility lobby, and 7) development of a Peer Mentor program.</description>

    <description>I.A multi-module, secure, web-enabled software application called Transplant Referral EXchange (T-REX):1) real-time communication between staff across healthcare settings, documenting the use of transplant education materials, 2) sending/receiving electronic referrals for transplant specific to a transplant center's requirements and 3) tracking patients' status in the transplant process (e.g., patient interest in transplant, referral for transplant, evaluation start/completion, waitlist status, and transplant) II. Educational webinars/seminars for staff, III. Facility-specific performance feedback reports, IV. Assistance with and review of center-specific action plans to increase transplant referral, V. Scheduled bi-annual phone calls with an SETC member to monitor progress, VI. Patient education on transplant via creation of an Education Station in facility lobby, VII.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Kidney transplant centers in the geographic area of North Carolina (NC), South
             Carolina (SC) and Georgia (GA)

          2. Low rates of referral for kidney transplantation (6-month crude referral risk mean of
             0.06 and all facilities with a crude referral risk less than the mean)

          3. The presence of a racial disparity (African American vs. Caucasian) in referrals for
             kidney transplantation (racial disparity calculated based on the crude referral risk
             difference and the standardized referral risk difference.)

        The final pool of 440 facilities will be randomized to either the intervention or control
        group using a one to one ratio.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Close out date populated

          2. Transplant and hospital-based facility

          3. Home dialysis facility

          4. Patient census &lt;25

          5. &gt;100 miles from nearest transplant center

          6. Non-profit facility (except Wake Forest University Dialysis)
