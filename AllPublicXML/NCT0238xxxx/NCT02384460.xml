      The aim is to assess the efficacy and safety of SD-101-6.0 cream versus SD-101-0.0 (placebo)
      in the treatment of patients with Epidermolysis Bullosa. Funding Source - FDA OOPD

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a rare group of inherited disorders that typically manifest at
      birth as blistering and lesion formation on the skin and, in some cases, the epithelial
      lining of other organs, in response to little or no apparent trauma. In consequence, the skin
      is extremely fragile which can result in shearing of the skin, causing a high risk of
      infection. All forms of EB are both debilitating and life threatening. In some EB subtypes,
      high mortality occurs before the age of 1 (Junctional Herlitz), and others in adolescence to
      early adulthood, typically due to infection or failure to thrive. In addition, children
      surviving into their 20's and 30's are also at risk for development of a virulent form of
      squamous cell carcinoma, which is in many cases fatal.

      There are no standard of care products available to treat the dermal manifestations of EB,
      and there is no approved drug for EB in either Europe or the United States. There have been
      numerous studies published on potential treatments for skin manifestations associated with
      EB, including vitamin E therapy, systemic phenytoin, topical nonsteroidal agents,
      cyproheptadine, tetracycline, and dapsone. No controlled studies showed clinical benefit of
      any therapy. Newer exploratory treatments including skin grafts, bioengineered skin products,
      and gene therapy have been unsuccessful to date.

      This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study to
      assess the efficacy and safety of SD-101-6.0 cream vs. placebo (SD-101-0.0) on lesions in
      patients with Simplex, Recessive Dystrophic, or Junctional non-Herlitz Epidermolysis Bullosa.

      SD-101-6.0 cream or placebo (SD-101-0.0) will be applied topically, once a day to the entire
      body for a period of 90 days. Patients will have 1 target wound selected at baseline by the
      investigator. Selected target wound must be of at least a certain age. Photographic
      confirmation of the target wound location will be collected at baseline, and the picture
      saved from the first visit will be used to confirm location of the target wound at subsequent
      visits.

      The patient will return to the study site for Visit 2 (14 days ±5 days from baseline), Visit
      3 (30 days ±7 days from baseline), Visit 4 (60 days ±7 days from baseline), and Visit 5 (90
      days ±7 days from baseline) to have the target wound, previously identified at baseline,
      re-assessed for the level of healing. In addition, itching, pain, body surface area (BSA),
      target wound closure, and scarring of healed target wound will also be assessed at each
      visit. The ARANZ SilhouetteStar™ will be used to measure the target wound at all visits.
