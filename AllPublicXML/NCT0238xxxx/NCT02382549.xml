      This study evaluates whether it is safe to administer a helper peptide vaccine with
      dabrafenib and trametinib. This study will also evaluate the effects of the combination of
      the peptide vaccine and dabrafenib and trametinib on the immune system. We will monitor these
      effects by performing tests in the laboratory on participants' blood, a lymph node, and tumor
      samples.

    <description>The vaccine drug product, 6MHP, consists of 6 class II MHC-restricted peptides derived from melanoma proteins. Each vaccine consists of 200 mcg of each of the six peptides. An aqueous solution of vaccine is mixed 1/1 with Montanide ISA-51 to form water-in-oil emulsions. Vaccines are administered days 1, 8, 15, 36, 57, 78. All peptide vaccines are administered intradermally and subcutaneously.
Dabrafenib is a small molecular BRAF inhibitor and will be administered in accordance with the prescribing information: 150 mg orally twice daily taken at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after a meal; the doses will be approximately 12 hours apart. Trametinib is a small molecular MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor and will be administered in accordance with the prescribing information: 2 mg orally once daily taken at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after a meal. The medication will be taken at the same time each day with either the morning or evening dose of dabrafenib.</description>
