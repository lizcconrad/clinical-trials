    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ASP4132 and to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose of ASP4132. The study will
      also determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASP4132 and evaluate the preliminary antitumor
      activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two parts and these will be conducted sequentially: Part 1 (dose
      escalation) and Part 2 (dose expansion). Subjects will participate in Part 1 or Part 2.
