  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic Focal Segmental Glumero Sclerosis (FSGS) is not very common but important
      manifestation of kidney disease.

      FSGS has poor prognosis among the patterns of Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome (INS).

      Even with treatment (Steroid therapy and cytotoxic immunosuppressant therapy), many patients
      eventually still require dialysis.

      Cell therapy is useful in treatment of INS and mesenchymal stromal/stem cell is one of the
      cells that useful in the treatment of glomerulus disease.

      Intravenous injection of allogeneic adipose derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cell will be
      done in 5 patients with refractory INS(FSGS). They will be followed 1, 2, 4 weeks and then
      monthly until a year following injection day.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary FSGS thought to be a part of the immune-mediated disease. Main challenge is to
      decrease protein excretion in urine. Only 30% of children with FSGS achieve complete
      remission with steroids and other 30-40% patients experience remission (partial and complete)
      with cytotoxic immunosuppressant drugs. Even with these treatments, many patients eventually
      still require dialysis. Other treatment strategy doesn't exceed beyond symptomatic treatment
      and delaying the progression. Also risk of recurrence after kidney transplantation is 20-50%.

      Cell therapy is one of the treatment strategies and mesenchymal stromal/stem cell is one
      modality that notice in glomerulus disease.

      We will evaluate safety and efficacy of intravenous injection of allogeneic AD-MSC
      (adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cell) in 5 refractory INS patients.They will be followed
      1, 2, 4 weeks and then monthly until a year following injection day.
