      Part A: This is a phase Ib trial combining the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib with the PI3K
      inhibitors taselisib, or pictilisib. There are two treatment arms during the dose escalation
      phase where patients will receive either taselisib OR pictilisib in combination with
      palbociclib. Palbociclib, taselisib and pictilisib can all be given orally once daily with
      food, in a 21-days-on and 7-days-off schedule. Once the MTD is reached, the combination with
      the optimum safety and PK/PD profile will be taken forward to the dose expansion phase (Part
      B).

      Part B1: At the MTD dose expansion, fulvestrant will be administered in addition to
      palbociclib and taselisib or pictilisib orally once daily, in a 21-days-on and 7-days-off
      schedule in the ER+ve HER2-ve PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cohort. Fulvestrant will be given
      intramuscularly on Day 1, Day 15 in cycle one followed by Day 1 for all subsequent cycles.

      Part B2: At the MTD dose expansion, patients with PIK3CA mutant advanced solid tumours will
      be treated with palbociclib and taselisib or pictilisib orally once daily, in a 21-days-on
      and 7-days-off schedule.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib trial of palbociclib in combination with either taselisib or pictilisib.
      The study will include a dose escalation phase (Part A), and an MTD dose expansion phase
      (Part B).

      Part A: will investigate escalating doses of palbociclib with either pictilisib or taselisib
      administered orally, continuously for 21 days out of a 28 day cycle in patients with advanced
      solid tumours recruited simultaneously into two parallel arms (up to 24 patients in each arm
      with a maximum of 48 patients in Part A).

      Once the MTD is determined the combination with the optimum safety and PK/PD profile as
      determined by the SRC will be taken forward to the dose expansion phase (Part B).

      Part B: The MTD dose expansion phase will be conducted using the optimal combination from
      Part A in two parallel arms as follows:

      B1: Patients (n=25) with PIK3CA mutant ER + HER2-ve advanced breast cancers will be treated
      with a triplet combination of palbociclib and either taselisib or pictilisib along with
      fulvestrant. Part B1 will require at least two of the first 15 patients to respond to
      progress to recruit the full 25 patients.

      B2: Patients (n=20) with PIK3CA mutant advanced solid tumours including at least 8 patients
      with PIK3CA mutant ER negative and/or HER2 positive breast cancers will be treated with the
      doublet combination of palbociclib and either taselisib or pictilisib. Other cancers with
      relevant genetic aberrations (e.g. KRAS mutations) may be considered, depending on emerging
      preclinical and clinical data on these novel antitumour agents.

      In total, it is expected that a minimum of 70 and up to a maximum of 93 patients will be
      enrolled into the trial, the final number will depend on the number of dose escalations
      required to reach DLT. If &lt; 48 patients are enrolled in Part A, investigators will be
      permitted to enrol &gt; 45 patients in Part B, providing the maximum number of patients remains
      ≤93 patients across the study.

      The anticipated accrual rate during the dose escalation phase is estimated at 2 patients per
      month. Accrual in the expansion phase is estimated at 4 patients per month across 2 centres.
      It is expected that the trial will have a duration of recruitment of 12 to 24 months.

          5. On-going toxic manifestations of previous treatments ≥ grade 1. Exceptions to this are
             alopecia or certain other toxicities, which in the opinion of the Investigator should
             not exclude the patient.

          6. History of malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with enteral
             absorption. For example active intestine inflammation (e.g., Crohn's disease or

               -  Not requiring dexamethasone treatment

         10. Major surgery (excluding minor procedures, e.g. placement of vascular access) within 4
             weeks of the first dose of study treatment

         11. Ability to become pregnant (or already pregnant or lactating). However, those female
             patients who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before enrolment and agree

             measures not to father children by using one form of highly effective contraception
             [condom plus spermicide] during the trial and for six months afterwards). Men with
             pregnant or lactating partners should be advised to use barrier method contraception
             (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure to the foetus or
             neonate.

         13. At high medical risk because of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease, such as:

             uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure ≥ class 2 (refer to
             appendix 4 for grading), unstable angina pectoris, stroke or myocardial infarction
             within 6 months, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment, with the exceptions
             of atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or conduction
             abnormality that has been treated and for which the patient is no longer at risk for

             abuse, or current known active infection with hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus.

             Active infection is defined as requiring treatment with antiviral therapy or presence
             of positive test results for Hepatitis B (Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] and/or
             total Hb core antibody [anti-HBc]) or Hepatitis C (Hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody).
             Unless required by local regulations, patients are not required to have HIV, HCB, or
             HCV assessments at screening if these assessments have not been previously performed.

             Patients who are positive for anti-HBc are eligible only if testing is also positive
             for Hepatitis B surface antibody [HbsAb] and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is
             negative for HBV DNA.

             Patients who are positive for HCV serology are eligible only if testing for HCV RNA is
             negative.

         15. Immunocompromised status due to current known active infection with HIV or due to the
             use of immunosuppressive therapies for other conditions

         16. Need for current chronic corticosteroid therapy, specifically dexamethasone or ≥ 10 mg
             of prednisone per day or an equivalent dose of other anti inflammatory
             corticosteroids. Stable use (i.e., no change in dose within 1 month prior to Day 1 of
             Cycle 1) of inhaled corticosteroids is allowed.

         17. Prior bone marrow transplant or extensive radiotherapy to greater than 25% of bone
             marrow within eight weeks.

         18. Is a participant or plans to participate in another interventional clinical trial,
             whilst taking part in this Phase I study. Participation in an observational trial
             would be acceptable.

         19. Current malignancies of other types, with the exception of adequately treated
             cone-biopsied in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri and basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin. Cancer survivors, who have undergone potentially curative
             therapy for a prior malignancy, have no evidence of that disease for 3 years or more
             and are deemed at negligible risk for recurrence, are eligible for the trial.

         20. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a
             good candidate for the clinical trial.
