  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to try to treat bowel movement (BM) accidents differently with
      children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study will use over-the-counter (OTC)
      medications to evoke predictable bowel movements. This will make it possible for
      investigators to use certain strategies to reward BMs in the toilet. Independence will be
      increased by fading out the use of medications. The investigators will also train caregivers
      to implement the procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large percentage of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are delayed in
      achieving continence with bowel movements or never achieve it at all (i.e., they meet
      criteria for encopresis). This problem has tremendous ramifications for these individuals and
      their families because encopresis restricts them from integration with peers, limits access
      to educational opportunities, and carries significant social stigma. Previous interventions
      for encopresis in this population have either been unsuccessful or required implementation
      over very long periods.

    <description>An independent evaluator (IE) will use the parent target problem (PTP) interview to help caregivers estimate the frequency of encopresis as well as its impact on the family. From this description, the IE (who will be blind to treatment assignment) will generate a brief narrative describing the participant's encopresis. This narrative will be used by the IE to rate the overall severity on the 7-point Clinical Global Impression for Severity (CGI-S). Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) Scale is a clinician's assessment of patient's severity of illness. The score ranges from 1 = normal, not at all ill to 7 = among the most extremely ill patients</description>

    <description>Pediatric subjects with autistic spectrum disorder will begin treatment immediately. The treatment program will consist of 10 appointments of up to 4 hours each, over a 14 day period, followed by 4 weekly 1-hour follow-up visits. During each appointment, subjects will be guided to sit on the toilet. If the participant has a continent urination they will be provided with praise and remain on the toilet. If a participant has a continent bowel movement they will be provided with enthusiastic praise along with positive reinforcement and they will be allowed to leave the bathroom. A continent bowel movement will end that day's appointment. If necessary, glycerin suppositories, bisacodyl suppositories, and/or senna may be used to aid in the bowl movement.</description>

    <intervention_name>Glycerin Suppository</intervention_name>
    <description>Nursing staff will administer one glycerin suppository in the bathroom if there is no continent bowl movement in the first 30 minutes. Subjects will be taken to the bathroom 5 minutes after the suppository is administered for a 30 minute sit or until a continent void occurs. If continent bowel movements maintain on two subsequent days (after bisacodyl suppositories are discontinued) the glycerin suppository will be discontinued. At least one primary caregiver will be trained on all components of intervention still in use on the last day their child's admission. Four weekly follow-up appointments will be used to support them as they continue to implement the protocol at home, including continuing to fade out the use of medications for participants who are at least partially continent but not fully independent at the time of discharge.</description>

Glycerin Suppository: Nursing staff administered one glycerin suppository in the bathroom if there was no continent bowl movement in the first 30 minutes.
Bisacodyl suppository: If a subject did not have a bowel movement during the 30 minute sit following administration of the glycerin suppository, they were given a 1 hour break, after which a bisacodyl suppository was administered.
Senna: If no continent bowel movements occurred for two consecutive treatment days, caregivers were asked to administer senna each evening thereafter until medication tapering began.</description>

          <title>Mean Clinical Global Impression for Improvement (CGI-I) Score</title>
          <description>An independent evaluator (IE) will use the parent target problem (PTP) interview to help caregivers estimate the frequency of encopresis as well as its impact on the family. From this description, the IE (who will be blind to treatment assignment) will generate a brief narrative describing the participant's encopresis. This narrative will be used by the IE to rate the overall severity on the 7-point Clinical Global Impression for Improvement (CGI-I). Clinical Global Impression for Improvement (CGI-I) Scale is a clinician's assessment of a patient's change in condition from baseline.The score ranges from 0 = not assessed, 1 = very much improved, through 7 = very much worse.</description>
