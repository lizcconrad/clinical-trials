      1. Target disease: Patients with combined dyslipidemia accompanied by type 2 diabetes who
           has done exogenous visit or hospitalization from Jan 2010 to June 2014.

        2. Study objective:

             1. The objective of this study is to Identifying the lipid parameter variation when
                treating patients who have dyslipidemia of type 2 diabetes for 3±1 months.

             2. After treating patients who have dyslipidemia of type 2 diabetes for 3±1 months,
                identifying the reason why changing method of drug dosage and pharmacotherapy.

             3. If the drug dosage and pharmacotherapy have been changed, Identifying the lipid
                parameter variation when treating patients by altered drugs for 3±1 months,
