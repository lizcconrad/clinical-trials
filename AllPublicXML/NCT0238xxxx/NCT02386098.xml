    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the combination of BMS-955176 with
      atazanavir (ATV) [with or without ritonavir (RTV)] and dolutegravir (DTG) is efficacious,
      safe, and well-tolerated in HIV-1 infected treatment experienced adults.

    <measure>Percentage of participants with plasma human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt;40 copies per milliliter (c/mL) at Week 24-Stage 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected for quantitative analysis of plasma HIV-1 RNA. Percentage of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;40 c/mL at Week 24 was assessed using the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot algorithm which used the last on-treatment plasma HIV-1 RNA measurement, within an FDA-specified visit window (18 to 30 weeks), to determine response. Analysis was performed on the modified intent to treat (mITT) Population which comprised of all randomized participants who received atleast one dose of BMS-955176 or TDF.</description>

    <description>Blood samples were collected for quantitative analysis of plasma HIV-1 RNA. Response was assessed using the last plasma HIV-1 RNA value in the predefined visit window to classify a participant's response status. The percentage of responders with HIV-1 RNA &lt;40 c/mL at Weeks 48 and 96 using mITT Population (observed) which consisted of participants in the Treated Population excluding participants who had no HIV-1 RNA result data in the assessment visit windows due to discontinuation and who discontinued on or after the date of site notification of study termination by the sponsor (October 10, 2016) is presented. The study was terminated early during the primary end point analysis of Stage 1; hence, data was not collected for Week 96 analysis.</description>
