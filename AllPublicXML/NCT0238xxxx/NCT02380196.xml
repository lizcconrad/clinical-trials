    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether circulating tumor cells (CTCs)
      can be used as a non-invasive means of confirming pathologic diagnosis in early-stage (Stage
      I) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients scheduled to undergo surgical intervention
      will have blood samples obtained to test for CTCs. Presence of CTCs will be compared to final
      pathologic diagnosis based on surgical specimens to assess the sensitivity of using CTCs
      alone to make a definitive diagnosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical diagnosis of stage I NSCLC a. Only patients with a pathologically confirmed
             NSCLC will be retained for data analysis b. Should pathologic diagnosis reveal a more
             advanced stage, these subjects will remain in the study

          2. 18 years of age

          3. Ability to read and sign informed consent

          4. Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this
             trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior cancer diagnosis, excluding previously treated non-melanoma skin cancer

          2. Prior or ongoing treatment of the clinically diagnosed cancer
