  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electrical stimulation therapy for pain reduction was performed already 2000 years ago. In
      recent years many studies had proved the effectiveness of electrical stimulation in pain
      management, tissue healing and muscle strengthening. Today there are devices with many types
      of currents. Each current comes with different statements for its effectiveness and its
      penetration depth yet there is no consensus on the most effective current in the dimension of
      penetration depth.

      The study shall be recruited patients who underwent implantation of electrodes in the spine
      (Spinal Cord Stimulation- SCS). The electrode will serve as a voltage reader deep in the
      tissue. The voltage is generated from electrodes applied on the skin and delivers therapeutic
      currents to the patients back. The study will be tested 4 different types of currents and
      number of electrode placement.
