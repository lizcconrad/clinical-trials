  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitreoretinal surgery is associated with a considerable incidence of postoperative nausea and
      vomiting (PONV), which is reported to be as high as 60%. Reasons for this high incidence may
      be the long duration of surgery and anesthesia and the high degree of manipulation of the
      eye. Postoperative vomiting after vitrectomy is an important risk factor for the onset of
      several complications, such as suprachoroidal hemorrhage, with disastrous visual
      consequences.

      To date there is no evidence as to the possible protective effect of anti-emetic therapy with
      regard to interventions of vitrectomy performed under local anesthesia.

      In this prospective, randomized, multicenter, double blind study, we evaluated the efficacy
      of Ondansetron alone, Dexamethasone alone and in combination in controlling nausea and
      vomiting in patients undergoing vitrectomy under local anesthesia.

      Patients were randomly stratified to receive 1 of 4 prophylactic antiemetic treatments (3
      pharmaceutical treatment and 1 placebo) in a double-blind manner at the start of the surgery
      and 15 minutes before the end of surgery.

      The syringes were prepared by a third, neutral person not involved in the perioperative care
      of the patient, immediately before the start of anesthesia.

      All vitrectomy surgeries were performed, in each unit,under local anesthesia by a retrobulbar
      block.

      Each patients was observed and treated during a period of 24 hours after the surgery. For
      patients who have nausea and vomiting despite the antiemetic prophylaxis, will be given a
      rescue dose of 4 mg ondansetron IV.
