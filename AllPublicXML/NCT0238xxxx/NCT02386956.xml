  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical trial to evaluate the elongation of the hamstrings after making different
      types of stretching. One group receives a stretch of global postural reeducation (RPG),
      another group receives a mobilization of sciatic nerve, and a third group received a placebo
      treatment. The evaluation of these treatments are done previously, immediately after and 20
      min later. The test used to evaluate elongation are the Sit and Reach and active knee
      extension (AKE test).

      Randomized clinical trial to evaluate the elongation of the hamstrings after making different
      types of stretching and mobilizations used in physiotherapy. This study is realized with
      university students to be long time studying in sitting position, and each subject is
      randomly assigned to one of three different groups. One group receives 10 minutes of global
      postural reeducation stretching (RPG), another group receives 10 minutes of bilateral
      mobilization of sciatic nerve, and a third group received a placebo treatment. The evaluation
      of these treatments are done previously, immediately after and 20 min later. The test used to
      evaluate elongation are the Sit and Reach and active knee extension (AKE test). The order of
      measurement of each test is also randomized in each subject. The intervention is always
      applied to the same physical therapist, and measurements were always performed by another
      physiotherapist blinded.

    <description>This test involves sitting on the floor with legs out straight ahead. Feet (shoes off) are placed with the soles flat against the box, shoulder-width apart. Both knees are held flat against the floor by the tester, if required. With hands on top of each other and palms facing down, the subject reaches forward along the measuring line as far as possible. After three practice reaches, the fourth reach is held for at least two seconds while the distance is recorded. Make sure there are no jerky movements, and that the fingertips remain level and the legs flat. he score is recorded to the nearest centimeter or half inch as the distance reached by the tip of the fingers.</description>

    <description>Participants were assessed on a plinth in the supine position with both lower extremities extended. Both anterior superior iliac spines were positioned by aligning them with the vertical bars of the apparatus. The lower extremity not being measured was secured to the plinth using a strap across the lower third of the thigh. Each assessor marked the lateral knee joint line with washable ink. The participants were told to flex the hip until the thigh touched the horizontal metalic bar. While maintaining the contact between the thigh and horizontal bar, the participants were asked to extend the leg as much as possible while keeping their foot relaxed and to hold the position for about 5 seconds. A standard universal goniometer was placed over the previously marked joint axis, and the inclinometer arms were aligned along the femur and fibula.</description>
