      sjogren syndrome is an autoimmune disease that mainly affects the Salivary glands and
      Lacrimal gland In addition to the effects of this disease is characterized by overall
      systemic Muskals injury, pulmonary disease, peripheral neuropathy and vasculitis. In addition
      recent studies have shown that patients are at increased risk of the disease up to 2 cardiac
      events and stroke events Hydroxychloroquine is an RHEUMATIC DISEASE PROCESS
      SUPPRESSANTS-ANTIMALARIALS used to treat anti-inflammatory rheumatic diseases in many
      first-line treatment is sjogren syndrome.

      A recent study of the treatment in Hydroxychloroquine effect on lipid profile sjogren
      syndrome patients showed a reduction in total cholesterol levels and increase in HDL. Further
      studies of the impact made Hydroxychloroquine systemic lupus patients erythematosus (SLE)
      showed in Atherosclerosis and morbidity and mortality reduction in cardiovascular. Studies of
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) demonstrated reduced risk of developing diabetes and
      improved lipid profile Research Goals valuate The effect of HCQ treatment in cardiovascular
      patients with primary sjogren syndrome

      Research Goals Valuate The effect of HCQ treatment in cardiovascular patients with primary
      sjogren syndrome Research Methods The study will included patients that diagnosed with
      sjogren syndrome and was treated in Meir Medical center during the years 2003-2014 During the
      study will collect information on confounding factors , Risk factors include cardiovascular
      acceptable such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, high blood pressure and the like, central nervous
      system involvement and steroid use

      Study outcome will be one of the follow:

        1. Thrombosis of peripheral veins

        2. Arterial cardiovascular events

        3. Cardiac events (myocardial infarction

        4. Stroke (stroke and TIA)

      4. Venous thrombosis events 5. Pulmonary embolism In the study will be 500 patients

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. 18 years old

        2. Both sexes

        3. Patients that diagnosis in sjogren in treated in Meir Medical center in the years
           2003-2014 And treated in Hydroxychloroquine at least a month.

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. Minors and special populations

        2. Patients that treated in Hydroxychloroquine at less than a month.

        3. Patient that participate in clinical trial and treat with investigational product
