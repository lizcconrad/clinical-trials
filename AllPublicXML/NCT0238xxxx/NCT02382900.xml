  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the genital tract human papilloma virus (HPV), especially types 6 and 11 cause genital
      warts, the commonest viral sexually transmitted disease. The HPV 16 and 18 are the most
      common oncogenic &quot;high-risk&quot; genotypes and cause approximately 70% of all cervical cancers
      despite the fact that are associated with other anogenital cancers, anus, vagina, vulva and
      penis, and cancers of the head and neck. Current estimates are that 5.2% of all cancers are
      HPV associated. A large number of studies, including both adult and young females, have
      demonstrated that HPV vaccines are highly immunogenic and induce a long lasting protection
      against infection. Immunogenic vaccination results in young men and boys are equally
      satisfactory with the quadrivalent HPV (types 6, 11, 16, 18) vaccine recommended for men. The
      recommended vaccination scheme includes three shots giving the second at two months and the
      third at six months after the initial shot. Recently, it has been shown that the use of a two
      shot scheme (0 and 6 months) is equally effective among girls. The purpose of this study is
      to determine that the immunogenicity is non-inferior in boys using a two shot scheme compared
      with young women and girls.
