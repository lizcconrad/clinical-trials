  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is the most frequent cause of suffering and disability in society. Despite considerable
      involvement of genetic factors in pain sensation and sensitivity, the individual genes
      involved remain largely unidentified.

      Knowledge of genetic factors,their phenotypic expression in pain processing, and their link
      to neuronal correlates can improve our understanding of pain aetiology and the processes
      involved in pain perception and chronification. In addition, they can serve as biomarkers to
      predict chronic pain development and progression in individual patients and help early
      individual treatment adaptation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain is the most frequent cause of suffering and disability in society. Chronic pain
      seriously impairs quality of life of millions of people worldwide. 10-50% of surgical
      patients report chronic pain after surgery; up to 10% report severe pain. Thus, chronic pain
      is a significant medical and financial burden to society.

      Despite considerable involvement of genetic factors in pain sensation and sensitivity,
      individual genes involved remain largely unidentified. Knowledge of genetic factors, their
      phenotypic expression in pain processing, and their link to neuronal correlates can improve
      understanding of pain aetiology and processes involved in pain perception and chronification.
      Also, they can serve as biomarkers to predict chronic pain development and progression in
      patients and help early individual treatment adaptation.

      In this study we will establish a prospective database and biobank of patients undergoing
      elective major surgery. Using data from the database and biobank, we will identify genetic
      factors contributing to development of chronic pain after surgery. In addition, markers of
      pain modulation and chronification at gene expression and protein levels, and phenotypic
      measures of pain processing including neuroimaging features will be studied.

      Over a period of 10 years we will prospectively include up to 10,000 patients visiting the
      hospital for elective major surgery. Data defining participants demographics, medical history
      and questionnaire data will be collected and stored in dedicated databases. Additional
      details (surgery and perioperative management, pain processing phenotypes and surgical and
      pain outcomes) will be stored. Besides Electroencephalography and/or magnetoencephalography,
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging will be performed on a subgroup (n=70).
