  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around 20% of women who receive breast radiotherapy (RT) experience moderate to severe breast
      hardening and shrinkage. These side-effects have been shown to be important factors
      influencing quality of life after breast radiotherapy. It is thought that the likelihood of
      developing these side-effects is related to the presence of underlying genetic differences in
      patients. In order to identify these genetic differences, the severity of side-effects needs
      to be accurately measured. Currently, clinical assessments are conducted by a clinician but
      this is not specific enough to be able to relate development of breast shrinkage and
      hardening to genetic differences. For example, clinical assessment often fails to distinguish
      between hardness due to swelling (known as oedema) and hardness due to generalised
      radiation-induced scarring (known as fibrosis). Ultrasound techniques, however, may be able
      to help quantify and characterise radiotherapy-associated changes in breast tissue allowing
      for better correlation with genetic abnormalities. Once genetic changes can be identified,
      adjustment of breast RT treatments (or add drugs) to help reduce side-effects in women at
      higher genetic risk of side-effects may be possible.

      This study tests the ability of two forms of ultrasound, shear-wave elastography (USE) and
      ultrasound backscatter spectroscopy (UBS), to quantify and characterise breast shrinkage and
      firmness with a view to using these techniques to measure the late side-effects of breast RT
      to study the underlying causes of radiotherapy toxicity.

      Principle research question: Can a new ultrasound technique (shear wave elastography) measure
      radiation-induced side-effects in women who have received breast radiotherapy?
