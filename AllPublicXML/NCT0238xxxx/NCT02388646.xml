  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to explore the effectiveness of a commercially available,
      over-the-counter knee brace in the conservative treatment of knee osteoarthritis.
      Participants will either be fitted with a brace and told to wear it every day during normal
      activities, fitted with the brace and given instructions on a set of quadriceps strengthening
      exercises to complete twice daily, every day, or be given the exercise instructions, but not
      fitted with a brace. Functional and subjective outcomes will be collected preoperatively and
      at 6 and 12 weeks from baseline, with the goal of informing the effectiveness of bracing
      alone versus a home exercise program, and whether the combination of those provides the most
      therapeutic benefit to participants.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale consists of a 100mm horizontal line with the words &quot;No Pain&quot; and &quot;Pain as bad as it could possibly be&quot; written on opposite ends. Participants will be asked to mark on the line where their pain is in relation to the two extremes. Measurement is taken from the left-hand side of the line to the mark and reported as a score out of 100.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
