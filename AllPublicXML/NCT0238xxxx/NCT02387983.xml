      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of oral posaconazole
      tablets in Chinese participants at high risk for invasive fungal infections. Neutropenic
      participants undergoing chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic
      syndromes will be enrolled in the study.

Results data are presented as the arithmetic mean (% arithmetic coefficient of variation [CV]), where CV is calculated as (100 x standard deviation/arithmetic mean).</description>
          <population>The PK analysis set included all randomized and treated participants in the Intensive and Sparse PK subgroup who complied with the protocol and have documented adherence to daily dosing and PK regimens through the Day 8 steady-state evaluation with available data.</population>
