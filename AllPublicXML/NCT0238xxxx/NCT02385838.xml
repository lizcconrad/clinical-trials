  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this interventional study is to compare the impact of four different
      Front-Of-Pack (FOP) nutrition labels on purchasing intentions. This study is nested in the
      ongoing web-based prospective observational NutriNet-Santé cohort study, including on
      December 2014 around 150,000 participants. The investigators will perform a five-arm
      randomized trial where participants will be subjected to different FOP nutrition label
      formats: Guidelines Daily Amount (GDA), Multiple Traffic Lights (MTL), 5-Color Nutrition
      Label (5-CNL), Green Tick (Tick) and a 'no label' condition. The impact of front-of-pack
      nutrition labels on the nutritional quality of the shopping cart will be assessed.
      Participants from the NutriNet-Santé cohort study will be randomly assigned to one of these
      five experimental conditions according to their sociodemographic characteristics.

      Purchasing intentions will be assessed using an experimental web-based supermarket designed
      to look like a regular online grocery store. The supermarket includes 269 unique products
      divided into 4 categories: dairy products, processed meat/delicatessen, savory and
      breakfast/sugary products. Each category is then separated into specific products families
      like yogurt, milk, cheese, etc. for the dairy products category. Inside a food family, the
      selection of foodstuffs will be made to obtain a representative sample of the products
      commonly sold in French supermarket. For each type of products, at least two variants are
      proposed. Products are retailers or manufacturers branded. Categories of products that are
      not usually bought each week, or which are likely to be bought from different sources are not
      included on the web-based supermarket.

      Participants are asked to simulate a shopping situation: they have to select a week worth of
      food for their family among proposed products. If the user is not able to find a product
      he/she usually buy, the instruction is to select similar product among proposed ones.

      Information provided for each product is: name, price and the picture with the FOP label/or
      not according to the experimental condition to which the participant is allocated. A brief
      explanation of the FOP label used is also given.
