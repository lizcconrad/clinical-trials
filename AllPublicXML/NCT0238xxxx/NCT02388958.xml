  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with short-term and long-term complications
      for infants and mothers. The management of GDM during pregnancy focuses on reducing risks to
      the infant associated with hyperglycemia. The postpartum management of GDM focuses on
      reducing maternal risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM). A diagnosis of GDM identifies up
      to 31% of parous women who will eventually develop T2DM and approximately 50% of women
      diagnosed with GDM will develop T2DM in the first 5 years postpartum. The perceived risk of
      developing short-term and/or long-term complications of GDM may influence women's likelihood
      of engaging in diet modification, the mainstay of treatment of GDM, both during and after
      pregnancy. If sustained after delivery, diet modifications introduced as treatment for GDM
      could affect maternal weight changes during and after pregnancy, which could in turn affect
      T2DM risk. It is unknown if and how women with GDM differ in their perceived risk of
      developing T2DM, dietary choices, or weight gain (and retention) during versus after
      pregnancy. Therefore, the project proposed in this application seeks to (1) characterize the
      perceived risk of developing T2DM among women with GDM during and after pregnancy, (2)
      characterize dietary choices of women with GDM during and after pregnancy, and (3)
      characterize weight changes of women with GDM during and after pregnancy as compared to women
      without GDM.

        All women receiving prenatal care at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who do not
        already carry a diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes are screened for GDM between weeks
        24-28 of pregnancy with a non-fasting 50-gram glucose tolerance test (GTT). Blood glucose
        values greater than or equal to 140 on this screening test are considered positive. Women
        with a positive screening test undergo a diagnostic fasting 100-gram 3-hour GTT. GDM is
        diagnosed if a woman has 2 or more abnormal values on the 3-hour GTT (abnormal values are
        fasting blood glucose greater than or equal to 95, 1-hour blood glucose greater than or
        equal to 180, 2-hour blood glucose greater than or equal to 155 and/or 3-hour blood glucose
        greater than or equal to 140). By reviewing the electronic medical record of women with
        singleton pregnancies undergoing GTT on a weekly basis, we will identify women with and
        without GDM.
