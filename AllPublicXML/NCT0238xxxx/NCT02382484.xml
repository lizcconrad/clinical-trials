  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether the A-V sequential pacing strategy shown to
      effectively reduce blood pressure in a dog model of hypertension also reduces blood pressure
      acutely in patients with hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg) despite
      medical treatments.

    <description>The study was a single arm, unblinded, treatment only study. Each patient served as his or her own control.
Treatment delivered by a dual chamber pacing system (BackBeat Medical) which was able to generate stimulating patterns with characteristics that are different than the common pacemaker.
The study was limited to hypertensive patients who were also already scheduled to undergo an invasive electrophysiology procedure.</description>

    <description>For each patient, one pacing electrode was placed in the right atrium and the second electrode was placed in the right ventricle. With a dual chamber pacing system (BackBeat Medical) it was possible to pace the heart with a wide variety of pacing settings.</description>
