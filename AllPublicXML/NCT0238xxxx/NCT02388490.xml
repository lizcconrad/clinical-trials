      This is an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center, phase II trial of brentuximab vedotin to
      evaluate ORR primarily in patients with EBV- and CD30-positive lymphomas. The ORR will be
      evaluated based on the revised Cheson's criteria or modified SWAT criteria in case of
      cutaneous EBV- and CD30-positive lymphomas.

    <description>Brentuximab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of the anti-CD30 chimeric immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody cAC10 and the potent antimicrotubule drug monomethyl auristatin E connected by a protease-cleavable linker. cAC10 binds to the CD30 antigen, which has a very low expression on normal cells but is found on some tumor cells.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with relapsed or refractory EBV- and CD30-positive lymphomas

          2. Age ≥ 18 years

          3. ECOG performance status 0-2

          4. At least one measurable lesion based on revised Cheson's or modified SWAT criteria

          5. Provision archival tumor tissues (4 μm thickness x 5 unstained slides) and blood
             samples

          6. Voluntary written informed consent must be given before performance of any
             study-related procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that
             consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future
             medical care.

          7. Female patient is either post-menopausal for at least 1 year before the screening
             visit or surgically sterile or if of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2
             effective methods of contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the
             informed consent through 6 months after the last dose of study drug, or agrees to
             completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.

          8. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized, (i.e., status post vasectomy) agree to
             practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study period and through 6
             months after the last dose of study drug, or agrees to completely abstain from
             heterosexual intercourse.

          9. Adequate hematologic function: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500/µL, platelet
             count ≥ 75,000/µL, and hemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dL unless there is known hematologic tumor
             marrow involvement (ANC ≥ 1,000/µL and platelet count ≥ 50,000/µL if there is known
             bone marrow involvement)

         10. Adequate liver function: total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x the upper limit of the normal (ULN)
             unless the elevation is known to be due to Gilbert syndrome and ALT or AST &lt; 3 x ULN
             (AST and AST &lt; 5 x ULN if their elevation can be reasonably ascribed to the presence
             of hematologic tumor in liver)

         11. Adequate renal function: serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL and/or creatinine clearance or
             calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/minute.

          6. Known history of myocardial infarction within 1 year, NYHA class III/IV heart failure,
             or uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions including cardiac arrhythmias, congestive
             heart failure (CHF), angina, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or
             active conduction system abnormalities. Recent evidence (within 6 months before first
             dose of study drug) of a left-ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50%.

          7. Any active systemic viral, bacterial, or fungal infection within 2 weeks prior to
             first study drug dose

          8. Any prior chemotherapy and/or other investigational agents within at least 5
             half-lives of last dose

          9. Prior stem cell transplantation within 100 days or radioimmunotherapy within 8 weeks

         10. Prior exposure to CD30-targeted agents

         11. Known hypersensitivity to recombinant proteins, murine proteins, or to any excipient
             contained in the drug formulation of brentuximab vedotin

         12. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive

         13. Known hepatitis B surface antigen-positive, or known or suspected active hepatitis C
             infection

         14. Another malignancy within 3 years before the first dose or previously diagnosed with
             another malignancy and have evidence of residual disease. Patients with nonmelanoma
