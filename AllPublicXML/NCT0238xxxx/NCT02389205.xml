    <textblock>
      Background Hemophilia is a sex-linked genetic disorders. When the joint or the muscles is
      bleeding, it may cause haemarthrosis, synovium, cartilage tissue thickening, joint activity
      (Range of Motion) decreasing and other musculoskeletal and related disorder. Patients will
      produce pain in the action, compensatory action occurs, thus causing recurrent of bleeding,
      and joint damage. There is high rate of ankle joint bleeding in hemophilia. The ankle
      articular joint disease will affect lower limbs activities, and the functional activities
      will impaired.

      Review studies, in addition to physical therapy, Kinesio taping is a common intervention to
      improve other subjects' static balance, proprioception, functional ankle stability, correct
      poor posture.

      The main intervention of this study is physical therapy and Kinesio taping, expect to improve
      the stability and muscular strength of lower extremities, and balance, correcting gait and
      lower extremity functional activities of subjects with hemophilia.

      Methods:

      This study is a randomized controlled trial, the subjects were randomly divided into two
      groups, the control group received physical therapy once a week for a period of three months;
      experimental group received the same physical therapy in addition to treatment, but each will
      be accepted Kinesio taping. Experiments group carried out before and after the relevant
      tests, including: muscle strength, balance, lower extremity functional activities. The
      participants will be followed for the duration of physical therapy , an expected average of 3
      months.

    <description>kinesio group, The kinesio TapingÂ® Method is a definitive rehabilitative taping technique that is designed to facilitate the body's natural healing process while providing support and stability to muscles and joints without restricting the body's range of motion as well as providing extended soft tissue manipulation to prolong the benefits of manual therapy administered within the clinical setting.
The effect of intervention may affected by the varying durations and frequencies of exercise, different state of arthropathy and joint range of motion limitations of ankle , etc.</description>
