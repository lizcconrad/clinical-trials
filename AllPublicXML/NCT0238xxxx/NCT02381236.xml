    <textblock>
      A single-arm, open-label Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the effect of G-202 on the
      perfusion and volume of the prostate using non-invasive multiparametric prostate magnetic
      resonance imaging (mpMRI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than one-third of patients with localized high-risk prostate cancer who undergo radical
      prostatectomy eventually relapse with distant disease and some data suggest that neoadjuvant
      treatment in this patient population may be helpful. This study is based on prodrug tumor
      targeting, in which an inactive form of a toxic agent is administered systemically and gets
      activated in specific locations in the body, resulting in higher concentrations of the
      cytotoxic form at the tumor location. G-202 is a prodrug that is activated in prostate cancer
      tissue and in the blood vessels of tumors, but not normal tissue; once activated, G-202 leads
      to disruption of intracellular calcium levels and subsequent induction of apoptosis. Thus,
      G-202 is expected to bring about cell death in prostate cancer cells and to destroy the blood
      supply of prostate tumors. G-202 has led to disease stabilization in some patients, but the
      drug has not been evaluated in the neoadjuvant setting. This single-arm, open-label Phase II
      clinical trial will evaluate the safety and activity of G-202 in patients with localized
      high-risk prostate cancer prior to radical prostatectomy. Through its effects on the
      neovasculature of tumors, G-202 is anticipated to disrupt the blood supply of the prostate
      tumor, resulting in decreased perfusion and subsequent tumor volume. The primary endpoint of
      this study is evaluation of G-202 on the perfusion and volume of the prostate using
      non-invasive multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).
