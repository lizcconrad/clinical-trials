    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes of (i) surgical treatment with posterior
      dynamic stabilization and (ii) surgical treatment with internal fixation and fusion in
      patients with multilevel lumbar degenerative disk disease.

      Study aims are:

        1. To evaluate superiority of Surgical treatment with posterior dynamic stabilization
           compared to Surgical treatment with internal fixation and fusion in lumbar range of
           motion;

        2. To compare Surgical treatment with posterior dynamic stabilization compared to Surgical
           treatment with internal fixation and fusion in functional outcomes as measured by change
           in Oswestry Disability Index;

        3. To compare radiological, clinical, patient-reported and, safety outcomes between the two
           surgical approaches.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent

          2. Age between 30 and 75 years inclusive

          3. Radiographic evidence of multi-level lumbar disc degeneration disease

          4. Scheduled for 2- or 3-level lumbar discectomy at levels from L1 to S1 with or without
             dynamic stabilization or fusion

          5. Preoperative ODI ≥ 30%

          6. Clinical symptoms consistent with diagnosis of lumbar DDD:

               -  Radicular back or lower extremity pain and/or

               -  Decreased muscular strength and/or

               -  Abnormal sensation

          7. Failed to gain adequate symptom relief from at least one month of adequate
             non-operative treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Cauda equina syndrome

          2. Patients with other lumbar conditions that will, in the opinion of the investigator,
             interfere with clinical outcomes (e.g. spinal structural deformities, spinal
             fractures, ankylosing spondylitis, spinal tuberculosis, spinal infection, spinal
             tumors, symptomatic cervical spinal disease)

          3. Osteoporosis defined as T-score ≤ -3.5. BMD will be measured by DEXA performed on
             lumbar spine

          4. Systemic infection such as AIDS and active hepatitis

          5. Recent history (less than 3 years) of chemical substance dependency or significant
             psychosocial disturbance, which may impact the outcome or study participation

          6. Participation in a clinical trial of investigational drug or device within the past 30
             days
