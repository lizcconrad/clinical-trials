  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      low GI and low GL diet have more beneficial effect for diabetic nephropath patients compared
      with conventional diet.

      low GL may have more favorable effect than low GI diet.

      According to body weight status of participants, the investigators considered a slight
      calorie restriction ranged from 200 to 300 Kcal/d. Planed meals and exchange list prescribed
      for all volunteers. Dietary records forms were given to all subjects and they were educated
      how to record their dietary intakes. The investigators asked subjects not to change their
      physical activity level during the study and monitored them for their physical activity level
      by 3 days physical activity records monthly.

    <description>All diets were designed with similar macronutrients content (30% fat, 0.8 g/kg/d protein and remained calorie requirement by carbohydrate). Additionally, we controlled phosphorus, sodium and potassium content of diets for three intervention groups. All dietary menus had less than 1500 mg phosphor and less than 2400 mg sodium and 2000 mg potassium.</description>
