      This phase II trial studies how well regorafenib and gemcitabine hydrochloride work as
      second-line therapy (treatment given when initial treatment doesn't work) in treating
      patients with pancreatic cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Regorafenib may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Giving regorafenib together with gemcitabine hydrochloride may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy (progression-free survival) of regorafenib and gemcitabine
      (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in previously treated patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of regorafenib in combination with gemcitabine. II. To assess
      response rate (RR). III. To assess overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive regorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.
