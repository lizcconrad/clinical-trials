      The NeuroBlate® System (NBS), is a minimally invasive robotic laser thermotherapy tool. It
      employs a pulsed surgical laser to deliver targeted energy to abnormal brain tissue caused by
      tumors and lesions. Since receiving FDA clearance in April 2013, the NBS has been used in
      nearly 300 procedures conducted at approximately 20 leading institutions across the United
      States. This post-market, multi-center retrospective study is designed to collect long-term
      follow-up data on patients who were treated previously with NBS.
