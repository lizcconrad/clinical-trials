  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of
      mebendazole plus quinfamide for the treatment of intestinal helminthiasis and amoebiasis in
      Mexican population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither investigator nor participant knows which treatment the
      participant receives), placebo-controlled (placebo is an inactive substance that is compared
      with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial), randomized
      (study medication assigned to participants by chance), prospective (study following patients
      forward in time) study. The total study duration for each participant will be approximately
      48 days. The study will consist of 3 parts: Screening Phase (5 days) and double-blind
      treatment Phase (from Day 1 to 21, consists of Phase-1 and Phase-2) and follow-up Phase (from
      Day 21 to 43). Participants will receive mebendazole (600 milligram [mg]) and quinfamide (200
      mg) tablets orally once starting on Day 1 and mebendazole 600 mg and quinfamide (200 mg) or
      placebo tablets orally once starting on Day 21. Efficacy will be primarily evaluated by
      percentage of participants with eradication of helminthic and/or protozoa. Participants'
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Improved Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of improved quality of life will be carried by the questionnaires, the results will be evaluated according to the symptomatic satisfaction scales, scale ranges from Excellent to Terrible (Excellent = very satisfied, Good= satisfied, Poor= more or less satisfied, Bad= unsatisfied and Terrible= very unsatisfied), which should show that there was an improvement in the sensation of wellbeing of the participant compared with the symptoms provoked by the presence of the intestinal parasitosis.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
