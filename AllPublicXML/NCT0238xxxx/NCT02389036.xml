  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction- Hospital acquired infections (HAI) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality
      and increase health care costs. Critically ill patients are particularly susceptible to these
      infections and have an even higher mortality. One intervention that has gained much interest
      in the medical literature for reducing infection rates and deaths from HAIs is selective
      decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD). SDD involves the application of antibiotic
      paste to the mouth, throat, stomach and a short course of intravenous antibiotics. The
      evidence supporting the use of SDD for saving lives and preventing infections is actually
      quite strong. However, health care professionals in many parts of the world have refrained
      from using SDD due to fears of the effects of overuse of antibiotics on the frequency of
      infections with resistant bacteria such as multi-resistant Gram negative organisms, MRSA and
      Clostridium difficile.

      SuDDICU-ANZ is a cross-over, cluster randomised trial comparing the effect of using selective
      decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) plus standard care, to standard care alone on
      hospital mortality in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit
      (ICU).

      Secondary outcomes include an ecological assessment and a long-term health economic analysis.

  <detailed_description>

      Design- A bi-national, multicentre, crossover, cluster randomised controlled trial (x-cRCT)
      of eligible patients in participating ICUs using two 12-month interventional trial periods
      separated by a 3-month inter-period gap.

      An observational ecological assessment will be conducted in all eligible patients during the
      two 12-month intervention periods and in all patients admitted to participating ICUs during
      the first week of each month over three 3-month surveillance periods before, during the
      inter-period gap and after the second 12-month interventional period.

      Participants- General ICUs that admit mechanically ventilated patients will be randomised in
      the first 12-month period to either implement the SDD protocol in addition to standard care
      or to continue standard care without SDD, and then to cross over to the other arm during the
      second 12-month period.

      Eligible patients are defined as:

        1. All patients who are mechanically ventilated via an endotracheal tube on admission to
           the ICU and who are predicted to remain ventilated beyond the end of the calendar day
           after the day of ICU admission, or

        2. All patients who become mechanically ventilated via an endotracheal tube during their
           ICU stay and who are predicted to remain ventilated beyond the end of the calendar day
           after the day they are first ventilated, or

        3. All patients who not already recruited but are receiving mechanical ventilation via an
           endotracheal tube and are expected to receive ongoing ventilation for a further 48-hours
           or more despite an earlier prediction that ventilation would be discontinued earlier.

      Intervention- In the SDD arm, all eligible patients will receive:

        1. A six-hourly topical application of 0.5g paste containing colistin 2%, tobramycin 2% and
           nystatin 2%, to the buccal mucosa and oropharynx

        2. A six-hourly administration of 10 mL of a suspension containing 100 mg colistin, 80 mg
           tobramycin and 2 x 106 IU nystatin, to the gastrointestinal tract via a
           gastric/post-pyloric tube

        3. A four-day course of an intravenous (IV) antibiotic. Patients not already receiving a
           therapeutic antibiotic will be prescribed cefotaxime 1g six-hourly or ceftriaxone 1g
           daily, with dose adjusted as appropriate for organ dysfunction. Ciprofloxacin (400mg
           12-hourly) may be used as an alternative if there is a contraindication to
           cephalosporins, such as allergy. Patients already receiving an alternative IV antibiotic
           as clinically indicated will not receive an additional IV antibiotic, but will continue
           the prescribed antibiotic for the usual duration of therapy.

      Statistical considerations and sample size- SuDDICU-ANZ will recruit 8,000 patients from
      25-30 ICUs and will be able to detect a 3.6-3.7% absolute reduction in hospital mortality
      from a baseline mortality of 29%, using 80% power, Î± &lt;0.05.

    <description>Standard care- In Australia and New Zealand there are no national guidelines so local policy is determined by each ICU. We are recommending (but not mandating) that control and SDD group management be in line with these national guidelines. We will recommend control and SDD group management is in line with current national standards of practice that may or may not include a VAP bundle. We will monitor record data regarding the nature and delivery of the control and SDD group co-interventions.</description>
