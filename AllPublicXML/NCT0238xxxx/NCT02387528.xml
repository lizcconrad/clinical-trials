      High demands put on workers nowadays have contributed for an increase on the vulnerability
      and the stress levels, with severe consequences for the health (Sandim, 2008). One of the
      main health conditions today is the Burnout Syndrome - or professional exhaustion (Salanova
      and Llorens, 2008), with harmful consequences for individuals and organizations. The level of
      dedication to the tasks in which the frustrations are faced more strongly can determine what
      type of burnout would be developed ( &quot;frenetic&quot;, &quot;under-challenged&quot; or &quot;worn-out&quot;), affecting
      the health condition. In late 1970s, mindfulness began to be studied as a behavioral
      intervention in mental health. Current evidence suggests that the state / mental trait
      mindfulness is positively associated with a variety of mental health indicators. The
      potential applicability of mindfulness in health services is great. Besides the effects for
      patients, health professionals also can have benefits. The consensus is that a greater number
      of mental health interventions need to be evaluated and implemented and it is possible that
      mindfulness can fit this need as a new technology in health care. There is a gap in the
      literature on the relationship of different clinical types of burnout and its association
      with different psychological constructs related to health, particularly in relation to the
      mental state of mindfulness and, in particular , addressing health professionals. Better
      understand this association will enable the improvement of existing and development of new
      interventions, geared to the specific needs of the population of health professionals,
      especially for professionals of Primary Health Care (PHC) , the object of this study. Thus,
      the general objective of this study is to assess the effect of a mindfulness-based
      intervention for primary health care professionals in the city of Porto Alegre, evaluating
      the behavior of a questionnaire for clinical subtypes of burnout (BCSQ -36), other variables
      of psychological well -being, depression and anxiety symptons, activity and sleep patterns,
      measuring before and after the intervention, from a randomized controlled trial.

      HYPOTHESIS A mindfulness-based intervention in professionals in primary health care is
      associated with decreased levels of burnout, and increased levels of psychological
      well-being.

      OBJECTIVES Check the effect of a mindfulness-based intervention for primary health care
      professionals in Porto Alegre-RS, evaluating the behavior of a questionnaire for clinical
      subtypes of burnout (BCSQ-36) and other variables of psychological well-being, depression and
      anxiety symptons, activity and sleep patterns, from a randomized controlled study and also
      check the convergence between clinical types of burnout that constitute BCSQ-36 in relation
      to other measures of psychological well-being (mindfulness, resilience, acceptance,
      affection, self-esteem, commitment and compassion).

      DELINEAMENT: Randomized clinical trial. Outcome: Modification of clinical subtypes of burnout
      (BCSQ-36) and other variables of psychological well-being, depression and anxiety symptons,
      activity and sleep patterns, after training in mindfulness meditation in comparing to prior
      levels.

      Factor: Training in mindfulness meditation. Sampling: The sample will be composed of health
      professionals working in primary care, which will be recruited voluntarily with the various
      family health strategies (FHS) and basic health units (BHU) in the city of Porto Alegre - RS.

      The number of participants needed for the study has adequate power, was defined from the
      literature review. Thus, 60 participants will be recruited and randomized into two groups:
      control group (CG) + Intervention Group (IG). Each of the groups will be composed by two or
      three subgroups, in order to form suitable and manageable size groups for the intervention.
      Thus, interventions for each group will start as soon as subgroups of approximately 15
      participants are formed in each.

      Procedures: The complete experimental protocol will last approximately 8 months. Initially, a
      contact was made with the management of primary health care system with the aim to present
      the methodology and the research objectives, having then the accent to proceed.

      Professionals will be invited to the research project through an introductory lecture that
      lasts an hour. In the lecture the components of evidence based Mindfulness interventions will
      be included, followed by the presentation of research. Interested volunteers will be
      instructed about the purposes and procedures of the research, as well as on the existence of
      two groups, one that receive the Mindfulness intervention immediately, and other that will
      remain on the waiting list, with the possibility of receiving Mindfulness training after the
      end of the study. After clarification, those who agree to participate in the research will
      sign the Consent Form (CF). After signing the consent form, volunteers will be evaluated by a
      clinical interview, to verify eligibility according to inclusion and exclusion criteria
      described above. Eligible to participate in the study will receive, in the same clinical
      evaluation , the first battery of questionnaires, consisting in the application of SRQ - 20
      and SRQ-A . Participants who have the SRQ - 20 ≥ 7 or SRQ - A ≥ 1 will be interviewed using
      the SCID DSM-IV, which is a structured diagnostic psychiatric interview. The 24-hour urine
      collect for measurement of sulphatoxymelatonin, and use of actigraph (which will record the
      sleep/wake cycle, as well as the incidence of light) will also occur at this time.

      After the first evaluation, the volunteers will be randomized for the two groups. The groups
      will be equated with control of age and gender. As soon as they form subgroups of
      approximately 15 volunteers the interventions will begin. Recruitment and screening of
      participants will continuate and the new groups will begin as new subgroups of approximately
      15 participants are formed. The protocol of Mindfulness will be offered to the control group
      after the end of the study.

      The post-participation evaluations will occur for both groups immediately after the eight
      weeks interventions. It will be similar to the pre-participation evaluation, except for
      sociodemographic questionnaire.

      At the end of the study a qualitative evaluation with some participants in the intervention
      group will be held, as described above.

      Intervention Protocol: Mindfulness Protocol (intervention group). An intervention program
      integrating elements of Mindfulness Breathworks Institute Mindfulness based approaches for
      Pain and ilness (MBPI), (Burch , 2009) and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), (Kabat
      Zinn, 2003), and Mindfulness based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) shall be used. All programs are
      highly structured, lasting eight weeks, with a weekly meeting about two hours , and working
      with four main techniques during these meetings : mindfulness in breathing, body scan,
      walking meditation and mindfulness yoga. In order to facilitate the home practice of
      meditation by participants during and after the intervention protocol, all will receive a CD
      containing guided meditation sessions, covering the above techniques. One of the researchers
      will be the instructor as she has completed the Teacher Training Program. The sessions
      duration was shortened to better fit the functioning and infrastructure services, comprising
      eight weekly sessions of an hour and a half each.

      All data collected in this study will be organized in the database in computational SPSS.

      Analysis of these data will be descriptive (absolute and relative frequencies, and total mean
      scores for each instrument and their measures of central tendency and dispersion for each
      evaluation point) and analytical, comparing the two groups in various stages of evaluation.
      The internal consistency of the instruments will be assessed by the coefficient of
      reliability or Alpha (α) Cronbach.
