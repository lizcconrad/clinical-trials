  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe hypercholesterolemia produced by conditions such as heterozygous familial
      hypercholesterolemia is associated with multiple complications including premature
      atherosclerotic disease. There is evidence that microvascular perfusion, particularly flow
      reserve, in critical organs is limited due to abnormalities in plasma viscosity, abnormal RBC
      deformability, and an imbalance between vasodilators and vasoconstrictors. There is little is
      currently known about acute changes in microvascular blood flow and microvascular rheology
      that occur in response to plasmapharesis which is used in some patients to lower critically
      elevated cholesterol levels. Our research group has pioneered CEU methods for assessing
      myocardial and skeletal muscle perfusion, and has previously demonstrated in pre-clinical
      models that acute hyperlipidemia produces a reduction in microvascular RBC transit rate. In
      this study, the investigators will assess acute changes in microvascular perfusion in
      patients undergoing clinically-indicated plasmapharesis.

      Subjects who are scheduled to have planned apheresis treatment for severe
      hypercholesterolemia will be recruited into the study. They will undergo a screening
      evaluation, including a medical history, physical examination, ECG, and limited
      echocardiogram to evaluate for exclusion criteria. Before the apheresis procedure, blood
      samples will be obtained for plasma markers of inflammation, erythrocyte deformability, and
      plasma viscosity. Contrast enhanced ultrasound perfusion imaging will be performed to
      evaluate blood flow in the myocardium at rest, as well as in the forearm skeletal muscle
      before and after mild isometric exercise (50% maximal grip, 0.2 Hz). Flow mediated
      vasodilation will be performed. The subjects will then undergo their planned apheresis
      procedure. Within 2 hours of completion of apheresis, blood collection and CEU will be
      repeated. Plasma lipids will be available as part of the standard apharesis protocol.
