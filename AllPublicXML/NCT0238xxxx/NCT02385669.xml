  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether it is safe to administer a peptide vaccine with ipilimumab. This
      study will also evaluate the effects of the combination of the peptide vaccine and ipilimumab
      on the immune system. The investigators will monitor these effects by performing tests in the
      laboratory on participants' blood, a lymph node, and tumor samples.

    <description>The vaccine drug product, 6MHP, consists of 6 class II MHC-restricted peptides derived from melanoma proteins. Each vaccine consists of 200 mcg of each of the six peptides. An aqueous solution of vaccine is mixed 1/1 with Montanide ISA-51 to form water-in-oil emulsions. Vaccines are administered days 1, 8, 15, 43, 64, and 85. All peptide vaccines are administered intradermally and subcutaneously.
Ipilimumab will be administered in accord with the official prescribing information: 3 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks, for 4 doses. Ipilimumab will be administered on days 1, 22, 43, and 64.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with stage IIA (with class 2 DecisionDx Score) through IV melanoma in
             cohorts defined below. These participants may have had cutaneous, uveal, mucosal
             primary melanoma, or an unknown primary melanoma. The diagnosis of melanoma must be
             confirmed by cytological or histological examination. Staging of cutaneous melanoma
             will be based on the revised AJCC staging system. Participants must be eligible to be
             treated with ipilimumab based on clinician judgment within standard of care.

               -  Cohort 1 (Advanced Patients): unresectable stage III or IV melanoma that have
                  clinical or radiographic evidence of disease.

               -  Cohort 2 (Neoadjuvant therapy): primary melanoma with clinically apparent lymph
                  node or in transit/satellite lesions with or without lymph node involvement, in
                  transit recurrence or metastatic recurrence amenable to complete resection to no
                  evidence of disease

               -  Cohort 3 (Adjuvant therapy): Stage IIA (with class 2 DecisionDx Score), IIB-IV
                  melanoma resected to no evidence of disease.

          -  Participants will be required to have radiological studies to define radiologically
             evident disease. Required studies include:

               -  Chest CT scan,

               -  Abdominal and pelvic CT scan, and

               -  Head CT scan or MRI PET/CT fusion scan may replace scans of the chest, abdomen,
                  and pelvis.

          -  Participants who have melanoma available for biopsy pre-treatment and on day 22 must
             consent to having those biopsies. Melanoma lesions may be in nodes, skin, soft tissue,
             liver, or other sites that can be accessed by core needle biopsy, or incisional or
             excisional biopsy, with or without image guidance.

          -  Participants who have had brain metastases will be eligible if all of the following
             are true:

               -  Each brain metastasis must have been treated by surgical removal, stereotactic
                  radiosurgery or managed to complete resolution with immunotherapy. Patients with
                  brain lesions managed by immunotherapy without excision or radiosurgery are
                  included provided that the brain metastases have completely resolved after
                  systemic therapy and there are no neurologic symptoms or need for systemic
                  therapy to control CNS-disease related symptoms.

               -  There has been no evident growth of any brain metastasis since the most recent
                  treatment. If a patient has been managed by immunotherapy alone, the prior
                  lesions must be completely resolved.

               -  No brain metastasis is &gt; 2 cm in diameter at the time of registration

               -  The most recent surgical resections or gamma-knife therapy for malignant melanoma

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Ability and willingness to give informed consent

          -  Adequate lab function tests Age 18 years or older at registration.

               -  High doses of systemic corticosteroids, with the following qualifications and
                  exceptions:

                    -  Daily doses of 10 mg predisone (or equivalent) per day administered
                       parenterally or orally are not allowed in patients with normal adrenal and
                       pituitary function.

                    -  In patients with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency replacement steroid
                       doses are allowed.

                    -  Inhaled steroids (e.g.: Advair®, Flovent®, Azmacort®) are permitted at low

             therapy within the preceding 6 weeks

          -  Participants who are currently receiving a checkpoint molecule blockade therapy, or
             who have received this therapy within the preceding 6 weeks, with the following
             exceptions:

               -  Participants who have received a PD-1 blocking antibody (eg: pembrolizumab or
                  nivolumab) may be enrolled 3 weeks after receiving the last dose of that
                  antibody.

               -  Participants who have been treated previously with a CTLA-4 blocking antibody
                  either as monotherapy or as part of combination CTLA-4/PD-1 blockade will be
                  ineligible if CTLA-4 therapy:

                    1. was discontinued early for toxicity, or

                    2. did not induce stable disease or objective clinical response (by RECIST or
                       irRC criteria) lasting 6 months or more.

        Note: Patients may be eligible if they have experienced progression after a period of
        stable disease (6 months or more) or an objective clinical response (by irRC or RECIST) (6
        months or more) induced by CTLA-4 blockade or combination CTLA-4/PD-1 blockade.

          -  Participants may not have been vaccinated previously with any of the synthetic
             peptides included in this protocol. Participants who have received vaccinations
             containing agents other than the synthetic peptides included in this protocol and have
             recurred during or after administration of the vaccine will be eligible to enroll 12
             weeks following their last vaccination.

          -  Female participants must not be breastfeeding

          -  Participants in whom there is a medical contraindication or potential problem in
             complying with the requirements of the protocol in the opinion of the investigator.

             immunosuppressive therapy, or autoimmune disorders with visceral involvement.
             Participants with an active autoimmune disorder requiring these therapies are also
             excluded. The following will not be exclusionary:

               -  The presence of laboratory evidence of autoimmune disease (e.g. positive ANA
                  titer) without symptoms
