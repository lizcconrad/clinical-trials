  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is one of the main chronic diseases in childhood and it is characterized by the
      inflammation of airways. Individuals with chronic lung disease are more susceptible to
      present reduction in exercise tolerance due to pulmonary limitations. The pulmonary
      rehabilitation may improve the physical capacity in asthmatic patients, as observed in other
      chronic lung diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The asthmatic patient's clinical changes may impair their functional capacity and exercise
      tolerance. Thus, the treatment of these individuals should be extended to pulmonary
      rehabilitation. Randomized clinical trials have shown interesting results, whether in
      cardiopulmonary conditions, quality of life or in the number of crises, after applying
      pulmonary rehabilitation program in asthmatic children and adolescents. In a systematic
      review on physical training with asthmatic children and adolescents the authors concluded
      that physical activity should be recommended to this population, although some issues have
      not yet been clarified due to limitations in the clinical trial. The control of the disease
      has not been evaluated by specific questionnaires in any study. The assessment of
      inflammatory markers was rarely addressed and the same occurred in the quality of life after
      physical training. In addition, it is possible to question the intensity and frequency of
      training, factors that can significantly contribute to the intervention results. All these
      information let us know that is necessary a randomized control trial to answer questions
      about physical characteristics, quality of life, inflammatory markers, and muscles strength.

    <description>The intervention group will have supervised rehabilitation program held twice a week, each session will have 60 minutes duration, with minimum interval of 24 hours, for a period of 8 weeks. Each session will consist of three parts: aerobic training, strength training and respiratory physiotherapy. The aerobic training will be held for 35 minutes (10 min of warm up, 20 min on target load and 5 min of slowdown) with initial intensity of 60% of the maximum load obtained in the maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing or in incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT). The intensity will be gradually increased up to 80%, so that fatigue or dyspnea values are kept between 4 and 6, according to the modified Borg scale.</description>

    <description>The control group will be subjected to supervised respiratory physiotherapy and stretching exercises twice a week, each session with duration of 60 minutes, with minimum interval of 24 hours, for a period of 8 weeks. The oral high-frequency oscillation device (Flutter®) will be used for 10 minutes, 5 minutes in each lateral decubitus, followed by the stretching of upper and lower limbs for 40 minutes. All exercises will be active, performed in sitting and lying positions without increasing the heart rate. The remaining 10 minutes will be used to discuss doubts about the disease and the use of the booklet.</description>
