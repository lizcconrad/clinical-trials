      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single 6 mL intraarticular (IA) injection of
      Synvisc-One in participants in India with symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee(s).

      Secondary Objective:

      To evaluate the safety and short-term efficacy of a repeat treatment with Synvisc-One.

      A period of approximately 19 months was anticipated from the time the first participants was
      enrolled in the study to the completion of the study (last participant out). Individual
      participant participation lasted from 7 to 13 months depending on the timing of repeat
      treatment.

          <description>WOMAC is health status measure questionnaire comprising 3 subscales (pain, stiffness and physical function). WOMAC A (measure of pain) calculated as a mean of 5 individual components, measured using a visual analogue scale (100 mm line marked by participants with score ranging from 0-100). Total score range is 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate higher pain. Data are reported for those participants who received repeat injection.
