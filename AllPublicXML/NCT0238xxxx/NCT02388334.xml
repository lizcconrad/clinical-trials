      Half the MS patients require a natural (non professional) caregiver's support for daily
      living activities and this level of investment increases with the degree of disability.

      The caregiver's role is an essential key factor in the &quot;therapeutic alliance&quot; between the
      patient and heath professionals. The impact on the natural caregivers' Quality Of Life (QOL)
      and their expectations for the global quality of management are not documented, notably
      because of the lack of adapted tools.

      The aim of the investigators' project is to develop, from the caregivers' point of view, a
      standardized questionnaire evaluating 1) their QOL as related to the disease of the assisted
      and 2) their expectations concerning the global quality of professional management (care,
      coordination, information...).

      1) their quality of life (QOL) as related to the disease of the assisted and 2) their

    <textblock>
      Half the MS patients require a natural (non professional) caregiver's support for daily
      living activities and this level of investment increases with the degree of disability.
      Authors considered that an approach focused on the caregiver's burden limits the perception
      and evaluation of the real impact of his/her role at the patient's side, just as it probably
      limits the effectiveness of interventions used and the support they can be offered. According
      to them, the concept of QOL linked to the disease of the assisted person would be better
      adapted to respond to this question, because of its multidimensional approach, along with the
      potential secondary benefits of caregiving.

      Although consideration of the patients' point of view to evaluate the effectiveness and
      quality of therapeutic strategies and, more widely, healthcare interventions have been
      imposed for the last 20 years in the investigators' healthcare systems, the data on
      caregivers' viewpoints are more recent. Authors concurred that assessing caregivers' needs
      and experiences is a more appropriate source of information to identify their expectations
      concerning the quality of the healthcare system rather than the concept of &quot;patient
      satisfaction&quot;. The impact of MS on the natural caregivers' QOL and expectations for the
      global quality of management is not documented in France, notably because of the lack of
      adapted tools. So, if caregivers' support capacities are exceeded primarily because of their
      own impaired QOL and their expectations for the quality of management are not considered, the
      therapeutic contract will be diminished, thereby worsening the overall quality of management
      for MS patients.

      The original tool validated will complete the palette of those that the investigators are
      developing to evaluate the quality of care of MS patients according to different dedicated
      organizations (formal networks or not, focused on the patients or professionals). All tools
      will initially be tested together, in the framework of the IRSEP project (funding by the
      ministry of health : PREQHOS nÂ° 2010-A0096138) on 3 regional population-based cohorts.

    <description>The validation phase of V2 comprises the analysis of the construct's reliability, exploratory and confirmatory stages of tool structuration in dimensions, and the reproducibility of the findings generated. It relies on the recruitment of caregivers who did not participate in the preceding steps.
To verify the stability of tool responses, another test round by 20% of the responders will be conducted 15 +/- 5 days after the first evaluation.
Finally, an analysis of sensitivity to change (e.g. initiation of a new treatment, transition to a progressive form; changes in disease management; changes in caregiver's situation) will be conducted.</description>
