    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the imaging performance of the Carestream
      PRO 3543 Detector and Carestream PRO 3543C Detector (referred to as the &quot;investigational
      devices&quot;) as compared to the currently marketed Carestream DRX-1 Detector (referred to as the
      &quot;predicate device&quot;). Both detectors are flat panel digital imaging devices. The results of
      this study will be included in a Traditional 510(k) FDA Submission to obtain clearance to
      market the new detectors in the US. The study was designed in accordance with the FDA
      Guidance titled &quot;Guidance for the Submission of 510(k)'s for Solid State X-ray Imaging
      Devices&quot;, issued on August 6, 1999.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the imaging performance of the
      investigational devices as compared to the currently marketed predicate device. The
      evaluation will consist primarily of comparing the diagnostic image quality of pediatric and
      adult cadaver studies and adult live human subject studies acquired under the same exposure
      technique.

      Under the same position and radiological technique, pediatric and adult cadaver studies, and
      adult live human subject studies, using double-exposed images will be acquired to evaluate
      the diagnostic image quality of the investigational device versus the predicate device.
      Target images will be assembled and reviewed in a side-by-side Comparative Evaluation to
      statistically confirm the findings of this evaluation.

      The live human subject portion of this study will be performed on healthy volunteers. Each
      volunteer will sign an Informed Consent after which they will have two (2) x-rays taken.The
      first x-ray will follow standard technique using the cleared predicate detector currently in
      use at the site. Following the first x-ray, we will take one additional x-ray of the same
      part of the body with one (1) of the investigational detectors. The x-ray from the
      investigational detector will not be used to diagnose.

      If the x-ray obtained by the standard DR x-ray detector shows any unforeseen, unusual or
      abnormal findings, these findings will be communicated to the subject and their doctor by
      USPS mail.

      Reason for Observational Study Type: There are three (3) physical detectors being used in
      this study. Each detector is 35 centimeters by 43 centimeters. None of the subjects will
      given a detector. All subjects are healthy volunteers recruited by flyer. All subjects will
      be imaged with the same predicate detector and one (1) of the investigational detectors.

    <description>1-Non-diagnostic Unacceptable for diagnostic purposes. Little or no clinically usable diagnostic information (e.g., gross underexposure, system failure or extensive motion artifact). Almost all such imaging should be repeated. 2-Limited Acceptable, with some technical defect (motion artifact, body habitus/poor x-ray penetration, or patient positioning may limit visualization of some body-regions but still adequate for diagnostic purposes). Not as much diagnostic information as is typical for an examination of this type, but likely sufficient. 3-Diagnostic Image quality that would be expected routinely when imaging cooperative patients. 4-Exemplary Good, most adequate for diagnostic purposes. Image quality that can serve as an example that should be emulated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pair Preference Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks after last x-ray capture</time_frame>
    <description>During the Reader Study the radiologists completed a paired preference rating using the following scale: -3, Image displayed on left is strongly preferred; -2, Image displayed on left is moderately preferred; -1, Image displayed on left is slightly preferred; 0, No preference between the images; 1, Image displayed on right is slightly preferred; 2, Image displayed on right is moderately preferred; 3, Image displayed on right is strongly preferred. Both the predicate and investigational images were randomly assigned to appear on the right or left monitors. A spreadsheet was used for managing the data. Prior to analysis, raw ratings were converted so that those in favor of the investigational device were made positive, and ratings in favor of the predicate device were made negative.</description>

        <title>Pair Preference Rating Scale</title>
        <description>During the Reader Study the radiologists completed a paired preference rating using the following scale: -3, Image displayed on left is strongly preferred; -2, Image displayed on left is moderately preferred; -1, Image displayed on left is slightly preferred; 0, No preference between the images; 1, Image displayed on right is slightly preferred; 2, Image displayed on right is moderately preferred; 3, Image displayed on right is strongly preferred. Both the predicate and investigational images were randomly assigned to appear on the right or left monitors. A spreadsheet was used for managing the data. Prior to analysis, raw ratings were converted so that those in favor of the investigational device were made positive, and ratings in favor of the predicate device were made negative.</description>
