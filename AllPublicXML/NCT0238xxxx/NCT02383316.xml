  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Noonan syndrome (NS) is a rare genetic disease (incidence 1/2500 live births) characterized
      by the association of craniofacial manifestations, cardiopathies, short stature, and tumor
      predisposition. The genetic causes of Noonan Syndrome are mutations of genes involved in the
      Ras/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) pathway, mainly the gene encoding the tyrosine
      phosphatase Shp2 (50% of patients).Shp2 appears to be involved in many facets of energy
      metabolism control (glucose homeostasis, adipose tissue function…), through mechanisms that
      are poorly understood. Several metabolic anomalies (reduced adiposity, improved glucose
      tolerance) have been recently identified in an original mouse model carrying Shp2 mutation.
      Moreover, recent clinical survey has shown that adult Noonan Syndrome patients are protected
      from developping overweight and obesity when compared to the general population. However, the
      metabolic status associated with Noonan Syndrome condition has not been explored to date.

      Differential hormone sensitivity is associated with Noonan Syndrome and participates in the
      development of some symptoms. The investigators have demonstrated that MAPK upregulation in
      Noonan Syndrome is responsible for partial growth hormone (GH) insensitivity, and subsequent
      growth retardation.

      Clinical traits evocative of energy metabolism dysfunctions have been recently reported in
      Noonan Syndrome patients, although the origins and consequences of these metabolic changes
      have not been documented to date. The aim of this study is to explore the metabolic status of
      children with Noonan Syndrome.

      Children with Noonan Syndrome will be compared with age- and sex-matched healthy children.
      The investigators hypothesize than Noonan Syndrome children have an increased insulin
      sensitivity compared to GHD children.

      Study parameters will be collected including: clinical measurements (height, weight, body
      mass index, waist circumference, and blood pressure), glucose and insulin levels at baseline
      and after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), body composition measured by dual-energy
      x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

      The study will include only one visit.
