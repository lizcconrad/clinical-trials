  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent clinical studies showed an association between Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) and
      circulating levels of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-8 and
      MMP-10, compared with healthy controls. A recent study showed the association between MMP-10
      serum levels and severity and poor outcome in patients affected by Critical Limb Ischemia
      (CLI).

      Also, MMPs seems to be involved in intimal hyperplasia and constrictive remodeling, both
      responsible of restenosis after surgical treatment of atherosclerotic lesions.

      Intimal hyperplasia is a thickening of the tunica intima resulting in narrowing of the vessel
      lumen.

      Elevated tissue levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 have been identified in pig models of vein bypass
      grafts, temporally coinciding with the period of Smooth Muscle Cells (SMC) migration and
      neointimal formation.

      In the present study the investigators want to evaluate MMP-1; MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-8 and MMP-10
      serum levels variations in patients affected CLI, before and after lower limb surgical
      revascularization through venous or prosthetic bypass in order to assess their role in
      predicting the surgical outcome of these procedures.

      Patients with CLI will be randomized to receive lower limb surgical revascularization through
      autogenous venous (Group I) or prosthetic bypass (using synthetic polytetrafluoroethylene -
      PTFE- ) (Group II).

      Patients enrolled in the present study will be followed through clinical and ultrasonographic
      examination at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. At the same time points MMPs plasma levels (by
      means of blood sampling through venipuncture) will be evaluated. Clinical, Instrumental and
      Laboratory data then will be matched.
