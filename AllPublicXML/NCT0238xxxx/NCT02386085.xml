  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is a significant deficiency in evidence regarding the safety of osteopathic
      manipulative treatments (OMT). To address this deficit, this study is designed to
      systematically evaluate the incidence and severity of OMT adverse events and examine the
      relationship of these adverse events to the technique(s) used and the body region(s) treated.
      The study is being conducted at the clinics of participating members of DO-Touch.NET, the
      only known practice-based research network (PBRN) focused on osteopathic manual medicine
      research. Eligible patients who receive OMT at one of the participating clinics will be asked
      to complete either a paper or online survey regarding any adverse events they experience
      within 1, 3, and 7 days following their treatment. Information regarding their diagnoses,
      which osteopathic techniques were used in their OMT, and which body regions were treated will
      be obtained from participant medical records. This data will be used to answer the following
      research questions:

        1. What is the incidence of adverse events from osteopathic manipulative treatment?

        2. What types of adverse events occur following osteopathic manipulative treatment?

        3. Are there individual osteopathic techniques in particular body regions that have higher
           incidences of adverse events than other techniques or body regions?

        4. Is the incidence of adverse events higher for some patient conditions than others?

    <description>Data from surveys completed 24 hours, 72 hours, and 1 week after receiving OMT will be used to determine the severity, duration, and onset of symptoms/complaints experienced by participants. The 24- and 72-hour surveys assess the patient-reported severity, duration, and location of potential adverse events, as well as the existence and severity of these symptoms within the week prior to treatment and the participant's assessment of whether the symptom/complaint was related to the OMT they received. The 1-week survey will follow-up on symptoms/complaints reported on the 72-hour survey and whether participants have sought follow-up or urgent care, visited the emergency room, or been hospitalized during the week following OMT.</description>
