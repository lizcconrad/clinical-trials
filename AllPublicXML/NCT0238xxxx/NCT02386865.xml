    <textblock>
      Although several prognostic models have been developed to predict outcome for patients with
      severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), currently no study describes the impact of respiratory
      failure during Emergency Department treatment on mortality in a population of elderly
      patients. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate factors predicting poor outcome
      with special emphasis on the impact of respiratory failure on mortality in elderly patients
      with isolated severe TBI.

      All elderly patients (age ≥ 65 years) with isolated severe head injury, admitted to this
      Level I trauma center, during a period of 16 years (from January 1992 to December 2008) were
      identified from the trauma registry. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to
      identify risk factors for a poor prognosis and outcome.

      The logistic regression found the following variables influencing the mortality: respiratory
      failure (p&lt;0.0005; OR: 9.369), pupillary response (p&lt;0.0212, OR: 3.393) and ISS score
      (p&lt;0.0001, OR:1.179). A significant (p&lt;0.0001) increased risk of death was also found for
      patients with a midline shift &gt;15 mm.

      The present study predicts a strong correlation between respiratory failure, pathological
      pupillary response, a higher ISS and substantial midline shift with poor outcomes in elderly
      patients sustaining an isolated severe TBI.

        : All elderly patients (age ≥ 65 years) with isolated severe head injury, admitted to this
        Level I trauma center, during a period of 16 years (from January 1992 to December 2008)
        were identified from the trauma registry. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to

        The inclusion criteria for this study were:

          1. patients aged 65 years and older and

          2. acute severe TBI defined by an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS-head) score of ≥ 3 for
             the head region.

        Exclusion criteria for this study were as followed:

          1. oral intubation prior to ED-admission;

          2. no details of the time of injury (e.g. chronic subdural hematomas) and

          3. any concomitant injuries.

          4. Patients who received oral intubation prior to ED-admission were excluded due to the
             high variability of indications other than respiratory failure or secondary
             neurological decline (e.g. intubation required for aspiration protection) that may not
             be necessarily related to TBI induced secondary respiratory failure.
