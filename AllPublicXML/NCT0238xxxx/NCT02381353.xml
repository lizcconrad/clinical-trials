  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After surgery to remove the eye, either by enucleation or evisceration, patients have
      variable levels of pain for several postoperative days. Some patients have almost no
      discomfort while others require significant amounts of oral narcotics and report pain of 10
      out of 10 on a numerical rating scale. The current operative standard is to infiltrate the
      eye socket with 0.5% bupivacaine during surgery leading to several hours of postoperative
      analgesia. In 2011, Pacira Pharmaceuticals released a bupivacaine liposomal injectable
      suspension (Exparel, 1.3%) which offers sustained release of bupivacaine giving postoperative
      pain control for up to 72 hours. This medication has been used in numerous surgeries
      including inguinal hernia repair, hemorrhoidectomy, bunionectomy, breast reconstruction, and
      orthopedic surgery, and the literature reports improved pain control, decreased use of oral
      opioids, and increased patient satisfaction. There are no reports of the use of Exparel in
      the ophthalmic literature. The investigators propose a randomized, controlled trial to
      compare the postoperative pain control offered by sustained release bupivacaine to that
      offered by standard plain bupivacaine after enucleation or evisceration.
