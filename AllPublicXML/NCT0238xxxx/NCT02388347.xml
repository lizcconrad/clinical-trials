      To assess the safety of a single ascending dose of MEDI7836 in healthy adult male subjects
      and healthy adult female subjects of non-childbearing potential.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1a, randomised, blinded (the investigator and subject will be blinded to
      treatment assignment and sponsor will be unblinded to treatment assignment),
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety of single-ascending SC doses of MEDI7836 in
      healthy adult males subjects and healthy adult female subjects of non-childbearing potential.
      The study will be conducted at a single site in the United Kingdom (UK). Four dosing cohorts
      of MEDI7836 or placebo are planned for this study for a total of 32 subjects (24 subjects
      receiving MEDI7836, 8 subjects receiving placebo).

    <description>Any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening situation (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a participant who received MEDI7836. Treatment-emergent adverse events between administration of investigational product and Day 281 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

    <description>An abnormal laboratory finding which required an action or intervention by the investigator, or a finding judged by the investigator to represent a change beyond the range of normal physiologic fluctuation were reported as an adverse event. Treatment-emergent adverse events between first dose of study drug and Day 281 after the last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state.

Physical examination included assessment of general appearance, weight, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, skin, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, abdominal system, and nervous system. Criteria for abnormal physical findings was based on investigator's discretion. TEAEs were present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug until Day 281 after the last dose of study drug.</description>
