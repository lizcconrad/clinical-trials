  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the Italian language version of a questionnaire about
      symptoms that patients may have during cancer treatment is understandable to Italian speaking
      patients. The questionnaire is called the PRO-CTCAE, and was originally developed at the U.S.
      National Cancer Institute to help get information about patients' symptoms directly from the
      patients themselves. The Italian version of the questionnaire will be used in future studies
      to gain a better understanding of patient symptoms.

      This study will be conducted in two steps. The first is the Italian translation and cross
      cultural adaptation of the original US NCI's version of the PRO-CTCAE questionnaire. The
      questionnaire will be translated and administered to a sample of 96 Italian patients. After
      protocol amendment in November 2016, the second step was modified and consists of test-retest
      reliability assessment of the Italian language version of the PRO-CTCAE questionnaire that
      was developed in the first step, with a minimum of 59 Italian speaking patients to be
      enrolled. A validation study is planned and will be the subject of a separate protocol.

    <description>In this phase 96 Italian-speaking patients who are receiving cancer treatment or who have completed treatment for cancer within the past six months at one of the participating sites will first be asked to independently complete a series of PRO-CTCAE symptom items in a Patient Questionnaire. Following completion by the participant of the Patient Questionnaire containing PRO-CTCAE items, the interviewer will elicit participants' feedback regarding item comprehension, symptomatic adverse event terms, attribute terms, 7-day recall period, and response options, via a semi-scripted cognitive debriefing interview developed to assure consistency across interviews.</description>

        Adult patients receiving or having recently received cancer therapy (chemotherapy, biologic
        therapy, and or radiation therapy) will be recruited from 17 Italian Cancer Institutes and
        Hospitals throughout Italy. Sampling will be performed to ensure that the target population
        is matched for gender, age and area of residence (North, center, and Southern Italy).
        Recruitment of at least 25% of patients with lower levels of educational attainment (i.e.,
        primary school or no education) will also be ensured.
