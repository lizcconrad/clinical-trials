  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is the most frequent psychiatric problem in children. Untreated anxiety often has a
      chronic course, or may be a recurring condition. Anxiety in children predicts a variety of
      psychiatric disorders later in life, and involves problems regarding school performance and
      social relations. The literature provides a number of factors, which are suggested to
      increase the risk of developing an anxiety disorder. In particular, it has been shown that
      children of parents with anxiety disorders are at much greater risk of developing an anxiety
      disorder. Several studies have found a correlation between anxiety in the child, and parent
      behavior characterized by criticism, control and overprotectiveness. The present study aim to
      preliminary evaluate whether a eight week parent training intervention can reduce the
      incidence of anxiety disorders in children and to evaluate the feasibility of the parent
      training. Three central factors has been the basis in developing the parent training, all of
      which are considered to be involved in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders
      in children (1) criticism and rejection, (2) control and overprotectiveness, and (3) parental
      modeling and reinforcement of anxiety. The goal of the parent training is therefore (1) to
      increase warmth and acceptance, (2) to increase autonomy for the child, and (3) modeling and
      reinforcement of brave behavior. The investigators intend to include 60 anxious parents in
      the study, who will be randomly allocated to either group parent training, Internet delivered
      parent training, or wait-list condition. The inclusion criteria are as follows: The parent
      states that he/she experiences anxiety or worry, the parents' child is 6-12 years old, and do
      not fulfill criteria for an anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder, the parent
      possesses everyday access to the Internet, and there is no presence of very aggravated family
      situations, such as parent substance abuse or severe depression, or domestic violence.
