      Sports-related soft tissue injuries, such as sprains, strains, and contusions, are a common
      painful condition. Current treatment includes oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs), which have a high incidence of intolerable gastrointestinal side effects.

      Ancient Indian healing system, Ayurveda addresses the need of sports medicine up to certain
      extent. In practice, there are different treatment modalities for injuries, uses of drugs &amp;
      dietetics as well as practices of rehabilitation. Although, previous evidences support the
      efficacy of ayurveda practices with significant reduction in pain, joint tenderness, joint
      swelling, mobility restriction and early morning joint stiffness. But there is no treatment
      studies have been performed to evaluate the clinical outcome for specific sports injuries.

      This study assessed the efficacy and safety of ayurveda gel and patches applied to the
      painful injury site for the treatment of acute minor sports injury pain.
