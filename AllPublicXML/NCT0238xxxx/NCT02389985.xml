      The purpose of this study is to estimate the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of CRLX101 when
      administered in combination with weekly paclitaxel in women with recurrent or persistent,
      epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.

      Determine through pharmacokinetic evaluation(sometimes described as what the body does to a
      drug, refers to the movement of drug into, through and out of the body-the time and course of
      its absorption, bioavailability, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) whether or not the
      disposition of paclitaxel is affected by the concurrent administration of CRLX101.

      Recurrent ovarian cancer represents a therapeutic challenge. Patients with resistant disease,
      showing progression within six months of platinum-containing therapy, have a poor prognosis,
      with median overall survival (OS) approximately 12 months.Ultimately most patients with
      recurrent disease ultimately develop platinum resistance, and novel strategies are needed.

      In this setting the most active agents are pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), paclitaxel
      and topotecan. Multiple trials have demonstrated that combination therapy produces increased
      toxicity without improved efficacy.

      This study proposes to examine the combination of CRLX101 in combination with weekly
      paclitaxel. Preclinical studies show synergistic activity in the SKOV3 human ovarian cancer
      xenograft ovarian cancer cell lines (14), as well as in vivo (15,16), perhaps via an
      antiangiogenic mechanism.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or
             primary peritoneal carcinoma. Histologic documentation of the original primary tumor
             is required via the pathology report.

          2. Patient must have measurable disease or detectable (non-measurable) disease:

             Measurable disease will be defined by RECIST 1.1.

          3. Patients must have adequate bone marrow, renal, hepatic, and neurologic functions

          4. Patients should be free of active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics.

          5. Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including chemotherapy,
             bevacizumab or other biologic or targeted agents and immunologic agents, must be
             discontinued at least 21 days (three weeks) prior to registration.

          6. Any prior radiation therapy must be discontinued at least four weeks prior to
             registration.

          7. Major surgery within 28 days (four weeks) prior to registration.
