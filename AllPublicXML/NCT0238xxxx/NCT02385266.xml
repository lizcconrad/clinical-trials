  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of D-Cycloserine versus placebo
      treatment in reducing pain from urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blinded, randomized control trial (RCT) over a 21 week period that aims to
      evaluate the treatment efficacy of placebo and D-cycloserine(DCS) in men suffering from
      UCPPS. The brain functional and anatomical properties associated with treatment response will
      also be examined.

      This study will emphasize on comparing, both clinically and by brain imaging, the analgesic
      response to placebo in both placebo responders and non-responders in addition to a novel
      treatment (DCS) that targets the brain's pain mechanism for UCPPS.

      Subjects will be randomized to 2 arms, in a 1:1 ratio, to a DCS medication group (n=20) and a
      placebo medication group (n=20). Questionnaire outcomes and brain scans will occur prior to
      initiating treatment and at the end of the treatment period. The actual visits required are
      minimized, 9 visits spread out over 21 weeks, as pain, quality of life and pill ingestion
      timings are collected using a secure study website accessible electronically.

             a 3 mo period within the last 6 mo;

          -  Must have a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score &gt;40 mm (of 100 mm maximum) at the
             baseline visit (UCPPS pain moderate to severe);

          -  Must be in generally stable health;
