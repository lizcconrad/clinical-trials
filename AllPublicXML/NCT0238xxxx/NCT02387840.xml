  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the feasibility of using magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) in
      children, adolescents and young adults (AYA) with and without brain tumors. This study will
      also look at subjects with and without neurofibromatosis type 1(NF1), a genetic disorder that
      affects the growth of nervous system cells. Further, it will explore potential ways of using
      of MRF signal measurements in children, adolescents, and young adults with brain tumors,
      including tissue characterization, looking at whether the treatment was effective, and
      finding metastasized tumors of unknown origin (occult tumors). To explore the feasibility and
      potential applications of MRF, this study will recruit up to 80 subjects but will stop once
      10 subjects have usable data in each of six groups.

      Specific Aim 1: Demonstrate the feasibility of magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) in
      children, adolescents and young adults (AYA) with and without brain tumors.

      Specific Aim 2: Characterize the MRF signature of low-grade gliomas

      Specific Aim 3: Determine whether MRF can identify occult tumor in subjects with low-grade
      glioma.

      Specific Aim 4: Determine whether MRF can identify treatment effects in low-grade gliomas.

      Specific Aim 5: Explore whether common brain tumors can be differentiated by comparing
      pre-operative MRF signature with pathologic diagnosis.

      Outline: This study will examine the feasibility of MRF in children and AYA and determine
      whether quantitative measures of T1 and T2 relaxation times can be derived in subjects &lt;35
      years of age. Approximately 80 subjects will be evaluated and include subgroups where MRF may
      be of particular utility, including children and AYA subjects with brain tumors and subjects
      with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Additional aims will investigate the utility of MRF in
      these groups.

    <description>Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) uses pseudo-randomized variation in acquisition parameters to generate a multi-parametric data signal that can be compared to signal patterns calculated from all possible combinations of parameters of interest. The closest match in signal patterns yields the parameters used to calculate the theoretical signal, in each voxel, and thus a map of all parameters of interest for that tissue. This process allows for rapid quantitation of MR relaxometry values (T1 and T2).</description>
