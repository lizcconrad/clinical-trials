          -  ≥18 years of age

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of CML patients by attending physician

          -  Naive to dasatinib before enrollment in study treatment or have received &lt;3 months of
             dasatinib treatment

          -  Plan to or are receiving dasatinib therapy based on physician's clinical judgment

          -  Administered dasatinib after imatinib-resistance or intolerance
