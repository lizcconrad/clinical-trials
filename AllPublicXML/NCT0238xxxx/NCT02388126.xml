  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer has been the most common neoplastic disease in men in Finland over the last
      ten years. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) plays an important role in screening of prostate
      cancer. However, PSA has a limited sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer detection.
      Commonly, the diagnosis of prostate cancer is done by transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)
      guided biopsy. Because of the low accuracy of TRUS a systematic biopsy is usually performed
      instead of targeted TRUS biopsy. While, as many as 47% of the ultra-sound guided biopsies may
      be false negative and biopsies carry a risk of increase in complications, there is an
      increasing interest in developing more accurate non-invasive imaging modalities.

      This study will enroll 150 men with previous negative biopsies and clinical suspicion of
      prostate cancer due to serum level of PSA higher than 2.5 ng/ml or abnormal digital rectal
      examination (DRE) or patients in active surveillance due to low risk prostate carcinoma.
      Anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) at 3 Tesla
      (T) magnetic field using surface coils will be used to non-invasively predict the presence or
      absence of prostate cancer. In addition to routine 12-core TRUS biopsies, targeted TRUS
      guided biopsy based on MRI findings will be performed.
