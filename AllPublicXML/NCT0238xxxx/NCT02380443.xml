    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open label dose frequency escalation study of InSituVax personalized
      anti-tumor vaccine protocol combining the cryoablation of a selected metastatic lesion with
      intra-lesional immunotherapy with AlloStim®. The in-situ (in the body) cancer vaccine step
      combines killing a single metastatic tumor lesion by use of cryoablation in order to cause
      the release of tumor-specific markers to the immune system and then injecting bioengineered
      allogeneic immune cells (AlloStim®) into the lesion as an adjuvant in order to modulate the
      immune response and educate the immune system to kill other tumor cells where ever they
      reside in the body.

    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most common cancer worldwide. Metastasis is the
      main reason of death in CRC patients. The current drugs used to treat colorectal cancer
      provide important treatment options for patients, their limitations including drug
      resistance, poor efficacy and severe side effects. Development of new therapeutic strategies
      for KRAS mutant as well as BRAF mutant tumors are therefore highly needed in order to offer a
      new category of drug (immunotherapy). This study targets the population of mCRC patients that
      have progressed after two lines of chemotherapy and are not eligible for targeted therapies.
      The study will assess six different dosing schedules. A standard 3 plus 3 study design will
      be used. The starting frequency for each dosing schedule will be escalated in subsequent
      groups of patients. The study will evaluate safety of increased frequency of AlloStim® dosing
      and anti-tumor effect of the new proposed dose and frequency schedule.

    <description>AlloStim is an activated living CD4+ Th1 memory cell derived from the blood of normal blood donors and intentionally mismatched to the recipient. AlloStim is bioengineered to express high levels of Type 1 inflammatory cytokines (such as interferon-gamma, TNF-alpha, GM-CSF) and immunomodulatory molecules such as CD40L. AlloStim has CD3/CD28-coated microbeads attached to assure activation upon infusion.</description>
