    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study for previously untreated subjects with advanced NSCLC. The study
      will take place in two phases. First, a cohort of twelve participants will be enrolled in
      phase I part and will be treated with carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel and pembrolizumab. A cohort
      of twelve subjects will be evaluated for safety and tolerability after 2 cycles of therapy.
      All subjects who receive either nab-paclitaxel or pembrolizumab will be evaluable. If 33% of
      subjects or less have unacceptable toxicity in the first cohort or any subsequent cohort (if
      necessary), the study will proceed to the Phase II part. If more than 33% have unacceptable
      toxicity, 12 additional subjects will be enrolled in a second cohort, if necessary. If
      unacceptable toxicity is seen in more than 33% in Cohort 2, the study will end due to
      unacceptable toxicity of this drug combination.

      The phase II part of the study is a single arm study. All subjects will be treated with
      carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel, and pembrolizumab in 21-day cycles for up to 4 cycles.

      Mandatory pre-treatment tumor biopsies will be obtained prior to initiating treatment for all
      subjects (only if adequate archived samples are unavailable). Mandatory tumor biopsies will
      be obtained in the Phase II part of the study after 4 cycles of study treatment or at the
      time of progression, whichever comes first.

      For subjects without progression of disease after Cycle 4, pembrolizumab will continue every
      3 weeks for up to 2 years or until unacceptable toxicity.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

      Phase I, Cohort 1 Induction Therapy:

        -  Carboplatin AUC 6 IV, Day 1

        -  Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m^2 IV, Days 1, 8, 15

        -  pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg IV, Day 1

        -  Cycle length: 21 days; number of cycles: 4

      Phase I, Cohort 1 Maintenance Therapy:

      For subjects who have confirmed CR, PR, or SD (non-progression) after 4 cycles of induction
      therapy, maintenance therapy with pembrolizumab 2* mg/kg will continue on Day 1 of each
      21-day cycle. Treatment will continue until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or
      for a maximum of 2 years from Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1). Subjects who complete 24 months of
      treatment with pembrolizumab may be eligible for up to one year of additional study treatment
      if they progress after stopping study treatment provided they continue to meet inclusion
      criteria requirements.

      If unacceptable toxicity is seen in Phase I, Cohort 1, 12 additional participants will be
      enrolled.

      Phase I, Cohort 2 Induction Therapy (if necessary):

        -  Carboplatin AUC 6 IV, Day 1

        -  Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m^2 IV, Days 1, 8, 15

        -  pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg IV, Day 1 (cycle 2-4 only)

        -  Cycle length: 21 days; Number of cycles: 4

      Phase I, Cohort 2 Maintenance Therapy:

      For subjects who have confirmed CR, PR, or SD (non-progression) after 4 cycles of induction
      therapy, maintenance therapy with pembrolizumab 2* mg/kg will continue on Day 1 of each
      21-day cycle. Treatment will continue until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or
      for a maximum of 2 years from Cycle 2, Day 1 (C2D1). Subjects who complete 24 months of
      treatment with pembrolizumab may be eligible for up to one year of additional study treatment
      if they progress after stopping study treatment provided they continue to meet inclusion
      criteria requirements.

      Phase II Induction Therapy:

        -  Carboplatin AUC 6 IV, Day 1

        -  Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m^2 IV, Days 1, 8, 15

        -  pembrolizumab 200mg IV, Day 1 of each cycle

        -  Cycle length: 21 days; number of cycles: 4

      Phase II Maintenance Therapy:

      For subjects who have confirmed CR, PR, or SD (non-progression) after 4 cycles of induction
      therapy, maintenance therapy with pembrolizumab 200 mg will continue on Day 1 of each 21-day
      cycle. Treatment will continue until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or for a
      maximum of 2 years from Cycle 1, Day 1 (C1D1). Subjects who complete 24 months of treatment
      with pembrolizumab may be eligible for up to one year of additional study treatment if they
      progress after stopping study treatment provided they meet the requirements.

      *As additional data from ongoing trials becomes available, the dose of pembrolizumab may be
      adjusted.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial
             and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health information. NOTE: HIPAA
             authorization may be included in the informed consent or obtained separately.

          -  Subjects must be ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  Individuals with stage IIIB or IV, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who
             have not received prior chemotherapy for Stage IIIB or IV disease, and who are not
             candidates for curative surgery or radiation therapy.

          -  ECOG performance status (PS) 0-1

          -  Measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 criteria

          -  Prior to registration, all subjects must have archival tissue available. For subjects
             who have no archival tissue, but have PD-L1 testing results using the Dako 22C3
             antibody, subjects will be permitted to enroll without submitting tissue. If the
             patient has not had prior testing and no acceptable archival tissue is available,
             subjects must be willing to consent to providing a pre-treatment biopsy for PD-L1
             testing. Regardless of PD-L1 testing status, archival tissue will be requested for
             research testing if available.

          -  Phase II subjects must be willing to consent to providing a mandatory post-treatment
             core biopsy for research if clinical feasible.

          -  Women are eligible to participate if they are of non-childbearing potential or have
             documentation of a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine β-hCG) within 3 days of
             registration. Sexually active pre-menopausal women of childbearing potential must
             agree to use adequate, highly effective contraceptive measures, starting with the
             first dose of study drug and for 120 days after the last dose of last study drug.
             Effective birth control includes (a) intrauterine device (IUD) plus one barrier
             method; (b) oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives plus one barrier method;
             or (c) 2 barrier methods. Effective barrier methods are male or female condoms,
             diaphragms, and spermicides (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm).
             Women of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or
             have not been free from menses for ≥ 1 year.

          -  Male participants should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting
             with the first dose of study drug through 120 days after the last dose of last study
             drug.
