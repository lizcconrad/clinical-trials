      In this study, 'the management of pressure ulcer' defined as procedures comprising wound
      assessment, wound dressing and infection control, visually evaluated the outcomes of 'the
      management of pressure ulcer' through the tele-consultation.

      This study designed to draw service targets based on utility and compatibility of U-health
      solution service and to analyse whether health providers use U-health solution service.
