  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The achievement of peripheral nerve block requires several needle passes, with each of them
      being at risk of causing nerve injury either by direct trauma or intraneural injection even
      with the use of the ultrasound.

      The ultrasound guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block is known to be at risk of
      pneumothorax and / or nerve injury.

      This study is designed to determine the maximal effective distance away from the nerve for
      the injection to be effective.
