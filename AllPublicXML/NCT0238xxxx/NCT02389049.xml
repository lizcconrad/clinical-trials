      This study is designed to study DNA sequencings for mutations in a research genetic test
      panel of genes (which contains all 32 known and/or published genes associated with PCD). The
      study aims to show that about 70% of PCD patients have biallelic mutations in one of these
      genes. This project will enroll patients who have already had a clinical evaluation, and have
      clinical features consistent with PCD.

      The investigators have established a Consortium of 9 geographically-dispersed clinical
      research sites to study rare disease of the airways, including Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia
      (PCD). PCD is a genetic disorder with defective mucociliary clearance (MCC), sinus and
      pulmonary disease with chronic infection, and organs located on the wrong side of the body in
      about 50% of patients (Kartagener Syndrome). Lung disease occurs early in children with PCD,
      but establishing a diagnosis remains a major challenge, based on the traditional approaches
      of using electron microscopy and/or ciliary waveform analysis to define abnormalities of
      ciliary ultrastructure and/or function.

      For this study, blood or buccal samples for DNA will be collected and genetic testing in
      patients with known or suspected PCD will be performed. This study can include term neonates
      with respiratory distress of unknown etiology and features of PCD, particular laterality
      defects (situs inversus or heterotaxy). The key hypothesis for this study is that a genetic
      test panel of 32 genes will confirm a diagnosis in most patients with PCD.

    <description>The primary objective is to perform research genetic (Ampliseq panel) testing in patients who are known or suspected to have PCD, based on previous research or future clinical and lab characterization by certified clinical research sites. We will define the prevalence of biallelic PCD-causing mutations in patients who fulfill criteria of very high likelihood of PCD, as well as prevalence in other patients with some features of PCD. We anticipate successful completion of this objective will provide the foundation for development of clinically available genetic test panels, particularly as additional PCD genes are identified.</description>

    <measure>Identify patients with PCD who do not have a biallelic PCD-causing mutation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objective is to perform research genetic testing to identify patients with PCD who do not have biallelic PCD-causing mutations in known PCD genes, so they can be exome sequenced to discover novel genes associated with PCD. We anticipate that successful completion of this objective will enable the development of more extensive genetic test panels that are more robust to diagnose PCD.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known diagnosis of cystic fibrosis with classic clinical presentation and elevated
             sweat chloride levels and/or two known disease-causing Cystic Fibrosis transmembrane

             arthritis.

          -  Any patient who is unwilling or unable to provide consent or to comply with the
             testing required in this protocol

        A participant should not be in the study if they have not had a standard clinical
        evaluation to address other potential causes of chronic oto-sino- pulmonary disease.
