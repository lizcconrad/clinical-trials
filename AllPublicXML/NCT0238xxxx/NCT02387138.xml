    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD), the Dose Limitant Toxicities
      (DLTs) and the safety profile of S-1 combined with fixed doses of Irinotecan (SIRI schedule)
      and fixed doses of Irinotecan and Oxaliplatin (SIRINOX schedule).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the therapeutic potential and reduced toxicity advantages of S-1 compared with other
      fluoropyrimidines, this trial assessing S-1 with Oxaliplatin plus Irinotecan is warranted for
      future investigations (Phase II-III). The primary objectives are to determine the Maximal
      Tolerated Dose (MTD), the Dose Limitant Toxicities (DLTs) and the safety profile of S-1
      combined with fixed doses of Irinotecan (SIRI schedule) and fixed doses of Irinotecan and
      Oxaliplatin (SIRINOX schedule).

    <description>S-1: Administered orally twice daily from day 1 for 7 consecutive days followed by a 7-day recovery period in a 14-day cycle.
The starting dose of S-1 will be two levels below the recommended dose defined in SIRI (20 mg/m² BID minimum) with a cohort dose escalation by 5 mg/m² increments (5 dose levels).
Irinotecan : fixed dose of 180 mg/m² IV over 90 minutes on d1 of every cycle Oxaliplatin : fixed dose of 85 mg/m² over 120 minutes on d1 of every cycle G-csf : d8 to d13 systematically</description>
