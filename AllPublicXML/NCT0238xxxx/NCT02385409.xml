    <textblock>
      Preoperative anemia is an independent risk factor for the need for allogeneic transfusion
      during surgery and increased postoperative morbidity.

      Treatment of preoperative anemia is recommended. However the type of preoperative anemias in
      elective hip- and knee surgery has only been sparsely studied.

      This observational study aims to investigate the incidence and type of anemias prior to
      elective hip- and knee arthroplasty.

    <textblock>
      Preoperative anemia is an independent risk factor for the need for allogeneic transfusion
      during surgery and increased postoperative morbidity.

      In elective orthopedic surgery, international guidelines recommends treatment of preoperative
      anemia including the use of Iron supplements for anemias associated with iron deficiency. In
      addition, low iron stores in both anemic and non-anemic patients may delay postoperative
      hemoglobin recovery.

      However, the reasons for preoperative anemia and the prevalence of patients with low iron
      stores have only been sparsely studied in elective hip- and knee arthroplasty.

      This observational study aims to investigate the incidence and type of anemias prior to
      elective hip- and knee arthroplasty.
