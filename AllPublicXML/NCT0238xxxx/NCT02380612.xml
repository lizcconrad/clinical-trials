    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, within-subject controlled study to compare the clinical performance of
      the ReCell device when used as an adjunct to meshed skin graft in subjects requiring skin
      grafts for closure of burn injuries. Co-primary effectiveness endpoints include: (1)
      confirmed treatment area closure (i.e., healing) prior to or at 8 weeks as assessed by a
      blinded evaluator, and (2) a comparison of the actual expansion ratio, computed as the ratio
      of measured treated area to the measured donor site area, achieved for the ReCell-treated and
      control treatment areas. Safety will be evaluated in terms of long-term durability, scar
      outcomes and treatment-related adverse events.

    <description>Complete wound closure is defined as skin re-epithelialization without drainage, confirmed at two consecutive study visits at least 2 weeks apart by direct visualization by a qualified clinician blinded to treatment assignment. The incidence of complete wound closure is hypothesized to be non-inferior for ReCell-treated areas as compared to control areas.</description>

    <measure>The actual expansion ratios (treatment area to donor site area, inclusive of donor skin needed for secondary treatments) will be calculated separately for the ReCell and control treatments.</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to or at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For this second co-primary endpoint, it is hypothesized that the expansion ratio associated with the ReCell treatment area will be superior to that of the control, i.e. less donor skin will be required for ReCell-treated areas compared with the control areas.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject requires skin grafting as a result of an acute thermal burn injury (i.e.
             injuries caused by exposure of the skin to fire/flames, excessive heat, hot steam or
             water).

          2. The area of total burn injury is 5-50% TBSA inclusive.

          3. Two areas requiring skin grafting, each at least 300cm2 (or 600cm2 contiguous),
             excluding hand/face and joints.

          4. The subject is at least 5 years of age.

          5. The subject (or family, for those under 18 years of age) is willing and able to
             complete all followup evaluations required by the study protocol.

          6. The subject is to abstain from any other treatment of the wound(s) for the duration of
             the study unless medically necessary.

          7. The subject agrees to abstain from enrollment in any other interventional clinical
             trial for the duration of the study.

          8. The subject and/or guardian are able to read and understand instructions and give
             informed, voluntary, written consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject's burn injuries were caused by chemicals, electricity, and/or radioactive
             substances.

          2. The subject is unable to follow the protocol.

          3. The subject has other concurrent conditions that in the opinion of the investigator
             may compromise patient safety or study objectives.

          4. The subject has a known hypersensitivity to trypsin or compound sodium lactate for
             irrigation (Hartmann's) solution.

          5. Life expectancy is less than 1 year.
