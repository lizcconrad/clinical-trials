  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a serious health condition in overweight children which
      can lead to heart disease. This project will examine the links between liver health and
      cardiovascular risk factors in overweight and obese children, and will test the effect of a
      long-term after-school exercise program.

      Provision of comprehensive evidence for the benefits of exercise on children's health may
      reduce barriers to vigorous physical activity programs during a childhood obesity epidemic.

      This is an ancillary study adding cardiometabolic outcome measures to an ongoing NIH-funded
      randomized trial of exercise in overweight children (&quot;SMART study,&quot; R01 HL087923, P.I. Davis,
      NCT02227095). This presents the opportunity to obtain detailed measures of liver and vascular
      health to provide information about the effects of exercise on these conditions.

    <description>At baseline, the proportion of liver fat (ascertained by MRI) will be closely related to indices of liver fibrosis (as detected by transient elastography) and inflammation (ratio of aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase, AST/ALT; C-reactive protein, CRP), and to arterial stiffness and other indices of cardiovascular risk (body fat (DXA), visceral fat (MRI), aerobic fitness, insulin resistance, adiponectin, dyslipidemia).</description>
