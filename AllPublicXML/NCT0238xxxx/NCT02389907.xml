    <description>Assess the association between patients' perceptions of success with opioid post-operative pain management following total hip replacement or hysterectomy surgery as measured by a patient global assessment (PGA) at 24 hours post-op and at 48 hours post-op, and their perception of pain management while in the hospital and the hospital overall, as measured by the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) instrument two-weeks (14 days) post-discharge</description>

             required for the study and are willing to participate in the study

          -  Subject is receiving a unilateral total hip replacement or a hysterectomy (total
             abdominal hysterectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy,
             total vaginal hysterectomy, or total vaginal hysterectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy)

          -  Subject is expected to remain hospitalized for at least 24 hours post-operatively

          -  Subject is expected to experience pain requiring IV PCA or non-PCA (non-patient
             controlled opioids via IV, IM, SC, or PO routes of administration) opioids for at
             least 24 hours after surgery

          -  Subject is classified as American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) category I, II, or
             III

          -  Subject is willing to complete the required post-operative survey measures to be
             completed in the hospital

          -  Subject is willing to complete a post-discharge survey (including HCAHPS survey
             instrument) via telephone approximately two-weeks (14 days) post-discharge

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is having an operation other than the surgical procedures selected for
             inclusion (e.g., bilateral or partial hip replacement, or hip revision)

          -  Subject has a history of tolerance to opioids including those prescribed opioids in
             the 3 month period leading up to the perioperative period (i.e., a subject is
             considered to have a potential tolerance to opioids if for 4 consecutive days prior to
             surgery they have been taking a short acting/short acting combination opioid analgesic
             greater than 120 mg codein daily, 40 mg hydrocodone daily, 200 mg tramadol daily, or
             40 mg oxycodone daily or if they were on any dose of strong opioid analgesic such as
             morphine, hydromorphone, or fentanyl)

          -  Subject has a history of allergy to opioids reported pre-operatively or documented in
             medical history

          -  Subject is scheduled to receive additional surgical procedures beyond those listed
             within 72 hours of the initial surgery
