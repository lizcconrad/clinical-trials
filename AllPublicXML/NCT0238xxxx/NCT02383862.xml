    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of providing PROMIS Profile Scale
      scores (e.g., sleep, pain, anxiety, depression, energy/fatigue) to physicians on patients'
      symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SPADE symptoms (sleep, pain, anxiety, depression, and energy/fatigue) are the most common
      yet undertreated symptoms in clinical practice. Using the PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcome
      Measurement Information System) Profile Scales as a measure of SPADE symptoms, this study
      will determine the effectiveness of providing patient symptom scores to clinicians, identify
      barriers and facilitators to the clinical use of such scores, and evaluate the psychometric
      properties of the PROMIS Profile Scales in a primary care population.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in PROMIS Composite T-Score at 3-Month Follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The 20-item PROMIS questionnaire (composed of 4-item scales for each of the 5 SPADE symptoms) was administered to participants at baseline and at 3 month follow up. PROMIS assesses the extent to which patients experience problems with SPADE symptoms over the past 7 days using a 5-point Likert scale. Higher scores reflect greater symptom severity. To assess the effects of feedback on SPADE symptom improvement, group differences in the change in PROMIS composite T-scores from baseline to 3 month follow up (baseline PROMIS T-score - 3 month PROMIS T-score) were calculated. Positive change scores are indicative of symptom improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in PROMIS Sleep T-score at 3-Month Follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The 4-item PROMIS subscale for sleep was administered to participants at baseline and at 3 month follow up. The sleep subscale measures the extent to which patients experience problems with sleep over the past 7 days using a 5-point Likert scale. Higher scores reflect more severe sleep problems. To assess the effects of feedback on sleep, group differences in the change in PROMIS sleep T-scores from baseline to 3 month follow up (baseline PROMIS sleep T-score - 3 month PROMIS sleep T-score) were calculated. Positive change scores are indicative of improvement in sleep.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in PROMIS Pain T-score at 3-Month Follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The 4-item PROMIS subscale for pain was administered to participants at baseline and at 3 month follow up. The pain subscale measures the extent to which patients experience problems with pain over the past 7 days using a 5-point Likert scale. Higher scores reflect greater pain. To assess the effects of feedback on pain, group differences in the change in PROMIS pain T-scores from baseline to 3-month follow up (baseline PROMIS pain T-score - 3 month PROMIS pain T-score) were calculated. Positive change scores are indicative of improvement in pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in PROMIS Anxiety T-score at 3-Month Follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The 4-item PROMIS subscale for anxiety was administered to participants at baseline and at 3 month follow up. The anxiety subscale measures the extent to which patients experience anxiety symptoms over the past 7 days using a 5-point Likert scale. Higher scores reflect greater anxiety. To assess the effects of feedback on anxiety, group differences in the change in PROMIS anxiety T-scores from baseline to 3-month follow up (baseline PROMIS anxiety T-score - 3 month PROMIS anxiety T-score) were calculated. Positive change scores are indicative of improvement in anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in PROMIS Depression T-score at 3-Month Follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The 4-item PROMIS subscale for depression was administered to participants at baseline and at 3 month follow up. The depression subscale measures the extent to which patients experience depressive symptoms over the past 7 days using a 5-point Likert scale. Higher scores reflect greater depression. To assess the effects of feedback on depression, group differences in the change in PROMIS depression T-scores from baseline to 3-month follow up (baseline PROMIS depression T-score - 3 month PROMIS depression T-score) were calculated. Positive change scores are indicative of improvement in depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in PROMIS Fatigue T-score at 3-Month Follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The 4-item PROMIS subscale for fatigue was administered to participants at baseline and at 3 month follow up. The fatigue subscale measures the extent to which patients experience problems with fatigue over the past 7 days using a 5-point Likert scale. Higher scores reflect greater fatigue. To assess the effects of feedback on fatigue, group differences in the change in PROMIS fatigue T-scores from baseline to 3-month follow up (baseline PROMIS fatigue T-score - 3 month PROMIS fatigue T-score) were calculated. Positive change scores are indicative of improvement in fatigue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction at 3-Month Follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>At 3-month follow-up, treatment satisfaction was assessed. This 1-item measure assesses patients' satisfaction with the care of their symptoms overall on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from excellent to poor. Higher scores indicate poorer satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep at 3-month Follow up, as Measured by the Pittsburgh Insomnia Rating Scale (PIRS-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>For this secondary outcome, data were collected from the group as a whole without regard to randomization. Thus, data is analyzed for the group as a whole rather than separately for each arm. At 3-month follow up, sleep was assessed using the 2-item Pittsburgh Insomnia Rating Scale (PIRS-2). PIRS-2 measures quality and satisfaction with sleep over the past week. Possible scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores reflecting poorer sleep.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain at 3 Month Follow up, as Measured by PEG</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>For this secondary outcome, data were collected from the group as a whole without regard to randomization. Thus, data is analyzed for the group as a whole rather than separately for each arm. At 3-month follow up, pain was assessed using the 3-item PEG (Pain intensity, Enjoyment of life, and General activity). PEG measures pain intensity and interference in the past week. Possible scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores reflecting more intense pain and interference.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety at 3 Month Follow up, as Measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>For this secondary outcome, data were collected from the group as a whole without regard to randomization. Thus, data is analyzed for the group as a whole rather than separately for each arm. At 3-month follow up, anxiety was assessed using the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2). GAD-2 measures the frequency of anxiety symptoms over the past 2 weeks. Possible scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores reflecting more severe anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression at 3-month Follow up, as Measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>For this secondary outcome, data were collected from the group as a whole without regard to randomization. Thus, data is analyzed for the group as a whole rather than separately for each arm. At 3-month follow up, depression was assessed using the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). The PHQ-2 measures the frequency of depressive symptoms over the last 2 weeks. Possible scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores reflecting more severe depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue at 3-month Follow up, as Measured by the SF-36 Vitality Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>For this secondary outcome, data were collected from the group as a whole without regard to randomization. Thus, data is analyzed for the group as a whole rather than separately for each arm. At 3-month follow up, fatigue was assessed using the 4-item SF-36 (Short Form-36 Healthy Survey) vitality scale. The SF-36 vitality scale measures fatigue and energy over the past week. Possible scores range from 0 to 100, with lower scores reflecting greater fatigue.</description>

        <description>The 20-item PROMIS questionnaire (composed of 4-item scales for each of the 5 SPADE symptoms) was administered to participants at baseline and at 3 month follow up. PROMIS assesses the extent to which patients experience problems with SPADE symptoms over the past 7 days using a 5-point Likert scale. Higher scores reflect greater symptom severity. To assess the effects of feedback on SPADE symptom improvement, group differences in the change in PROMIS composite T-scores from baseline to 3 month follow up (baseline PROMIS T-score - 3 month PROMIS T-score) were calculated. Positive change scores are indicative of symptom improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in PROMIS Sleep T-score at 3-Month Follow up</title>
        <description>The 4-item PROMIS subscale for sleep was administered to participants at baseline and at 3 month follow up. The sleep subscale measures the extent to which patients experience problems with sleep over the past 7 days using a 5-point Likert scale. Higher scores reflect more severe sleep problems. To assess the effects of feedback on sleep, group differences in the change in PROMIS sleep T-scores from baseline to 3 month follow up (baseline PROMIS sleep T-score - 3 month PROMIS sleep T-score) were calculated. Positive change scores are indicative of improvement in sleep.</description>
