    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to estimate the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ADXS31-164.
      Once the RP2D has been selected, up to 4 expansion cohorts will be evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HER2 Positive

          -  Have histological or cytological diagnosis of locally advanced/metastatic HER2 solid
             tumors that has progressed or become intolerant to standard therapy or for which no
             standard therapy is available

          -  Have measurable and/or evaluable disease based on RECIST 1.1.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 to 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is newly diagnosed with a curative treatment option available.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of' immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of
             trial treatment.

          -  Has had a prior monoclonal antibody therapy within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1.
             (Prior anti-HER2 therapy is acceptable).

          -  Has received anticancer chemotherapy, surgical treatment, and/or radiation therapy
             (except palliative radiation therapy for disease-related pain with a consult with the
             sponsor's medical monitor) within â‰¤2 weeks of first study treatment.

          -  Is dependent on, currently or has received within the past 4 weeks corticosteroids
             (hormone replacement therapy, topical corticosteroids and occasional inhaled
             corticosteroids are allowed).

          -  Has a contraindication to administration of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or
             ampicillin.

          -  Has implanted medical device(s) that pose a high risk for colonization and/or cannot
             be easily removed (e.g., prosthetic joints, artificial heart valves, pacemakers,
             orthopedic screw(s), metal plate(s), bone graft(s), or other exogenous implant(s)).
             NOTE: More common devices and prosthetics which include arterial and venous stents,
             dental and breast implants, and venous access devices (e.g., Port-a-Cath or Mediport)
             are permitted. Sponsor must be contacted prior to consenting any subject who has any
             other device and/or implant.
