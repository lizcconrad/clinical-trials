      The primary objective of this research protocol is to evaluate the health related quality of
      life and efficacy of patient-initiated hospital follow-up for patients with moderate to
      severe psoriasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting 1 to 3% of the European
      population. Treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis often requires lifetime routine reviews
      by hospital dermatologist. Patterns of hospital review vary, but most patients attend
      follow-up every 12-16 week by dermatologist. At routine reviews the patient disease is often
      quiet and little intervention or no intervention is required, and times were the patient need
      help the time is limited for in-depth consultation. Both patient and healthcare professional
      requested more time. In-depth consultation is important in the care of psoriasis, because
      moderate to severe psoriasis has a significant impact on quality of life and patient have an
      increased incidence of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, overweight,
      hyperlipidemia and exposure to tobacco and alcohol. These comorbidities and the psychosocial
      burden must be addressed by clinicians to help patients to acquire or to maintain
      competencies that are required to live with a chronic disease.

      Patient-initiated hospital follow-up for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis might
      reduce inappropriate follow-up appointments, improve rapid access to specialist care and
      release resource to further in-depth consultation. If the patient is empowered to initiate
      hospital review thus patient's individual needs dictate the content, duration and contact
      with clinicians. It is our goal that an individual needs-based patient involvement in the
      shape of patient-initiated hospital follow-up,will be perceived as a benefit of the patients
      who 1) meets a high safety in the patient's own provision of medical treatment, 2) increase
      the patient's knowledge of the lifestyle and prevention of comorbidities and 3) strengths
      patient's overall satisfaction with treatment.
