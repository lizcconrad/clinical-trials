      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide versus
      normal saline in postoperative care of sutured wounds. Subjects will be randomly assigned to
      standard of care hydrogen peroxide or standard of care normal saline in postoperative care of
      sutured wounds followed by applying petroleum jelly and sterile gauze bandage. Data will be
      collected at day 0 and between days 7 to14. Subjects will provide irritation scale rating
      (0-4) with 0 being none/absent and 4 being severe/extreme.
