  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study addresses the challenge of increasing compliance with dietary recommendations and
      guidelines among diabetes type 2 patients by introducing professional dietary advice based on
      individual requirements.

      The objective of this study is to assess the effect of the Personalized Dietary Advice
      Services (PDAS) after a three month intervention on established markers of nutritional and
      health status in diabetes type 2 patients (HbA1c, glucose, insulin). Besides, the effect of
      the PDAS on perceived health status of diabetes type 2 patients will be assessed.

      This study will be a randomized control trial studying the effect of personalized dietary
      advice services on established markers of nutrition and health status of diabetes type 2
      patients. This dietary advice will be based on individual genetic, blood and food intake
      profiles, which will be measured at the start of the study.

      The dietitian will provide this personalized dietary advice, during the regular patient
      visits. In the control group, the dietitian will give the regular dietary advice.

      The study will start with a run-in period of two weeks, during which baseline measures will
      be done. After the run-in period, the three-month study will start with a first dietary
      consult during which the dietitian will use the personalized dietary advice services for
      providing dietary advice in the experimental group.
