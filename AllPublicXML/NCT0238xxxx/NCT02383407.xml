  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the current proposal is to evaluate safety and tolerability, in terms of
      neuropsychological effects of low frequency electrical stimulation of the fornix (LFSF) in
      participants with medically-intractable Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. Secondary aims include
      evaluation of psychiatric changes, seizure frequency, and quality of life during LFSF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low frequency stimulation is an attractive, uninvestigated method for treatment of
      intractable epilepsy. Preliminary animal and human data suggest safety and remarkable
      efficacy of Low frequency stimulation (LFS) in epilepsy. In addition, the duty cycle of LFS
      is very low, implying less electric current injection, with less charge density on the target
      tissue and electrodes, and longer battery life. The current project is a classic
      translational, single-blinded, randomized research project, demonstrating a clear path from
      the laboratory to bedside. If successful, this new therapy will be of great value to patients
      with medically and surgically intractable Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (MTLE).

      The study is expected to last approximately 5 years, from enrollment of the first patient to
      completion of the final subject, taking into consideration attrition and otherwise-eligible
      subjects who will not elect to participate. Once the study is completed, and enrolled
      participants have completed all required elements of the protocol, a final report will be
      submitted to the FDA. Participants may also discontinue their participation in the study, if
      they wish, at any time.

    <measure>Psychiatric Health (effects of LFS on psychiatric symptoms using standardized measures that are known to be sensitive to changes to surgical treatment of TLE)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Since LFSF is expected to activate limbic structures, we will assess the effects of LFS on psychiatric symptoms using standardized measures that are known to be sensitive to changes to surgical treatment of TLE</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess if electrode implantation in the fornix is feasible as is done in patients with Parkinson's Disease.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The DBS leads are routinely interested for patients with Parkinson's disease. Thus, we plan to implant Model 3389 DBS leads using the same technique of stereotactic implantation. A secondary aim of this trial is to standardize the implantation, the evoked potential and electric current determination procedures in preparation for a large-scale phase III trial</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect on seizure frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>We expect LFSF to result in seizure reduction based on our preliminary data and a number of studies. For outcome measures, we will use (1) total percentage of seizure frequency change, (2) change in secondarily generalized seizure frequency, (3) change in seizure-free days.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants are between the ages of 18 -65 years of age

          -  Participants must have had a non-invasive video-EEG monitoring revealing seizure
             semiology and ictal EEG consistent with unilateral or bilateral MTLE

          -  Participants must have tried and failed two trials of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)

          -  Participants may have lesional or non lesional hippocampi, as evidenced by brain MRI
             acquired within the previous two years
