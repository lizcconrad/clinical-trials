    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the key symptoms of individuals with systemic
      mastocytosis. Interviews of enrolled individuals will be conducted to learn about the disease
      symptoms and condition. The interview will last approximately 60 minutes and will be
      conducted by a trained interviewer, be audio-recorded (with patient consent), and all
      information provided by the patient will be treated confidentially and made anonymous so that
      it is non-identifiable. The interview may be conducted face-to-face, over the phone, or
      virtually via Skype, a free video conferencing program, depending upon the patient's
      geographic location. Patients will be compensated for their participating time.

      This is not a medication-related study, and no medication will be distributed or tested
      during this study. Participation in this study will not affect any treatment or assistance
      that a patient currently receives or may receive in the future.
