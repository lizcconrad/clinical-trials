          3. Male or female.

          4. 18 years of age or older at the time of signing informed consent.

          5. Platelet count &lt; 50 × 10^9/L at baseline on Day 1 prior to randomization.

          6. Undergoing an elective invasive procedure.

          7. In the opinion of the investigator, able to meet study requirements.

          8. Male patients who are sterile or who agree to use an appropriate method of
             contraception (including use of a condom with spermicide) from Screening to completion

             completion of the Post-treatment Period. Barrier method with or without spermicide,
             double barrier contraception and oral contraceptive pill are insufficient methods on
             their own.

          9. Portal vein thrombosis based on ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI) within 28 days prior to randomization or a history of portal
             vein thrombosis.

         10. Absence of hepatopetal blood flow in the main trunk of the portal vein as demonstrated
             by Doppler ultrasonography within 28 days prior to randomization.

         11. History or evidence of disease associated with a risk of bleeding (e.g., coagulation
             factor deficiency or von Willebrand factor deficiency).

         12. Bleeding score at randomization ≥ Grade 2 according to the World Health Organization
             (WHO) Bleeding Scale.
