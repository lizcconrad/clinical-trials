  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The frequent incidence of postoperative vomiting and severe pain in children undergoing
      adenotonsillectomy, may delay postoperative oral intake and increase the risk of dehydration.
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is of multi-factorial origin in this group of
      patients, with a reported incidence ranging from 23% to 73%.

      There is growing evidence that the perioperative administration of gabapentinin in adults is
      beneficial for preoperative anxiolysis, postoperative analgesia, reduction of postoperative
      nausea and vomiting, and delirium.

      Only few studies in literature explored the analgesic effects of preoperative gabapentin as
      premedication in pediatric population. However, the antiemetic effect of gabapentin in
      pediatric patients was not systematically investigated before.
