    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a psychiatric pathology, which concerns around 1% of adult population. It is
      characterized by clinical symptoms combining positive and negative symptoms and thinking
      disorganization. Schizophrenia is also characterized by cognitive deficits, likely to play an
      important part in adaptation of these patients in their every-day life, and to affect their
      clinical symptomatology. Among them, there are deficits in sustained attention which are
      associated with a difficulty for these patients to maintain efficiently their cognitive
      activity on a source of stimulation or task. This basic attentional process is fundamental
      for the efficiency of the overall of cognitive processes, and so for all behaviors directed
      on an aim. The question of whether or not patients with schizophrenia have difficulty
      sustaining attention is of high relevance, in the sense that it could undermine performance
      on nearly any task and so provide a compelling causal explanation of many other impairments
      observed in these patients. Yet it has not been conclusively answered in over four decades of
      research. Consequently, the main objective of the protocol is to evaluate sustained attention
      abilities in schizophrenic patients and to better understand the specific functioning of
      cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying these abilities (attentional resources and
      cognitive control mechanisms).
