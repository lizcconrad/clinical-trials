      Background:

      - Ebola is a virus that can spread quickly and causes serious disease. It is currently
      causing an outbreak in West Africa. There are no approved treatments for Ebola. ZMappTM is a
      new drug made of natural infection-fighting substances. Researchers want to see if it can
      treat Ebola.

      Objective:

      - To assess the safety of ZMappTM and how the body processes it. To measure the immune system
      response to ZMappTM.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy people 18 50 years old.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine
           tests. They will have an electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure heart electrical activity.
           Small pads will be stuck to the arms, legs, and chest.

        -  Participants will be admitted to the hospital. They will have a physical exam,
           medication review, and blood samples.

        -  Two intravenous (IV) lines will be placed into separate arm veins. A needle will be used
           to guide plastic tubing into the veins. One will be used to take blood samples. The
           other will be used to give the study drug.

        -  Participants will be given drugs to help prevent side effects.

        -  Participants will be given the study drug by IV over 10 12 hours. Participants will be
           monitored closely and vital signs taken frequently. They may have another ECG.

        -  Blood samples will be taken before, during, and after the infusion.

        -  Participants will stay in the hospital 1 or 2 nights after receiving the drug.

        -  Participants will have several study visits over 90 days after getting the study drug.
           They will be asked about side effects. They may have a physical exam, and blood may be
           drawn.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ebola virus (EBOV) is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in patients
      presenting clinical illness. Currently, no agent is approved in the U.S. or elsewhere for the
      therapeutic treatment of EBOV. The current standard of care for EBOV infection is limited to
      supportive treatment.

      ZMapp TM, a combination of three chimeric human/murine monoclonal antibodies against the EBOV
      surface glycoprotein found on virions and infected cells, is being developed as a treatment
      for Ebola virus disease. This is a Phase 1a, open-label study to assess the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of a single intravenous administration of ZMapp tm in healthy adult
      volunteers. Three subjects will receive a single intravenous dose of 50mg/kg infusion and be
      evaluated on study Days 0, 1, 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 60, and 90. Samples will be collected for
      pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity assessments at baseline, during, and following infusion.
      Subjects will be monitored and assessed for safety and the incidence of adverse events over
      the course of the study.

                  postmenopausal or have undergone surgical sterilization) or must, in conjunction
                  with their sexual partner(s), use a highly effective contraceptive (namely, a
