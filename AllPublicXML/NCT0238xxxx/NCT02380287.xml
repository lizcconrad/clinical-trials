      This is an open label, phase 1, &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalating study of tolerability, safety,
      pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of a single subcutaneous injection of the novel
      monoclonal antibody against human IL-17 - BCD-085. The study will enroll 37 healthy male
      volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IL-17 is a new potential therapeutic target which plays important role in pathogenesis of
      several autoimmune disorders including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, possibly - SLE and
      MS. BCD-085 is a novel humanized monoclonal antibody against human IL17 developed by JCS
      BIOCAD (Russia) which is now on the first step of clinical evaluation. BCD-085-1 study is the
      first-in-human clinical trial which is intended to evaluate tolerability, safety,
      pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of BCD-085 when used as a single step-by-step escalating
      subcutaneous dose in healthy male volunteers. During this study it is expected to determine
      diapason of safety doses of BCD-085 (incl. MTD) which thereafter can be evaluated in phase 2
      studies.

          <description>This cohort includes 3 subjects who will receive the single subcutaneous injection of BCD-085 at a dose of 2.25 mg/kg.
If at least 2 subjects are observed to have DLT, this dose level is defined as the MTD (unless only 3 patients have been treated at that level, in which case it is the tentative MTD). If 0 of the 3 subjects are observed to have DLT, the dose level is escalated one step for the next cohort no. 8 of 3 subjects, and the process continues as above. If exactly 1 of the 3 subjects treated show DLT, 3 additional subjects are treated at the current dose level. If none of these additional 3 patients show DLT, the dose level is escalated for the next Cohort no. 8.
