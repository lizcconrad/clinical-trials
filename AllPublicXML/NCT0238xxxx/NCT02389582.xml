  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anticoagulation with heparin is indicated in several situations, such as acute coronary
      disease (in combination with antiplatelet therapy) for the prevention and treatment of venous
      thromboembolism and situations with high risk of thromboembolism. Recently, the latest trials
      on anticoagulation for stroke prevention on atrial fibrillation have shown an increased risk
      for acute mycardial infarction on patients submitted to new oral anticoagulants, such as
      dabigatran. The mechanism is still unclear, however, in this context, some previous studies
      about interaction between anticoagulants ( mainly heparin) and platelet aggregation have
      shown conflicting results: while some suggest an inhibitory effect of heparin on platelet
      function, others suggest that heparin could promote an increase in platelet activation. The
      present study aims to assess the effects of the LMWH Enoxaparin and direct thrombin
      inhibitor, Dabigatran, on platelet aggregation, studied and compared by different methods in
      patients with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD).

      This is a prospective and open study. We will include 29 patients with chronic CAD, stable,
      using ASA. All patients will receive the same medications in effective doses recommended at
      each stage of the study, so that every individual is his self-control, the Enoxaparin will be
      administrated at a dose of 1mg/kg twice a day and Dabigatran at a dose of 150mg twice a day.
      Study Design: Phase 1 : There will be a first collection of blood samples from all patients
      at baseline for laboratory tests, then the patient will receive Dabigatran for 5 days and
      laboratory tests including platelet aggregation will be made, among others. After a 30 days
      washout period, enoxaparin will be administrated for 5 days and in the 6st day, the same
      laboratory tests, including platelet aggregation, will be performed.
