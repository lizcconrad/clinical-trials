    <textblock>
      Asbestos defines a group of naturally occurring mineral silicate fibers which are easily
      inhaled, resulting in a variety of diseases of the respiratory system including lung cancer
      and malignant mesothelioma. Despite some advances in treatment, there has been little impact
      on overall survival for both lung cancer and mesothelioma in the past 20 years in great part
      because patients usually present with disease at an advanced and incurable stage. This study
      aims to develop and implement a low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening approach for
      lung cancer and mesothelioma in asbestos-exposed workers in Alberta.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer mortality above the next three culprits
      combined (breast, colon and prostate cancer). Cigarette smoking is the most important risk
      factor in the development of lung cancer. Another population of particular interest in
      Alberta involves workers with occupational exposure to asbestos as asbestos and tobacco
      exposure results in a synergistic effect on lung cancer risk. Mesothelioma is a rare cancer
      of the lining of the lung with poor prognosis of which 80% of cases are believed to be
      related to asbestos exposure.

      Unfortunately, despite some advances in treatment, there has been little impact on overall
      survival for both lung cancer and mesothelioma in the past 20 years in great part because
      patients usually present with disease at an advanced and incurable stage. Additional
      strategies are desperately needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this
      disease.

      The objectives of this study are to develop and implement a LDCT screening approach for lung
      cancer and mesothelioma in asbestos-exposed workers in Alberta; to determine participants'
      motivation and expectations associated with a screening program, their satisfaction with the
      program, and the psychosocial consequences of the screening program; to determine the
      accuracy of a lung cancer risk prediction model modified to include asbestos exposure; and to
      determine the 3-year clinical incidence of lung cancer in asbestos-exposed individuals
      interested in lung cancer screening but who do not meet minimal risk threshold.

      The investigators will offer a combined lung cancer and mesothelioma screening program for
      200 Alberta asbestos-exposed workers based on low-dose CT scanning.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 50 - 80 years (either gender, any ethnic group)

          -  Documented exposure to asbestos for at least one year, at least 10 years prior to
             study entry

          -  Ability to provide informed consent and participate in study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any medical condition, such as severe heart disease (e.g. unstable angina, chronic
             congestive heart failure), severe lung disease or lung disease requiring supplemental
             oxygen, solid organ transplant, that in the opinion of the physician unlikely to
             benefit from screening due to shortened life-expectancy from the co-morbidities or
             inability to tolerate diagnosis and treatment of a screen detected abnormality

          -  Have been previously diagnosed with lung cancer or mesothelioma

          -  Have had other cancer within the past 5 years with the exception of the following
             cancers: non-melanomatous skin cancer, localized prostate cancer, carcinoma in situ
             (CIS) of the cervix, or superficial bladder cancer. Treatment of the exceptions must
             have ended &gt;6 months before registration into this study

          -  Pregnancy

          -  CT scan of the chest in the past 2 years

          -  Unwilling to have a LDCT of chest
