    <textblock>
      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is reported to occur after major surgery in
      elderly patients. They may especially experience problems in the weeks and months after
      surgery. Recent studies vary greatly in methods of evaluation and diagnosis of POCD, and the
      pathogenic mechanisms are still unclear. The investigators evaluated a large uniform cohort
      of elderly patients in a standardized approach after total knee replacement.
