  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the clinical performance of a novel vitro-ceramic biomaterial
      (Biosilicate®) as treatment of caries-affected dentin in posterior resin restorations. A
      total of 94 restorations of 66 participants were selected and assigned at random into four
      groups: 1 (Biosilicate / Two-step etch and rinse system), 2 (Control / Two-step etch and
      rinse system), 3 (Biosilicate / Two-step self-etching system) and 4 (Control / Two-step
      self-etching system). Two operators carried out the adhesive protocols and restored the
      cavities with a nano-hybrid resin composite (IPS Empress, Ivoclar) using the incremental
      technique. Participants were recalled at one week, 6, 12 and 18 months for clinical
      evaluation performed by two blinders and calibrated examiners according FDI criteria.

      Background: Dental caries has decreased in recent years, but is still the main oral health
      problem in developed and undeveloped industrialized countries. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate clinical performance of resin-based composite Class I and II restorations in
      association with Biosilicate.

      Methods: Eighty patients with carious lesions will be receive restorations in premolars and
      molars, which will be randomly allocated in four experimental groups: G1 (Biosilicate,
      AdperSingle Bond 2 and IPS Empress Direct composite), G2 (Adper Single Bond 2 and IPS Empress
      Direct composite), G3 (Biosilicate, AdheSe and IPS Empress Direct composite) e G4 (AdheSE and
      IPS Empress Direct composite) To participate in the clinical trial, qualified subjects must
      meet for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Sixty-four (64) selected volunteers will be fully
      informed on the nature of the study and after had signed a Term of Acceptance defined by the
      Ethics Committee (FORP - USP), they will be invited to participate.

      Carious teeth will be cleaned with a pumice-water slurry and rubber cup to remove salivary
      pellicle and any bacterial plaque. As much as possible, local anesthesia will be. After
      caries removal (high and low-speed handpieces under abundant water irrigation), patients will
      be allocated randomly in the four experimental groups cited above. Final contouring and
      polishing of the restorations will be performed at the same appointment, using a fine-grit
      diamond bur (KG Sorensen), silicon carbide polisher (Viking Kit, KG Sorensen), silicone
      rubber tips (Viking Kit, KG Sorensen) flexible discs (Sof-Lex, 3M ESPE), and polishing pastes
      (Diamond Excel, FGM).

      Two trained and calibrated evaluators, fully blinded to the restorative techniques used, will
      be evaluating the restorations at baseline (one week after placement of restorations), after
      06, 12 and 18 months using FDI criteria. All restorations will be photographed at every
      evaluation point. Esthetic, Functional and Biological proprieties will be used as key
      parameters determining the overall clinical success. Data will be analyzed.

    <description>Two experienced and calibrated dentists, not involved with the placement of the restorations will be assess the efficiency of Biosilicate under composite restoration of Class I and Class II dentin caries lesions by record instrument to record the esthetic, functional and biological properties over a 18 months time frame. These variables will be ranked according to the FDI criteria in the following scores: clinically very good, clinically good, clinically sufficient/ satisfactory, clinically unsatisfactory and clinically poor.</description>
