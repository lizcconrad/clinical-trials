    <textblock>
      The Motus GI Colon Cleansing device is intended to facilitate intra-procedural cleaning of a
      poorly prepared colon by irrigating the colon and evacuating the irrigation fluid and feces.

      The study aim to evaluate the post Procedure Cleansing Level as Measured by the Boston Bowel
      Preparation Scale (BBPS).

      Each subject was required to follow a bowel preparation regimen including split dose of 2
      tablets of 5mg Bysacodyle followed by a colonoscopy procedure with the tested device.
