  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study's aim is to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of transperineal ultrasound assessment
      compared with speculum examination, nitrazine and placental micro globulin-1 tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women with early and late preterm pregnancies with a complaint of fluid leakage are enrolled
      in the study. Prior to speculum examination, sagittal view of the birth canal and transverse
      view of cervix and fornices are obtained with transperineal technique and images are stored.
      Then speculum examination for pooling, nitrazine test and placental microglobulin-1 tests are
      performed and results are recorded. Ultrasound images are analysed by an observer blind to
      physical examination findings. Hypoechogenic fluid appearance of adequate size around the
      cervix and in the fornices are considered positive. Placental microglobulin-1 test is used as
      reference. Sensitivity and specificity values are calculated for each test.
