  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When completing difficult tasks, the brain requires faster delivery of energy sources (oxygen
      and glucose) via the blood. There is evidence to suggest that some nutritional supplements
      may increase blood circulation in the brain which can result in improved task performance.
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of a multivitamin/mineral preparation
      (containing a range of vitamins and minerals as contained in commonly consumed
      multivitamin/minerals available off the shelf) in healthy females on cerebral (brain) blood
      flow and energy expenditure during cognitive task performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamins, minerals and CoQ10, exert a number of physiological effects directly relevant to
      energy supply and metabolism. Therefore it is hypothesized that the nutritional interventions
      in this trial will facilitate brain metabolic substrate distribution and utilisation during
      demanding brain activities with a potential benefit on task performance. This pilot,
      double-blind, placebo controlled, 3-arm parallel groups trial will utilise two concomitant
      non-invasive techniques:

        -  Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and

        -  Indirect Calorimetry (ICa). The NIRS will be utilised to measure the rate of delivery of
           metabolic substrates (via cerebral blood flow i.e. concentrations of total-haemoglobin)
           and oxygen extraction from the blood (concentration of deoxy-haemoglobin) in the frontal
           cortex of the brain during cognitive tasks.

      The ICa calculated from exhaled gas analysis will be utilised to quantify the overall
      'energy' costs of performance of tasks in terms of oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide production,
      energy expenditure, and substrate (fat and carbohydrate) metabolism.

      Cognitive tasks of differing levels of difficulty will be utilised with the hypothesis that
      energy expenditure parameters and blood flow/oxygen extraction will increase with rising task
      demands, and that any treatment related effect will be more evident under conditions of
      increased neural activity. The effects on the above mentioned parameters of two
      multivitamin/multimineral preparations (MMP) will be compared to placebo subsequent to single
      dose administration (acute) and following daily administration over an eight week period
      (chronic). The nutritional interventions are expected to improve nutritional status and
      thereby facilitate energy supply and metabolism and to have positive impact on the study
      parameters. The effects of the nutritional interventions on nutritional status will be
      evaluated by measuring the plasma/serum concentrations of a selected subset of analytes. It
      is hypothesized that the nutritional status at baseline and after eight week supplementation
      period will have an impact on metabolic substrate conversion, oxygen utilisation, cerebral
      blood flow and cognitive performance.

             routine medications to treat benign conditions, such as antibiotics to treat acne).

          -  Habitual intake of MMP and dietary supplements within the last 4 weeks (defined as ≥3
             consecutive days or ≥4 days in total per week).

          -  Current or history of drug or alcohol abuse in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Current pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to screening.

          -  Any condition which may interfere with the subject's ability to perform assessments
             (i.e. colour blindness).
