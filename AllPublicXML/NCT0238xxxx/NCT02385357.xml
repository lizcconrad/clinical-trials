  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no conclusive evidence about the effect of intake of protein-enriched drink after
      and acute high intensity exercise bout on muscle function and damage. The investigators aimed
      to study the effect of a protein-enriched drink on muscle function recovery following an
      acute high intensity exercise bout. The present counterbalanced, crossover, and double blind
      study will involve a total of 12 active men.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will run downhill (-10%) during 30 min at a intensity equivalent to 75-80% of
      their maximum heart rate (previously determined). After the exercise bout, participants will
      have either the placebo or the experimental drink. The investigators will measure muscle
      function and damage-related parameters right after the exercise as well as the three
      following days. This protocol will be repeated after a wash out period of 3 weeks, where the
      participants will have the other drink. The investigators will control exercise and diet
      three weeks before study entry, during the experimental week as the investigators as during
      the wash out period.
