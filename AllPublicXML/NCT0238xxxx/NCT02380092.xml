    <textblock>
      LEGION™ Primary Total Knee System is CE-marked and marketed in all study regions. This study
      serves as post-market surveillance for LEGION™ Primary Total Knee System with the VERILAST™
      bearing surface (OXINIUM™ femoral component with highly cross-linked polyethylene tibial
      insert).

      All study subjects will receive a LEGION™ Primary Total Knee System with VERILAST™ bearing
      surface and the results will be analysed against historical data from patients who received a
      Genesis II knee replacement.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LEGION™ Primary Total Knee System (TKS) is a comprehensive, state-of-the-art system that
      empowers surgeons to address diverse surgical challenges and provide personalized joint care.
      The LEGION™ Primary TKS implant designs were built on the legacy of the GENESIS™ II TKS. For
      more than 15 years and in more than 30 countries, the GENESIS™ II TKS has achieved
      outstanding clinical outcomes.

      As CE-mark and 510k approval for the LEGION™ Primary TKS has been obtained, it is being used
      in clinical practice in several countries including Europe and the US but clinical studies
      need to be carried out in order to confirm its safety and efficacy and in order to conform to
      the medical device directives (MEDDEV. 2.7.1 Rev.3).

      This study is therefore a post-market study to evaluate the short-, mid- and long-term safety
      and effectiveness of the LEGION™ Primary TKS with VERILAST™ bearing surface (the combination
      of an OXINIUM™ femoral component with highly cross-linked polyethylene tibial base plate
      inserts). The clinical outcome from a large cohort of subjects who are treated with the
      LEGION™ Primary TKS as part of their standard of care will be documented. The study is
      designed to reflect standard clinical practice as closely as possible because it allows the
      results of such a study to represent the true clinical outcome that would be achieved in
      clinical practice, up to a maximum. Only subjects who will be treated with the LEGION™
      Primary TKS as part of their normally planned care will screened for participation in this
      study.
