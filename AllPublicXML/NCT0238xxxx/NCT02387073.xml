  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently the importance of electrical PRO system is increased for the accuracy, convenience,
      and efficiency for both patients and physicians. For the evaluation of quality of life,
      various self-reported questionnaires is filled-out by the patient, mostly in front of
      outpatient clinic, and doctor usually take times to calculate the score. If there is
      electrical PRO which is available with mobile device, the efficacy of clinic would be
      improved. The investigators developed such a system and applied the system for patients with
      spinal disease. The investigators assessed the effectiveness of application of electrical-PRO
      in outpatients' clinic for patients who had filled-up same questionnaire in paper version.
