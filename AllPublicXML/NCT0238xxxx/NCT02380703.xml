  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether a home-based targeted education and skill training
      (Aggression Prevention Training or APT) will reduce aggression in persons with dementia (PWD)
      and pain/pain-related features more than usual care plus supportive telephone calls. Half of
      the participants will receive APT and half will receive supportive telephone calls.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eighty percent of PWD have behavioral or psychological disturbances, including 40% that are
      aggressive behaviors. The prevalence of pain in PWD is about 60%, and it is a strong
      predictor of aggression. The biopsychosocial model of pain posits that pain is
      bidirectionally related to psychological factors (ie, depression) and social support factors
      (ie, quality of caregiver/PWD relationship) in addition to biological factors. Thus,
      depression and quality of the caregiver/PWD relationship can be seen as pain-related
      features. Caregivers are ideally suited to help address pain, depression, and the
      caregiver/PWD relationship, thus preventing the development of aggression; but they need
      tools to assist them in identifying and managing these symptoms.

      Prior studies of aggression treatment have not examined using a preventive strategy to
      decrease incidence of aggression in persons with dementia (PWD). Almost all studies have
      examined use of pharmacologic interventions following development of aggression.This 5-year
      randomized controlled trial based on the Unmet Needs Model will focus on preventing
      aggression in PWD with pain and pain-related features by providing the caregiver with
      targeted education and skill training. PWD and their caregivers will be randomized to APT or
      to an enhanced usual primary care condition (EU-PC). APT will use active learning tools,
      including didactics, role-playing, and multimedia (eg, books and DVDs) to educate and provide
      skill training for the caregiver. The 6-8 modules in the intervention will include 4 core
      modules that address 4 main aggression risk factors: a) recognizing pain, b) treating pain,
      c) increasing pleasant activities, and d) improving patient-caregiver communication.
      Caregivers can select 2 to 3 additional elective sessions; elective selection is guided by
      the needs of the dyad to further enhance skills related to these core topics. EU-PC provides
      the patient and caregiver educational materials on pain, notifies the primary care provider
      of the PWD's level of pain and depression, and provides 8 weekly supportive telephone calls
      to caregivers. PWD and caregiver outcomes will be collected at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months.

      Data analysis will include both univariate descriptive statistics and inferential statistics,
      including regression models, repeated measure modeling and Cox proportional hazards models.

    <measure>Incidence of aggression (Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory, Aggression Subscale)</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Aggression is measured on a 7-point Likert scale for frequency and a 5-point Likert scale for disruptiveness. Aggression is considered present if a participant scores over one on both frequency (more than never) and disruptiveness (at least a little) on any of 13 aggressive behaviors, including spitting, verbal aggression, hitting, kicking, grabbing, pushing, throwing, biting, scratching, hurting self/others, destroying property, or making inappropriate verbal or physical sexual advances.</description>

    <measure>Nursing Home Placement</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Nursing Home Placement is defined as a change in residence from the community to a Personal Care Home, Assisted Living Facility, Skilled or Non-skilled Nursing Facility, or other Residential Care Facility.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Burden--Zarit Burden Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>The Zarit Burden Interview is a 22-item instrument measuring perceived impact of caregiving on the caregiver's financial status, physical status, physical health, emotional health, and social activities. Questions are answered on a 5-point Likert-type scale (0=never, 4=nearly always). The total scale score ranges from 0-88.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive Caregiving Attributes--Positive Aspects of Caregiving Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>The 9-item Positive Aspects of Caregiving Scale presents statements about a caregiver's mental or affective state in the context of the caregiving experience. Responses are provided on a 5-point agree/disagree scale and designed to assess perception of benefits within the caregiving context, such as feeling useful, feeling appreciated, and finding meaning. Higher scores (range 9-45) represent more positive appraisals.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavior Problems--Revised Memory and Behavior Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Revised Memory and Behavior Checklist (RMBCL) is a 24-item informant-based measure of observable behavior problems in PWD, including memory-related, disruptive, and depressive behaviors. Scores are computed for the presence/absence of each problem first and then for caregiver &quot;reaction&quot; or the extent to which caregivers were bothered or distressed by each behavior (0-4). Total score is the sum of reaction scores for all endorsed behaviors. Possible range is 0-96.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain--Philadelphia Geriatric Pain Intensity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>The Philadelphia Geriatric Pain Intensity Scale will be administered to the PWD and caregiver to measure pain. It consists of 4 items assessing the extent to which the PWD has been bothered by pain over the past several weeks, at present, when pain was at its worst, and when pain was at its least. These items are rated on a 1- to 5-point Likert scale (not at all to extremely). A fifth item asks for number of days per week that pain was really bad, and a sixth asks for a rating of how much pain has interfered with day-to-day activities.PWD are known to under-report clinically significant conditions, including pain, compared with proxies. Therefore, we will code the higher score of the PWD and caregiver at each assessment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression--Geriatric Depression Screen (GDS), Caregiver Version</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>The 30-item GDS will be administered to the caregiver to measure depression. Items are answered with Yes/No. Total score ranges from 0-30. A score of 11 or greater is a possible indicator of depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver-Patient Relationship Quality--Mutuality Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>The Mutuality Scale and is a 15-item instrument measuring the positive quality of the relationship between caregiver and care receiver. Questions are answered by the caregiver on a 5-point Likert-type scale (0=never, 4=a great deal). Its 4 subscales represent domains of shared values, affective closeness, shared pleasurable activities and reciprocity. The total score ranges from 0-4 and is the sum of individual items divided by the number of items answered. High scores indicate a relationship characterized by communication, shared pleasurable activities, common values, and reciprocity.</description>

    <ipd_description>The information generated in this proposal aims to prevent the development of aggression in persons with dementia. Clinician and participant manuals are developed for the intervention and will be widely shared through abstracts, presentation, publication and personal communication if the intervention is efficacious. In addition, if the intervention is found to be evidence-based, we will pursue placement on the websites of:
1) Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Registry for Evidence-based Programs and 2) Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregiving (RCI) Caregiver Intervention Database. Information about the study will also be available to interested investigators through NIH CRISP, and the Baylor College of Medicine Section of Health Services Research website. Requests to use the information will be considered on a case-by-case basis, following written request to the principal investigator.</ipd_description>
