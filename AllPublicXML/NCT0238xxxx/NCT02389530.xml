  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluorescein is a dye agent that can be injected through an intravenous line. It has been
      shown to help tell the difference between brain tumor tissue and normal brain tissue when it
      is used together with a specialized filter on a microscope in the operating room. The
      investigators plan to study the use of fluorescein in the removal of brain tumors at a low
      dose.
