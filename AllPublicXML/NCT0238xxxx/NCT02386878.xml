    <textblock>
      The PHE study is a two-year longitudinal study evaluating two interventions for reducing
      depression and HIV risk behaviors among highly vulnerable adolescents in the Eastern Cape of
      South Africa. Research suggests that children affected by AIDS are at heightened risk of HIV
      infection relative to their peers; however, evidence on how best to address HIV prevention
      and psychological health among this population is lacking. This study examines the efficacy
      of both a psychological and behavioral intervention, alone and in combination, on related
      outcomes among vulnerable youth age 14-17. A mixed methods approach is applied, including a
      community-randomized controlled trial with a factorial design, a cost-effectiveness analysis,
      and a qualitative component. At baseline data collection in January 2012, more than 1000
      adolescents and their caregivers were interviewed; these participants were invited to take
      part in two more survey rounds designed to examine both the immediate and long term effects
      of the interventions. Support for this research was provided by USAID under Grant No.
      GHH-I-00-007-00069-00.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will apply a mixed-methods approach involving two primary components: 1) an impact
      evaluation using a community-randomized controlled trial (CRCT); and 2) a detailed analysis
      of intervention costs, linked to the impact evaluation to determine the cost-effectiveness of
      these interventions.

      For the CRCT, sixty World Vision drop-in centers which deliver standard care were randomly
      assigned to one of four study conditions: IPTG, Vhutshilo, IPTG+Vhutshilo, and control.
      Approximately 1600 adolescent OVC aged 14-17 years (current beneficiaries at the drop-in
      centers) and their caregivers were eligible to participate in the study at baseline.

      Participants were visited three times including the baseline survey. Follow-up data
      collection was conducted in two rounds. The first round took place 8 months after the
      baseline survey and immediately following intervention exposure. A second follow-up round
      took place a year later, allowing assessment of both the immediate and longer-term impact of
      the interventions.

      Participants were interviewed at home in Xhosa or Sesotho. Caregivers in the sample completed
      face-to-face interviews with trained interviewers, while adolescents complete surveys used a
      mix of face-to-face interviewing and audio computer-assisted self-interview technology
      (ACASI).

    <measure>Change in HIV knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 0 months post-intervention, 12 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Adolescent self-report of basic HIV knowledge: 9 items were used to measure general HIV transmission, testing and treatment knowledge. Respondents were asked to agree or disagree with each item. They could also respond with 'don't know'. The first item (testing for HIV) came from the UNDP/UNFPA/WHO/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP)'s Asking Young People about Sexual And Reproductive Health (HIV testing). Four items, including transmission by mosquitoes, sharing food, witchcraft, and healthy-looking person with HIV, were from the South African Demographic and Health Survey. Two items were pulled from a previous evaluation of Vhutshilo 2 in South Africa (perinatal transmission, sex with a virgin). Two questions were self-generated to gather knowledge of drug treatment availability and exact location of VCT site.</description>

    <measure>Change in Condom Knowledge and Attitudes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 0 months post-intervention, 12 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Adolescent self-report of three items assessing condom knowledge and three items assessing condom attitudes. Respondents indicated agree, disagree or don't know for each item. The South Africa DHS provided two condom knowledge items, whether the male condom provides protection from HIV and whether condoms can be washed and reused. The third knowledge item, whether condoms can be used with Vaseline, came from the South Africa and Tanzania project (SATZ) questionnaire. The SATZ questionnaire also provided one of the three items to measure attitudes toward condom use, which is particularly useful for its gendered perspective; the question asks whether it is okay for a girl to suggest condom use to a sexual partner. The other two items assessing attitudes, including embarrassment and trust, are from the Stepping Stone Study men's questionnaire.</description>

Participants were asked &quot;what are the chances that you will…&quot; fulfill each of six items (marriage, children, secondary school, long life, manage difficulties, job) on a 4-point Likert scale (very low to very high). The items were based on two scales; one is a self-generated scale used in a previous study of OVC in South Africa by the authors and the other is an adapted subscale of the Social and Health Assessment (SAHA) previously used among South African adolescents.</description>

    <description>Interpersonal psychotherapy is a theory- and evidence-based treatment approach for depression developed by clinicians. World Vision has helped to pioneer the use of this model in sub-Saharan Africa including adapting the model for use with OVC within South Africa. Sessions are designed to provide participants with opportunities to learn and practice interpersonal skills for solving problems that bring about depression, and to facilitate the provision of emotional support between members of the group. Groups are implemented by a trained adult facilitator from the community who helps participants to identify people who are important in their lives, understand links between their psychological state and current problems, and practice new ways of problem-solving.</description>

    <description>The Vhutshilo 2 model was developed in 2008 by the Centre for the Support of Peer Education (CSPE), a branch of the South African non-profit organization Health and Education Training and Technical Assistance Services. The Vhutshilo program was designed specifically for adolescent OVC in South Africa, and attends to risk factors and pathways considered particularly relevant for this population. Topics include finding and giving emotional support; dealing with grief and loss; alcohol and substance abuse; crime and sexual violence; HIV/AIDS; healthy and safe sexual relationships; and transactional sex. In addition to its knowledge component, the program places heavy emphasis on building relevant skills and efficacy.</description>
