      The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of high density formula in early
      postoperative infants with congenital heart disease and to assess its safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of infants born with CHD increases every year and most CHD infants are suffered
      with malnutrition.Recent studies have shown that increasing energy intake in CHD infants can
      improve their nutrition status.But there are no high qualified evidences supporting that high
      density formula can promote infants' nutrition status and ensure its safety. The hypothesis
      of the current study is that high density formula intake can increase infants'weight and it's
      safe.

      The current study adopts randomized,controlled intervention trial, gives high density
      formula(Infatrini,100kcal/100ml)to CHD infants in intervention group and normal density
      formula（Neocate,67kcal/100ml）in control group. Intervention begins when infants start enteral
      nutrition after operation and continues for 7days.
