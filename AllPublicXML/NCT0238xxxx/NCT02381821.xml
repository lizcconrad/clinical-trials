      100 patients aged 21-40 years old, diagnosed as primary or secondary infertility These
      patients are then assigned to receive ICSI treatment (ovulation induction, . They undergo a
      3D vaginal ultrasound before treatment to measure the junctional zone thickness and followed
      up after treatment to determine the rate of implantation.

      Intervention(s) All patients will undergo 3D ultrasound to measure the thickness of the
      junctional zone at day 21 of the cycle.

      100 patients aged 21-40 years old, diagnosed as primary or secondary infertility due to the
      following causes of infertility; ( Pelvic Inflammatory disease, dysovulation , tubal
      infertility, unexplained infertility, combined infertility or due to male factor ). These
      patients are then assigned to receive fertility treatment (ICSI) They undergo a 3D vaginal
      ultrasound before treatment to measure the junctional zone thickness and followed up after
      treatment to determine the rate of implantation.

      Intervention(s) All patients will undergo 3D ultrasound to measure the thickness of the

    <description>Endometrial thickness was measured in the longitudinal plane at the widest anteroposterior diameter with a trans-vaginal 2D ultrasound, and then 3D mode was then activated with power Doppler setting for this study standardized using a frequency at 4-9 MHZ pulse repetition frequency at 0.5KHz gain at-3.0 and wall motion filter at 1. The sub-endometrial region was considered to be within 3 mm of the originally defined myometrial-endometrial contour. The endometrial volume (EV) and 3D power Doppler indices below the endometrium were measured using the automated VOCALâ„¢ for the 3D power Doppler histogram analysis</description>

    <description>All women received daily subcutaneous 0.1 mg triptorelin injection started from day 21) of the cycle preceding stimulation. Downregulation of the pituitary gonadotropins was confirmed after 12 days , gonadotropin (Gn) induction was started using Human menopausal gonadotropins for ovarian stimulation. The starting dose was 225 to 300 IU . Ultrasound Folliculometry was done every other day . When two or more follicles reached a minimum mean diameter of 18 mm, triggering of ovulation trigger was done using Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 10,000 IU and ovum pick up was scheduled 36 hours later</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A normal transvaginal ultrasound is defined as having no visible intracavitary
             pathology (e.g. submucous myomas, polyps or septa) and was be performed in the
             follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Intramural myomas without impression or
             deformation of the uterine cavity were incorporated in the definition of a normal
             ultrasound

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria included Females aged above 40 years old , patients with
             endometriosis, abnormal endocrine functions as Diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorders
             and adrenal abnormalities ,general diseases, those with ovarian cysts or have
