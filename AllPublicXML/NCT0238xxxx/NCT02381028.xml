    <textblock>
      The aim of this small pilot study is to assess the potential effects and risks of applying
      fresh human milk locally on eczema spots in children with atopic eczema. This is a split
      body, controlled, randomized and physician blinded pilot study, of children with atopic
      eczema with two similar contralateral eczema spots having a mother breastfeeding the child or
      a sibling. Fresh expressed milk and emollient is to be applied on the intervention spot and
      emollient alone on the control area, three times a day for four weeks. Severity and area of
      the eczema spots is evaluated weekly, and samples from milk and the spots were analysed
      weekly with respect to bacterial colonisation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with atopic eczema according to Hanifin and Rajkas criteria with a mother
             breastfeeding the child or a sibling.

          -  The eczema spots in the treatment and control areas were to be similar in features and
             extent as well as being localized on contralateral parts of the body.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children were excluded if the severity of the eczema spots indicated need for
             treatment with antibiotics and/or steroids.
