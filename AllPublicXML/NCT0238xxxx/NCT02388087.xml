      The purpose of the study is to investigate the efficacy of the ROX coupler in treating
      patients with tilt test proven Neurally mediated syncope.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurally mediated syncope (NMS) is a debilitating condition, with no proven therapeutic
      measures. The ROX coupler is a device used to create an Iliac arterio-venous anastamosis
      which allows a shunt of 0.8 litres per minute. The haemodynamic changes following creation of
      an arterio-venous anastomosis at the iliac level leads to an increase in cardiac preload,
      reversing finding thought to induce NMS.

      This a randomised controlled study to evaluate the effect of Iliac arterio-venous anastamosis
      in patients with neurally mediated syncope. The Head up tilt test is used as an objective
      measure to evaluate the effect of the arterio-venous anastamosis in patients with NMS.
      Participants with tilt test proven NMS will be eligible for the study ( if they satisfy all
      other eligibility criteria). Participants will be randomised to ROX coupler intervention or
      standard therapy. The primary outcome measure will be absence of loss consciousness on tilt
      table testing at 3 months post intervention.
