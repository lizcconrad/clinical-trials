  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial exploring the
      efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban as compared to acetylsalicylic acid in reducing stroke,
      transient ischemic attack (TIA) and neurocognitive decline, in subjects with non-valvular AF
      and with low risk of stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who qualify will be approached and those consenting will be enrolled to undergo a
      baseline evaluation including the modified mini mental state test (3MS). Subjects without a
      clinical diagnosis of dementia and with a Mini Mental State Examination score (MMSE) score ≥
      25 will undergo neurocognitive assessment (MoCA), psychosocial and QoL assessment before
      randomization.

      During the follow-up period or double-blind treatment period (between a minimum of 3 and 6.5
      years depending on the length of the recruitment), subjects will receive study medications as
      fixed doses. During the follow-up period, subjects will visit the clinic every 6 months up to
      a maximum of 78 months. Subjects will take either rivaroxaban 15 mg with matching
      acetylsalicylic acid - placebo or acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg with matching
      rivaroxaban-placebo orally, once daily, preferably at the same time of the day throughout the
      study.

      An independent clinical event committee will classify all endpoint events. An independent
      Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) was established to monitor the progress of the study
      and assure the safety of subjects enrolled in the trial.
