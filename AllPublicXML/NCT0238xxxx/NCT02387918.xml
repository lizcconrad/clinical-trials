  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures in children. It
      remains associated with a high morbidity related to postoperative vomiting (POV), pain, risk
      of bleeding, and dehydration due to impaired oral intake. Current medications for POV have
      limited efficacy and may even be associated with potential side-effects. Non-pharmacological
      techniques such as acupuncture has been investigated as alternatives to antiemetics and as
      additional treatment modalities for POV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative vomiting (POV) is one of the most common complication in children undergoing
      tonsillectomy. Its incidence is between 62% and 73% when no prophylactic antiemetic is given.
      Because of Limited efficacy and side effects with antiemetics, many alternative treatment had
      been used. Acupuncture is simple, inexpensive, and noninvasive with minimal side effects. The
      objective of this study is to compare two prophylactic antiemetic treatments :

        -  Dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg) immediately after induction of anaesthesia

        -  Acupuncture treatment (immediately after induction of anaesthesia and for approximately
           20 minutes)
