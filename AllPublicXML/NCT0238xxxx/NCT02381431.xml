  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if thermal images can be used instead of a chest x-ray to
      diagnose bacterial pneumonia in children with signs and symptoms of pneumonia in Nagpur,
      India. More specifically, the objectives of the study are: 1) to determine if thermal
      imaging, using a commercial thermal camera can accurately detect the presence of bacterial
      pneumonia in children receiving a chest x-ray to rule out pneumonia; 2) to evaluate the use
      of thermal imaging to monitor the course and resolution of pneumonia in children diagnosed
      with pneumonia; and 3) to determine if thermal imaging can accurately diagnose sites of
      infection that are suspected to be related to the pneumonia.
