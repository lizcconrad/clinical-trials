  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a clinical syndrome presented with central, cardiac
      deterioration as well as peripheral vascular and muscular abnormalities, resulting finally to
      reduced exercise tolerance, quality of life and mortality rates. Exercise training is a major
      component of rehabilitation / secondary prevention interventions, inducing significant
      beneficial changes in mechanisms of pathophysiology, exercise tolerance, functional capacity
      and quality of life, while a positive impact on hospitalization and mortality reduction
      should not be also excluded. There has been growing interest in the characteristics and
      modalities of exercise training able to induce optimal benefits. High intensity and interval
      mode have been shown to induce greater benefits than moderate intensity and continuous mode
      regimes. Additionally, there has been sound rationale for the inclusion of strength training,
      which has been also shown able to yield benefits in terms of exercise capacity and quality of
      life. However, there haven't been much data on the so called combined regimes, which include
      both aerobic exercise and strength training. This study aims at investigating the effects of
      combined high-intensity interval and strength training compared to high-intensity interval
      exercise alone in CHF.
