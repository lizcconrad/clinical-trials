The measurement of the size of pressure ulcer
Medical examination;the degree of recovery of pressure ulcer
Remote physician monitoring
- The patient data was transmitted from the smart-phone to the website via open application programming interface (API)

    <description>The data such as photographs can be collected simply using built-in cameras installed in smart-phones that used the standard touch-screen user interface (UI) and camera installed in the iPhone3GS and iPhone4 using iOS 3.0 and iOS 5.0, respectively. Subjects were instructed to transmit the photographs of the wounds then investigator performed the photography in such a manner that the size of pressure ulcer should be automatically measured based on a 1 cm x 1 cm-sized indicator on the screen.</description>
