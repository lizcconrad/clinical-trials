      The present study is designed to investigate the effectiveness of AV gel local drug delivery
      as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of subjects with chronic
      periodontitis (CP) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).

      BACKGROUND: Advances in the field of alternative medicine have promoted widespread use of
      herbal agents, like Aloe vera (AV), for both medical and dental therapy. AV has
      anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, hypoglycaemic, healing promoting and immune
      boosting properties. The present study is designed to investigate the effectiveness of AV gel
      local drug delivery as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of
      subjects with chronic periodontitis (CP) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).

      MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 60 subjects with probing depth (PD) ≥5mm and clinical
      attachment level (CAL) ≥3mm were randomly divided into two groups. Group 1 was treated with
      SRP + placebo gel local drug delivery (LDD) and Group 2 with SRP + AV gel LDD. Clinical
      parameters including full mouth plaque index (PI), modiﬁed sulcus bleeding index (mSBI),
      probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) were recorded first at baseline and
      then at intervals of 3 months and 6 months.
