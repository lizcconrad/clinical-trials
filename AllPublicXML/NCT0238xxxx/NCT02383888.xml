  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of BI 425809 tablets in healthy
      Chinese and Japanese male subjects following the administration of single rising oral doses
      and further to explore the pharmacokinetics (PK) including dose proportionality of BI 425809
