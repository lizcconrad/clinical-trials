      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of a repeat injection of Cingal® in
      subjects with Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee who participated in Cingal 13-01. This will be
      done through examination of the incidence of adverse events and physical examination of the
      knee.

      The Cingal 13-02 study is a follow-on study to the recently completed clinical trial Cingal
      13-01. Cingal 13-01 was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, Phase III study that
      enrolled 368 subjects at up to 30 sites in Canada and Europe. The Cingal 13-01 study
      objective was to assess the safety and effectiveness of a single injection of Cingal® for
      relief of joint pain and symptoms in patients with OA of the knee. The study had three arms:
      the Cingal® investigational arm, an active comparator arm (Monovisc®) and a control arm
      (saline). Cingal 13-02 is designed to evaluate the safety of an open-label injection of
      Cingal® in subjects who received a study injection in the Cingal 13-01 trial.

          4. Subject is willing to use only acetaminophen/paracetamol (up to a maximum of 4.0 grams
             per day per the package insert) for the treatment of joint pain for the duration of
             the study. At least twenty-four hours prior to the injection and each follow-up visit,
             the subject is willing to discontinue use of acetaminophen/paracetamol
