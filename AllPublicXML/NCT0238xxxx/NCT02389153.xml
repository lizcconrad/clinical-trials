      The main focus of the pilot study is to evaluate the feasability and effectiveness of a
      collaborative care intervention for patients suffering from a coronary heart disease (CHD)
      with insufficient controlled health related risk factors in their lifestyle. The design of
      the study is a wait list control design. 30 patients will receive treatment immediately after
      submission, the other 30 after 6 months. An interdisciplinary team, including a care manager
      for each patient, will offer an individualized treatment plan, based on shared decision
      making for each patient to reduce risk factors and improve quality of life.

      The following assumptions will be evaluated:

        1. The collaborative care concept is feasable in the context of the german health care
           system and leads to greater patient satisfaction

        2. The team-based intervention leads to a decrease of cardiovascular risk factors of
           patients in the intervention group compared to participants in the waitlist condition

        3. The collaborative care intervention leads to an improvement of quality of life as well
           as mental well being of participants in the intervention group compared to participants
           of the waitlist condition
