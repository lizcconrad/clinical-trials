      Reversal of the Anti-platelet Effects of Ticagrelor: REVERSAL study

      The fatality of stent thrombosis (ST) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD)
      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is approximately 50% and clopidogrel is
      an important anti-platelet drug for prevention of ST. CAD patients implanted with stent
      including bare metal stent (BMS) and drug eluting stent (DES) are recommended to receive dual
      anti-platelet treatment (DAPT), i.e. clopidogrel along with aspirin, for at least one year to
      reduce the incidence of ST by up-to-date guidelines. However, due to the variability of
      anti-platelet effect of clopidogrel, regular dose (75 mg daily) of clopidogrel administered
      cannot achieve enough inhibition of platelet aggregation in 20-30% of total patients, which
      is named as clopidogrel low responsiveness (CLR), and the morbidity of thrombosis (including)
      in CAD patients is still 10%.

      Ticagrelor, a cyclopentyl-triazolo-pyrimidine, is a more potent adenosine diphosphate (ADP)
      receptor antagonist with faster onset and more significantly higher inhibition of platelet
      aggregation compared with clopidogrel and directly acts on P2Y12-ADP receptor in platelets
      without process of hepatic metabolism. In the PLATO study, ticagrelor plus reduced the
      remarkable incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
      without significant higher incidence of major bleeding events compared with clopidogrel plus
      aspirin. Surprisingly, the incidence of death due to cardiovascular causes and the total
      fatality was decreased in patients with ticagrelor plus aspirin compared with those with
      clopidogrel plus aspirin. The results suggested the more benefit brought by ticagrelor,
      highlighting the wide use of it in the future.

      Due to the potent anti-platelet effect of ticagrelor, more bleeding events may occur.
      Additionally, when facing the need for cardiac or non-cardiac operation, occurrence of
      life-threatening bleeding event or necessity of emergency operation, doctors may be confused
      of the treatment for the patients taking ticagrelor, of which the half-life period is 8-9
      hours and it suggests the importance of studying the reversal of the anti-platelet effects of
      ticagrelor.

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the proportion of untreated donor
      platelets required to fully reverse the platelet inhibitory effects of aspirin and ticagrelor
      in healthy persons and patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) and receiving ticagrelor.

      Venous blood samples are collected by venipuncture into two 4.5-mL draw BD vacutainer tubes
      containing 0.105M buffered sodium citrate (3.2%) at 08.00 hours in the morning before taking
      the agent and after the last dose of the study drug. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from subjects
      in A group is mixed with increasing proportions of that in C group, with one untreated
      subject serving as the control for one treated subject. The proportion of control platelets
      mixed with inhibited platelets is calculated based on platelet numbers, starting at 10% and
      increasing by 10% increments. So as the PRP in B group.

      Sample test for fresh platelet saved in blood bank

      Function of platelet aggregation, platelet count, pH value and metabolic products (including
      PO2, PCO2, blood glucose, lactate, bicarbonate, sodium, potassium and chloride) are measured
      in fresh platelet sample preserved in blood bank for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 days respectively.

      the medicine. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from participants is mixed with increasing
      proportions of that extracted from fresh platelet sample reserved in blood bank for one day
      as the control for each treated subject. The proportion of control platelets mixed with
      inhibited platelets is calculated based on platelet numbers, starting at 10% and increasing
      by 10% increments. So as the PRP mixed with fresh platelet sample preserved for four days.
