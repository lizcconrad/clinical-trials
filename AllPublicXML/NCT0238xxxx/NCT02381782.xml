  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last few years, there has been a considerable interest in the development of
      screening tools to assess the capability of elderly cancer patients to tolerate anti-cancer
      treatment. Therefore, the NCCN Guidelines in Senior Adult Oncology recommend an assessment of
      co-morbid conditions that are likely to interfere with cancer treatment and tolerability. As
      presbyacusis is common in an older population, elderly cancer patients are at high risk for
      social isolation and a reduced quality of life. Therefore, in this project the investigators
      aim to validatie uHear™ as a quick and reliable screening tool to screen for presbyacusisf in
      routine clinical oncology practice.
