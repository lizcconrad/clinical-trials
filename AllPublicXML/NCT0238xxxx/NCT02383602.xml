      HIV counseling and testing, risk reduction counseling, provision of condoms and lubricants
      Same-day result HIV testing along with pre-test and post-test counseling, including risk
      reduction counseling, will be provided according to the standard practice at each study site
      at enrollment and every 6 months in HIV-negative participants. HIV-negative participants can
      also access non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis service and symptomatic STD service if
      these are available at study sites. HIV-positive participants will also receive risk
      reduction counseling every 3 months. Condoms and lubricants will be provided free of charge.

      This study is a prospective observational cohort study that will enroll up to 6,000 Thai MSM
      and TG from drop-in centers in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Chonburi and Songkhla. Each participant
      will have HIV testing at baseline and will be followed up for 18 months.

      HIV-negative participants will be asked to have HIV re-testing every 6 months. HIV-positive
      participants will have POC CD4 testing and ART initiation regardless of CD4 count will be
      offered. Those who accept ART will be followed up at week 2, week 4, month 2, month 3 and
      every 3 months thereafter. Those who deny ART will be followed up every 3 months.

      Uptake of HIV re-testing will be determined. Access to POC CD4 testing and acceptability of
      ART initiated at HIV diagnosis regardless of CD4 count along with ART adherence will also be
      determined.
