    <textblock>
      This proposal seeks to assess the impact of 24 weeks of metformin on non-calcified plaques
      and calcified plaques assessed by coronary CT angiography, and on whether these changes can
      be explained by metformin-induced phenotypic and secretory changes of monocytes.
