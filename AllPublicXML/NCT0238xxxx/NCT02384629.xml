    <description>The AXXESS stent (Biosensors Europe SA, Morges, Switzerland) is a dedicated self-expanding bifurcation stent eluting the sirolimus analog Biolimus A9 emulsed in a biodegradable polymer. It has the advantage to preserve the ostium of both distal branches and allows additional stent implantation in the distal branches for complete lesion coverage, while reducing large stent overlap and eliminating deformation. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), has enabled the evaluation of strut coverage and arterial healing after DES implantation with a superior resolution and delineation over other imaging modalities. With using these superiorities of OCT, there have been many studies assessing the neointimal coverage following various types of DES implantation in various periods.</description>

    <description>BioMatrix Flex is abluminal biodegradable polymer DES. Its abluminal coating is absorbed after 6 to 9months and turns the DES into a BMS. It combines the proven safety of a DES with an abluminal biodegradable polymer, the prove efficacy of BA9 and an advanced stent design.
