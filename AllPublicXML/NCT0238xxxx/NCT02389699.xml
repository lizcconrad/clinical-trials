    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Giving radiation during
      surgery followed by external-beam radiation to the entire breast may kill more tumor
      cells.The clinical trial is conducting to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy
      during surgery and whole-breast radiation therapy in treating women who have undergone
      breast-conversing surgery for Intermediate or high grade ductal carcinoma in situ breast
      cancer.
