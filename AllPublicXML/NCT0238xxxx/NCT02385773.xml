    <textblock>
      This trial will assess the impact of the nutritional product PTM202 on childhood diarrhea in
      Guatemalan children. The product is based on cow-milk colostrum and egg. The trial will
      enroll children between the ages of 6 months and 3 years and will assess the impact of the
      study nutrition product on the duration and severity of diarrhea and on weight recovery in
      the 4 weeks following the diarrheal episode. The investigators will be determining the
      etiology of the diarrhea episode to ascertain if the nutritional product works better for
      certain etiologies or has a non-specific benefit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized control trial of the nutritional product PTM202, which is
      a food product based on cow milk colostrum and eggs from hens that have been immunized
      against human diarrheal pathogens. Children between the ages of 6 months and 3 years will be
      enrolled at two sites in Guatemala who present with acute diarrhea. The study will have two
      strata according to the severity of the diarrhea.

      The study product will be administered over 3 days, and the investigators will assess the
      impact on diarrhea duration and severity, and then follow subjects for 4 weeks to assess the
      impact of the nutritional product on weight gain following the episode, because poor weight
      gain is a major health problem in low-income countries. The investigators will also monitor
      for any adverse events during the trial.

      The duration of participation will be 31 days for all subjects.

      A stool sample will be collected at enrollment to ascertain the etiology of the diarrhea. A
      second sample will be collected at the end of the study to assess changes in pathogens.
