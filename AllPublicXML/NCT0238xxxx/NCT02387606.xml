  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antiviral effect of repeated oral dosing of JNJ
      53718678 compared to placebo in healthy adult participants infected through inoculation with
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-A Memphis 37b virus.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), double-blind
      (neither physician nor participant knows the identity of the assigned treatment),
      placebo-controlled, single-center study of JNJ 53718678 in healthy adult participants. Study
      consists of 3 phases: Screening (Day -56 and Study Day -3 prior to the planned date of virus
      inoculation/challenge on Study Day 0), quarantine (includes challenge on Day -1 or -2 and
      treatment for 7 days), and follow-up (Day 15 and 28). Participants will be admitted to the
      quarantine unit on Study Day -1 or - 2 and will be inoculated (intranasal) with the RSV-A
      Memphis 37b virus on Study Day 0. Participants will be evaluated in 3 cohorts: Cohort 1 and
      Cohort 3 (participants will be dosed with JNJ-53718678 or placebo for 7 days) and Cohort 2
      (for up to 7 days [Dosing Days 1-x] [x will be determined based on the results from Cohort
      1]). Participants will be randomized and JNJ-53718678/placebo dosing will be started after
      RSV presence in nasal wash has been detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After
      completion of Cohort 1, data will be reviewed (unblinded) and the antiviral activity, safety,
      pharmacokinetic, clinical symptom and mucus weight data will be evaluated, based on which
      Cohort 2 will be initiated. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
