  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will explore whether the provision of oral HIV self-test
      kits to women can increase HIV testing among their male partners. The study will recruit
      adult women from antenatal care and post-partum clinics in Kisumu. Each participant will be
      randomized to either receive two HIV self-tests or to receive counseling referring their
      partner to HIV testing (standard of care). Over a 3 month period, we will obtain information
      from study participants on how many sexual partners they offered the tests to, the
      receptivity of their sexual partners to using self-tests, and the incidence of any adverse
      events. We will compare partner testing rates in intervention and control groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will enroll women, ages 18-39, attending antenatal care
      (ANC) and post-partum care (PPC) at 3 sites in Kisumu, Kenya. The study's purpose is to
      investigate whether offering multiple HIV self-tests to women can increase the likelihood
      that either partner or couples HIV testing takes place.

      Women who are randomized to the intervention group will be provided with multiple oral
      self-tests as well as information about how to use the tests and where to seek care if
      necessary. These women will be encouraged to give the self-tests to their sexual partners and
      encourage those partners to take a self-test. Women who are randomized to the control group
      will be offered the standard counseling to refer their partners for clinic-based HIV
      counseling and testing. Our hypothesis is that the intervention group will have higher uptake
      of HIV testing by women's partners within 3 months of enrollment in the study than the
      control group. Participants in the study will complete a baseline interview and a follow-up
      interview at 3 months post-enrollment. Qualitative in-depth interviews will be conducted with
      a subset of participants in the intervention group.

    <description>The primary outcome for the study will be uptake of HIV testing by women's partners within 3 months of enrollment in the study. For each participant, the investigators will record whether the participant's partner underwent HIV testing. The investigators will test for differences in the primary outcome variable between the intervention and control group.</description>

    <description>Following a baseline interview, participants in the intervention group will be shown how to correctly use the self-tests and given two HIV self-tests. Subsequently, we will contact participants periodically over a 3 month period to see if they have used the test(s) with their sexual partners and conduct a follow-up interview.</description>
