    <textblock>
      Demineralized bone matrix use for filling in the space removed bone in open wedge osteotomy
      and correction. The purpose this study is to test therapeutic benefits of demineralized bone
      matrix.

      Investigator will recruit thirty patients. Total evaluation period will be 12 months. In this
      period, investigator will examine correction rate, fusion rate, functional test, adverse
      event.
