  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects induced by the cholesterol-reducing drug
      Lovastatin on the platelet proteome of healthy volunteers. Our results may allow to recognize
      the cell signalling modifications induced by Lovastatin. Furthermore, the current study aims
      to characterize the biological and inter-individual variation of platelet's proteome as
      measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Lastly, the exploration of
      changes induced by Lovastatin on the platelet's proteome may allow the discovery of
      modifications relative to the effects of statins on hemostasis and the lipid profile.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Protein Level at 6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Proteins from total platelets lysates will be analyzed by TripleTOF 5600 LC-MS/MS (AB SCIEX). The intensity measured for each identified protein will be recorded in SWATH mode. Intensities measured for each protein before (baseline) and after treatment with lovastatin (at 6 weeks) will be recorded and compared.</description>
