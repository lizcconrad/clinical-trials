    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective study in subjects with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) to
      characterize the clinical performance during a single night of therapy with a FRESCA mask
      compared with a single night of therapy with their existing nasal Continuous Positive Airway
      Pressure (CPAP) mask.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a common chronic disorder and the most common of all sleep
      disorders. OSA can occur in any age group, but prevalence increases between middle and older
      age. Over the last two decades the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing seems to be
      increasing in both men and women, likely due to increasing rates of obesity. Relative
      increases reported are between 14% and 55% depending on the subgroup. For men, the current
      prevalence estimates of moderate to severe sleep-disordered breathing are 10% for 30 to 49
      year-olds and 17% for 50 to 70 year-olds. For women, the corresponding prevalence estimates
      are 3% and 9%.

      Common consequences of OSA include daytime sleepiness, extreme daytime fatigue, slow reaction
      time, moodiness, belligerence and vision problems. OSA is also linked to hypertension,
      increased cardiovascular morbidity, type 2 diabetes, neurocognitive dysfunction and possibly
      cancer.

      The study is a prospective, comparative, open label, randomized crossover assignment,
      multi-center pivotal study.

      Up to forty-five (45) subjects will be enrolled. It is desirable to have the subject
      population distributed across the OSA severity criteria range.

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the FRESCA mask is non-inferior to a CPAP
      nasal mask in maintaining AHI and ODI during a single night of PSG assessment.

    <measure>Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>per hour</time_frame>
    <description>The Apnea-Hypopnea Index or Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI) is an index used to indicate the severity of sleep apnea. It is represented by the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep. Difference of AHI values between patients who used the FRESCA treatment first versus the CPAP treatment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>per hour</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) is the number of times per hour of sleep that the blood's oxygen level drop by a certain degree from baseline. The ODI is typically measured as part of standard sleep studies, such as a diagnostic polysomnogram, home sleep apnea testing, or with overnight oximetry.Difference of ODI values between patients who used the FRESCA treatment first versus the CPAP treatment.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stage N2 (Min)</measure>
    <time_frame>per night</time_frame>
    <description>Stage N2 sleep predominates the sleep stages with 50% of the total sleep time. It follows the Stage N1 sleep and continues to recur throughout the night.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stage N3 (Min)</measure>
    <time_frame>per night</time_frame>
    <description>Stage N3 is considered as 'deep sleep'. It is sometimes referred as slow wave sleep.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>REM (Min)</measure>
    <time_frame>per night</time_frame>
    <description>The exact function of the REM is uncertain. However, it occupies approximately 25% of the total sleep time. REM sleep cycles occur every 90 to 120 min throughout the night with progressively increasing periods of time. REM sleep is associated with more frequent and longer duration apneas, hypopneas, and severe hypoxemia</description>
