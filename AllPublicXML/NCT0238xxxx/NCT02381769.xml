      The study will be an experimental pre-post trial in which patients with ethanol related liver
      disease (both severe alcoholic hepatitis and decompensated ) admitted in our institute from
      Jun 2013-Dec 2014 will be enrolled in the study. Those on ryle's tube feeding would receive
      polymeric blenderized kitchen based liquid diet while those tolerating orally would receive
      soft/ solid diet as tolerated as per requirement. All the patients would receive same amount
      of calories i.e., 30-35 kcal/kg ideal body weight/ day and 1-1.2 gm/kg protein. 35-40% of non
      protein calorie would be provided as fats and rest of the calories will be provided as
      carbohydrates. All patients will be transfused 250ml of 20% intra lipid per day for 3
      consecutive days, over and above the feed provided to them to be taken enterally (orally or
      through Ryle's Tube). Patients will undergo tests prior to infusion and 72 hours after
      infusion.
