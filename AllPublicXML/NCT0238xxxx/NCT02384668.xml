  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on
      morbidity and risk of relapse in patients with Graves' disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a multicentre trial, 260 patients with newly diagnosed Graves ' disease will be randomized
      to cholecalciferol 70 mcg/day or placebo in a parallel Group design. Drop outs prior to 31th
      of December 2017 will be replaced. The intervention will continue during treatment with
      antithyroid drugs (ATD), and for a period of 12 months after cessation of ATD. Blood samples
      will be collected at study entry, at 3 and 9 months, and at end of study. QoL questionnaires
      on nine occasions through out the study period. In a subcohort of 80 participants detailed
      examinations of bone density and geometry, muscle strength and postural balance, immune tests
      (N=50), and measurements of arterial stiffness will be performed at study entry, and at 3 and
      9 months after randomisation.
