      This is an open-label, prospective, observational, multicenter, randomized study to compare
      the efficacy between unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) and
      HLA-haploidentical related hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ,after myeloablative
      conditioning for adult patients with hematologic malignancies.
