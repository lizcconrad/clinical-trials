  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter Phase III study that will evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of bevacizumab, administered in combination with carboplatin with
      gemcitabine, in women with platinum-sensitive recurrent epithelial ovarian, primary
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma.

    <time_frame>From randomization through September 17, 2010 (up to 3 years, 5 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to disease progression (PD), as determined by the investigator, or death due to any cause. PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment started; the appearance of 1 or more new lesions; and/or the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Lesions were assessed by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound every 9 weeks.</description>

    <time_frame>From randomization through September 17, 2010 (up to 3 years, 5 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An objective response was the occurrence of either a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR). PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. CR: The disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Lesions were assessed by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound every 9 weeks.</description>

    <time_frame>From randomization through September 17, 2010 (up to 3 years, 5 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of OR was analyzed in the subset of patients who achieved an OR. The duration of OR was defined as the time from the initial CR or PR until documented PD or death. Lesions were assessed by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound every 9 weeks.</description>

    <description>Carboplatin (AUC 4 mg/mL/minute) was administered intravenously (IV) on Day 1 of each of six 21-day treatment cycles. The carboplatin dose was calculated to reach a target area under the curve (AUC) of concentration x time according to the Calvert formula. Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m^2 was administered IV on Days 1 and Day 8 of each of the six 21-day treatment cycles. Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg was administered IV on Day 1 of each of the six 21-day treatment cycles. The bevacizumab dose was based on the patient's weight at baseline and remained the same throughout the study.</description>
