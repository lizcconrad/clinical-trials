      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bortezomib in
      participants with multiple myeloma who have previously responded to a bortezomib based
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an Open-Label (all people know the identity of the intervention), non-randomized,
      multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research
      study), single arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bortezomib in participants
      with multiple myeloma (cancer of the types of cells normally found in bone marrow) who have
      previously responded to a bortezomib based therapy. Participants will be non-randomly
      assigned to single group bortezomib. Participants will be treated with bortezomib alone or in
      combination with another drug (dexamethasone). Bortezomib will be given intravenously (i.v.
      [into a vein]) twice Weekly, on Days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of each cycle followed by a 10-day (Days
      12 to 21) rest period. The total duration of treatment period will be 8 cycles, each lasting
      3 weeks. The initial bortezomib dose is the last tolerated dose (1.0 or 1.3 milligram per
      metersquare [mg/ m^2] on the previous bortezomib-based treatment. Participants who start the
      study on a dose of 1.0 mg/m^2 bortezomib and tolerate the dose well could have their dose
      escalated to 1.3 mg/m^2. Doses above 1.3 mg/m^2 are not allowed. A complete cycle comprises 4
      doses of bortezomib. Dexamethasone will be first introduced in Cycles 1 to 5
      (i.e.dexamethasone will not be introduced for the first time in Cycles 6 to 8). The median
      total dose of dexamethasone received per cycle ranges from 120 mg (cycle 7) to 160 mg (cycles
      1 to 6 and 8). Efficacy will be primarily assessed by determining Best Confirmed Response
      according to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria.
      Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>Number of participants with best confirmed response to bortezomib Re-Treatment will be assessed by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria. Best confirmed response is, if administration of bortezomib provide continuing or additional clinical benefit after previous bortezomib administration. The ordering of possible responses are Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Minimal Response (MR), No Change (NC) and Progressive Disease (PD)/relapse from CR. CR is the best response and the poorest response is PD or relapse from CR.</description>

    <description>Number of participants with percent change in baseline serum M-protein best confirmed response category will be assessed by EBMT criteria. Best confirmed response is, if administration of bortezomib provide continuing or additional clinical benefit after previous bortezomib administration. Decrease in serum M-protein levels from baseline represents improvement. Participants having baseline M-protein value of &lt;5 gram per liter (g/L) (serum) or &lt;200 mg/24 hour (urine) will be classed in 'Not Evaluable' category and any response rate (RR) which is unconfirmed will be classed as 'Missing'.</description>

    <description>The DOR is defined as the duration (months) from the date of the first evidence of a best confirmed response to the date of first documented evidence of PD (or relapse for participants who experienced CR). The PD or relapse are defined as one or more of following criteria: &gt;25% increase in either serum or urine M-protein, &gt;25% increase in plasma cells on bone marrow, Definite increase in size of bone lesion or plasmacytoma, Development of new bone lesion or plasmacytoma, Development of hypercalcaemia.
