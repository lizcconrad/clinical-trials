    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if insulin, when administered as a &quot;nasal spray&quot;
      into the nasal passages, improves memory in adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or
      Alzheimer's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of evidence suggests that insulin plays a role in normal memory processes and
      that insulin abnormalities may contribute to cognitive and brain changes associated with
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interestingly, insulin administered to the nasal cavity is
      transported within a few minutes into the brain, but does not affect blood sugar or insulin
      levels.

      This study will consist of a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trial
      in which 90 participants with AD or MCI receive daily intranasal administrations of either
      insulin (10 or 20 IU twice a day for a total dose of 20 or 40 IU per day) or placebo (saline
      twice a day) for 4 months. The study will examine the effects of intranasal insulin
      administration on cognition, cerebral glucose metabolism, and β-amyloid (Aβ) in cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) and plasma, testing the hypothesis that daily intranasal insulin administration
      for 4 months will facilitate memory for adults with AD, and adults with mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI). A subset of participants will have the option to participate in 2
      sub-studies: PET scans (prior to and at the end of treatment) to determine whether intranasal
      insulin increases cerebral glucose metabolism; lumbar punctures (LPs) before and at the end
      of treatment to determine effects of intranasal insulin administration on CSF Aβ levels.
