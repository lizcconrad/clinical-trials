      The aim of this study is to to determine whether atorvastatin 40mg per day is effective in
      the treatment of SLE.

      Background: Statins are lipid-lower agents with pleiotropic effects. Beyond the traditional
      effect as inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3methylglytaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, it has
      anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. The administration of atorvastatin to
      lupus-prone model NZB/W F1 mice results in a significant reduction in serum IgG anti-dsDNA
      Abs and decreased proteinuria. In a pilot study with three patients with SLE, simvastatin
      induced rapid and significant reduction in proteinuria levels. However, further randomized
      double-blinded placebo-controlled study is pending.

      Objective: The goal of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and laboratory effect
      of atorvastatin in SLE.

      Methods: Forty patients with SLE will randomize in two groups to receive atorvastatin or not
      as an adjuvant to immunosuppressive agent therapy. Patients who received atorvastatin for 6
      months will stop atorvastatin for 8 weeks as a washout period. We will cross over the placebo
      and experimental groups, then given atorvastatin for another 6 months. Primary outcome is
      improvement of lupus disease status measured by SLEDAI and microcirculation improvement via
      nailfold capillaroscopy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 16–80 years of age, fulfilling ACR criteria for the classification of SLE (no limit on
             disease duration)

          2. Active disease status including (1) active nephritis with moderate proteinuria
             (between 1.0gm/day and 2.5gm/day) despite ongoing immunosuppressive therapy or (2)
             moderate active extra-renal component of the SLEDAI score in the range of 3 to 10. The
             SLE-DAI score should have been stable for at least two weeks prior to screening.

          3. The type and number immunosuppressive agents were not changed in recent one months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. inability to give informed consent;

          2. myositis (CK&gt;3×normal value);

          3. dialysis or serum creatinin&gt;2.5mg/dL;

          4. abnormal liver function (ALT&gt;3×normal value);

          5. pregnant or breastfeeding;

          6. life-threatening illness that would interfere with ability to complete the study;

          7. current drug or alcohol abuse

          8. Already under statin therapy

          9. Active SLE disease need added new immunosuppressive agent or increased current drug
             dosage for more than 50%.
