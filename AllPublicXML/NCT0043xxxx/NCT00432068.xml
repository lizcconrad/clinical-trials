  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the pharmacokinetic profile, safety and tolerability of an octreotide
      extended long-acting formulation after a single dose in humans. It will investigate the
      profile of a single dose of drug in a healthy volunteer subject in order to understand the
      timing and extent of fluctuations in octreotide concentrations in the blood with this
      formulation, the relationship of drug concentration with dose, and how long the drug remains
      in the body system.
