  <brief_title>Immunogenicity and Safety of Concomitant Administration of MMR™ rHA and VARIVAX® by Intramuscular Versus Subcutaneous Route</brief_title>
  <official_title>An Open, Randomised, Comparative, Multicentre Study of the Immunogenicity and Safety of M-M-R™II Manufactured With Recombinant Human Albumin (rHA) and VARIVAX® When Administered Concomitantly by Intramuscular (IM) Route or Subcutaneous (SC) Route at Two Separate Injection Sites in Healthy Subjects 12 to 18 Months of Age</official_title>

      Primary objective:

      To compare if, when given concomitantly with VARIVAX® by the same route at 12-18 months of
      age using separate injection sites, a single dose of M-M-RTMII administered by IM route is as
      immunogenic as a single dose of M-M-RTMII administered by SC route in terms of response rates
      to measles, mumps and rubella at 42 days following the vaccination.

      AND/OR

      To compare if, when given concomitantly with M-M-RTMII by the same route at 12-18 months of
      age using separate injection sites, a single dose of VARIVAX® administered by IM route is as
      immunogenic as a single dose of VARIVAX® administered by SC route in terms of response rate
      to varicella at 42 days following the vaccination

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To summarise the antibody titres to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella at 42 days
           following the vaccination in children immunised with M-M-R™II and VARIVAX® administered
           concomitantly at two separate injection sites by the same route IM or SC,

        -  To evaluate the safety profiles of M-M-R™II and VARIVAX® administered concomitantly at
           two separate injection sites by the same route IM or SC.
