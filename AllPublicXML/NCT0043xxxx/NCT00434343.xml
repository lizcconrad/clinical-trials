    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study wherein eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive
      either myofascial tissue manipulation or global therapeutic massage. Those receiving
      myofascial tissue manipulation will have targeted internal and external connective tissue
      manipulation focusing on the muscles and connective tissues of the pelvic floor, hip girdle,
      and abdomen. Those receiving global therapeutic massage will have non-specific somatic
      treatment with full-body Western massage.
