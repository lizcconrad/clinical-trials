  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress, which refers to cellular damage caused by reactive oxygen intermediates,
      has been implicated in many disease processes, especially age-related disorders. Many trials
      investigating use of antioxidants in protecting different tissues against oxidative stress
      have been conducted, but the results are ambiguous.

      Inflammation is generally associated with enhanced oxidative stress and widespread
      endothelial dysfunction. In the present study, the infusion of LPS, which is a cell wall
      component of Gram-negative bacteria and a major mediator in the pathogenesis of septic shock,
      will be used as a standardized experimental model of systemic inflammatory response in
      humans. The assessment of outcome parameters will include measurements of ocular blood flow,
      forearm blood flow and plasma concentration of cytokines. Measurements of ocular hemodynamics
      provide an unique chance to investigate local blood flow in humans non-invasively. Moreover,
      the retina is especially susceptible to oxidative stress because of its high consumption of
      oxygen, its high polyunsaturated fatty acid content, and its exposure to visible light.
      Evidence from literature clearly supports a role for oxidative stress in pathophysiology of
      several ocular diseases including diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration.
      To investigate the retinal vascular reactivity we will use systemic hyperoxia as a stimulus.
      The measurement of forearm blood flow will be use to assess endothelial function. The main
      study objective is to investigate the effect of oral vitamins and minerals supplementation on
      impaired retinal vascular reactivity after LPS administration.
