  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine whether bosentan will alter exercise capacity after rapid ascent
      to high altitude.

      We hypothesize that bosentan administration will improve arterial oxygenation and exercise
      capacity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both the prostacyclin and the nitric oxide pathways are important in modulating hypoxic
      pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). There is little information about the role of the
      endothelin pathway at high altitude. The endothelin pathway involves the activation of two
      distinct receptors, A and B. Bosentan is a nonpeptide, specific, competitive, dual antagonist
      of both endothelin receptor subtypes. The primary objective of this study will be to
      determine the effect of endothelin receptor blockade with bosentan on exercise performance
      and HPV. This is a prospective, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over study
      involving healthy subjects aged 25-55 years of age. Subjects will undergo echocardiography
      and exercise testing at low altitude (&lt; 500m) and at 3800m. Subjects will receive either
      bosentan vs. placebo and will be studied at low and high altitude on two occasions in a
      crossover design. Primary outcome measures will be pulmonary artery systolic pressure
      measured by echo-Doppler and exercise capacity. A better understanding of the role of the
      endothelin pathway in HPV may lead to improved treatments for some patients.
