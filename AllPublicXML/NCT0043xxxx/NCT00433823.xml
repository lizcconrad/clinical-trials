  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cholesterol is the precursor of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and sex steroids. Both
      adrenal and non-adrenal (ovarian + testicular) all steroid hormones are primarily synthesized
      using the LDL–cholesterol in the circulation. Additionally there is ‘de novo’ cholesterol
      synthesis in both the adrenals and gonads controlled by the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme. A third
      pathway is the use of circulatory HDL–cholesterol by the adrenal and gonadal tissues for the
      synthesis of steroids. Since statins both decrease circulatory LDL and inhibit de novo
      cholesterol synthesis, they are likely to affect the synthesis of steroid hormones. In this
      study we aim to investigate the effects of lowering LDL levels below 70 mg/dL on steroid
      hormone synthesis.

    <textblock>
      Today atherosclerotic diseases are among the most important causes of death in the world.
      Epidemiological, clinical, genetic, experimental and pathological studies have clearly shown
      the role of lipoproteins in atherosclerosis. LDL is the major atherogenic lipoprotein and has
      been defined as the primary target of lipid lowering treatment by NCEP. Although the level of
      LDL, the primary target in the treatment of dyslipidemia, has been set as below 100mg/dl in
      coronary heart diseases (CHD) and CHD risk equivalents, this level has been pulled down to
      below 70mg/dl for the group defined as very high risk group by the ATP (Adult Treatment
      Panel) guide that has been updated following the new clinical studies. As we already know,
      cholesterol is the precursor of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and sex steroids, besides
      being a structural component of the cell membrane. Both adrenal and non-adrenal
      (ovarian+testicular) all steroid hormones are primarily synthesized using the LDL-cholesterol
      in the circulation. In addition to this, there is 'de novo' cholesterol synthesis in both the
      adrenals and gonads controlled by the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme. A third pathway, which under
      normal circumstances has little contribution as compared to the first two, is the use of
      circulatory HDL-cholesterol by the adrenal and gonadal tissues for the synthesis of steroids.
      Our knowledge on extremely lowered LDL levels is quite limited. However, since statins both
      decrease circulatory LDL and inhibit de novo cholesterol synthesis, they are likely to affect
      the synthesis of steroid hormones.
