  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the use of a robotic
      hand therapy device in the home environment. We hypothesize that the therapy group will
      improve hand function more than a customary and usual care group.

      Many stroke survivors have significant limitations of upper extremity function which impacts
      many important activities such as eating, dressing and personal care. Studies show that to be
      effective in increasing functional independence, therapy must involve active participation of
      the patient and repetitive training. Robotic therapy offers a means of transferring some of
      this essential, but time consuming, therapy into the home. Seventy subjects (3 to 12 months
      post stroke)are being randomized to a control group that utilizes an innovative robotic hand
      therapy device in the home for three months or a control group that receives no device
      treatment. Clinical motor function and quality of life measures will compare the groups
      before intervention, immediately after, and 3 months later. The control group will receive
      device treatment for 3 months following their final evaluation. The results will provide
      valuable data on the ability of monitored home therapy to provide effective treatment. This
      project has the potential to increase the availability of effective rehabilitation techniques
      to patients with stroke.
