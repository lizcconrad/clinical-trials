      Purpose: There are some controversies about the effect of Levodopa-Carbidopa on treatment of
      non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). This study was performed to
      evaluate the effect of Levodopa-Carbidopa on visual acuity, color vision, and visual field in
      patients with recent onset NAION (less than 6 weeks duration).

      Patients and Methods: In this double-blind randomized clinical trial, 13 patients were
      treated with levodopa-carbidopa and 12 patients took placebo for 3 weeks. Visual acuity,
      color vision, and visual field were tested before and at 4th, 12th, 16th, and 24th weeks
      after enrollment, and evaluated.
