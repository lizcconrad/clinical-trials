  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, prospective, observational registry will evaluate the safety and
      performance of the CYPHER SELECT™ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent, and of all future
      generation of commercially approved Cordis Sirolimus-eluting Stents (SES), in routine
      clinical practice. Its objective is to measure the incidence and identify the predictors of
      acute, sub-acute and late stent thrombosis and Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE).
      Additional analyses will be performed in patient sub-populations, such as diabetes, in-stent
      restenosis (ISR), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and multivessel coronary disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The data will be collected in consecutive subjects treated with commercially available
      product and following standard clinical practice. This registry will be limited to subjects
      who have received only the CYPHER SELECT™ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent during the index
      procedure. While no inclusion or exclusion criteria have been specified, uniform, complete
      and accurate data will be collected peri-procedurally, during the index hospitalization, and
      during follow-up. All subjects should be treated according to the Instruction For Use (IFU)
      including conduct of the stenting procedure, application of antiplatelet medication and any
      other medical therapy should be provided according to local usual practice. Data collection
      (Electronic Data Capture), data management, statistical analyses, monitoring and core
      laboratory evaluations will be assigned to independent organizations.
