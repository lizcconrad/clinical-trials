  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rational of the study is to try to predict which of the patients who suffer from Fabry
      disease will have End Stage Renal Disease. We hope to find correlation between certain
      modifier genes, previously related to renal disease, to renal disease in Fabry.
