      The primary objectives of this study are:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of glufosfamide in subjects with extensive recurrent sensitive
           small cell lung cancer (SCLC) as measured by objective response rate

        2. To evaluate the safety of glufosfamide in subjects with extensive recurrent sensitive
           SCLC

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of glufosfamide in subjects with extensive recurrent sensitive
           SCLC as measured by duration of response, progression-free survival and overall survival

        2. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of glufosfamide and isophosphoramide mustard (IPM)

      The exploratory objectives of this trial are:

        1. To evaluate the effect of glufosfamide on lung cancer symptoms

        2. To evaluate the role of tumor cell glucose transporter expression on the efficacy of
           glufosfamide

             may have received radiotherapy within 6 weeks of study start)

          -  A minimum of 21 days between prior radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or other
             anti-tumor therapy and study entry

          -  Recovered from reversible toxicities of prior therapy

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status score of 0, 1, or 2

          -  All women of childbearing potential and all men must agree to use effective means of
             contraception (surgical sterilization or the use of barrier contraception with either
             a condom or diaphragm in conjunction with spermicidal gel or an IUD) from entry into
             the study through 6 months after the last dose

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  More than one previous chemotherapy regimen

          -  Concomitant or planned hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, biologic therapy,
             chemotherapy or other systemic antitumor therapy for SCLC other than protocol therapy

          -  Limited stage SCLC (defined as confined to one hemithorax including ipsilateral
             supraclavicular lymph nodes and excluding pleural effusion)

          -  Symptomatic brain metastases requiring corticosteroids

          -  Active clinically significant infection requiring antibiotics

             of cardiovascular instability, uncontrolled hypertension, clinically significant
             pericardial effusion, congestive heart failure, or stroke

          -  Other active malignancies (other than treated non-melanoma skin cancer or treated in
             situ cancer) within the past 5 years

          -  Major surgery within 28 days of the start of study treatment, without complete
             recovery

          -  Females who are pregnant or breast-feeding

          -  Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 28 days of the first
             day of dosing on this study

          -  Concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with the conduct of the study,
             or that, in the opinion of the investigator, could pose an unacceptable risk to the
             subject in this study.
