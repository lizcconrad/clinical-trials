  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to assess the possibility of the potential integration of malaria
      vaccine into the EPI regimen. It will evaluate whether the malaria vaccine is safe and
      immunogenic in infants aged 6 to 10 weeks at first dose, when co-administered with other EPI
      vaccine antigens. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA
      Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two vaccination schedules will be studied, which constitutes the two alternative three dose
      regimens for the malaria candidate vaccine 257049 integration into EPI. The co-administered
      EPI vaccines include GSK Biologicals' Tritanrix™-HepB/Hiberix™, a measles vaccine (depending
      on the supply availability), Aventis Pasteur's Yellow Fever vaccine Stamaril™ and GSK
      Biologicals' Oral Polio vaccine Polio Sabin™. Tuberculosis vaccine (Bacillus of Calmette and
      Guerin, BCG) will be administered according to national medical practice and will not be
      administered as part of this protocol, but will be documented.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins, blood transfusions or other blood products since
             birth to the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study
             period.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose.

      <pre_assignment_details>The study comprised a vaccination phase (Months 0-8) and a follow-up phase (Months 8-19). The Stamaril™ vaccine was not part of the EPI Tanzanian vaccination schedule at study planning. Hence this vaccine was not administered to subjects from Tanzania.</pre_assignment_details>
