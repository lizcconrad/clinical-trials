    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to investigate if there is a significant difference in active
      joint range of motion, questionnaire on gait function and health related quality of life
      between patients randomized to treatment with Botulinum toxin type A and patients randomized
      to placebo treatment.

      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a constellation of symptoms and conditions defined as lifelong motor
      dysfunction resulting rom a non-progressive brain lesion occurring pre-, peri- or postnatal
      before the second year of life. CP consists of different aspect of motor disorder including
      spasticity, paresis, incoordination and dystonia

      There is scarce knowledge about the association between spasticity, pain and physical
      function in the adult CP-population, and the systematic follow up of patients with CP
      typically ends at the age of eighteen. Frequently used intervention in spastic cerebral palsy
      for children with gait problems are injections with Botulinum toxin type A (Btx-A) in leg and
      thigh muscles, and three dimensional-gait analysis has become a standard procedure in
      treatment decision and evaluation.

      Botulinum toxin A (Btx- A) is a highly effective treatment in the management of spasticity.
      The first reported success of use of Btx-A in children with cerebral palsy was made in 1993
      by Koman et al. Subsequently, randomized controlled studies on children with spastic type of
      cerebral palsy has documented that Btx-A is effective and safe in the management of muscle
      spasticity in children with CP. There is an implicit, and as of yet, unproven assumption that
      there is no indication for this treatment in the adult CP-population.
