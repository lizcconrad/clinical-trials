  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overt hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are associated with inverted hemodynamic
      changes.Regional blood flow disturbances (including intrathyroidal) were also reported in
      these thyroid disorders. The purpose of this study is to investigate the thyroid vascularity
      and blood flow by Color Flow Doppler Sonography in patients with subclinical thyroid
      dysfunction

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Color Flow Doppler Sonography (CFDS) has become in the last years an increasing procedure to
      assess the thyroid blood flow. Previous studies showed specific changes of thyroid blood flow
      in hyperthyroidism, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and thyroid nodules when investigated by CFDS.
      Subclinical hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are common laboratory findings, defined by
      normal thyroid hormones concentrations along with ,respectively,decreased or increase Thyroid
      stimulating hormone (TSH) level. We purpose to investigate thyroid vascularity by CFDS in
      patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism and compared them with euthyroid
      patients.
