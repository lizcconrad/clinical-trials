  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of a community-based strategy of routine population mass
      screening for depression with follow-up feedback and management in a primary care
      non-psychiatric setting involving a structured, multifaceted, collaborative (primary care and
      hospital-based)shared care programme.

      Hypotheses:

      We hypothesize that a community-based early psychiatric interventional strategy (CEPIS) for
      depression in the elderly leads to increased recognition of depression by primary care
      physicians, more initiation of treatment for emotional problems, and improved outcomes for
      patients with depression, as measured by:

        1. increased rates of detection or recognition by a primary care physician of minor or
           major (clinical) depression.

        2. higher rates of management activities: counselling for psychological, family social
           problems, contact with community family services (human service agency), consultation
           and/or referral to a mental health specialist

        3. Reduced depressive symptom severity, improved level of daily functioning and quality of
           life among those with major clinical depression

        4. Better patient satisfaction with care

        5. Favourable clinician's and patients perception of their usefulness or acceptability

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a highly prevalent, clinically under-recognized and under-treated medical
      disorder world wide. In Singapore, 17% of the adult population experience recent psychiatric
      disturbances, yet only 6% use the services of any health professional. General practitioners
      are the most commonly preferred caregiver, and actually used by 41.1% of those who sought
      help. At the same time, suicide rates especially among the elderly remain at very high levels
      compared to other countries in the world.

      In recent decades, screening questionnaires have been developed and validated that are
      suitable for the initial detection of depression in the primary care setting. Previous
      research have shown that screening for depression do not result in increased recognition
      rates of mental disorders unless positive cases are selectively fed back to primary care
      physicians. They also do not translate into increased rates of interventional activities such
      as initiation of therapy and referral to mental health specialists. Neither dose primary care
      physician education or clinical practice guidelines result in any improved outcomes for the
      patients unless these are accompanied by more sophisticated strategies in the organization
      and delivery of care, such as structured, collaborative, multidisciplinary care together with
      quality improvement processes.

      More empirical data are therefore needed to establish whether screening for psychiatric
      disorders will enhance the recognition of clinical disorder, leading to better patient
      outcomes.
