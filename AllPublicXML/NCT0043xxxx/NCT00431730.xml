  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Habitual smoking is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, cerebral
      and peripheral vascular disease, including ocular diseases like age-related macular
      degeneration or diabetic retinopathy. Data of a recent study performed in the investigators
      lab revealed abnormal choroidal blood flow regulation in chronic smokers as compared to
      age-matched non-smoking subjects during isometric exercise. However, no information is yet
      available about the regulation of retinal vascular tone in habitual smokers.

      Thus, in the current study, the investigators set out to investigate whether the regulation
      of retinal vessels diameters is affected in habitual smokers. It has been shown in several
      reports that stimulation with diffuse luminance flicker, increases retinal arterial and
      venous diameters, indicating for the ability of the retina to adapt to changing metabolic
      demands. In the current study we use this effect as a tool to investigate whether the flicker
      induced vasodilatation is affected in habitual smokers. This would indicate for an impaired
      vascular regulation process in smokers.
