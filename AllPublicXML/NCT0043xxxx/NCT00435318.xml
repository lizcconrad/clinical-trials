      The intent of this double-blinded study is to investigate the short (2 months) and long-term
      (over 2 months) therapeutic capabilities of Iontophoresis. We anticipate that patients
      treated with Iontophoresis will have improved scores on the VAS and DASH assessments, and
      will recover more quickly than those patients receiving the Sham treatment. A Sham treatment
      is a method used in medical trials to help researchers determine the effectiveness of a
      drug/treatment which in this case will be Iontophoretic Administration using Dexamethasone.
      Placebos are inactive substances (Saline) used in this study to compare results with an
      active substance (Dexamethasone). Furthermore, it is the hope of this research team that
      through careful analysis and comparison of these two treatment arms a clear conclusion is met
      regarding the efficacy of Iontophoresis as a powerful treatment paradigm for patients
      suffering from this disorder.
