      This study is in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) and will compare the effect
      versus placebo of repeat doses of intranasal GSK256066 using the Vienna Challenge Chamber.
      GSK256066 is a potent and highly selective phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor, currently in
      development by GSK for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, asthma and COPD.

      Subjects will be selected on the basis that they display a defined moderate response to the
      pre-determined dose used.

      This study aims to explore the actions of repeat doses of intranasal GSK256066 in patients
      with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis in the Vienna Challenge Chamber compared to placebo.

      12-lead ECG, vital signs and adverse event enquiries will be made throughout the study. Nasal
      examination, symptom scores (TNSS), nasal lavage, nasal scrape and allergen challenge
      assessments will also be performed at various time points throughout the study.
