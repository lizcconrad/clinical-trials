    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the probability of pregnancy is dependent on
      the duration of GnRH agonist downregulation in IVF cycles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GnRH agonists have been used extensively in assisted reproduction technologies for inhibition
      of gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary prior to initiation of ovarian stimulation.
      Administration of GnRH agonists results in the prevention of spontaneous LH surges, which
      lead to luteinization of the developing follicles, initiation of final oocyte maturation and
      a decrease in pregnancy rates.

      GnRH agonists are usually administered according to two protocols: the short and long
      protocol.In the long protocol, downregulation with GnRH agonists is initiated either in the
      middle of the secretory phase, or at the beginning of the follicular phase. Stimulation of
      the ovaries with gonadotropins is initiated when downregulation is confirmed.

      Administration of gonadotropins is usually started during the second or third week of
      treatment with GnRH agonists.The possibility of earlier initiation of the ovarian
      stimulation, if downregulation is confirmed at an earlier stage, has not been examined so
      far.

      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the duration of pituitary downregulation with
      GnRH agonists, prior to initiation of ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins, has any effect
      on pregnancy rate, in women undergoing IVF.

    <description>This is a randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomized to two groups during the first consultation. GnRH agonist will be administrated according to the long luteal protocol. Down-regulation of the pituitary will be controlled on the first day of the menstrual period.
The purpose of this study is to compare the pregnancy rates between the two groups. In the eventuality that pituitary down-regulation has not been confirmed (down-regulation levels determined as Î•2&lt;80 pg/ml and progesterone &lt;1.6 ng/ml), the patient will be assigned to a third group (group 3) and ovarian stimulation will only be initiated after down-regulation has been confirmed.
The GnRH agonist that will be administrated is Buserelin Acetate. Recombinant FSH will be used for the ovarian stimulation and dose determination will be based on patient characteristics and previous history.</description>
