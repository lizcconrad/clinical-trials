  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine maximum tolerated dose level (MTD) of PEP005
      Topical Gel for the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma on the trunk
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are a common skin problem largely caused by long term sun
      exposure. Current treatments include surgery, curettage/desiccation and simple excision,
      which are often cosmetically disfiguring. Non-invasive alternative therapy for treatment of
      BCC lesions is thus being researched. Sap from the plant Euphorbia peplus has been used for
      many years in Australia as a &quot;folk&quot; remedy to treat a number of skin conditions. The active
      component of Euphorbia peplus has been isolated and made into a gel applied directly to the
      skin by Peplin Opeation Pty Ltd.

      The proposed study follows a previously conducted 12 week study in sBCC, PEP005-003. This was
      a two dose schedule evaluating doses up to 0.05%. Histological clearance rate at the end of
      study was 71% for the 0.05% concentration on the Day 1, Day 2 schedule compared with 0% in
      the vehicle group.

      The proposed study aims to determine the maximum tolerated dose level (MTD) of PEP005 Topical
      Gel, in patients, when administered either as a single application or as two applications to
      a selected superficial basal cell carcinoma lesion with a 3 month follow up.
