    <textblock>
      This study is testing a process (rEEG)for selecting the most appropriate medication(s) to
      treat a patient's depression versus a control group being treated according to a standardized
      method, the modified Star*D Algorithm. Qualified subjects will be randomized to the
      experimental (rEEG guided) group, or the control group and treated for 12 weeks. Medications
      utilized in this study are currently marketed. All visits, physical exam, rEEG, labs, rating
      scales and medications are provided at no cost to the patient.

           psychotic features; or use of depot neuroleptics in last 12 months.

        2. Known pregnancy and/or lactation, or intent to become pregnant during this study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18 years of age or older.

          2. Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder validated by SCID. Subjects may meet criteria
             for both melancholic and atypical depression per this protocol.

          3. Have failed three or more antidepressant regimens during the current depressive
             episode with minimum daily dose(s) as defined in the Medication History for Depression
             Case Report Form and for a minimum duration of treatment of at least 4 weeks. For
             purposes of the Study, augmentation will be considered a separate regimen.

          4. Able to stop all medications for 5 half-lives of the medication(s), with the exception
             of hormones, thyroid, hydrochlorthiazide and Ambien. See Appendix II for a list of the
             half-lives of medications.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of: closed head injury with unconsciousness, craniotomy, cerebral metastases,
             cerebrovascular accident; no current diagnosis of seizure disorder, bipolar disorder,
             schizophrenia, dementia, mental retardation, substance abuse, or major depression with
             psychotic features; or use of depot neuroleptics in last 12 months.

          2. Participation in any other therapeutic drug study evaluating a treatment for
             depression within 60 days preceding inclusion, unless drug(s) half-life is known.

          3. Known pregnancy and/or lactation, or intent to become pregnant during this study.

          4. Doesn't qualify via rEEG analysis due to:

               -  Potential physiologic abnormality

               -  Low abnormality in comparison to current rEEG database

               -  No strong prediction by rEEG analysis for any particular medication class
