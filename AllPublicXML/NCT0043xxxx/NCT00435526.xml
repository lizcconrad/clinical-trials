      The purpose of this study is to assess anti-CFA/I and anti-CfaE BIgG safety and to determine
      protective efficacy of anti-CFA/I and anti-CfaE BIgG against diarrhea after challenge with
      H10407, a CFA/I-expressing ETEC strain.

      This is a Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial involving up to 33 subjects.
      Subjects will be randomized into one of the following three groups.

      Group N Product

        1. 10 BIgG anti-CFA/I

        2. 10 BIgG anti-CfaE

        3. 10 LactoFree® Lipil®

      Volunteers will receive the test article three times daily following meals beginning 2 days
      prior to oral ETEC challenge (strain H10407). Test article will be administered for a total
      of 7 days. Monitoring procedures will assess volunteer safety, the primary endpoint
      (diarrhea), stool microbiology (H10407 excretion), and ETEC-specific immunology. All
      volunteers will receive antibiotic treatment (ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or
      amoxicillin) starting 5 days after ETEC challenge or sooner based on pre-defined clinical
      criteria. Follow-up visits for 2 weeks post-discharge will monitor safety and immunological
      parameters.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female between 18 and 45 years of age.

          -  General good health, without significant medical illness, abnormal physical
             examination findings or clinical laboratory abnormalities as determined by principal
             investigator.

          -  Demonstrate comprehension of the protocol procedures and knowledge of ETEC illness by
             passing a written examination (pass grade ≥ 70%)

          -  Willing to participate after informed consent obtained.

          -  Available for all planned follow-up visits.

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test on the
             day of admittance to the inpatient phase for female volunteers of childbearing
             potential. Females of childbearing potential must agree to use an efficacious hormonal
             or barrier method of birth control during the study. Abstinence is acceptable. Female
             volunteers unable to bear children must have this documented (e.g., tubal ligation or
             hysterectomy).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of a significant medical condition, (e.g. psychiatric conditions or
             gastrointestinal disease, such as peptic ulcer, symptoms or evidence of active
             gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease, inflammatory bowel disease, alcohol or
             illicit drug abuse/dependency), or other laboratory abnormalities which in the opinion
             of the investigator precludes participation in the study.

          -  Immunosuppressive illness or IgA deficiency (below the normal limits)

          -  Positive serology results for HIV, HBsAg, or HCV antibodies.

          -  Significant abnormalities in screening lab hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis or
             EKG (EKG in volunteers ≥ 40 years), as determined by PI.

          -  Allergy to fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or ampicillin/penicillin
             (excluded if allergic to two of three).

          -  Abnormal stool pattern (fewer than 3 stools per week or more than 3 stools per day) on
             a regular basis.

          -  History of diarrhea in the 2 weeks prior to planned inpatient phase

          -  Regular use of laxatives, antacids, or other agents to lower stomach acidity (regular
             defined as at least weekly).

          -  Use of antibiotics during the 7 days before dosing or proton pump inhibitors, H2
             blockers, or antacids within 48 hours of dosing.

          -  Travel to countries where ETEC or cholera infection is endemic (most of the developing
             world) within two years prior to dosing.

          -  History of vaccination for or ingestion of ETEC, cholera, or LT toxin.

          -  Stool culture (collected no more than 1 week prior to admission) positive for CFA/I +
             ETEC or other bacterial enteric pathogens (Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter).

          -  Use of any investigational drug or any investigational vaccine within 30 days
             preceding the first dose of test article, or planned use during the active study
             period.

          -  Clinical history of lactose intolerance or allergy to milk or milk products.

          -  Use of any medication known to affect the immune function (e.g., corticosteroids and
             others) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use
             during the active study period.

          -  Inability to tolerate an over-the-counter, lactose-free, infant, powder formula
             suspended in 150 mL sodium bicarbonate buffer (based on requirement for frequent
             dosing).
