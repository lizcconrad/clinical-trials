  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to Evaluate the response rate of Gemcitabine with TS-1
      in Korean patient with advanced but inoperable, metastatic or recurrent pancreatic cancer who
      is not receiving anti cancer therapy.

      To date, curative treatment of pancreatic cancer is surgery.But patients with operable
      indication are rare, most of patients present with locally advanced or general advanced stage
      at diagnosis. Thus the majority of patients need chemotherapy.But efficacy outcomes have not
      seemed to increase overall survival comparing with none treated control group.In Korea the
      incidence of pancreatic cancer increases steadily. Prognosis is poor. So now the effective
      treatment is necessary.There are no phase 2 trialsabout combining gemcitabine and TS-1
      against advanced pancreatic cancer.according to phase 1 trial of advanced pancreatic cancer
      (nakamura et al)toxicities more than 3 grade are neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia,
      anorexia, etc that can be treated.Phase 1 trial is not study to evaluate the response rate.
      But among 21 patients who can be evaluated the response rate, 10 patients have Partial
      response or Complete response.This combination therapy seemed to havetolerable toxicity and
      remarkable therapeutic effect for locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.So therapy
      combining gemcitabine with TS-1 is expected synergic and additional effect.

      This trial is phase 2, open-label, multi-center, single arm study The total sample size will
      be 38 patients. Patient will be administered chemotherapy until disease progression.
      Gemcitabine will be administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 every 3weeks (on day 1 of each
      cycle) TS-1 will be administered 80 mg/m2 orally twice daily for 14 days every 3 weeks.
