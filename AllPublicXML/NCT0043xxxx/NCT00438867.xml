      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a one-time intracoronary infusion of
      Ad5FGF-4 is effective in reducing the time to onset myocardial ischemia as measured by
      exercise treadmill testing and improving myocardial blood flow as measured by SPECT imaging.
      Exercise capacity, angina functional class, patient symptoms and quality of life will also be
      evaluated to characterize the efficacy of Ad5FGF-4. Short-term and long-term safety of
      Ad5FGF-4 will also be evaluated.

          -  Not a candidate for, or unlikely to benefit from standard revascularization procedures
