      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of the Trexima versus
      placebo as assessed by pain relief and the incidences of photophobia, phonophobia and nausea
      at 2 hours after treatment as the primary endpoints. Another objective of this study is to
      evaluate the efficacy of Trexima when compared to the individual components (sumatriptan and
      naproxen sodium) using sustained pain-free as the endpoint. It is the intent that this study
      be sufficiently powered to detect differences that are clinically meaningful and
      statistically significant in order to meet both objectives.

                    -  Child-bearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) at
                       screen, and employs one of the following acceptable measures of
                       contraception:

                         -  Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to
                            administration of the investigational product, throughout the study,

                            from the study to account for elimination of the investigational drug
                            (a minimum of 24 hours); subjects utilizing this method must agree to
                            use an alternate method of contraception if they should become sexually
                            active and will be queried on whether they have been abstinent in the
                            preceding 2 weeks when they present to the clinic for randomized

                            meet this criterion); or

                         -  Any other method with published data showing that the lowest expected
                            failure rate for that method is less than 1% per year.

                         -  Barrier method only if used in combination with any of the above.

                  other types of headaches.

               7. Subject is willing and able to give written informed consent prior to entry into
                  the study.

                  subject has any other abnormal laboratory value of clinical significance for this
                  study.
