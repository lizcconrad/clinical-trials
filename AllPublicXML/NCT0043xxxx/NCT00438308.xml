  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare two common ways of rehabilitating after surgery for
      distal radius fractures treated operatively with a volar plate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last three decades, operative treatment of distal radius fractures has become
      increasingly common compared to non-operative treatment. Over the last 15 years there has
      been a trend towards more invasive, internal plate fixation of fractures of the distal
      radius. One argument in favor of internal fixation for these fractures is that, similar to
      other periarticular fractures, it would be beneficial to allow early movement of the wrist
      articulation. There is not, however, any data to support this statement. In fact, data
      regarding external fixation that either immobilizes the wrist or allows wrist motion suggest
      that early wrist mobilization is not as important as the overall alignment of the bone in
      terms of final wrist motion. This question is important in patient care and in
      decision-making regarding these fractures. Additionally, many companies use this claim as a
      marketing point in spite of the lack of evidence. We consider that good quality data is
      needed to determine the answer to this issue and to help to resolve the related problems
      described above.
