  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if giving progesterone medication to pregnant women, who
      have never delivered a baby after 19 weeks of pregnancy and who have a short cervix, lowers
      the risk of early delivery and improves the health of their baby.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm births, defined as the delivery of a baby less than 37 weeks of gestation, are
      responsible for the majority of neonatal mortality and morbidities. Studies have shown that a
      number of risk factors, including never having a baby before and having a short cervix are
      associated with early delivery. Recently the NICHD did a study in women who were pregnant
      again after having delivered preterm. It showed that giving 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone
      caproate (17P) medication during pregnancy decreased the chance of delivering another preterm
      baby by 34%. This placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial will address the primary
      research question: does treatment with 17P initiated before 23 weeks of gestation prevent
      delivery prior to 37 weeks in nulliparous women with a singleton gestation who have a short
      cervix?
