  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is determine whether indomethacin is able to retard disease
      progression in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research indicates that inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s
      disease (AD), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may retard the progression of
      the disease.

      Comparison(s): Cognitive decline of patients with mild to moderate AD receiving the NSAID
      indomethacin, compared to cognitive decline of patients with mild to moderate AD receiving
      placebo, during a one-year period.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient will satisfy the DSM-IV criteria for dementia of the Alzheimer’s type.

          -  The patient will satisfy the NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for the clinical diagnosis of
             probable Alzheimer’s disease (Appendix I).

          -  The severity of dementia for each patient will be quantified by a Mini-Mental State
             Examination (MMSE) score between 10 and 26 (both inclusive).

          -  The patient is living at home or in a home for the elderly.

          -  The patient has a responsible caregiver who is able to provide information about the
             patient’s functional status.

          -  Written informed consent is obtained from the patient or the legally accepted
             representative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient satisfies the NINDS-AIREN criteria for probable vascular dementia.

          -  A known exaggerated pharmacological sensitivity or allergy to NSAID’s.

          -  History of peptic ulceration, gastric surgery or gastrointestinal bleeding.

          -  Current diagnosis of active peptic ulceration.

          -  Current diagnosis of severe and unstable cardiovascular disease.

          -  Current diagnosis of renal failure.

          -  Advanced, severe and unstable disease of any type, other than Alzheimer’s disease,
             that may interfere with primary and secondary variable evaluations, including a
             medical condition which should be expected to progress, recur, or change to such an
             extent that it may bias the assessment of the clinical or mental status of the patient
             to a significant degree or put the patient at special risk.

          -  Intake of any of the following concomitant medications: salicylates, coumarin
             derivatives, ACE-inhibitors, loop diuretics.

          -  Intake of any of the following concomitant medications more than two months
             immediately prior or during the study: NSAID’s, systemic corticosteroids.

          -  Intake of any of the following concomitant medications with a possible effect on
             cognition: estrogen, deprenyl, vitamin E, neuroleptics, anticholinergics. Patients
             using stable doses of cholinesterase inhibitors were eligible, with the provision that
             the dose should not be changed during the study. Cholinesterase inhibitors could not
             be initiated during the study.

          -  Excessive use of alcohol (more than 5 units per day)

          -  The patient is, either alone or with the aid of a caregiver, not able to reliably take
             the medication.
