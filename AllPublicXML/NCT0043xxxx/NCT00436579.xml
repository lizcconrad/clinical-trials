    <textblock>
      This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects, such as high blood pressure, and
      best dose of sorafenib in treating patients with advanced solid tumors. Sorafenib may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by
      blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether increasing the dose of sorafenib tosylate increases the plasma
      steady-state concentration in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      II. Determine whether increasing the dose of this drug affects blood pressure in these
      patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether the variability in blood pressure elevation is due to pharmacokinetic or
      pharmacodynamic variability.

      II. Compare the toxicity and differences in pharmacokinetics of delivering a higher dose of
      this drug per day (using two different schedules) vs delivering the currently recommended
      dose of this drug.

      III. Investigate mechanisms of sorafenib tosylate-induced hypophosphatemia with serial
      measurements of phosphate metabolism (no longer assessed as of 4/29/2009) in these patients,
      detailed baseline measurements in all patients, and detailed evaluations of patients
      developing grade 3 or greater hypophosphatemia.

      IV. Detect subclinical effects of this drug on measures of thyroid function. V. Identify
      biomarkers predicting the categorization of patient response.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-7 and once on day 8. Patients
      not experiencing at least one grade 2 or higher toxicity during the initial sorafenib
      treatment are randomized to 1 of 3 dose-escalated treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive higher-dose oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 15-36.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard-dose oral sorafenib tosylate three times daily on days
      15-36.

      ARM III: (closed to accrual as of 4/29/2009) Patients receive standard-dose oral sorafenib
      tosylate twice daily on days 15-36.

      In all arms, treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo ambulatory blood pressure monitoring at baseline, on days 7, 14, and 21, and
      at 6 and 12 months. Blood samples are collected periodically throughout study and evaluated
      for pharmacokinetic studies, thyroid function, serum markers, and phosphate metabolism*. CT
      perfusion imaging is performed at baseline, week 6, week 12, and then every 8-12 weeks
      thereafter.

      NOTE: * Phosphate metabolism no longer assessed as of 4/29/2009.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 4 weeks for 1 year and then
      every 3 months thereafter.

    <description>Spearman correlation coefficients (since the distribution of sorafenib plasma trough levels is not normal and the relationship may be non-linear) will be calculated and scatter plots will be produced separately for each phase of the study. The association between differences in trough levels at the two different doses and changes in BP due to dose escalation will be tested in a similar manner. comparisons of BP changes and drug plasma levels between the three randomized treatment arms will be analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's allowance for multiple comparisons.</description>
