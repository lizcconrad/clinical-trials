      Multiple Drug Resistance is the phenomena whereby cells become resistant to a variety of
      drugs with different mechanisms of action. Drug resistance remains a significant impediment
      to successful cancer chemotherapy inhibitors have been developed and are currently in
      clinical trials. CBT-1 is a natural product currently in clinical trials as an inhibitor

      Lung cancer has the highest incidence and prevalence among cancers in the world and remains
      the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. One-year survival of
      patients with best supportive care remains low. Non-small-cell lung cancer accounts for
      almost 85% of all lung cancer cases. Approximately 70% of patients have locally advanced or
      metastatic disease at presentation and are not candidates for surgery.

             clearance &gt; 50mL/minute

          -  have adequate liver function defined as SGOT &lt;4 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)
             and bilirubin &lt;2.0 mg/dL

          -  have calcium &lt;11.0 mg/dL and albumin &gt;2.0g/dL

          -  have adequate bone marrow reserve defined as granulocyte count &gt;1,500/mm3, hemoglobin
             &gt;10.0 g/dL and platelets &gt;100,000/mm3

          -  if female and of child-bearing potential, agree to use one of the following methods of
             birth control: oral contraceptives, barrier with spermicide, intrauterine progesterone
             contraceptive system, levonorgestrel implant, medroxyprogesterone acetate
             contraceptive injection, complete abstinence from sexual intercourse

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  have previously received taxanes, platinums, vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines,

          -  have significant central nervous system disease, including history of seizures within
             last 3 months or psychiatric history which would impair the ability to give informed
             consent or prevent compliance with protocol requirements

          -  be eligible for curative surgery or radiotherapy.

          -  have ongoing serious infections that require parenteral antibiotics

          -  have clinically significant bleeding disorders

          -  be using a medication that could interact adversely with CBT-1, paclitaxel, or
             carboplatin. Medications include:aminoglycoside antibiotics, Prilosec, Losec, Zantac
