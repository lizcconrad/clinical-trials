    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 8-week study is to compare the effects of switching from intravenous
      Flolan to intravenous Remodulin therapy. Remodulin (treprostinil sodium) is an approved
      therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Unlike Flolan, Remodulin does not need to
      be mixed daily and is stable at room temperature, so there is no need for ice packs. In
      addition, Remodulin is changed every 48hrs, instead of every 12-24 (with ice packs) or every
      8 hours (without ice packs) with Flolan. Flolan is given using a type of portable medication
      pump called the CADD Legacy infusion pump. In this study, Remodulin will be given using a
      smaller and lighter medication pump called the Crono Five infusion pump. This study will also
      assess the effect that changing to Remodulin will have on treatment satisfaction and patient
      quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which is defined as an elevation in pulmonary arterial
      pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, is a severe hemodynamic abnormality common to a
      variety of diseases and syndromes. Elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure causes an
      increase in right ventricular afterload, impairing right ventricular function and ultimately
      leading to inactivity and death. The goal of PAH treatment is to lengthen survival time, to
      ameliorate symptoms of PAH, and to improve health related quality of life (HRQOL).

      Remodulin® (treprostinil sodium), a stable analogue of prostacyclin, possesses potent
      pulmonary and systemic vasodilatory and platelet anti-aggregatory actions in vitro and in
      vivo. Recently, Remodulin received FDA approval for intravenous therapy based upon
      bioequivalence of the intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) routes of administration.
      Remodulin is more chemically stable than epoprostenol and may offer potential safety and
      convenience advantages compared to intravenous epoprostenol that may impact Health Related
      Quality of Life (HRQOL) and/or patient satisfaction. Unlike epoprostenol, Remodulin does not
      need to be mixed daily and is stable at room temperature eliminating the need for ice packs.
      Since Remodulin remains in the body longer than epoprostenol (4 hrs instead of less than 5
      minutes) there is less risk of cardiovascular collapse from a sudden interruption of
      infusion, such as a line clog. In an open-label study in Europe, patients who were using a
      type of portable medication pump called the CADD Legacy pump were rapidly switched from
      Flolan to Remodulin with no serious side effects. This study will examine effects of
      switching from therapy with epoprostenol or Flolan to IV Remodulin and compare changes in
      HRQOL and treatment satisfaction before and after rapid switch from epoprostenol to Remodulin
      in patients with pulmonary hypertension from the CADD legacy pump to a smaller pump called
      the Crono Five.

      Participation in this study will last approximately 10 weeks. Study procedures include
      routine blood tests, medical history, physical exams, disease evaluation, exercise tests and
      patient questionnaires. Participants will have 4 visits during the study and will spend at
      least 1 night in the hospital.

    <measure>Change From Baseline at Week 8 in Score on Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire - The Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR), a validated PAH-specific instrument consisting of 65 items used to assess symptoms, functioning and QOL. The CAMPHOR was completed at Baseline and at Week 8. The CAMPHOR consists of 3 scales: 1. A 25-item overall symptoms scale scored 0-25, with a higher score indicating the presence of more symptoms. 2. A 15 item Activity/Functioning scale scored 0-30, where a low score indicates good functioning. 3. A 25-item QoL scale scored 0-25, with a high score indicating poor QoL. Additionally, a total score was recorded by adding up the the scores from the 3 above scales. The Symptom and QoL scales have dichotomous ('True'/'Not true') response options while the Activity/Functioning scale has three-point ('Able to do on own without difficulty'/'Able to do on own with difficulty'/'Unable to do on own') response options. Reduction in score denotes improved heath status.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline at Week 8 in Score on Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire- The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), a validated generic measure of treatment satisfaction consisting of 14 Likert-response items comprising four domains: Effectiveness, Side Effects, Convenience, and Global Satisfaction. The TSQM was completed at baseline and at Week 8. The TSQM consists of 13 items that made up three specific scales (Effectiveness, Side effects, Convenience) and one global satisfaction scale. TSQM items are scaled using either a 5-point or 7-point scale. Five-point scales are used for unidimensional continua (e.g. extremely satisfied to not at all), while 7-point scales are used for bipolar continua (e.g., extremely positive to extremely negative. Non-neutral midpoints are used for 7-point scales, resulting in a greater range of positive response options than negative options for these items. Scale scores are transformed into scores ranging from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating more satisfaction.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>A total of ten subjects were screened. Eight were enrolled and completed the study. One subject withdrew their consent prior to enrolling. The second subject failed screening due to low hemoglobin levels.

        <title>Change From Baseline at Week 8 in Score on Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire - The Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR)</title>
        <description>The Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR), a validated PAH-specific instrument consisting of 65 items used to assess symptoms, functioning and QOL. The CAMPHOR was completed at Baseline and at Week 8. The CAMPHOR consists of 3 scales: 1. A 25-item overall symptoms scale scored 0–25, with a higher score indicating the presence of more symptoms. 2. A 15 item Activity/Functioning scale scored 0–30, where a low score indicates good functioning. 3. A 25-item QoL scale scored 0–25, with a high score indicating poor QoL. Additionally, a total score was recorded by adding up the the scores from the 3 above scales. The Symptom and QoL scales have dichotomous (‘True’/‘Not true’) response options while the Activity/Functioning scale has three-point (‘Able to do on own without difficulty’/‘Able to do on own with difficulty’/‘Unable to do on own’) response options. Reduction in score denotes improved heath status.</description>

A 15 item Activity/Functioning scale scored 0–30, where a low score indicates good functioning. 3. A 25-item QoL scale scored 0–25, with a high score indicating poor QoL. Additionally, a total score was recorded by adding up the the scores from the 3 above scales. The Symptom and QoL scales have dichotomous (‘True’/‘Not true’) response options while the Activity/Functioning scale has three-point (‘Able to do on own without difficulty’/‘Able to do on own with difficulty’/‘Unable to do on own’) response options. Reduction in score denotes improved heath status.</description>

        <description>The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), a validated generic measure of treatment satisfaction consisting of 14 Likert-response items comprising four domains: Effectiveness, Side Effects, Convenience, and Global Satisfaction. The TSQM was completed at baseline and at Week 8. The TSQM consists of 13 items that made up three specific scales (Effectiveness, Side effects, Convenience) and one global satisfaction scale. TSQM items are scaled using either a 5-point or 7-point scale. Five-point scales are used for unidimensional continua (e.g. extremely satisfied to not at all), while 7-point scales are used for bipolar continua (e.g., extremely positive to extremely negative. Non-neutral midpoints are used for 7-point scales, resulting in a greater range of positive response options than negative options for these items. Scale scores are transformed into scores ranging from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating more satisfaction.</description>
