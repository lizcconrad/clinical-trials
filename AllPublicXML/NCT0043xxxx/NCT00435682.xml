      This is a human trial to study the peripheral effect of therapeutic botulinum toxin
      (botox-A). The trial is performed on healthy normal males. The study comprises of two
      parallel placebo-controlled, double blinded studies.

      In experiment 1 intramuscular Botox will be given in corrugator (one site) and frontalis (two
      sites) muscles on one side and placebo to the other side. Intradermal (i.d.) capsaicin
      injection will be given to both sides (between the two sites of frontalis injection
      horizontally). Capsaicin-induced pain intensity and flare together with the area of
      hypersensitivity to different stimulus modalities will be measured and mapped at specific
      time points using different cutaneous stimuli (thermal, electrical, tactile, pressure). This
      will characterize which fibres and receptors are affected by Botox and will show if Botox
      have a unilateral effect (peripheral) or if it also affects the contralateral side (central
      effect).

      In experiment 2 intradermal Botox will be given in corrugator (one site) and frontalis (two
      sites) muscles on one side and placebo to the other side. I.d. capsaicin injection will be
      given to both sides (between the two sites of frontalis injection horizontally).
      Capsaicin-induced pain intensity and flare together with the area of hypersensitivity to
      different stimulus modalities will be measured and mapped at specific time points using
      different cutaneous stimuli (thermal, electrical, tactile, pressure). This will characterize
      which fibres and receptors are affected by Botox. The effect of intradermal Botox will be
      compared to the results of experiment 1.

      The two experiments will show if the intramuscular Botox exerts its action via a leak of
      Botox from the muscle to the overlying skin.

      Antipruritic effects of Botox on histamine prick test and itch will also be assessed in
      parallel with the experiment 2. In this sub-experiment, 5 Units of Botox will be injected
      intradermally in the middle of volar forearm. The same volume of placebo will be injected
      into the other side. Histamine prick test will induce itch and the effect of intradermal
      Botox will be assessed compared to the baseline. Flare area and visual analogue scale (VAS)
      ratings will be measured.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed and dated Written Informed Consent

          2. Male, 18 40 years of age

          3. No concomitant medical diseases or clinically significant abnormal findings based on
             the medical history and baseline physical examination, that could affect the conduct
             of the study, analysis of the data, or the safety of a subject, as determined by the
             investigator.

          4. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject clearly understands the intent of the
             study and is willing and able to comply with study instructions, is available for
             study visits and procedures and is anticipated to complete the entire study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any medical condition that may put the subject at increased risk with exposure to
             Botox, such as myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, amyotrophic lateral
             sclerosis or any other significant disease that might interfere with neuromuscular
             function, including peripheral neuropathies.

          2. Concurrent use or use within 30 days of screening of aminoglycoside antibiotics,
             curare like agents or other agents that might interfere with neuromuscular function

          3. Known allergy or sensitivity to any of the ingredients in the study medication or any
             clinical supply materials.

          4. Current or previous participation in another investigational drug or device study
             within 30 days prior to screening.

          5. Current or previous use of any serotype of botulinum toxin, or anticipated need for
             treatment with or use of any serotype of botulinum toxin during the study (other than
             the study medication).

          6. Recent history of drug or alcohol abuse.

          7. Indications which in the investigator's opinion, indicates inappropriate/illicit
             substance abuse, an underlying significant medical condition or which might interfere
             with the subject's participation in the study.

          8. Infection or dermatological condition at the sites of study medication injection or
             test site.

          9. Family history of hereditary neuropathy.

         10. Any disease associated with a peripheral neuropathy (diabetes, etc.)
