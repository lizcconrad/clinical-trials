    <textblock>
      This is a study of different techniques for treatment of atrial fibrillation using a
      procedure called radiofrequency catheter ablation. Atrial fibrillation (called AF) is when
      the upper chambers of the heart (the atria) beat much faster than the lower chambers, causing
      the heart to beat less effectively. AF can cause stroke, impaired performance, palpitations,
      shortness of breath, passing out and other symptoms. Radiofrequency ablation involves
      placement of catheter/electrode wires into the heart through plastic tubes inserted into
      veins / arteries in both the groins and the right side of the neck under local anesthesia.
      Radiofrequency energy is delivered to the areas inside the heart that cause the rapid firing
      of the atria, causing small lesions or &quot;burns&quot; that destroy the heart tissue where the extra
      electrical impulses come from. Commonly this area is where the four pulmonary veins (PV)
      deliver blood from the lungs to the left side of the heart, and the procedure is also
      referred to as &quot;pulmonary vein isolation&quot; or PVI.

      This study compares two different strategies for performing the pulmonary vein isolation
      procedure, and compares the effect using two different types of radiofrequency ablation
      catheters.

      Usually there are 4-5 PVs in each person that bring blood form the different lobes of the
      lung into the LA. Typically the inside lining of the LA extends for 3-7 mm inside the PVs
      around the entire circumference as they connect (ostium; os) in the form of finger like
      projections. These projections are thought to be the sites that initiate AF. The procedure
      involves careful definition of the finger like projections between the LA and PV os using the
      circular mapping catheter (Lasso). The connections produce specific pattern of electrical
      recordings which are targeted using the ablation catheter that utilizes radio-frequency
      energy to create local burns at the point of contact with the inside of the heart. A
      successful burn destroys these finger-like projections which can be appreciated by loss of
      the characteristic electrical recordings which were seen pre-ablation. Using this technique,
      a series of radiofrequency ablation lesions are delivered around the circumference of PV, the
      end point being obliteration of all electrical recordings between the left atrium and the PV
      of interest (also called &quot;Electrical Isolation&quot; of PV from the rest of the LA). At this time
      the ablation procedure for AF involves electrical isolation of either those PVs that have
      been shown to be the sites from where AF starts (arrhythmogenic PV) or empirically isolating
      all the PVs that the patient has (typically 4-5). There is lack of data showing benefit of
      one technique over the other. Additionally, in order to create radiofrequency lesions or
      burns inside the heart, two different catheter technologies have been approved and are
      currently in use: 1) radiofrequency delivery using a standard 4-mm tip or 8-mm tip catheter,
      which creates burns at the point of catheter contact that are approximately 5 mm deep and 2)
      delivery of radiofrequency energy via saline irrigated cool tip catheter which is capable of
      creating deeper burns (5 - 10 mm). Once again, for electrical isolation of pulmonic veins in
      pts with AF, there is no data that proves the benefit of either catheter technology over the
      other.

      PURPOSE AND DURATION: The objectives of the proposed research project are to study:

        -  The effectiveness of electrical isolation of only the arrhythmogenic pulmonic veins (PV;
           partial isolation) vs. electrical isolation empirically of all 4 PV (total isolation) on
           long-term (1 year) control of Atrial Fibrillation (AF)

        -  The effectiveness of a closed loop saline irrigated cooled tip ablation catheter
           compared with standard 4-mm tip or 8-mm tip ablation catheter in achieving successful
           electrical isolation of pulmonic vein(s).

      Study participants shall have a 1:1 chance of getting either ablation of all 4 PVs vs. only
      the PVs that are shown to start AF and also for creation of the radiofrequency ablations you
      have 1:1 chance of being enrolled either in the arm that utilizes the standard catheter vs.
      that which utilizes the saline irrigated cooled tip catheter. The duration of your
      participation in the study will be for a maximum of 12 months. This trial is being conducted
      in approximately 300 patients.

      Hypothesis:

      Total electrical isolation of all 4 PVs compared with electrical isolation of only PV(s)
      where abnormal impulses are found should be more efficacious in achieving long-term cure of
      patients undergoing ablation for AF. Furthermore, the saline irrigated cooled tip catheter
      should be able to accomplish successful EI of PV(s) in either group with lesser number of
      lesions when compared with the standard 4-mm tip or 8-mm tip ablation catheter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All pts of age 40 years or over that are referred to our center for ablation of AF and
             meet the clinical criteria to undergo the procedure shall be eligible to participate
             in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Failure to obtain informed consent

          -  Age &lt; 40 years

        Despite the reported low incidence of pulmonic vein stenosis (0.8%) as a potential
        complication of PV isolation in pts undergoing AF ablation, in younger pts where it appears
        that AF results mostly from foci from a limited number of PVs, we feel that including them
        in the current study with a possibility of having all 4 PVs isolated cannot be justified.
