      This study is evaluating reflex board training to see if it will help people who frequently
      roll their ankles. We are investigating several tests that evaluate the ability of the
      neuromuscular system to control ankle movement. This study is in 2 parts:Part 1 looks at
      changes after 1 day of reflex training; Part 2 looks at changes after 6 weeks of reflex
      training. It is thought that the reflex training will improve measures of static and dynamic
      balance as well as spinal reflex measures.

      Research has utilized multiple measures in an effort to detect chronic ankle instability
      (CAI). Recently, investigations have focused on assessment of sensorimotor function in those
      who suffer from CAI. These measures have included traditional and functional postural control
      variables, as well as measures of joint position sense, neuromuscular control and
      recruitment, and nerve conduction velocity. This study seeks to modulate sensorimotor
      measures through both short- and long-term reflex training. This information may help to
      better assess sensorimotor deficits associated with CAI, to focus future research, evaluate
      rehabilitation protocols and to improve our understanding of this chronic disability.
