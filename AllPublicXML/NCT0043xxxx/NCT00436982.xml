      The objective is to investigate the Clinical, Radiographic, Roentgen Stereophotogrammetric
      behaviour and patient outcome when using the Triathlon total knee prosthesis in a prospective
      randomized clinical trial.

    <time_frame>[Time Frame: pre-operative, 3 months, 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10 years]</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee Society Clinical Rating System is comprised of two distinct sub-scores: one for pain, ROM and joint stability, and one for functional parameters. Sub-scores range from a potential minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 100 points. Although the specific scores are not distinguished as &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;fair,&quot; or &quot;poor,&quot; a higher value represents a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Investigation of Clinical Performance and Patient Outcome With KOOS Patient Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative, 3 months, 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Sport and Recreation Function (Sport/Rec) and knee-related Quality of Life (QOL). The previous week is the time period considered when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is assigned a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.

    <measure>Investigation of Clinical Performance and Patient Outcome With EQ-5D Patient Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative, 3 months, 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a subject-completed questionnaire designed to assess subject health state values. The EQ-5D consists of 2 areas; the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) and EQ-5D descriptive system. The EQ VAS collects health state values using a 20 cm visual analogue scale with the endpoints labeled best imaginable health state at the top and worst imaginable health state at the bottom, having numeric values of 100 to 0 respectively. The EQ-5D Time Trade-off (TTO) descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/comfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three levels: no problems, some problems and extreme problems, where an overall score of 1 represents full health.
NOTE: While the protocol includes pre-operative, 3 months, and 1 year, this data was not collected.</description>

             system

          3. Patients who understand the conditions of the study and are willing and able to comply
             with the post-operative scheduled clinical and radiographical evaluations and the
             prescribed rehabilitation.

          4. Patients who signed the Ethics Committee approved Informed Consent Form prior to
             surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous major knee surgery

          2. Other significant disabling problems from the muscular-skeletal system than in the
             knees

             which interferes with the patient's ability to limit weight bearing or places an
             extreme load on the implant during the healing period.

          9. Female patients planning a pregnancy during the course of the study.

             outcome.

         13. Patients with other concurrent illnesses, which are likely to affect their outcome
             such as sickle cell anaemia, systemic lupus erythematosus or renal disease requiring
             dialysis.

        <title>Investigation of Clinical Performance and Patient Outcome With KOOS Patient Questionnaire</title>
        <description>KOOS consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Sport and Recreation Function (Sport/Rec) and knee-related Quality of Life (QOL). The previous week is the time period considered when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is assigned a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.

        <description>The EQ-5D is a subject-completed questionnaire designed to assess subject health state values. The EQ-5D consists of 2 areas; the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) and EQ-5D descriptive system. The EQ VAS collects health state values using a 20 cm visual analogue scale with the endpoints labeled best imaginable health state at the top and worst imaginable health state at the bottom, having numeric values of 100 to 0 respectively. The EQ-5D Time Trade-off (TTO) descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/comfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three levels: no problems, some problems and extreme problems, where an overall score of 1 represents full health.
NOTE: While the protocol includes pre-operative, 3 months, and 1 year, this data was not collected.</description>
