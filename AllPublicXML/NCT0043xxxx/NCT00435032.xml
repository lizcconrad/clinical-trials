  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized trial is to compare two commonly utilized surgical treatments
      for children with ruptured appendicitis: early appendectomy, versus interval appendectomy.
      The primary outcome measure is time away from normal activities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two surgical treatment options for children with ruptured appendicitis. Early
      appendectomy is one option and typically involves removing the ruptured appendix after
      several hours of optimizing the patient medically with intravenous fluids and intravenous
      antibiotics. Another option, interval appendectomy, uses the same initial fluid and
      antibiotic management, but delays removing the appendix until 6-8 weeks later. The rationale
      for delaying the appendectomy is to perform the operation at a time when the patient is
      perhaps more stable and the abdominal cavity is free from contamination. Both of these
      treatment options are currently used by many pediatric surgeons across the United States and
      both appear to work well. The two treatment have never been compared in any prospective
      study. The primary outcome of the study is the time that a patient (and family) is away from
      normal activities, due to the disease and its treatment. Secondary outcome measures include
      complication rates, quality of life measures (SF10), hospital cost analysis, and others.
