  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is using EF5 to measure the oxygen level in tumor cells of patients
      undergoing surgery or surgery biopsy for newly diagnosed supratentorial malignant glioma.
      Diagnostic procedures using the drug EF5 to measure the oxygen level in tumor cells may help
      in planning cancer treatment

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the presence and pattern of etanidazole derivative EF5 binding with tumor, based
      on image and cellular analyses, in patients undergoing surgery or biopsy for newly diagnosed
      supratentorial malignant gliomas.

      II. Determine the level of EF5 binding within histologic subtypes of this tumor in these
      patients.

      Compare the relationship between hypoxia and clinical outcomes in patients with glioblastoma
      multiforme (GBM) vs non-GBM.

      III. Determine the spatial relationships between EF5 binding and tumor tissue biomarkers and
      pathophysiologic processes (e.g., necrosis, proliferation, and apoptosis) in these patients.

      IV. Determine the relationship between EF5 binding and Eppendorf needle electrode
      measurements in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive etanidazole derivative EF5 IV over 1-2½ hours once within 1-2 days before
      surgical resection or biopsy. Tumor tissue, normal tissue, and/or tumor-infiltrated lymph
      node samples are collected during surgery and stained for biological markers. Fluorescent
      immunohistochemistry techniques are used to determine the presence, distribution, and levels
      of EF5 binding.

      Patients are followed at 1 month, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every
      6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients will be accrued for this study within 1½-2 years.
