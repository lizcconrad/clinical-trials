  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will compare BOTOX® versus Zanaflex ® for the treatment of muscle
      overactivity in the upper limb following stroke or brain traums. This is a critical step in
      the development of local intramuscular treatment for patients with muscle overactivity
      following an acute brain lesions, as opposed to the more classic oral treatments.

      This study will be a multicenter, randomized, prospective, parallel, double blind study that
      enrolls subjects at twelve sites (including Mt. Sinai) throughout the United States and
      Europe. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BOTOX® compared
      to Zanaflex® in reducing upper limb muscle tone in post-stroke subjects, as well as
      evaluating changes in muscle tone-related disability and drug-therapy tolerance. This will be
      an 18 week study. Subjects are eligible if they have been medically stable with upper limb
      spasticity 6 months after their first stroke. Subjects will be randomized to one of three
      treatment groups: Treatment Group I - intramuscular BOTOX® plus oral placebo, Treatment Group
      II - intramuscular placebo plus oral Zanaflex®, Treatment Group III - intramuscular placebo
      plus oral placebo. The dose of BOTOX® will be at the discretion of the investigator with a
      maximum of 500 U per subject. The dose of the Zanaflex® will be 4mg/day to a maximum of
      36mg/day. The study anticipates that 150 subjects will be enrolled to provide sufficient
      information to answer the primary objective of safety and efficacy of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatient, male and female subjects, of any race, between 18 and 85 years of age.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test
             result at Visit 1/Screening. (A female is considered of childbearing potential unless
             she is postmenopausal or without a uterus and/or both ovaries.)

          -  Subjects with a history of stroke or traumatic brain injury, more than 90 days prior
             to Visit 2/Baseline, that result in disability caused by focal upper limb muscle over
             activity, as assessed by the Investigator and characterized by the following:

               -  A wrist Ashworth tone of +3 or greater as measured on the Modified Ashworth Scale
                  at Visit 1/Screening and Visit 2/Baseline;

               -  A minimum measurement of +2 on the Disability Assessment Scale (DAS) for the
                  principal therapeutic intervention target assessment (hygiene, dressing, pain,
                  and cosmesis) chosen by the Investigator and the subject or subject’s caregiver
                  at Visit 1/Screening and Visit 2/baseline.

          -  Subjects, who, as assessed by the Investigator, clearly understand the intent of the
             study and are willing and able to comply with study instructions, complete the entire
             study and sign Informed Consent Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:
