      Primary:

      To show the equivalence in terms of efficacy glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of
      glimepiride/metformin slow-release combination tablet (Amaryl M SR 2/500) once daily compared
      with fixed-dose glimepiride/metformin combination tablet (Amaryl M 1/250) twice a day on
      HbA1c in patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM)

      Secondary: To compare the following parameters in two treatment arm

        -  Efficacy; Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) and Post-prandial two hours plasma glucose (PP2h)

        -  Response rates in terms of HbA1c, FPG

        -  Patient compliance

      Safety:

        -  episodes of hypoglycemia

        -  adverse events

        -  laboratory values including hematology blood chemistry and urinalysis

        -  vital sign and physical examination
