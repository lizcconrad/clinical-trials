  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of combination therapy with verteporfin photodynamic
      therapy and ranibizumab on visual acuity compared to ranibizumab monotherapy and the
      durability of response observed in patients with choroidal neovascularization secondary to
      age-related macular degeneration

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Best-corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at Month 12.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA score was based on the number of letters read correctly on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity chart assessed at a starting distance of 4 meters. An ETDRS visual acuity score of 85 is approximately 20/20. An increase in the VA score indicates improvement in visual acuity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Participants With a Treatment-free Interval of at Least 3 Months Following the Month 2 Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 2 to Month 11</time_frame>
    <description>The number of patients with a ranibizumab treatment-free interval, ie, no active ranibizumab treatments for at least 3 months duration (at least 2 consecutive monthly visits), anytime following the Month 2 ranibizumab treatment. Only active ranibizumab treatments were considered.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Fluorescein Leakage in the Study Eye at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients with leakage of the study eye was assessed at the Central Reading Center (CRC) using Fluorescein angiography (FA).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Total Area of Leakage (Observed) of the Study Eye at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Fluorescein angiography (FA) was used to assess the mean change of leakage of the study eye at the Central Reading Center (CRC). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement, ie, less leakage.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Central Retinal Thickness of the Study Eye at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to assess the mean change in retinal thickness of the study eye at the Central Reading Center (CRC). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement, ie, less thickness.</description>

    <description>Verteporfin (6 mg/m^2) photodynamic therapy (PDT) and ranibizumab (0.5 mg). Patients received three consecutive monthly ranibizumab injections starting on Day 1, and then as needed at intervals of at least 30 days based on retreatment criteria. These patients also received verteporfin PDT on Day 1 and then as needed from Month 3 at intervals of at least 90 days based on the retreatment criteria. From month 3 onward, retreatments were determined based on study-specific retreatment criteria that included retinal thickness by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), sub-retinal hemorrhage evaluated by ophthalmoscopic examination, visual acuity assessed using Early treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity chart and CNV leakage assessed by fluorescein angiography (FA).</description>

These patients also received verteporfin PDT on Day 1 and then as needed from Month 3 at intervals of at least 90 days based on the retreatment criteria. From month 3 onward, retreatments were determined based on study-specific retreatment criteria that included retinal thickness by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), sub-retinal hemorrhage evaluated by ophthalmoscopic examination, visual acuity assessed using Early treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity chart and CNV leakage assessed by fluorescein angiography (FA).</description>
