    <textblock>
      This study is planned to compare the results of ultrasonic and Orbscan pachymetry in corneal
      haze not related to surgery. Corneal haze is graded with slit-lamp by a single examiner.
      Ultrasonic and Orbscan II pachymetry measurements are obtained. Paired t and Kruskal-Wallis
      tests are used to evaluate the difference between ultrasonic and Orbscan pachymetry
      measurements. Correlation of the two methods and haze grade is determined with Kendall’s
      tau-b correlation analysis.

      We planned this study to compare the results of ultrasonic and Orbscan pachymetry in corneal
      haze not related to surgery. In this institutional based, prospective, controlled clinical
      trial subjects with corneal haze not related to surgery are included. Normal eyes are used as
      control group to calculate the customized acoustic factor. Corneal haze is graded with
      slit-lamp by a single examiner. Ultrasonic and Orbscan II pachymetry measurements are
      obtained by one technician each masked to the other measurement. Paired t and Kruskal-Wallis
      tests are used to evaluate the difference between ultrasonic and Orbscan pachymetry
      measurements. Correlation of the two methods and haze grade is determined with Kendall’s
      tau-b correlation analysis. According to the results of the study, we will determine which
      method is accurate in subjects with corneal haze.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with significant corneal haze on slit-lamp are included in the study group.
             50 eyes of 50 age-matched patients with normal eye and clear cornea are included in
             the control group. Only one eye of each subject is included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria to participate in the study are previous ocular surgery, history of
             contact lens use, glaucoma, and topical ocular medication use, excluding artificial
             tears.
