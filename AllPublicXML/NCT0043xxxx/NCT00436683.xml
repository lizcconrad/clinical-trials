  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate is a phosphate binder that absorbs phosphate from food,
      reducing the amount that the body can absorb.

      The purpose of this study is to determine how well a range of different doses of fermagate
      are tolerated by the subjects in the trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High levels of phosphate in the blood are linked with serious effects, due to calcium
      imbalances (high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), bone disease, formation of calcium
      deposits in the body, and blood-vessel disease.

      Current guidelines indicate that blood phosphorus levels should be maintained between 1.13 to
      1.78 mmol/L in patients who receive hemodialysis.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the range of dosages which are tolerated by
      patients with hyperphosphatemia, undergoing haemodialysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects on active haemodialysis, aged 18 years or over who are able to
             comply with study procedures

          -  Written informed consent given

          -  On a stable haemodialysis regimen (three times per week) for at least 3 months and be
             unlikely to change their dialysis prescription during the study period

          -  On a stable dose of phosphate binder for at least 1 month prior to screening

          -  Willing to abstain from taking any phosphate binder or oral magnesium-, aluminium- or
             iron-containing products and preparations, other than the study medication

          -  Willing to avoid any intentional changes in diet such as fasting, dieting or
             overeating

          -  On a dialysate magnesium ion concentration of â‰¤1.0 mmol/L for at least 1 month prior
             to screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Received a cardiac transplant

             in the opinion of the investigator
