      To evaluate a new vascular sealant compared to control for the control of suture line
      bleeding after vascular reconstructive surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vascular surgery encompasses a wide range of surgical procedures. In these procedures
      reduction of blood loss and creation of suture line is of utmost importance to the surgeon.
      Bleeding at the suture line may require transfusion, as well as prolonged operative and
      anesthesia time. Suture hole bleeding is common following using synthetic and biological
      grafts for vascular repair. Several topical hemostatic ans sealing agents have been developed
      to control suture line bleeding. This new vascular sealant possess high bonding properties,
      minimal tissue reaction, is biodegradable and absorbed by the body quickly. The primary focus
      of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of the vascular sealant with
      standard of care methods used today, specifically gelfoam/thrombin and sponge like material.

    <time_frame>Within 10 minutes following restoration of blood flow</time_frame>
    <description>The primary effectiveness endpoint is sealing success defined as complete anastomotic suture line sealing within 10 minutes following restoration of blood flow without use of an adjunctive hemostatic technique different from the assigned treatment. The primary effectiveness endpoint was evaluated on a per subject basis. For subjects with two treated sites, the subject is considered a success only if there is complete anastomotic suture line sealing within 10 minutes at both sites.</description>

    <description>Time to hemostasis determined from time circulation restored after treatment application until bleeding stopped (assessed at intervals of immediate, 1, 3, 5, 7.5 and 10 min). For subject with two sites, time to hemostasis of both sites used for analysis. Subjects for whom bleeding had not stopped within 10 min considered censored observations.</description>

    <measure>Time to Wound Closure</measure>
    <time_frame>From initial clamp removal at the last anastomotic site until skin closure</time_frame>
    <description>Time to wound closure was defined as the elapsed time between initial clamp removal at the last anastomotic site until skin closure. This endpoint was analyzed using the log-rank test to compare the two treatment groups. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to obtain estimated median times to wound closure and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals for each treatment group.</description>

    <description>Consists of two liquids that when mixed together in situ rapidly cross-link to form a biocompatible absorbable sealant that is tissue adherent. These liquids are sprayed onto tissues using the Dual Liquid Applicator. The formed Sealant remains intact for approximately 2 to 7 days.

    <description>GELFOAM/THROMBIN description - GELFOAM Sterile Compressed Sponge is a medical device intended for application to bleeding surfaces as a hemostatic. It is water-insoluble, off-white, nonelastic, porous, pliable product prepared from purified porcine Skin Gelatin USP Granulates and Water for Injection, USP. It may be cut without fraying and is able to absorb and hold within its interstices, many times its weight of blood and other fluids. Although not necessary, GELFOAM can be used either with or without thrombin to obtain hemostasis.</description>

        <description>The primary effectiveness endpoint is sealing success defined as complete anastomotic suture line sealing within 10 minutes following restoration of blood flow without use of an adjunctive hemostatic technique different from the assigned treatment. The primary effectiveness endpoint was evaluated on a per subject basis. For subjects with two treated sites, the subject is considered a success only if there is complete anastomotic suture line sealing within 10 minutes at both sites.</description>

It is water-insoluble, off-white, nonelastic, porous, pliable product prepared from purified porcine Skin Gelatin USP Granulates and Water for Injection, USP. It may be cut without fraying and is able to absorb and hold within its interstices, many times its weight of blood and other fluids. Although not necessary, GELFOAM can be used either with or without thrombin to obtain hemostasis.</description>

          <title>Time to Wound Closure</title>
          <description>Time to wound closure was defined as the elapsed time between initial clamp removal at the last anastomotic site until skin closure. This endpoint was analyzed using the log-rank test to compare the two treatment groups. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to obtain estimated median times to wound closure and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals for each treatment group.</description>

          <description>Consists of two liquids that when mixed together in situ rapidly cross-link to form a biocompatible absorbable sealant that is tissue adherent. These liquids are sprayed onto tissues using the Dual Liquid Applicator. The formed Sealant remains intact for approximately 2 to 7 days. During this period the Sealant undergoes hydrolysis where it is absorbed into the circulatory system and is excreted through the kidneys.</description>
