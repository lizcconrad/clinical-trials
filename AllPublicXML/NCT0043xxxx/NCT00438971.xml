      The purpose of this study is to determine whether duloxetine is effective in the treatment of
      panic disorder.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Panic Disorder is relatively common, with a lifetime prevalence of 3.5 % (Kessler, et al
      1994) and characterized by a typically chronic course (Marzol &amp; Pollack, 2000). Affected
      individuals tend to be high utilizers of general health care services, frequently receiving
      extensive and unrevealing medical work-ups (Katon, 1997); while the panic disorder itself
      often goes unrecognized (Sartorious, et al 1993). Panic disorder has a significant negative
      impact on work, family, and social life (Rubin, et al 2000), and is associated with increased
      rates of negative life events and diminished overall quality of life (Cramer, et al 2005).
      Research indicates that the quality of life and well-being of patients with panic disorder is
      similarly or more impaired than that of patients with serious medical illnesses, such as type
      II diabetes (Rubin, et al 2000).

      Treatment of panic disorder is focused on the reduction of panic attacks, avoidance behavior,
      and anticipatory anxiety, as well as the resolution of comorbid conditions. The overarching
      goal of panic disorder treatment is reduction in symptoms to allow improvement in overall
      quality of life (Pollack, 2005).

      Duloxetine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that has greater initial
      noradrenergic effects than venlafaxine (Goldstein, et al 2004). Recent data from a placebo
      controlled fixed dose study, suggested that venlafaxine at 225 mg/d (a dose at which
      noradrenergic effects are likely to be relevant), was more efficacious on a number of
      measures of panic disorder than the SSRI, paroxetine (Pollack, et al 2003). This data,
      combined with our clinical experience with duloxetine to date, support the assertion that
      duloxetine is likely to prove an effective agent for panic disorder.

      Thus, we propose to perform the first systematic examination of the efficacy of duloxetine
      for panic disorder in a study in which 15 patients with panic disorder will receive
      duloxetine flexibly dosed from 30 to 120 mg/d in open treatment for 8 weeks. Information
      learned in this study will help guide treatment selection for panic disorder by providing
      initial open efficacy data for duloxetine in panic disorder.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PDSS contains seven items assessing multiple dimensions of panic disorder severity, including (a) frequency of panic attacks, (b) distress during panic attacks, (c) anticipatory anxiety, (d) agoraphobic fear and avoidance, (e) interoceptive fear and avoidance, (f) impairment of work functioning, and (g) impairment of social functioning. The PDSS ranges from 0 to 28, with higher ratings reflecting greater degrees of symptom severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Severity Scale (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is a clinician-rated instrument used to assess global severity of symptoms. The CGI-S ranges from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill). Remission was defined strictly as a CGI-S score of 1 or 2 (not at all ill or borderline ill) and zero panic attacks at endpoint.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Panic Attack Scale (PAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PAS is a measure that assesses participants' total number of panic attacks (situational and unexpected with full and limited symptoms), as well as anticipatory anxiety, since last visit. There is no total score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a 10-item clinician rating of depressive symptoms. Scores range from 0 to 60, with higher scores reflecting greater symptom severity.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BAI is a 21-item self-report measure of anxiety with a focus on somatic symptoms. Total scores range from 0 to 63, with higher scores reflecting greater symptom severity.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Q-LES-Q is a self-report measure of the degree of enjoyment and satisfaction experienced by subjects in various areas of daily functioning. Only the first 14 items are included in scoring, which ranges from 14 to 70, with higher scores reflecting greater enjoyment and satisfaction. The last two items are not included in the total score but are standalone items.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS is a 3-item measure with each item rated on a 10-point scale. The SDS measures the extent to which work/school, social life, and home life or family responsibilities are impaired by symptoms. Total scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores reflecting greater impairment.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation Range of Impaired Functioning Tool (LIFE-RIFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The LIFE-RIFT is a brief measure of psychosocial functioning in work, interpersonal relations, satisfaction, and recreation. Scores on the LIFE-RIFT can range from 4, indicating very good functioning (no impairment) in all of the 4 component areas, to 20, indicating very poor functioning (severe impairment) in all of the 4 areas.</description>

          -  Patients with current or history of posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive
             compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or other psychotic conditions.

          -  Patients on other psychoactive medication, including MAOIs, and those with the
             potential need to use an MAOI during the study or within 5 day of discontinuation of
             study drug will be excluded. Participants must have discontinued MAOI use at least 14
             days prior study baseline. Patients must discontinue regular benzodiazepine or other
             non-MAOI antidepressant therapy at least one week (5 weeks for fluoxetine) prior to
             baseline. Concomitant beta-blockers are proscribed unless prescribed for a medical
