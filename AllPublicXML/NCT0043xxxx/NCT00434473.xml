  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at 15-20 US centers in a randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind fashion. Enrollees will be hospitalized sickle cell disease (SCD) patients
      at-risk for acute chest syndrome (ACS) based on the presence of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC),
      fever (T ≥38.0°C) and serum sPLA2 concentration ≥50 ng/mL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled dose escalation study
      (2 cohorts) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) who
      are at-risk for development of acute chest syndrome (ACS) based on the combination of VOC,
      fever (T ≥38.0ºC), and a serum sPLA2 concentration ≥50 ng/mL.

      The first group of patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive low dose A-001 or placebo as a
      48-hour continuous infusion. Pharmacokinetic and clinical data from this group will undergo
      review by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). If there is no significant
      toxicity associated with A-001, then an additional group of patients will be enrolled and
      randomized 2:1 to high dose A-001 versus placebo as a 48-hour continuous infusion.
