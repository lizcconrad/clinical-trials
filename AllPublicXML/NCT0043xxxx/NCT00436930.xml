      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's tumor cells and white blood cells may help the body
      build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Colony-stimulating factors, such as
      GM-CSF, increase the number of white blood cells and platelets found in bone marrow or
      peripheral blood. Giving vaccine therapy together with GM-CSF may be an effective treatment
      for melanoma.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying two different vaccine therapy regimens to
      compare how well they work when given together with GM-CSF in treating patients with
      recurrent or metastatic melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare overall survival, progression-free survival, event-free survival, and
           failure-free survival of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with vaccine therapy
           comprising irradiated autologous tumor cells vs autologous dendritic cells loaded with
           irradiated autologous tumor cells in combination with sargramostim (GM-CSF).

        -  Compare the frequency of immune response based on delayed-type hypersensitivity to
           irradiated autologous tumor cells and serologic and cellular assays at baseline and
           during and after completion of autologous tumor cell-based vaccine therapy in these
           patients.

        -  Compare the safety of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to measurable disease
      (yes vs no) and location of disease (distant vs regional). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive irradiated autologous tumor cells subcutaneously (SC) and
           sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC once weekly for 3 weeks and then once monthly for up to 5
           months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive autologous dendritic cells loaded with irradiated autologous
           tumor cells SC and GM-CSF SC once weekly for 3 weeks and then once monthly for up to 5
           months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients will be accrued for this study.
