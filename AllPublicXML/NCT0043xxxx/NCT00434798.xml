  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to establish a human Campylobacter jejuni infection
      model with the following characteristics:

        1. Safe application

             1. Infectious period risk mitigated by close monitoring and prospectively applied
                early treatment criteria

             2. Potential post-infectious sequelae risk mitigated by appropriate strain and host
                selection

        2. Campylobacteriosis attack rate of at least 75%

      Secondary objectives are to determine humoral, cell-mediated, and mucosal immune responses in
      the newly established human C. jejuni infection model and evaluate short-term (&lt; 3 mo)
      protection upon repeat exposure to homologous C. jejuni strain and assess immune responses
      associated with protection.

             examination findings or clinical laboratory abnormalities as determined by principal
             investigator or principal investigator in consultation with the medical monitor and
             sponsor.

          -  Demonstrate comprehension of the protocol procedures and knowledge of Campylobacter

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of a significant medical condition, (e.g. psychiatric conditions or
             gastrointestinal disease, such as peptic ulcer, symptoms or evidence of active
             gastritis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, alcohol or illicit
             drug abuse/dependency), or other laboratory abnormalities which in the opinion of the
             investigator precludes participation in the study.

          -  Immunosuppressive illness, IgA deficiency (below the normal limits), or antihistamine
             use within 48 h of admission or during inpatient period.

          -  Positive serology results for HIV, HBsAg, or HCV antibodies.

          -  Significant abnormalities in screening lab hematology, serum chemistry, as determined
             by PI or PI in consultation with the medical monitor and sponsor.

          -  Use of any medication known to affect the immune function (e.g., corticosteroids and
             others) within 30 days preceding receipt of the challenge inoculum or planned use
             during the active study period.
