  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the proposed experimental and modeling efforts are to quantify the
      influences of acute sleep deprivation (short-term homeostatic), chronic sleep restriction
      (long-term homeostatic), circadian rhythmicity, and their interactions on neurocognitive
      performance and to develop a new model of sleep homeostasis that can predict the effects of
      chronic sleep restriction. This model will be based on the underlying neuroanatomy and
      neurophysiology. This new model will facilitate optimization of human performance in
      operational settings, such as are seen in military operation and other work environments.

      This protocol involves a baseline period consisting of 14 hours of wakefulness and 10 hour
      nocturnal sleep episodes each 24 hours. This is followed by a forced desynchrony regimen
      spanning 21 calendar days and consisting of 12 cycles (&quot;days&quot;) of a 42.85-hour wake:bedrest
      schedule. In each 42.85 hour cycle, there are 32.85 hours of scheduled wakefulness and 10
      hour sleep opportunities. This will allow assessment of the independent contributions of
      circadian phase and homeostatic sleep pressure on sleep and neurobehavioral performance. This
      forced desynchrony regimen is followed by 10 recovery days consisting of 14 hours of
      wakefulness and 10 hour nocturnal sleep episodes each 24 hours.

    <description>Subjects are scheduled to live on a non-24 hour day. This separates the sleep-wake schedule from the near-24 hour circadian rhythm. This allows assessment of how circadian rhythms and the length-of-time awake contribute to sleepiness, alertness, and cognitive performance.</description>
