  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is to have a consolidated consent and evaluation
      procedure that will lead potential subjects to the most appropriate clinical trial or human
      laboratory study (and its consent process) for their presenting concerns or interests. A
      second purpose is to have a consolidated intake data base on which secondary analyses can be
      conducted.

      Approximately 1500 candidates per year will respond to advertisements and will complete
      preliminary telephone screening without identifiers. Appropriate candidates will be given
      appointment times and on arrival will undergo the consent process for evaluation. A complete
      medical, social, psychiatric, and drug use history will be obtained. Subjects fulfilling
      general health inclusion requirements will then be offered an appropriate study for which the
      specific consent will be obtained. The evaluation period will be no more than one day with
      all results evaluated within the two following days. Acceptable candidates will then be
      invited to complete the study specific consent.
