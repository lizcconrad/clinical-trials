  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) is a botulinum toxin type A preparation free from complexing
      proteins, i.e. free from proteins other than the active toxin. Injected into the muscle,
      incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) causes local weakening. Botulinum toxin type A is widely used
      for treatment of various neurological conditions. This study will investigate the efficacy
      and safety of incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) in the treatment of post-stroke spasticity of the
      upper limb.

    <description>The Ashworth Scale is a well known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. It was considered to be the best clinical tool for measuring resistance to movement. It was used to categorize the severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension). Subjects with a reduction of one point were defined as responder for the aim of the primary efficacy analysis.</description>

        <description>The Ashworth Scale is a well known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. It was considered to be the best clinical tool for measuring resistance to movement. It was used to categorize the severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension). Subjects with a reduction of one point were defined as responder for the aim of the primary efficacy analysis.</description>

          <description>The Ashworth Scale is a well known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. It was considered to be the best clinical tool for measuring resistance to movement. It was used to categorize the severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension). Subjects with a reduction of one point were defined as responder for the aim of the primary efficacy analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in Ashworth Scale Score for Treated Elbow Flexors</title>
        <description>The Ashworth Scale is a well known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. It was considered to be the best clinical tool for measuring resistance to movement. It was used to categorize the severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension). Subjects with a reduction of one point were defined as responder for the aim of the primary efficacy analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 2 in Ashworth Scale Score for Treated Forearm Pronators</title>
        <description>The Ashworth Scale is a well known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. It was considered to be the best clinical tool for measuring resistance to movement. It was used to categorize the severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension). Subjects with a reduction of one point were defined as responder for the aim of the primary efficacy analysis.</description>

          <description>The Ashworth Scale is a well known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. It was considered to be the best clinical tool for measuring resistance to movement. It was used to categorize the severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension). Subjects with a reduction of one point were defined as responder for the aim of the primary efficacy analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in Ashworth Scale Score for Wrist Flexors</title>
        <description>The Ashworth Scale is a well known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. It was considered to be the best clinical tool for measuring resistance to movement. It was used to categorize the severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension). Subjects with a reduction of one point were defined as responder for the aim of the primary efficacy analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 2 in Ashworth Scale Score for Finger Flexors</title>
        <description>The Ashworth Scale is a well known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. It was considered to be the best clinical tool for measuring resistance to movement. It was used to categorize the severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension). Subjects with a reduction of one point were defined as responder for the aim of the primary efficacy analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Ashworth Scale Score for Finger Flexors</title>
        <description>The Ashworth Scale is a well known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. It was considered to be the best clinical tool for measuring resistance to movement. It was used to categorize the severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension). Subjects with a reduction of one point were defined as responder for the aim of the primary efficacy analysis.</description>

It was considered to be the best clinical tool for measuring resistance to movement. It was used to categorize the severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension). Subjects with a reduction of one point were defined as responder for the aim of the primary efficacy analysis.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Final Visit in Ashworth Scale Score for Treated Thumb Flexors</title>
          <description>The Ashworth Scale is a well known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. It was considered to be the best clinical tool for measuring resistance to movement. It was used to categorize the severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension). Subjects with a reduction of one point were defined as responder for the aim of the primary efficacy analysis.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Final Visit in the Carer Burden Scale for Domain &quot;Cleaning the Palm of the Affected Hand&quot;</title>
          <description>The Carer Burden Scale evaluates the impact of antispastic medication on the physical burden of the carer. It consists of the following items: A=cleaning the palm of the affected hand; B=cutting the fingernails of the affected hand; C=Cleaning the armpit of the affected arm; D=putting the affected arm through the sleeve; E=applying a splint on the affected arm. Each item was assessed on a 5-point Likert scale which values ranges from 0 (=no difficulty) to 4 (=cannot do the task).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Final Visit in the Carer Burden Scale for Domain &quot;Cleaning the Armpit of the Affected Arm&quot;</title>
        <description>The Carer Burden Scale evaluates the impact of antispastic medication on the physical burden of the carer. It consists of the following items: A=cleaning the palm of the affected hand; B=cutting the fingernails of the affected hand; C=Cleaning the armpit of the affected arm; D=putting the affected arm through the sleeve; E=applying a splint on the affected arm. Each item was assessed on a 5-point Likert scale which values ranges from 0 (=no difficulty) to 4 (=cannot do the task).</description>

        <description>The Carer Burden Scale evaluates the impact of antispastic medication on the physical burden of the carer. It consists of the following items: A=cleaning the palm of the affected hand; B=cutting the fingernails of the affected hand; C=Cleaning the armpit of the affected arm; D=putting the affected arm through the sleeve; E=applying a splint on the affected arm. Each item was assessed on a 5-point Likert scale which values ranges from 0 (=no difficulty) to 4 (=cannot do the task).</description>

        <description>The Carer Burden Scale evaluates the impact of antispastic medication on the physical burden of the carer. It consists of the following items: A=cleaning the palm of the affected hand; B=cutting the fingernails of the affected hand; C=Cleaning the armpit of the affected arm; D=putting the affected arm through the sleeve; E=applying a splint on the affected arm. Each item was assessed on a 5-point Likert scale which values ranges from 0 (=no difficulty) to 4 (=cannot do the task).</description>
