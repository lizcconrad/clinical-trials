    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients are eligible to be included in the study only if they meet all of the following
        criteria:

          1. Histologic diagnosis of colorectal cancer.

          2. Performance status of 0, 1, or 2 on the ECOG performance status schedule.

          3. Have had documented disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors (RECIST; Therasse et al. 2000) within 3 months after receiving FOLFOX
             plus bevacizumab as first-line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease, or
             within 6 months after receiving FOLFOX with or without bevacizumab in the adjuvant
             setting.

          4. Standard radiation therapy for rectal cancer is allowed. Patients must have recovered
             from the toxic effects (except for alopecia) of the treatment prior to study
             enrollment. Prior radiotherapy must be completed 4 weeks before study entry. Lesions
             that have been radiated in the advanced setting cannot be included as sites of
             measurable disease unless clear tumor progression has been documented in these lesions
             since the end of radiation therapy.

          5. At least one uni-dimensionally measurable lesion meeting RECIST guidelines (at least
             10 mm in longest diameter by spiral computerized tomography [CT] scan, or at least 20
             mm by standard techniques). Positron emission tomography [PET] scans and ultrasounds
             may not be used.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:

          1. Have received treatment within the last 4 weeks with a drug that has not received
             regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry.

          2. Have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study
             investigating enzastaurin, irinotecan, or cetuximab.

          3. Have a serious concomitant systemic disorder (eg, active infection including HIV, or
             cardiac disease) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the
             patient's ability to adhere to the protocol.

          4. Have a serious cardiac condition, such as myocardial infarction within 6 months,
             angina, or heart disease, as defined by the New York Heart Association Class III or
             IV.

          5. Have a prior malignancy (other than colorectal cancer, or adequately treated carcinoma
             in situ of the cervix or nonmelanoma skin cancer), unless that prior malignancy was
             diagnosed and definitively treated at least 5 years previously with no subsequent
             evidence of recurrence. Patients with a history of low grade (Gleason score less than
             or equal to 6) localized prostate cancer will be eligible even if diagnosed less than
             5 years previously.
