      RATIONALE: Germ cell tumors (GCT) are highly sensitive to chemotherapy such that even with
      metastatic disease at diagnosis, many patients can be cured. Patients who fall into the poor
      risk category or others who relapse can be successfully salvaged with high dose chemotherapy
      and autologous stem cell transplant (AuSCT). As in other diseases such as myeloma, sequential
      high dose chemotherapy and AuSCT may improve overall and disease free survival.

      PURPOSE: Because prior investigations in GCT suggest that a subset of high risk or relapsed
      patients may be cured with sequential cycles of high dose chemotherapy and AuSCT, we propose
      investigating how well non-cross resistant conditioning regimens work in treating patients
      with relapsed or high risk GCT.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine overall survival (OS) of patients with germ cell tumors treated with tandem
           autologous stem cell transplantation with non-cross-resistant conditioning regimens.

      Secondary

        -  Determine disease-free survival (DFS) of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of tandem transplants

        -  Determine the time to engraftment of neutrophils and platelets in patients treated for
           each transplant

        -  Determine the number of patients unable to adequately mobilize sufficient peripheral
           blood stem cells (PBSC) for tandem transplantation.

        -  Identify prognostic factors of patients unlikely to mobilize sufficient PBSC for tandem
           transplantation.

        -  Compare OS and DFS of patients undergoing single vs tandem transplantation.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization with filgrastim (G-CSF): Patients receive
           G-CSF subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 1 and continuing until stem cell collection
           is complete. Patients undergo stem cell collection beginning on day 5 of G-CSF
           administration and continuing for at least 3 collections until the collection goal is
           met.

        -  Second PBSC mobilization with chemotherapy: Patients not meeting the collection goal
           receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on day 1 and G-CSF SC beginning on day 4 and
           continuing until stem cell collection is complete. Patients meeting the collection goal
           after PBSC mobilization via G-CSF alone or in combination with chemotherapy will undergo
           tandem autologous transplantation. If collection goal is not met but the patient has
           collected &gt; or = 2 x 10^6 CD34 cells/kg, a single autologous transplant will be
           performed.

        -  Single stem cell transplantation (SCT): Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on
           day -7 and ifosfamide IV on days -6 to -4. Patients undergo reinfusion of stem cells on
           day 0. Patients also receive G-CSF SC or IV beginning on day 1 and continuing until
           blood counts recover.

        -  Tandem SCT: Patients receive treatment as in single SCT. Beginning 30-90 days later,
           patients receive carboplatin IV over 60 minutes and thiotepa IV over 30 minutes on days
           -6 to -4 and etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days -6 to -3. Patients undergo reinfusion
           of stem cells on day 0. Patients also receive G-CSF SC or IV beginning on day 5 and
           continuing until blood counts recover.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6, 9, and 12 months and then
      every 6 months for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
