        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have had a previous traumatic brain injury (more than 1 year and less than 5 years)
             prior to the screening visit.

          -  Have an Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) more than or equal to 5.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active systemic malignancy or active intracranial tumor. A successfully treated tumor
             or malignancy is not an exclusion criterion if the patient has not had active disease

             cell skin cancers.

          -  Receiving treatment with prednisolone in doses above 10 mg/day or treatment with other
             oral glucocorticosteroids above replacement doses is not permitted throughout the
