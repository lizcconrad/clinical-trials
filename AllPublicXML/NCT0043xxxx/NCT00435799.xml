      The purpose of this study is to assess safety, efficacy and stability of riboflavin-UV
      induced cross-linking of corneal collagen in reducing the progression of keratecatasia and in
      improving visual acuity. This is the first Norwegian study concerning CCL.

      The technique of corneal collagen cross-linking consists of photopolymerization of stromal
      fibers by combined action of a photosensitizing substance, riboflavin and ultraviolet type A
      rays (UVA) from a solid-state UVA Source. Photopolymerization increases the rigidity of
      corneal collagen and its resistance to keratectasia. It has been used to stop progression of
      keratectasia.

      Corneal transplantation has been the only available option so far for treatment for
      keratectasia in its advanced stage in Norway. The method of CCL using riboflavin and UV light
      is technically simple and much less invasive than corneal transplantation and it treats and
      prevents the underlying pathophysiological mechanism. It also does not reduce the chances for
      a successful corneal transplantation, in case that would still be necessary after CCL.

      The purpose of this study is to assess safety, efficacy and stability of riboflavin-UV
      induced cross-linking of corneal collagen in reducing the progression of keratecatasia and in
      improving visual acuity. This is the first Norwegian study concerning CCL.
