  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting from a deficiency in the key enzyme
      beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). The enzyme deficiency is caused by genetic mutations, which
      can result in the production of misfolded GCase. AT2101 is designed to act as a
      pharmacological chaperone by selectively binding to the misfolded GCase and helping it fold
      correctly, which may restore GCase activity.

      This study is being conducted to test the safety of AT2101 in patients with type 1 Gaucher
      disease already receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). The study will involve six visits
      over a period of 7 weeks and will evaluate the safety of AT2101.

          -  Male or female subjects, 18 to 65 years old

          -  All subjects of childbearing potential must be using adequate birth control
