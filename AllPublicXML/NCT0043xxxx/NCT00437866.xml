      Background: Anemia in chronic heart failure (CHF) is directly linked to increased mortality
      and reduced exercise capacity. The pathomechanism for the development of anemia in CHF is not
      well understood. Impairment of iron homeostasis is discussed to be one of the major triggers
      in anemia of chronic disease. Hepcidin was recently described as the central regulator of
      iron homeostasis.

      Main hypothesis: Plasma hepcidin levels are altered in anemic CHF patients compared to non
      anemic controls and might be a main contributing factor of anemia in CHF.

      Iron regulator-hypothesis High levels of cytokines in CHF patients cause up-regulation of
      hepcidin, which in turn leads to low iron uptake causing anemia. In this case venous hepcidin
      and hemoglobin concentrations should both correlate with cytokine levels.

      Erythropoietin regulator-hypothesis Dysregulation of the erythropoietin system results in
      anemia, which represses hepcidin. This leads to a negative correlation between hemoglobin and
      hepcidin in plasma.

      Methods: 100 consecutive patients diagnosed with systolic CHF will be prospectively included
      in the study. Iron status will be assessed and hepcidin, erythropoietin as well as
      interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and soluble TNF alpha receptor levels will be measured by ELISA.

      Patients will be followed up for one year and mortality, rehospitalization and worsening of
      CHF will be documented.
