  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if Dasatinib is effective and safe to give to
      people with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and to determine the effects of the
      drug on LYN kinase activity in blood and bone marrow. Recent research shows that a key enzyme
      in CLL cells is responsible for cell survival. This enzyme is called LYN kinase. Laboratory
      studies show that inhibition of LYN kinase in CLL cells results in the death to CLL cells.
      Dasatinib has the ability to inhibit LYN kinase and, therefore, should have some effect on
      CLL cells.

      -  After the screening procedures confirm that the participant is eligible and willing to
           participate in the research study, they will have the following tests and procedures.

        -  Dasatinib is given orally once daily. Each participant will have a pill diary to record
           doses and any missed doses. All necessary drug refills will be given during clinic
           appointments, at which time the pill diary and any unused study drug will be returned.

        -  During the first month of study treatment the participant will come to the clinic at the
           following intervals: Day 1: An EKG will be performed two hours after the first dose of
           medication; Days 3-8: Blood samples will be drawn once between days 3-8; Weeks 2-4: A
           physical examination, EKG and blood samples will be drawn once a week.

        -  Beginning with the second month of study treatment, participants will come to the clinic
           monthly for up to two years. The following tests and procedures will be done; physical
           examination (monthly), blood work (monthly), pregnancy test (monthly), EKG (monthly for
           6 months, then when medically indicated), CT of the neck, chest and abdomen (every 2
           months for 6 months, then once every 6 months), at the end of month 2, additional blood
           will be drawn for research testing.

        -  Participants can continue to take the study drug for up to two years as long as their
           disease does not progress and they are not experiencing any serious side effects.

Absence of lymphadenopathy
No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly
Absence of constitutional symptoms
Normal complete blood count
Nodular partial response (nPR): Met the criteria for CR, but had residual bone marrow biopsy nodules as the only evidence of disease
Partial response (PR): requires at least the following:
50% decrease in peripheral blood lymphocyte count
50% reduction in lymphadenopathy
50% reduction in the size of the liver and/or spleen</description>

The true ORR is reported as percentage and 90% CI calculated using the binomial exact test. Time to treatment failure (TTF) was defined from the date on study to date of progression, death in remission, initiation of non-protocol therapy in the absence of progression, or censored on the last visit.</groups_desc>
