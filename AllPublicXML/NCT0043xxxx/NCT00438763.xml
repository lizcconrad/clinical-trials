    <textblock>
      Carpometacarpal Thumb Arthritis is a disease caused by different factors and attacks mainly
      woman older than 50 years. The signs and symptoms consist in pain, swelling, joint
      instability, deformity and loss of motion. Some evidence has shown that splinting of the
      thumb may be of benefit. There are two methods of splinting: The first is Standard Neoprene
      wrap-on thumb support (in which the finger is kept in the same position with in a standard
      Neoprene thumb splint). The second is Thermoplast Short Opponens splint (This splint is
      custom-made and the thumb is use as a template to design the splint). The purpose of this
      study is to test and evaluate these two protocols of splinting and assess which one helps or
      works better in patients with thumb arthritis.

    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis of the thumb carpometacarpal joint is a common condition that affects
      approximately 16% to 25% of postmenopausal woman and causes pain, swelling, instability,
      deformity and loss of motion. This condition has been staged in 4 periods according to the
      degree of severity. Mild stages or stages 1 and 2 are usually treated conservatively by
      stabilization of the joint, which can be aggressively achieved by surgical ligament
      reconstruction or conservatively with thumb splints. Splinting is a typical treatment for
      osteoarthritis of the thumb with the goals of managing pain, stabilizing the CMC joint, and
      improving overall thumb function. There are limited studies showing the effectiveness of
      splinting for this condition indicating they are successful in decreasing pain and improving
      function in activities of daily living as well as radiographically improving joint stability.
      What is less clear is, once patients leave the clinic setting, how compliant they are with
      their splinting regimen. Patients with chronic illnesses tend to have compliance issues when
      it comes to their care. Also, there are limited studies comparing different modalities of
      splinting. A recent study compared custom-made short opponens thermoplastic splint with the
      metacarpo-phalangeal (MP) joint free to a pre-fabricated short neoprene splint. They found
      that patients preferred the neoprene splint but both splints provided some degree of pain
      relief, reduction of subluxation of the MP joint and improvement in function. Our purpose is
      to objectively quantify the various benefits of splinting for patients with thumb arthritis
      using the DASH score and assess if there is a difference between the pre-fabricated neoprene
      splint and the custom-made short opponens thermoplastic splint with the MP included.
