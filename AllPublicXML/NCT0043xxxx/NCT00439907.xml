  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rupture of the external anal sphincter occurs in about 4% percent of deliveries. It is not
      clear from other studies whether the results concerning anal function, e.g. fecal continence,
      are better with the overlap repair or end-to-end repair of the injured muscle. The
      researchers randomize women at birth to either overlap or end-to-end when the injury is
      recognized, and examine them one year later with special anal physiologic examinations and a
      validated questionnaire. The hypothesis is that the overlap technique is superior.

    <textblock>
      Rupture of the external anal sphincter occurs in about 4% percent of deliveries in our
      department. It is not clear from other studies whether the results concerning anal function
      are better with the overlap repair or end-to-end repair of the injured muscle. Our routine
      has been to perform an end-to-end repair, though anal surgeons, in the setting of a secondary
      repair, prefer the overlap method. Former studies, when the repair was performed by highly
      skilled operators, have indicated that the overlap method is better.

      We wanted to compare the two methods through a RCT with the end-points examination results
      after one year addressing endoanal sonography findings, anal manometric results and
      continence score evaluated by a Weksner score questionnaire. Our study is performed in the
      routine clinical setting. The patients are recruited to the study during delivery when the
      injury is recognized. When she has given her informed consent she is randomized to one of the
      two operation methods. The operation is performed by the consultant obstetrician on call or
      the resident supervised by the consultant. The proctologist who performs the anal manometry
      and sonography after one year is blinded to the surgical method.

      We plan to include approximately 160 patients at one center. In our center we have about 4500
      deliveries per year.
