      Thesis Infants of diabetic mothers are at high risk to develop hypoglycemia after birth.

      After birth, glucose and ketone bodies are the main substrates of brain energy. Under normal
      condition, the adrenergic response seen immediately after birth suppresses insulin release
      and stimulates glucagon secretion which enhances gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis.

      An inversion of the insulin/glucagon ratio is seen soon after birth as a normal, physiologic
      phenomenon. Consequently, a post delivery glucose nadir is reached between 30 to 90 minutes
      after birth, followed by a spontaneous recovery before 3-4 hours of age.

      In infants of diabetic mothers, this inversion of the ratio is postponed and a more profound
      and sustained hypoglycemia is seen.

      Early feeding is of great importance to diminish the severity and incidence of hypoglycemia.
      But, if despite an appropriate calorie intake, low levels of sugar are seen, an intravenous
      infusion of glucose should be commenced. In case that IV glucose is not effective or can't be
      supplied immediately, intramuscular glucagon is a therapeutic alternative.

      We hypothesize that a single intramuscular injection of glucagon together with the
      appropriate oral intake of nutrients is a safe and an effective alternative to the IV
      infusion of glucose alone in the treatment of hypoglycemia in term infants of diabetic
      mothers.

      Methods Appropriately grown or large for date, term infants of insulin treated diabetic
      mothers, with no other known medical problems, are potential candidates for our study.

      Hypoglycemia will be defined as serum glucose level lower than 45 mg%. Infants of diabetic
      mothers will arrive to the nursery and immediately receive early feeding before 30 minutes of
      life. At that time, glucose will be checked. If glucose level is lower than 45 mg%, treatment
      with IV glucose or IM glucagon will be initiated. Glucose will be checked every hour for 4
      hours and then every 3 hours (before each meal) for the next 20 hours.

      In case blood glucose level is lower than 20 mg% or falls below 45 mg% despite glucagon
      treatment, IV glucose will immediately be instituted.

      Our aim is to check that IM Glucagon is as good as IV glucose in the treatment of
      hypoglycemia in infants of diabetic mothers. We will compare glucose levels after treatment
      with IV glucose and IM glucagon, the time till normalization of glucose and full feeding is
      achieved and the number of hospitalization days in both groups.
