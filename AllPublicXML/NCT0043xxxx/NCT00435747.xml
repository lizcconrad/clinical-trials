  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to compare the pre-emptive analgesic efficacy of parecoxib 40 mg IV/IM
      versus placebo on reducing postoperative acute pain following submuscular breast
      augmentation. Additionally this study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of parecoxib in this kind of procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients of any ethnic origin aged 18 years or over.

          -  The patient is post-menopausal, surgically sterile, or using adequate contraception,
             not lactating, with a negative urine pregnancy test at screening, prior to
             administration of study medication.

          -  The patient's preoperative health is graded as a class I or II according to the ASA
             physical status classification and on the basis of medical history and physical
             examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has significant clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of renal or hepatic
             morbid conditions

          -  The patient has a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity to any NSAIDs,
             cyclooxygenase inhibitors, analgesics or sulfa medications which has a cross
             sensitivity to the medications used in this study.

          -  The patient used analgesics or other agents (antidepressants, sedating antihistamines
             or other sedatives, muscle relaxants, narcotics, or corticosteroids) during the four
             hours preceding the procedure that could confound the analgesic responses.

          -  Subjects with a history of established ischemic heart disease (e.g. myocardial
             infarction, stable angina, unstable angina), peripheral arterial disease and/or
             cerebrovascular disease (e.g. ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic
             attack), as well as subjects with previous revascularization procedure to coronary,
             carotid, cerebral, renal, aortic or peripheral arterial vasculature
