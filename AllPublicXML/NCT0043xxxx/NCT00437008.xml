      The purpose of the study is to determine whether there are differences in postprandial
      endothelial function following a high-AGE(Advanced Glycation End-products) meal vs. a low-AGE
      meal. We also intend to investigate if the therapy with 1050mg Benfotiamine for 3 days
      protects against the postulated deterioration of endothelial function after a high-AGE meal
      in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      AGEs are a heterogeneous group of compounds formed by the nonenzymatic reaction of reducing
      sugars with proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. Diet has been recognized as an important
      exogenous source of AGEs. There is evidence for the implication of AGEs in the pathogenesis
      of diabetes-related complications, atherosclerosis, ageing processes or AlzheimerÂ´s disease.
      Although, only little information exists about their effects in humans. The hypotheses of
      this study are that a high-AGE meal leads to a more important acute vascular dysfunction
      comparing to a low-AGE meal, and that a 1050mg/day Benfotiamine therapy for 3 days has a
      protective effect on the endothelial function.

      Twenty-one people with type 2 diabetes shall be investigated in a randomized, single-blinded
      (investigator), cross-over design (please compare design description).
