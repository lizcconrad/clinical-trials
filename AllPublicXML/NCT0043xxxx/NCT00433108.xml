  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, parallel design trial of two doses of mitoquinone
      mesylate (MitoQ) and of placebo in patients with chronic Hepatitis C.

      MitoQ is a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant that rapidly permeates the lipid bilayer and
      accumulates within mitochondria in organs such as liver, brain, heart, skeletal muscle. There
      is strong evidence for increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage leading to
      apoptosis via caspase activation. Several studies have shown that MitoQ protects cells from
      apoptosis by acting as a caspase inhibitor and may be effective in reducing cell damage in
      liver disease.

      It is hypothesised that administration of MitoQ will lower raised ALT seen in patients with
      chronic Hepatitis C compared with placebo. Approximately 36 patients who have been
      unresponsive or not suitable for interferon-based therapy will be enrolled at one centre.
      Treatment duration will be 28 days with 28 days post-treatment follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C is a viral liver infection that contributes significantly to the burden of
      chronic liver disease. It is currently estimated that over 170 million individuals (3% of the
      world's population)are infected. In New Zealand, an estimated 25,000 people are living with
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and prevalence is predicted to increase by 50% over the
      next 10 years. HCV is primarily spread by blood-to-blood contact. The single most important
      risk factor for acquiring HCV is the use of injected recreational drugs, accounting for
      approximately 80% of infections.

      Unlike hepatitis B, no hepatitis C vaccine is currently available. In the absence of an
      effective vaccine the current treatment of choice is interferon and ribavirin. However,
      treatment of chronic HCV infection with interferon-alpha monotherapy does not achieve
      sustained virologic response. Therefore, it is important to develop alternative treatment
      strategies for patients who are unresponsive or intolerant to current antiviral therapy.

      The aim of this protocol is to compare two doses of a mitochondrial antioxidant treatment
      (MitoQ) and placebo for the treatment of patients with raised liver enzymes due to HCV
      infection. Approximately 36 eligible patients with chronic HCV infection will be randomised
      to receive one of two doses of MitoQ or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. Treatment duration will be
      28 days with 28 days post-treatment follow-up.
