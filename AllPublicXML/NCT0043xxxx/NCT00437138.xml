  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Air pollution is a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The components of
      air pollution responsible and the mechanisms through which they might mediate these harmful
      effects remain only partially understood. We hypothesise that these adverse effects are
      mediated by combustion derived air pollutants and that even a brief exposure will effect
      heart and blood vessel function. We assess the effect of dilute diesel exhaust inhalation at
      levels encountered in urban road traffic on heart and blood vessel function in patients with
      stable coronary heart disease.

      Observational studies suggest that exposure to air pollution may worsen symptoms of angina
      and trigger acute myocardial infarction. These findings are limited by imprecision in the
      measurement of pollution exposure, the effect of potential confounding environmental and
      social factors, and the lack of mechanistic data. Controlled exposures of air pollutants can
      help to address these shortcomings by providing a precisely defined exposure in a regulated
      environment that facilitates investigation with validated biomarkers and surrogate measures
      of cardiovascular health. Using a carefully characterised exposure system, we have previously
      shown in healthy volunteers that exposure to dilute diesel exhaust causes lung inflammation,
      depletion of airway antioxidant defences, and impairment of vascular and fibrinolytic
      function. To date, there have been no controlled exposures in patients with coronary heart
      disease: an important population who may be particularly susceptible to the adverse
      cardiovascular effects of air pollution.

      In a double blind randomized cross-over study, 20 patients with prior myocardial infarction
      will be exposed to dilute diesel exhaust (300µg/m3) or filtered air during periods of rest
      and moderate exercise in a controlled exposure facility. During the exposure, myocardial
      ischemia will be quantified by ST-segment analysis using continuous 12-lead
      electrocardiography. Six hours following exposure, vascular vasomotor and fibrinolytic
      function will be assessed by means of intra-arterial agonist infusions.
