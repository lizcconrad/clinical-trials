  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, prospective double-blinded, randomized trial will study two treatment
      groups. Subjects will be randomized to receive either Orthovisc or corticosteroids/anesthetic
      injection into the shoulder in a 2:1 schema. The trial will assess safety and efficacy of
      pain relief in the osteoarthritic shoulder.

    <measure>American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Evaluation Form (ASES) Patient Score Change From Baseline and 12 Weeks (Per Protocol)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Evaluation Form (ASES) Patient score calculated as visit score - baseline score.
The ASES was designed to provide a standard method for evaluation of the shoulder through assessment of pain and activities of daily living (ie, function). The ASES is derived from an equation that incorporates a visual analog pain scale and functional ability questions. Both components have a maximum score of 50. Pain is calculated by subtracting the visual analog score from 10 and then multiplying by 5 for a total of 50 points. The function component is calculated by adding the points and multiplying by five thirds for a maximum of 50 points. The subscores for pain and function are then added for the total score. The maximum possible total score is 100, representing less pain and greater function.</description>

    <measure>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) Total Disability Score Change From Baseline and 12 Weeks (Per Protocol)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) Total Disability score calculated as visit score - baseline score.
The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities. The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain, where: 0 = no pain and 10 = the worst pain imaginable. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use, where: 0 = no difficulty and 10 = so difficult it requires help.
Scoring instructions: The scores from both dimensions are averaged to derive a total score.</description>

    <measure>12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) Physical Score Change From Baseline and 12 Weeks (Per Protocol)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) Physical score calculated as visit score - baseline score.
The SF-12 is a generic measure and does not target a specific age or disease group. It has been developed to provide a shorter, yet valid alternative to the SF-36, which has been seen by many health researchers as too long to administer to studies with large samples. The SF-12 is weighted and summed to provide easily interpretable scales for physical and mental health.
Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores (PCS &amp; MCS) are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of health.</description>

        <title>American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Evaluation Form (ASES) Patient Score Change From Baseline and 12 Weeks (Per Protocol)</title>
        <description>The difference in American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Evaluation Form (ASES) Patient score calculated as visit score - baseline score.
The ASES was designed to provide a standard method for evaluation of the shoulder through assessment of pain and activities of daily living (ie, function). The ASES is derived from an equation that incorporates a visual analog pain scale and functional ability questions. Both components have a maximum score of 50. Pain is calculated by subtracting the visual analog score from 10 and then multiplying by 5 for a total of 50 points. The function component is calculated by adding the points and multiplying by five thirds for a maximum of 50 points. The subscores for pain and function are then added for the total score. The maximum possible total score is 100, representing less pain and greater function.</description>

        <title>American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Evaluation Form (ASES) Patient Score Change From Baseline and 12 Weeks (As Treated)</title>
        <description>The difference in American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Evaluation Form (ASES) Patient score calculated as visit score - baseline score.
The ASES was designed to provide a standard method for evaluation of the shoulder through assessment of pain and activities of daily living (ie, function). The ASES is derived from an equation that incorporates a visual analog pain scale and functional ability questions. Both components have a maximum score of 50. Pain is calculated by subtracting the visual analog score from 10 and then multiplying by 5 for a total of 50 points. The function component is calculated by adding the points and multiplying by five thirds for a maximum of 50 points. The subscores for pain and function are then added for the total score. The maximum possible total score is 100, representing less pain and greater function.</description>

        <description>The difference in Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) Total Disability score calculated as visit score - baseline score.
The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities. The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain, where: 0 = no pain and 10 = the worst pain imaginable. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use, where: 0 = no difficulty and 10 = so difficult it requires help.
Scoring instructions: The scores from both dimensions are averaged to derive a total score.</description>

        <population>The Per Protocol analysis population was defined as all subjects that received treatment and completed 6 months of follow-up without a major protocol deviation. Subjects were allowed to have missing interim visits (i.e. 12 weeks).</population>

        <title>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) Total Disability Score Change From Baseline and 12 Weeks (As Treated)</title>
        <description>The difference in Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) Total Disability score calculated as visit score - baseline score.
The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities. The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain, where: 0 = no pain and 10 = the worst pain imaginable. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use, where: 0 = no difficulty and 10 = so difficult it requires help.
Scoring instructions: The scores from both dimensions are averaged to derive a total score.</description>

        <description>The difference in 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) Physical score calculated as visit score - baseline score.
The SF-12 is a generic measure and does not target a specific age or disease group.

          <description>The difference in 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) Mental score calculated as visit score - baseline score.
The SF-12 is a generic measure and does not target a specific age or disease group. It has been developed to provide a shorter, yet valid alternative to the SF-36, which has been seen by many health researchers as too long to administer to studies with large samples. The SF-12 is weighted and summed to provide easily interpretable scales for physical and mental health.
Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores (PCS &amp; MCS) are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of health.</description>
          <population>The Per Protocol analysis population was defined as all subjects that received treatment and completed 6 months of follow-up without a major protocol deviation. Subjects were allowed to have missing interim visits (i.e. 12 weeks).</population>
