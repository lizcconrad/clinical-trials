    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how well the DDLS (Disc Damage Likelihood Scale)
      (which is a method used by the eye doctor to evaluate how healthy the optic nerve is)
      measures up to the standard glaucoma tests: OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography), the HRT
      (Heidelberg Retinal Tomography) and the HVF (Humphrey Visual Field).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Disc Damage Likelihood Scale (DDLS) has been shown to be a reproducible method for
      clinicians to evaluate the optic nerve for glaucomatous damage and is highly correlated to
      diagnosis of glaucoma, severity of glaucoma as evidenced by visual field loss and Heidelberg
      Retina Tomography (HRT) evaluation. In comparison with the commonly used cup-disc ratio, the
      DDLS has less inter-observer variation and captures glaucomatous aspects of the optic nerve
      not assessed by the cup-disc ratio. The optic nerve imagers do not have the potential to
      completely replace the clinical examination of the optic nerve since they do not assess many
      critical features such as optic nerve pallor, hemorrhages, asymmetry of disc size, edema,
      etc. The DDLS presents the opportunity to provide a system to clinicians to increase the
      quality and objectivity of clinical optic nerve evaluation. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the correlation of the DDLS grading to OCT, HRT and HVF testing of glaucomatous
      and normal optic nerves.
