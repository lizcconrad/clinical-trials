  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the combination of Lpv/r monotherapy and anti-HCV
      drugs does not match with additional toxicity induced by the association of HAART and Peg-IFN
      + ritonavir in HIV/HCV coinfected patients.

      Secondary objective is to assess if Lpv/r monotherapy during HCV-treatment is associated with
      HIV efficacy versus optimized HAART.

      This is a pilot, randomised, open label, controlled clinical trial. All eligible
      patients(CD4&gt;350, HIV RNA&lt;50 copies and no PI mutations) will be randomized (1:1) to receive
      LPV/r new tabs (200/50 mg, 2 cpr BID) monotherapy (arm A) or LPV/r + selected NUCS (arm B)
      associated to anti-HCV therapy for 12 months. The number of subjects to recruit, in each arm
      of the study, is equal to 25, the total number of subjects to enrol will be 50.

        -  Group A: will receive LPV/r monotherapy and anti HCV drugs for 12 months.

        -  Group B: will receive LPV/r+ selected NUCS and anti HCV drugs for 12 months. All the
           patients will be followed-up for six months after the end of anti-HCV drugs for the
           evaluation of Sustained Virological Response (SVR). At the end of the co-treatment for
           HCV/HIV, each subject will be treated for HIV infection according to physician
           decisions.As anti-HCV drugs the patients will receive PEG-IFNa 2a 180 mcg/week +
           Ribavirin 1-1.2 g/day .At the end of the third month of combined therapy, only patients
           who reach an early virological response will continue anti-HCV drugs.
