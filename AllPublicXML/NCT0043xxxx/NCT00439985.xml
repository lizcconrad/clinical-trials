    <textblock>
      : Although intervention or prevention with young children with T1DM may help ameliorate
      problems or forestall later problems in metabolic control, a number of potential barriers to
      research have constrained the development of such interventions. To assess the feasibility of
      intervening with young children and their families, we propose to conduct an exploratory
      pilot study of a behavioral intervention for young children (ages 7 to 11) newly diagnosed
      with T1DM. The intervention, derived from the pediatric prevention work of Seligman and his
      colleagues, seeks to apply positive psychology principles to enhance optimism, self-efficacy,
      and parent-child collaboration in diabetes management, in order to improve quality of life,
      adherence, and metabolic control. This exploratory study will allow us to evaluate the
      feasibility of intervening with young children and their caretakers and to estimate
      intervention effect sizes in preparation for a randomized controlled clinical trial.

    <description>The treatment which incorporates cognitive restructuring and skill training, was designed to help children with diabetes and their families develop particular skills and optimistic/positive thinking style in order to facilitate better coping with the enduring demands and stress of diabetes management. The goal of the intervention was to improve the child's diabetes management both medically and psychologically by promoting optimism (positive outlook), mastery (problem-solving) and child-parent collaboration (team-work).</description>
