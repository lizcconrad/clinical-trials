  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to: a) Determine how the body takes up the test drug and
      distributes it into various body organs and tissues, how it processes the drug and how it
      ultimately removes it; and b) Examine how well the test drug works against cancer, and
      whether it is safe and tolerable to take
