  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis(IPF) is chronic progressive fibrosing lung disease of unknown
      cause. There is no effective therapy yet for this disease and the mean survival in most
      reports is about 3 years after the diagnosis. Because of the stiff fibrosis of the lung,
      pulmonary hypertension is the late complication of IPF and its development heralds a very
      poor outcome of the patients. For the primary pulmonary hypertension, recently the effective
      drugs have been available. However, there is no study about the efficacy of these drugs in
      the patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to pulmnary fibrosis, and the aim of this
      trial is to study the safty and efficacy of &quot;Iloprost,&quot; one of the safe and effective drugs
      in primary pulmonary hypertension.

      -  Prospective open labeled observational study

        -  Subjects: About 15 patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension due to IPF or
           pulmonary fibrosis associated with collagen vascular diseases.

        -  Method: 3 month trial of inhaled iloprost. Check the safty and measure the pulmonary
           arterial pressure by right heart catheterization, exercise capacity by 6 minute walking
           test, echocardiography, and quality of life questionnaires before and after the trial.
