  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the relative efficacy of a novel treatment (CBT-IC) versus
      a standard individual drug-counseling treatment. The novel treatment emphasizes exposure to
      emotional cues for drug use as part of a comprehensive, yet brief, treatment strategy. These
      treatments are delivered to opiate-dependent, often poly-substance dependent, individuals in
      a comprehensive methadone maintenance program who have failed to respond adequately to
      current treatments.
