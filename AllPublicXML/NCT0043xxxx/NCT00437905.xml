      The purpose of this study to compare balloon angioplasty (PTA) vs. cutting balloon
      angioplasty (CB-PTA) in terms of patency and postintervention inflammation in peripheral
      artery disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Balloon Angioplasty is a minimal invasive technique for treatment of superficial
      femoropoliteal artery obstructions. Despite high initial success rate and an acceptably low
      complication rate, long-term-results are disappointing as restenosis may frequently occur.
      One of the hypothesis for the differences in the reported patency rates is that the amount of
      vessel trauma correlates directly to the prognosis (restenosis) of the treated vessel wall
      segment.

      With the introduction of cutting balloons the problems of elastic recoil and residual
      stenosis might be resolved, by reduction of vessel wall trauma, vessel wall inflammation and
      consequently reduced neointima formation.

      The promising results especially in coronary arteries led us to initiate a RCT comparing
      primary PTA vs. CB-PTA for treatment of femoropoliteal obstructions in patients with
      intermittent claudication or critical limb ischemia.
