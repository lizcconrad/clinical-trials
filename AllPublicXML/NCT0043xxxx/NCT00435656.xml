      The development of new active substances is a continuous source of progress in
      pharmacotherapy. However, the search for an optimal use of existing molecules constitutes
      another possible way of progress. In the particular field of anti-infectious therapy, an
      optimization of treatments could minimize the emergence of resistance phenomena that require
      the continuous development of new active molecules.

      Pharmacogenetics is the scientific discipline seeking to improve the response to drug
      therapies (better clinical efficiency and reduction of side effects) by taking into
      consideration the genetic characteristics of the patient. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic
      index constitute a main target of this emerging field. The combination of therapeutic drug
      monitoring and pharmacogenetics already allows to optimize the use of some drugs among which
      oral anticoagulants, immunosuppressants, antiepileptics, antidepressors, antibiotics or
      antivirals….

      In this research project, we will study the genetic determinants that influence the
      pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral drugs used in the treatment of diseases caused by the HIV.
      We will put a particular emphasis on viral protease inhibitors (atazanavir, saquinavir,
      lopinavir, ritonavir)and non-nucleosides reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nevirapine and
      efavirenz). For those drugs, the clinician often faces a double therapeutic risk, either of
      insufficient dosing (clinical inefficacy and emergence of resistance) or of excessive dosing
      (toxicity). The optimization of drug dosing is especially crucial because some of these drugs
      often represent the last choice in multi-resistant patients.
