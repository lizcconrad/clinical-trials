  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The acute effects of farmed rainbow trout, fed by various feeds versus a control meal with
      poultry meat on cardiovascular risk markers and plasma protein expression are investigated.

      The hypotheses of the study are that if the feed are changed from a marine origin to
      primarily a vegetable origin the content of long chain n-3 poly unsaturated fatty acids (n-3
      PUFA) will decrease in the meat and thus possibly result in a decreased effect on health.
      Furthermore, the feed of the trouts are also expected to give rise to differences in the
      human plasma protein profile and fatty acid composition after consumption, which could be
      associated with physiological effects.

      In a controlled, single blinded human single meal study the acute effects of farmed rainbow
      trout, fed by various feeds versus a control meal with poultry meat on cardiovascular risk
      markers and plasma protein expression are investigated. 6 healthy men, age 40-70, will be
      randomized to trout fed on only vegetable, only marine and a mix of different compositions of
      vegetable and marine feeds. Outcome variables are blood pressure, pulse wave analyse, pulse
      wave velocity, plasma protein profile, and plasma triglycerides.
