  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe scarring is a common problem following breast reduction surgery, studies have shown
      that over 64% of patients develop a hypertrophic scar at three months after the operation.
      Scar severity can be influenced by a large number of factors including age, sex, skin
      thickness and tension, ethnicity and the position of the scar on the body. Therefore the most
      sensitive and reliable method to assess the efficacy of an anti-scarring treatment is to
      compare bilateral wounds on the same individual. Bilateral breast reduction surgery provides
      an ideal model for a within patient evaluation of anti-scarring activity in wounds which
      develop into bad scars.

      This study is being undertaken to investigate the efficacy and safety of Juvista (given as an
      intradermal injection of 200ng per 1cm wound margin) in the reduction of scar appearance
      applied to approximated wound margins following bilateral reduction mammaplasty.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients between 18 and 65 years of age undergoing bilateral reduction
             mammaplasty with anchor shaped incisions, who have given written informed consent.

          -  Patients with a Body Mass Index of 15-32 kg/m2 inclusive.

          -  Patients of child bearing potential who are using method(s) of contraception
             acceptable to the Investigator and agree to do so from at least the screening visit
             until 1 month after administration of the trial investigational products.

          -  Patients with, in the opinion of the Investigator, clinically acceptable results for
             the laboratory tests specified in the trial protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with significant breast asymmetry that may result in asymmetrical operative
             incisions being made on the left and rights breasts.

          -  Patients with breast asymmetry that may result in different post-operative tensions on
             the wounds of the left and right breasts.

          -  Patients who have had surgery in the area to be incised within one year of trial
             surgery.

          -  Patients with a history of a bleeding disorder.

          -  Patients with a history of breast malignancy.

          -  Patients with a skin disorder that is chronic or currently active and which the
             Investigator considers will adversely affect the healing of the wounds or involves the
             areas to be examined in this trial.

          -  Patients who on direct questioning and/or physical examination, have evidence of any
             past or present clinically significant medical condition that would impair wound
             healing.

          -  Patients with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity to any of the drugs
             or surgical dressings to be used in this trial.

          -  Patients who are taking, or have taken, any investigational drugs in the 3 months
             prior to the screening visit.

          -  Patients who are taking regular, continuous, oral corticosteroid therapy.

          -  Patients undergoing investigations or changes in management for an existing medical
             condition.

          -  Patients who are or who become pregnant up to and including the day of surgery or who
             are lactating.

          -  Patients with diseases or conditions that could, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             interfere with the assessment of safety or efficacy of the investigational product.

          -  Patients who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are not likely to complete the
             trial.
