      RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to
      the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving radiation therapy in
      different ways and giving it together with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving internal
      radiation therapy and external radiation therapy together with fluorouracil works in treating
      patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent pancreatic cancer and liver metastases that cannot
      be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine tumor response in patients with unresectable, newly diagnosed or recurrent
           pancreatic cancer and liver metastases treated with selective internal radiotherapy with
           yttrium Y 90 microspheres, selective external radiotherapy with tomotherapy, and
           fluoroucacil.

        -  Determine hepatic and systemic toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of time to progression and survival, in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-4. Patients undergo
      selective internal radiotherapy with yttrium Y 90 microspheres on day 2 and selective
      external radiotherapy with tomotherapy on day 3.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
