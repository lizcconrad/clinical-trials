  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is uncertainty about the optimal diet in the prevention and treatment of diabetes type
      2. Earlier studies have generally focused on intakes of fat, protein, carbohydrate, fiber,
      fruit and vegetables. This study is based on another approach which compares foods that were
      available during human evolution with more recently introduced ones. The basic tenet from
      evolutionary biology is that if human physiology is less adapted to a relatively recently
      introduced diet based on agriculture, this could cause disturbances to human physiology and
      ultimately lead to diseases. Epidemiological studies indicates that diabetes mellitus type 2
      is absent or near absent in populations eating a Palaeolithic (&quot;Old Stone Age&quot;) diet which is
      free from food items produced in agriculture or the food industry. Our study hypothesis is
      that a Palaeolithic diet is better than the standard diabetes diet recommended today in
      treating diabetes type 2.

      Fifteen patients with diabetes type 2 have been randomized to

        1. a Palaeolithic diet based on lean meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, root vegetables, eggs,
           and nuts

        2. a standard diabetes diet as recommended by national health authorities.

      The patients eat the diet they have been randomized to for three months and then switches to
      the other diet for another three months. The study is conducted in Primary Health Care
      stations.
