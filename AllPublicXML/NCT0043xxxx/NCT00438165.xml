  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a longitudinal follow-up of 679 low-income women (89% African American) and
      their firstborn and subsequent children who have participated in a randomized trial of
      prenatal and infancy home visiting by nurses in Memphis, Tennessee since 1988. The study was
      conducted when the first-born children completed sixth grade, at around their 12th birthday.

      The current follow-up was designed to determine whether: a) nurse-visited women differ from
      comparison group women in their life-course outcomes (the number and spacing of subsequent
      pregnancies and births; the rates of marriage and cohabitation with the father of the child;
      their employment, career growth, economic self-sufficiency, and welfare dependence; and
      behavioral problems due to substance abuse; arrests for serious misdemeanors and felonies);
      b) children of nurse-visited women differ from comparison-children in their academic
      achievement, placements in special education, rates of grade retention, conduct in school,
      and academic achievement; c) there are lower rates of developmental disability, grade
      retention, placement in special education, and school disciplinary actions among subsequent
      children born to nurse-visited women; d) nurse-visited families have fewer government
      expenditures and higher taxes paid; e) the effects of the program on child outcomes are
      concentrated on children born to women with low psychological resources; f) the effects of
      the program on maternal life course and government costs are concentrated on women with high
      psychological resources; g) the effects of the program on children are greater in schools and
      neighborhoods that contain greater risks for academic and behavioral problems; h) the effect
      of the program on children's disruptive behavior problems is explained by the combined
      effects of the program on maternal life-course, qualities of parental care-giving, and
      children's sequential processing skills, and aggressive and violent themes, reliance on
      adults, and story incoherence in their responses to the McArthur Story Stem Battery at
      earlier assessments. Data will be derived from maternal interviews and reviews of state
      administrative and school records. Results from this trial will provide policy makers with an
      estimate of likely long-term effects of this program when it is conducted in close to
      real-life conditions.
