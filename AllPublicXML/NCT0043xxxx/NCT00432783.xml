  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacologic boosting of protease inhibitors with ritonavir has become standard practice in
      antiretroviral therapy. Patients are instructed to take ritonavir at the same time as its
      accompanying protease inhibitor. However, ritonavir is unpopular with many patients because
      of its large size and because of the recommended need for refrigeration. This study will test
      the hypothesis that adherence to ritonavir is inferior to adherence to its accompanying
      protease inhibitor in patients receiving such therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study staff will employ MEMS caps to prospectively measure adherence to ritonavir and its
      accompanying protease inhibitor over 24 weeks of follow-up. Paired sample t-tests will be
      employed to compare adherence to the two agents, and secondary analyses will be conducted to
      evaluate the chronologic concordance of ritonavir and accompanying protease inhibitor dosing.
