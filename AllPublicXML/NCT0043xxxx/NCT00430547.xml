  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether radioactive iodine, as compared to
      anti-thyroid medications, is a risk factor for the development or progression of
      thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy in patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease.
      The other aim of this study is to determine the incidence of the various ophthalmopathy
      subtypes and the utility of orbital antibodies in the diagnosis, classification and
      monitoring of patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy.
