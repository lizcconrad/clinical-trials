  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are several benefits of over-the-counter medications, yet there is little research
      evaluating how to increase patient compliance when a health care provider suggests an
      over-the-counter (OTC) medication. We are evaluating two types of physician directions to see
      which increases patient compliance with OTC medications.

    <textblock>
      Researchers will identify a cohort of gynecologic patients presenting for annual examinations
      and offer participation in the study. Physician researchers will randomize patients to 2
      types of physician directions about OTC medications, then follow compliance over the course
      of the next 7 months. A total of 123 participants in each arm will undergo recruitment, until
      a total of 246 participants are recruited.

      Inclusion criteria include: female, non-pregnant patients presenting for annual gynecologic
      examinations between the ages of 19-50.

      Exclusion criteria include: outside of study age range, patient taking thyroid medication,
      history of kidney stones, history of hypercalcemia, non-English speaking.
