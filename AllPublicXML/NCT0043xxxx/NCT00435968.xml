  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be asked to participate in a four day research study of the immune system
      effects and safety of short-term acute dosing of Cold-fX.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of acute dosing of Cold-fX for 3 days on
      the immune system compared to a placebo (dummy pill). Safety of the acute dosing will be
      determined through various blood tests carried out during the study.

      Eligible volunteers from Hackensack University Medical Centre will be randomly assigned to
      either the treatment or placebo group with equal numbers in each group.

      The treatment will consist of taking three capsules of CVT-E002 (600mg) or placebo three
      times daily on Day 1, two capsules of CVT-E002 (400mg) or placebo three times daily on Day 2
      and one capsule of CVT-E002 (200mg) or placebo three times daily on Day 3.

      A fasting blood sample will be collected on all 4 days of study participation. Immunological
      assays and blood chemisty safety tests will be performed on the samples. Serum samples will
      also be collected and stored until futher analysis for various cytokines.

      Any adverse events experienced during this study will be documented.
