      RATIONALE: Identifying genes related to cancer may help in the study of cancer. It may also
      help doctors predict who is at risk of developing neuroblastoma.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at genes in participants with neuroblastoma or
      noncancerous conditions.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Perform a whole genome scan for association of neuroblastoma with single nucleotide
           polymorphisms (SNP) and SNP haplotypes.

        -  Identify true disease-associated SNP alleles using a customized genotyping platform
           enriched for haplotype analyses in an independent sample set.

        -  Validate disease-associated SNP alleles and haplotypes in a final independent sample
           set.

        -  Identify neuroblastoma predisposition genes.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Participants are stratified according to presence of
      high-risk disease (yes vs no) and MYCN amplification (yes vs no).

      DNA samples are derived from participants' banked blood or uninvolved bone marrow. A whole
      genome scan of DNA samples is employed to identify candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs). The candidate SNPs are investigated, using a gene-centric haplotyping approach, to
      identify 10-20 true disease-associated alleles. The disease-associated alleles are again
      investigated, using a gene-centric haplotyping approach, to validate 5-10 disease-associated
      SNPs. SNPs are then analyzed for heritable predisposition.

      Patients do not receive the results of the genetic testing.

      A certificate of confidentiality protecting the identity of research participants in this
      project has been issued by the Children's Oncology Group.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4,675 patients and 4,675 controls will be accrued for this
      study.
