  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically changed the
      consequences of an HIV infection, which is now viewed as a chronic disease. As in other
      chronic diseases, emotional distress and depressive symptoms are highly prevalent in
      HIV-infected patients. Psychological factors such as these have been associated with lower
      quality of life, lower adherence to therapy and also with a higher risk for mortality and
      disease progression. Psychosocial interventions, such as group-based cognitive behavioral
      stress management (CBSM) training, have been shown to reduce distress and psychological
      symptoms in HIV-infected patients. These psychosocial effects are paralleled by changes in
      physiological parameters, such as cortisol, DHEA-S, testosterones, catecholamines, and naïve
      T-cell counts. While these results are congruent with recent evidence of the interaction
      between psychological, neuroendocrine and immunological parameters in HIV-infected patients,
      it needs to be shown whether the reported effects hold true in the HAART era. Most
      importantly, it also needs to be ascertained whether these interventions have an impact on
      immunological and virological HIV parameters as well as on mortality and morbidity in HIV
      patients. We propose a randomized controlled one-year prospective evaluation of a group-based
      CBSM training in 80 HIV-infected patients. Participating patients will be recruited at
      cooperating centers of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and randomly assigned to CBSM training or
      waiting control group condition. At baseline, post-training and two follow-up (6 and 12
      months) assessments, effects of the CBSM on psychological, physiological and clinical
      out-come variables in HIV-infected patients under HAART will be evaluated. Additionally, the
      effects of CBSM on the neuroendocrine and autonomic stress reactivity in HIV-infected
      patients will be assessed, thus evaluating a possible direct pathway between emotional
      distress and physiological HIV-relevant parameters. In conclusion, the planned research
      project evaluates the effectiveness of a standardized psychosocial intervention as a possible
      component of a comprehensive disease management in HIV-infected patients under HAART.
