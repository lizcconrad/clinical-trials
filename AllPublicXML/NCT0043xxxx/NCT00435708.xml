  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the UK's fastest growing fatal disease and is
      estimated to cost the health service close to Â£1 billion every year. Around 80,000 people in
      Northern Ireland suffer from COPD. COPD is clinically defined as a slowly progressive
      condition characterised by airflow limitation, which is largely irreversible. Chronic
      inflammation and oxidative stress are key components of the underlying pathological process
      resulting in airflow limitation. Dietary factors and nutrients that have antioxidant or
      anti-inflammatory properties are therefore of interest with respect to the aetiology of COPD.
      The antioxidant vitamins C, E and beta-carotene are all present in the lung milieu. Such
      antioxidants represent the lung's first line of defence against oxygen free radicals.
      Observational studies indicate that a low dietary intake of antioxidant nutrients, or foods
      rich in antioxidants (e.g. fruit and vegetables), is associated with decreased lung function
      and increased risk of COPD. To date, there have been no food-based dietary interventions
      investigating the effect of increased fruit and vegetable intake on COPD. The investigators
      propose to recruit people with mild to moderate COPD and low fruit and vegetable intakes (&lt;=2
      portions daily) and randomise them to one of two study arms for 12 weeks - either to increase
      fruit and vegetable consumption to at least 5 portions a day, or to follow their normal diet.
      Airway and systemic oxidative stress and inflammation will be assessed at baseline and
      post-intervention in order to determine if fruit and vegetables have the potential to
      alleviate the oxidative stress and airway inflammation associated with COPD.
