  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will introduce a triage liaison physician (TLP) into the
      University of Alberta Hospital Emergency Department (ED) and assess the influence on patients
      who leave without being seen, ED length of stay, and other ED Overcrowding outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ED Overcrowding is a significant cause of delayed care, patient dissatisfaction, and poor
      outcomes in North American EDs. This intervention has not been widely studied; however, it
      represents an opportunity for improving patient flows in EDs.
