  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with ErbB2 overexpressing breast cancer that has spread to the
      brain and is still progressing there even after radiation treatment using WBRT (whole brain
      radiotherapy) or SRS (stereotactic radiosurgery) to the brain. The study will determine how
      safe and effective lapatinib is when given in combination with capecitabine to treat patients
      with ErbB2 overexpressing breast cancer that has spread to the brain. Lapatinib is an oral
      drug that will be taken every day. Tests for safety and efficacy will be performed regularly
      during the course of the study.

    <time_frame>From the start of treatment until disease progression, death, or discontinuation from the study, up to a maximum of Week 88</time_frame>
    <description>CNS OR is defined as the number of participants with either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by volumetric analysis of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR: complete resolution of all evaluable and non-evaluable brain metastases; PR: =&gt;50% reduction in the volumetric sum of all evaluable brain metastases compared to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With the Indicated CNS Responses</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of treatment until disease progression, death, or discontinuation from the study, up to a maximum of Week 88</time_frame>
    <description>CNS responses were assessed by volumetric (V) analysis of brain MRI and RECIST. CR: complete resolution of all evaluable and non-evaluable brain metastases (BMs). PR: =&gt;50% reduction in the V sum of all evaluable BMs compared to baseline. A response of &quot;Other&quot; was used for participants who discontinued the study prior to the first efficacy assessment. Stable Disease (SD): disease that does not meet CR, PR, or CNS progression criteria. Progressive disease (PD): a requirement for a new steroid or an increasing steroid dose for the treatment of worsening neurological signs/symptoms due to BMs.</description>

    <description>CNS OR is defined as the number of participants with either a CR or PR as assessed by volumetric analysis of brain MRI and RECIST. CR: complete resolution of all evaluable and non-evaluable brain metastases; PR: =&gt;50% reduction in the volumetric sum of all evaluable brain metastases compared to baseline.

    <description>Non-CNS disease (for par. with measurable baseline non-CNS disease) OR is defined as the number of par. with either a CR or PR as assessed by computed tomography (CT) or MRI scan and RECIST. CR: disappearance of all target lesions; PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. This study was closed before full enrollment was achieved; thus, predefined secondary efficacy endpoints were not assessed because there were not enough par. enrolled in the study to provide statistically valid analyses.</description>

    <description>CNS OR is defined as the number of participants with either a CR or PR as assessed by volumetric analysis of brain MRI and RECIST. CR: complete resolution of all evaluable and non-evaluable brain metastases; PR: =&gt;50% reduction in the volumetric sum of all evaluable brain metastases compared to baseline.

    <time_frame>From the start of treatment until disease progression, death, or discontinuation from the study, up to a maximum of Week 88</time_frame>
    <description>The site of initial disease will be determined by taking the earliest date of known progression and assigning the appropriate category (CNS or non-CNS) based on the source of the earliest date.

    <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment until the first documented sign of disease progression at any site or death due to any cause, if sooner. This study was closed before full enrollment was achieved; thus, predefined secondary efficacy endpoints were not assessed because there were not enough participants enrolled in the study to provide statistically valid analyses.</description>

    <description>TR NSS was to be recorded by the Investigator on the NEW, using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0 (CTCAE V3.0). Improvement was to be defined as a decrease of 1 or more CTCAE grades from baseline of any TR NSS. This study was closed before full enrollment was achieved; thus, predefined secondary efficacy endpoints were not assessed because there were not enough participants enrolled in the study to provide statistically valid analyses.</description>

    <time_frame>From the start of treatment until disease progression, death, or discontinuation from the study, up to a maximum of Week 88</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage participants with disease stabiliztion for 6 months or more were defined as those treated participants with a best CNS objective response of SD whose disease stabilization lasted 6 months or more from the start of treatment. This study was closed before full enrollment was achieved; thus, predefined secondary efficacy endpoints were not assessed because there were not enough participants enrolled in the study to provide statistically valid analyses.</description>

        <description>Non-CNS disease (for par. with measurable baseline non-CNS disease) OR is defined as the number of par. with either a CR or PR as assessed by computed tomography (CT) or MRI scan and RECIST.

          <title>Percentage of Participants With a &gt;=20% Volumetric Reduction in CNS Lesions</title>
          <description>The percentage of participants with a &gt;=20% volumetric reduction in CNS lesions was defined as the percentage of treated participants achieving at least a 20% volumetric reduction in CNS lesions relative to baseline. This study was closed before full enrollment was achieved; thus, predefined secondary efficacy endpoints were not assessed because there were not enough participants enrolled in the study to provide statistically valid analyses.</description>
