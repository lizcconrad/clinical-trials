      The purpose of this study is to examine the short and long-term benefits of implementing
      early regional anesthesia techniques for pain control after a major traumatic injury to one
      or more extremities during combat in the Iraqi/Afghanistan war, including the effects on
      acute and chronic pain, quality of life, and mental health.

      BACKGROUND:

      Adequate pain management for combat casualties balances the need for emergent, life-saving
      care with the urgency to remove soldiers from harm's way. Control of pain in traumatic
      battlefield situations may be impossible until safe evacuation to a surgical facility is
      achieved and a wounded soldier can receive general anesthesia. Recent evidence suggests that
      neural plasticity in the central nervous system coupled with hyperstimulation of central
      neuronal pathways lead to neuropathological remodeling. This neural rewiring may result in
      chronic pain for patients who have experienced severe, unrelieved acute pain. In addition,
      the stress of combat along with the suffering of prolonged uncontrolled pain may contribute
      to psychological disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and substance
      abuse.

      OBJECTIVE:

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of early and aggressive advanced regional
      anesthesia on the chronic neuropathic pain, health related quality of life, and mental health
      of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) Veterans who have
      suffered a major limb injury in combat. An additional aim of this study is to quantify and
      characterize the short-term and long-term effects of traumatic combat limb injuries on
      post-injury acute pain, chronic pain, health related quality of life, functional status,
      social reintegration, psychological adjustment, and substance abuse behaviors in a population
      of injured military personnel.

      METHOD:

      This study employs a cohort repeated measures study design involving prospective data
      collection at scheduled intervals. Interviews with participants provide data on pain
      outcomes, psychiatric morbidities, and quality of life. Follow up evaluations conclude at the
      two year anniversary of the start of combat injury rehabilitation. Medical records
      information collected retrospectively from armed services treatment facilities provide data
      on the use of pain management therapies as well as individual responses to regional
      anesthesia.

      IMPLICATIONS FOR RESULTS:

      The findings of this study may impact the clinical field by providing information on the
      effectiveness and benefits of early advanced regional anesthesia for chronic pain control.
      This study may also provide data to determine whether regional anesthesia pain treatments
      prevent or reduce the development of psychological maladjustment disorders such as
      post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and substance abuse in a population of military
      personnel with combat limb injuries.

    <measure>SF-36 Physical Component Summary</measure>
    <time_frame>Means of the individuals aggregated to the cohort level from start of rehabilitation for combat injury, month 0, to end of study follow up, at 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Physical component score (PCS) is an aggregate of the eight subscale scores measuring physical components with each subscale ranging from worst possible health, 0, to 100, the highest possible score and therefore the optimal health state. After the eight scale scores are calculated, a z-score is calculated for each by subtracting the scale mean of a sample of the U.S. general population from an individual's scale score and then dividing by the standard deviation from the U.S. general population. Each of the eight z-scores is then multiplied by the corresponding factor scoring coefficient for the scale. The products of the z-scores and factor scoring coefficients for the PCS are then summed together. Each resulting sum is multiplied by 10 and added to 50 to linearly transform the PCS to the T-score metric, which has a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 for the U.S. general population (Taft et al., 2001) doi:10.1023/A:1012552211996</description>

          <description>Injury Severity Scores (ISS): ISS is a scale to evaluate anatomic injury severity following trauma that ranges from 0 to 75, with 75 indicating the greatest severity. An Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score is allocated to the six body regions (Head, Face, Chest, Abdomen, Extremities, and External). The highest AIS score in each body region is used. The 3 most severely injured body regions scores are squared and summed to produce the ISS. The ISS correlates linearly with mortality, morbidity, and hospital stay.</description>

        <description>The Brief Pain Inventory - Short form (BPI) is a 17-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess severity of pain and the degree to which pain interferes with common dimensions of feeling and function. BPI Item - Worst Pain asks the respondent to rate worst pain in the past week from the combat limb injury on a scale of 0 to 10, where &quot;0&quot; is no pain, and &quot;10&quot; is pain as bad as you can imagine.</description>

        <title>Brief Pain Inventory - Pain Interference</title>
        <description>The Brief Pain Inventory - Short form (BPI) is a 17-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess severity of pain and the degree to which pain interferes with common dimensions of feeling and function. The BPI measures how much pain has interfered with seven daily activities, including general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others, and sleep. BPI pain interference is scored as the mean of the seven interference items, each ranging 0 to 10, where &quot;0&quot; is pain from combat limb injury does not interfere and &quot;10&quot; is pain from combat limb injury completely interferes with this aspect of daily life.</description>

        <description>The Physical component score (PCS) is an aggregate of the eight subscale scores measuring physical components with each subscale ranging from worst possible health, 0, to 100, the highest possible score and therefore the optimal health state. After the eight scale scores are calculated, a z-score is calculated for each by subtracting the scale mean of a sample of the U.S. general population from an individual’s scale score and then dividing by the standard deviation from the U.S. general population. Each of the eight z-scores is then multiplied by the corresponding factor scoring coefficient for the scale. The products of the z-scores and factor scoring coefficients for the PCS are then summed together. Each resulting sum is multiplied by 10 and added to 50 to linearly transform the PCS to the T-score metric, which has a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 for the U.S. general population (Taft et al., 2001) doi:10.1023/A:1012552211996</description>
