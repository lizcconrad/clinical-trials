      This will be a multi-centre, double-blind, within-subject, placebo controlled randomised
      trial in female subjects. All subjects will undergo bilateral breast augmentation surgery.
      Immediately following surgery, each subject will receive 100µl containing 50ng or 200ng of
      RN1001 per linear centimetre intradermally into both margins of one breast wound, and 100µl
      of placebo solution per linear centimetre intradermally into both margins of their other
      breast wound. The allocation of treatment to wound (left or right) will be randomised and
      double blind.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects between 18 and 60 years of age undergoing bilateral breast
             augmentation through an infra-mammary fold incision who have given written informed
             consent.

          -  Weight between 50 and 150kg and a body mass index within the permitted range for their
             height using Quetelet's index-weight (kg)/height²(m). The permitted index is between
             15-55.

          -  Subjects of child bearing potential who are using method(s) of contraception
             acceptable to the Investigator and agree to do so from at least the screening visit
             until 1 month post surgery.

          -  Subjects where the same implant position will be used for each breast; the implants
             can be placed in sub-mammary or sub-pectoral pockets.

          -  Subjects where the same type and size of implant is to be used for each breast.

          -  Subjects with, in the opinion of the Investigator, clinically acceptable results for
             the laboratory tests specified in the trial protocol . All laboratory tests must be
             performed within 28 days prior to Day 0.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with significant breast asymmetry where this may produce a different length
             or site of wound, or where there will be a different post-operative tension on the
             wound.

          -  Subjects who on direct questioning and physical examination have a history or evidence
             of hypertrophic or keloid scarring.

          -  Subjects who have had surgery in the area to be incised within one year of Day 0.

          -  Subjects with a personal history of a bleeding disorder.

          -  Subjects with any history of breast malignancy.

          -  Subjects with a skin disorder that is chronic or currently active and which the
             Investigator considers will adversely affect the healing of the acute wounds or
             involves the areas to be examined in this trial.

          -  Subjects who on direct questioning and/or physical examination, have evidence of any
             past or present clinically significant medical condition that would impair wound
             healing.

          -  Subjects with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity to any of the drugs
             or surgical dressings to be used in this trial.

          -  Subjects who are taking, or have taken, any investigational drugs including RN1001
             within 3 months prior to the screening visit.

          -  Subjects who are taking regular, continuous, oral corticosteroid therapy.

          -  Subjects undergoing investigations or changes in management for an existing medical
             condition.

          -  Subjects who are or who become pregnant up to and including Day 0 or who are
             lactating.

          -  Subjects with diseases or conditions that could in the opinion of the Investigator
             interfere with the assessment of safety, tolerability and efficacy.

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, a subject who is not likely to complete the trial
             for what ever reason.
