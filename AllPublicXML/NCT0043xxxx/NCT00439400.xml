  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of doxycycline 0.025%
      (ALTY-0501) ophthalmic solution for the treatment of dry eye using the Controlled Adverse
      Environment (CAE) Model.

      Dry eye is the most prevalent form of ocular discomfort and irritation. Estimates range up to
      20 million people in the US being affected with mild dry eye, and the literature reports that
      as many as 3.2 million American women suffer from clinically significant dry eye.(Schaumberg
      et al, 2003). Dry eye can be related to external factors, such as the low humidity of air
      conditioned offices, winter heating, a dusty or windy outdoor environment, prolonged use of
      computers, or wearing of contact lenses, as well as to internal factors, such as hormonal
      imbalance, autoimmune disease, the presence of many widely prescribed systemic medications,
      anatomical changes or trauma, and aging. Chronic dry eye disease is associated with an
      immune-based inflammation of the lacrimal glands and the ocular surface. Symptoms result in
      mildly decreased quality of life at a minimum, and with increasing severity, loss of function
      and productivity, pain, light sensitivity, and the misery that accompanies significantly
      impaired vision and decreased quality of life. With the aging population in the United States
      and other countries of the developed world, and with increasing computer use, dry eye will
      become more prevalent.

      Doxycycline is a well established anti-infective drug, and has been used systemically by
      ophthalmologists to treat moderate to severe case of blepharitis for years. Recently it has
      been demonstrated that doxycycline in low, non-antimicrobial concentrations also has powerful
      anti-proteolytic and anti-inflammatory properties. Anecdotal reports on the use of 0.025%
      doxycyline eyedrops in human patients with dry eye and/or meibomian gland disease indicate a
      significant improvement in ocular surface staining and a significant decrease in patient
      symptoms.

          -  Are able and willing to follow instructions, including participation in study
             assessments, and can be present for the required study visits for the duration of the
             study;

          -  Have a diagnosis of dry eye associated with meibomian gland disease; A fluorescein
             staining staining score of ≥ 1+ in at least one region of the cornea; Presence of
             eyelid telangiectasia and/or inspissation or metaplasia of meibomian gland orifices;
             An ocular dryness score of ≥1+;

          -  Have a TFBUT ≤ 7 seconds in at least one eye at Visit 1;

          -  Have a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of +0.7 or better assessed by Early
             Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale in both eyes at Visit 1;

          -  (If female and of childbearing potential) Are not pregnant, nursing, or planning a
             pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential are required to have a negative urine
             pregnancy test at the screening and exit visits and agree to use an acceptable method
             of contraception for the duration of the study;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have anterior blepharitis, which is deemed clinically significant and/or likely to
             interfere with study parameters in the opinion of the investigator;

          -  Are diagnosed with an on-going ocular infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal), or
             active ocular inflammation (e.g., follicular conjunctivitis);

          -  Report an ocular discomfort score of 4 in both eyes at time 0 of CAE exposure at Visit
             2;

          -  Wear contact lenses within 1 week of Visit 1 or throughout the course of the study;

          -  Have contact lens-induced dry eye;

          -  Have previously had laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery;

             investigator could interfere with study measurements or subject compliance;

          -  Are currently taking (at Visit 1) any medication known to cause ocular drying that has
             not been used on a stable dosing regimen for 30 days prior to Visit 1;

          -  Are currently pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy;
