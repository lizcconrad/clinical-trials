  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare two common ways of rehabilitating after proximal
      humerus fractures treated non-operatively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proximal humerus fractures with limited displacement and fractures that occur in older, less
      active or infirm patients are treated non-operatively. There is a general impression,
      supported by some data, that better function is obtained with immediate initiation of
      shoulder exercises. However, there is some concern that this may contribute to nonunion of
      the fracture and may be unnecessary. Some researchers have demonstrated better outcomes with
      immediate rehabilitation with pendulum movements. Others have shown similar functional
      outcomes when rehabilitation begins approximately a month after injury, or when radiographs
      show signs of bone healing, and this delay is associated with lower rates of non-union and
      malunion occurrence.
