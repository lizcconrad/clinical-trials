  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we have evaluated the effects of three different doses of oral testosterone
      undecanoate in aging men presenting with a combination of symptoms suggestive of hypogonadism
      and low blood levels of the male hormone testosterone.

      Specifically, we have studied the effects on:

        -  symptoms suggestive of low testosterone levels

        -  blood testosterone and other hormone levels

        -  bone mass

        -  muscle mass and fat mass

        -  muscle strength

        -  prostate

        -  lipids, hematocrit

             or any clinically relevant cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, endocrine, hepatic, renal
             or hematological disease, thromboembolism/thrombosis etc. which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might compromise the subject's participation in the trial

          -  Use of medication that would interfere with the efficacy and safety objectives of the
