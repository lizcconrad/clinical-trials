  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the impact of a pharmacist's recommendations
      regarding choice, dosing and duration of antibiotic therapy on quality and cost of antibiotic
      treatment on surgical wards.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inappropriate or incorrect use of antibacterials exerts selection pressure on pathogens
      potentiating emergence of resistance, puts patients at risk for unnecessary adverse drug
      reactions and potentially prolongs the length of stay in hospital thus increasing healthcare
      costs.

      In an effort to improve the quality of antibiotic drug therapy on surgical wards of a large
      university hospital, specific consulting by a clinical pharmacist was established.

      The objective of this study is to assess the impact of pharmaceutical consulting on the
      quality and costs of antibiotic use in surgical wards.

      Comparison:

      Within a control period the current pattern of antibiotic use is monitored. During the
      intervention period, the impact of the interventions made by the clinical pharmacist on
      antibiotic use is examined. One ward serves as a parallel control group; no intervention is
      being made on this ward throughout this study.
