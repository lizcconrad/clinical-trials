      The purpose of this study is:

        -  To elucidate the immunomodulating properties of anti-TNF-α therapy in patients with
           psoriatic arthritis (PsA).

        -  To ascertain whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive tool in measuring
           early response after therapy with anti-TNF-α in the PsA wrist using the Outcome Measures
           in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials (OMERACT) guidelines for rheumatoid arthritis
           (RA).

        -  To assess whether the lipid and other cardiovascular risk profiles would improve after
           anti-TNF-α therapy in patients with PsA.

      The study was a 12-week, open-label trial of anti-TNF therapy in 20 consecutive patients
      (Group 1). Another 20 consecutive patients with active disease whom have met the exclusion
      criteria, or were unwilling to start anti-TNF therapy for fear of toxicity would be recruited
      as control patients (Group 2). 20 healthy controls were recruited for comparison of the
      metabolic risk factors (Group 3). Study visits for groups 1 and 2 were conducted at baseline,
      weeks 2 and 6, and then week 12.
