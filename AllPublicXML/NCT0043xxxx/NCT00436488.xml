  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The genetic contribution to the development of obesity is now well recognized. However
      obesity is a polygenic disease and thus many genes are likely to be involved. This study aims
      to investigate the possible association between specific variants of the gene coding for the
      Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1)and the development of severe obesity in an Italian
      population

      Severely obese subjects referred to our institution will be evaluated. For the aim of the
      study, a venous blood sample will be obtained from these subjects and from a group of normal
      weight volunteers. Genomic DNA will be extracted from the blood samples and analysed by
      standard molecular biology techniques.The allelic and genotype frequencies of the two ICAM-1
      variants will be calculated in the obese and control groups. The statistical significance of
      possible differences will be determined
