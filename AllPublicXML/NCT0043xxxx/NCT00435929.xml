  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2 arm study will assess the effect of moderate liver impairment on the pharmacokinetics
      of saquinavir and ritonavir at steady state following administration of saquinavir/ritonavir
      1000mg/100mg po bid in HIV patients. Saquinavir/ritonavir will be administered concomitantly
      with 2 to 3 active nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The study will compare a
      group of HIV patients without known liver disease and a group with moderate liver disease.
      The anticipated time on study treatment is &lt;3 months, and the target sample size is &lt;100
      individuals.

AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) and American Heart Association (AHA) criteria were used to grade COG laboratory test values. Laboratory parameters for which an increase to Grade 3 (G3) or Grade 4 (G4) occurred are presented in the table below.</description>
          <population>Safety population: All participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication (whether or not they were withdrawn prematurely) and had safety follow-up data were included in safety analysis.</population>
