    <textblock>
      Aim:

      To investigate the quality of history taking by physician and computer-based system.

      Patients:

      100 inpatients presenting at the RBK for the first time and treated in the departments of
      nephrology and cardiology.

      Methods:

      The information obtained by the computer based system is compared with the information
      acquired by conventional history taking. Study endpoint is the comparison of historical data
      organized according to the elements in a standard medical history on a patient-by-patient
      basis.

      Study procedure History taking is performed by physicians according to the guidelines of the
      RBK. Within 2 days thereafter the patient is interviewed with help of the CLEOS system with
      the support of a study nurse.

      Aim:

      To compare the completeness of history taking by physicians and by a computerized system
      interacting directly with the patients. Historical data recorded in the patient record,
      including the discharge letter, were compared with the history acquired by computer-based
      interview of each patient.

      Patients:

      100 inpatients presenting at the RBK for the first time and treated in the departments of
      nephrology and cardiology.

      Methods:

      The information obtained by the computer based system is compared with the information
      acquired by conventional history taking. Study endpoint is the comparison of historical data
      organized according to the elements in a standard medical history on a patient-by-patient
      basis.

      Study procedure After informed consent of the patients the procedure of history taking is
      performed by the physician according to the guidelines of the RBK. Within 2 days thereafter
      the patient is interviewed with help of the CLEOS system [a computer-based, history-taking
      program] with the support of a study nurse. The physician will be informed about the results
      immediately after completion of the questionnaire.

      Data of medical significance were extracted from the official hospital chart and the
      computerized history by clinically experienced physicians and tabulated on a
      patient-by-patient basis. data elements were compared across each category of the history for
      each patient interviewed. The relevance of the differences of the information obtained by the
      two systems was rated by an independent reviewer.

    <description>Data were extracted from hospital charts by to experienced physicians.; data from the computer histories were extracted by a senior physician, who tabulated comparisons between the 2 sets of records. We used the number of problems reported by Computer Assisted History that were not reported by Physician. Nurses at Robert Bosch Krankenhaus do not take medical histories in regard to allergies or adverse drug reactions. Pharmacists make no entries into charts and have no separate records of drug allergies or history of adverse drug reactions. Data on these issues either are obtained only by physician interview of the patient.</description>

The intervention was use of an expert system to acquire medical histories by direct interview of patients.
Description of the software program - The program tested in this study consisted of a data acquisition [history-taking] component and a data analysis component. The data acquisition component was constructed on the basis of established principles of pathophysiology. Medical knowledge was formalized as software algorithms that were machine-readable by representing the knowledge as branched chain decision trees.</description>
