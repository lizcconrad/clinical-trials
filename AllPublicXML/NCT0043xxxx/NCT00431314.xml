  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the vascular condition of hemodialysis patients with
      toe pressure measurement, finger pressure measurement and measuring glycated and oxidated
      proteins by skin autofluorescence.

      Hypothesis: Lowering of finger pressure/toe pressure during hemodialysis, especially in whom
      with a arteriovenous fistula, may contribute to critical limb ischemia in the extremities.

      1. To determine the macrovascular status of hemodialysis patients by measuring toe
           pressure, finger pressure and skin autofluorescence.

        2. Measuring toe- and finger pressure before and during hemodialysis to determine the
           chance of developing critical limb ischemia in the extremities.

        3. To assess the differences in finger pressure in hemodialysis patients before and during
           hemodialysis in patients with either arteriovenous fistula in the upper extremity or
           not.

        4. To predict mortality and cardiovascular disease by determine the fastness of
           accumulation of Advanced-Glycation-Endproducts (this concerns follow-up measurements of
           skin autofluorescence; another study has collected data of skin autofluorescence in
           hemodialysis patients in our centre in 2003)
