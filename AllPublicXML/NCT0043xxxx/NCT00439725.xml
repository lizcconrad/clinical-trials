  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven,
      superiority study for efficacy. Patients with confirmed symptomatic DVT (deep vein
      thrombosis) or PE (pulmonary embolism) who completed 6 or 12 months of treatment with
      rivaroxaban or VKA (vitamin K antagonist) are eligible for this trial (Einstein-Extension
      study).

      The treatment period was followed by an observational period of 30 days starting the day
      after the last intake of study medication, regardless of the actual duration of study drug
      administration. Participants who did not complete the treatment period also entered the
      observational period. It was also possible that participants did not enter the observational
      period, e.g. due to withdrawal of consent or termination of study participation.

    <description>All events were adjudicated and confirmed by a central independent adjudication committee blinded to treatment. Events were assessed based on either compression ultrasound (for DVT), venography (for DVT), spiral computed tomography (CT) scanning (for PE), pulmonary angiography (for PE), ventilation/perfusion lung scan (for PE), lung scintigraphy (for PE), autopsy (for fatal PE) or unexplained death for which DVT/PE could not be ruled out (for fatal PE), and/or case summaries.

          -  Legal lower age limitations (country specific)

          -  Indication for VKA other than DVT and/or PE

          -  Patients in whom anticoagulant treatment for their index PE or DVT should be continued

          -  Childbearing potential without proper contraceptive measures, pregnancy or breast
             feeding. Proper contraceptive measures are defined as a method of contraception with a
             failure rate &lt; 1 % during the course of the study (including the observational
             period). These methods of contraception according to the note for guidance on
             non-clinical safety studies for the conduct of human trials for pharmaceuticals (CPMP
             [Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products]/ICH [International Conference on
             Harmonization]/286/95, modification) include consistent and correct use of hormone
