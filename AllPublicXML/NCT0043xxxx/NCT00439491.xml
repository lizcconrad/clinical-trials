  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between insulin resistance and body
      composition in relation to secterion and expression of adipocytokines. Obese subjects undergo
      6 months hypocaloric diet and, before, during and at the end of the diet, plasma samples and
      subcutaneous adipose tissue samples are obtained for subsequent analysis. In addition, body
      composition and insulin resistance are measured before and during the diet.

      The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between insulin resistance and body
      composition in relation to secterion and expression of adipocytokines. Obese subjects undergo
      6 months hypocaloric diet without any medication and, before, during and at the end of the
      diet, plasma samples and subcutaneous adipose tissue samples are obtained for subsequent
      analysis. Adipose tissue samples are obtained using needle biopsy. In addition, before and
      during the diet,body composition is measured using multifrequency bioimpedance and insulin
      resistance is evaluated using either hyperinsulinemic clamp or glucose/insulin - derived
      indices.
