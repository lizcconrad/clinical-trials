  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study (CLN-504) is to determine the safety and develop a dosing
      regimen of an investigational anticoagulant drug (ATI-5923) in patients with atrial
      fibrillation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ATI-5923 is a structural analog of warfarin that is being developed as an oral anticoagulant.
      It has a similar pharmacological profile to warfarin but was designed to provide more uniform
      and stable anticoagulation. ATI-5923 is a selective, non-competitive inhibitor of vitamin K
      epoxide reductase. ATI-5923 is metabolized by esterase to a single inactive metabolite and
      thus is expected to have less variable metabolism, drug-drug interactions and reduced
      instances of under/over coagulation, making the response safer and more predictable. The
      primary purpose of this study is to develop a dosing regimen and INR monitoring schedule that
      can be applied in an outpatient setting to safely and conveniently anticoagulate patients
      with atrial fibrillation to a therapeutic INR. Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) were
      chosen for the study population of this trial because they require anticoagulation if they
      have risk factors for stroke.
