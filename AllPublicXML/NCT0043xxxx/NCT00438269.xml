  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection developing in the intensive care unit is a common complication of critical illness,
      but notoriously difficult to diagnose. A definite diagnosis based on the most reliable tests
      usually is not possible for at least two days. It is unclear what the optimal management
      approach should be while awaiting the results of diagnostic tests. In some circumstances,
      broad spectrum antibiotics are started with a plan to adjust them once the results of
      cultures are available. Observational studies show that this results in greater antibiotic
      use, and the risk of superinfection and resistance. In other circumstances, antibiotics may
      be withheld pending the results of cultures, a strategy that leads to a delay in therapy when
      cultures are positive, and that may be associated with a worse clinical outcome.

      We undertook a randomized pilot study to address the question: &quot;In a critically ill patient
      for whom clinicians are uncertain whether infection may be present, and in whom potential
      sites of infection have been managed by removing or changing invasive devices, can a policy
      of delaying antibiotic treatment until cultures are available reduce the risks of excessive
      antibiotic use, without increasing the risks associated with delayed therapy?&quot;

      Recognizing that the question has not been formally addressed before, and that approaches to
      clinical management are both widely divergent and passionately held, our pilot study tested
      the feasibility and acceptability of undertaking a larger trial with sufficient power to
      determine equivalence.

      We randomized critically ill patients who had been in hospital for at least 72 hours, and in
      the ICU for at least 24 hours, and who manifested either a temperature &gt;38.5 degrees, or a
      temperature&gt;38.0 degrees and a white cell count &gt;12,000, and in whom clinicians entertained
      the possibility of infection as a diagnosis, to either site-specific broad spectrum empiric
      antibiotics or the corresponding placebo. All patients underwent a comprehensive series of
      investigations to identify an infectious focus, and all patients had full source control,
      including changes of central lines and urinary catheters, and change of nasogastric to
      orogastric tubes.

      Patients were maintained in assigned study arm for seven days, or until culture data were
      available, at which time they were switched to culture-guided narrow spectrum therapy
