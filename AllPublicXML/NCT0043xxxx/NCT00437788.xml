  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whenever a scan is accessed through the PACS system a scanned document or digital picture may
      be displayed automatically. In this study the technician will take a digital picture of the
      patient who will be undergoing the CT scan. This way the radiologist will be able to view the
      patient's face before viewing the scan.

      The hypothesis is that viewing a digital picture of the patient before viewing the CT scan
      will improve the quality of diagnosis.
