      -  To determine the total and local gray matter volumes, and N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)
           levels in patients with bipolar disorders who are within euthimic, depressive or
           manic/hypomanic period and who are not taking drug;

        -  To investigate the neuroprotective effects of long-term (6 weeks) use of valproate on
           total and local gray matter volumes and NAA levels.

        -  To measure the brain electrical response to visual and auditory impulses before and
           after valproate treatment in patients within euthimic, depressive or manic/hypomanic
           period and who are not taking drug, and to compare the data with each other and with
           normal groups.

        -  To determine the cognitive functions before and after the valproate treatment in the
           same patient group, to compare the data with each other and with age- and sex-paired
           normal controls;

        -  To determine the relationship between these effects of valproate and clinical
           improvement;

        -  To investigate the relationship between cognitive ability status and electrical activity
           of brain, to compare this with that in control group; to determine the relationship
           between the data and brain imaging (MRI/MRS) findings in conjunction with localization
