  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes are 1. to measure the effect of dialysis with glucose in dialysis water on blood
      pressure, pulse rate, plasma concentration of glucose, plasma concentrations og insulin,
      glucagon, growth hormone, renin, angiotensin II, endothelin and body temperature, and 2. to
      analyse the relationship between the changes in blood pressure and changes in vasoactive
      hormones
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between blood pressure during dialysis treatment and vasoactive hormones are
      studied. This includes measurements of plasma concentration of glucose, plasma concentrations
      og insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, renin, angiotensin II, endothelin
