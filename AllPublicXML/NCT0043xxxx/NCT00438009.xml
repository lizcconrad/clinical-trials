      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of two doses of
      Coxsackievirus A21, administered 48 hours apart into a superficial melanoma tumour.

      Injected and non-injected tumours will be observed regarding change in tumour size.

      Coxsackievirus A21 (CVA21) is a naturally occurring virus, that is known to cause self
      limiting upper respiratory infections. CVA21 has been shown in cell culture to infect and
      kill human melanoma cancer cell lines. This property of CVA21 is due to the specific
      receptors CVA21 uses in order to attach to, and infect a cell. The 2 receptors CVA21 uses to
      infect a cell are Intracellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and Decay Accelerating Factor.
      Both of these surface proteins are expressed on melanoma cell lines as well as human melanoma
      tumours. Animal models of human melanoma tumours have demonstrated that CVA21 injection
      either intratumour or intravenous causes infection in the tumours, resulting in reduction of
      tumour size and growth.

          -  Patients must have adequate hematological, renal and hepatic function

          -  Failed or refused standard treatment (s)

          -  Patients are able and willing to provide signed/informed consent to participate in the
             study.

          -  Fertile males and females must agree to the use of adequate form of contraception, eg.
             Condoms for males

          -  Negative pregnancy test is required for female patients of child bearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Mucosal or ocular tumour

          -  Presence of CNS tumour

          -  Radiotherapy to the injection tumour site.

          -  Prior local radiotherapy without subsequent nodule progression

          -  Chemotherapy within 4 weeks of screening visit.
