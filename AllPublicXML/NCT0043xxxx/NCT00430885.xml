    <textblock>
      The instigators hypothesize that IVIG, given in the acute phase following MI in patients at
      risk for developing HF, will improve cardiac performance, and by attenuating cardiac
      remodeling in this phase, such therapy will prevent the development of chronic HF resulting
      in long term beneficial effect also after the therapy has been stopped.

      This double-blind placebo-controlled study represents a new approach to cardiovascular
      disease. The project deals with unresolved issues in the intersection between cardiology,
      immunology and molecular biology.

      IVIG/placebo will be given as an induction therapy for 5 days and thereafter as monthly
      infusions for 5 months. Change in left ventricular remodeling will be assessed at baseline,
      and 6 and 12 months with MRI and echocardiography.

      The objectives are:

        1. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect on IVIG on LV remodeling
           and function: LV remodeling will be evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
           which offers an unsurpassed precision in the measurements of heart volumes and function.
           End points will be LV-end systolic and diastolic volume (LVESV, LVEDV), regional wall
           motion score index (WMSI), and LV-ejection fraction (LV-EF).

        2. The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect on IVIG on the
           myocardial marker B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP). BNP is a sensitive marker of the
           degree of HF besides being a prognostic indicator 18-20.

        3. The tertiary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect on IVIG on:

           a. Quality of life. b. Effect on New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class. c.
           Effect on immunological variables. i. Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-6,
           IL-18. ii. Anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta
           iii. Chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, IL-8 and CCL21. iv.
           Regulators of hypertrophy such as matrix metalloproteinases, their endogenous inhibitors
           (i.e., TIMPs) and procollagen III N-terminal.

           d. Effect on neurohormones. e. Withdrawals. f. Side effects.
