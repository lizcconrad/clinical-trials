  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic syndrome has been recognized as a proinflammatory state. It has been shown that
      many different diets such as Mediterranean diet, DASH diet, Foods with low glycemic index and
      low saturated fat diet, independent of weight loss, may be effective in improving the
      metabolic syndrome. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of Ramadan fasting on
      High-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and fibrinogen levels in metabolic syndrome.
