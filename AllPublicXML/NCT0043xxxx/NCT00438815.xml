  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeat use of C1INH-nf for the
      treatment of acute HAE attacks.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 113 subjects were enrolled in the study. One-hundred-one (101) subjects received
      C1INH-nf for the treatment of 1 or more HAE attacks and were analyzed for efficacy. The study
      design also allowed for short-term prophylaxis with C1INH-nf prior to emergency or
      non-cosmetic surgical or dental procedures, and an additional 12 subjects received C1INH-nf
      only for this purpose. All 113 subjects were exposed to C1INH-nf and analyzed for safety.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of HAE Attacks With Substantial Relief of the Defining Symptom</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 4 hours after initial treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were to assess their symptoms every 15 minutes up to 4 hours after the initial dose or until substantial relief of the defining symptom was achieved. The conservative analysis defined substantial relief as 3 consecutive assessments of improvement of the defining symptom; any attack that did not have 3 consecutive documented reports of improvement was considered a treatment failure. In the less conservative analysis, attacks also were considered to have responded if clinical improvement of the defining symptom occurred but data were incomplete due to cessation of symptom assessments.</description>

    <measure>Time to Beginning of Substantial Relief of the Defining Symptom</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 4 hours after initial treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were to assess their symptoms every 15 minutes up to 4 hours after the initial dose or until substantial relief of the defining symptom was achieved. Substantial relief was defined as 3 consecutive assessments of improvement of the defining symptom. Beginning of substantial relief was considered the first of the 3 consecutive assessments.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Beginning of Substantial Relief of the Defining Symptom for Subjects Who Received Multiple Treatments</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 4 hours after initial treatment</time_frame>
    <description>For attack number 1, the number of censored observations precluded estimation of the 95% confidence interval (CI) upper bound for median time to event (subjects who did not experience beginning of substantial relief of the defining symptom within 4 hours after initial treatment were included in the analysis as censored observations). Entry of 4.0 hours indicates that data were not estimable (NE); as non-numeric data are not supported by the 95% CI field, entry of the actual result (ie, NE or &gt;4.0) was not possible.</description>

Entry of 4.0 hours indicates that data were not estimable (NE); as non-numeric data are not supported by the 95% CI field, entry of the actual result (ie, NE or &gt;4.0) was not possible.</description>

        <title>Percent of HAE Attacks With Substantial Relief of the Defining Symptom</title>
        <description>Subjects were to assess their symptoms every 15 minutes up to 4 hours after the initial dose or until substantial relief of the defining symptom was achieved. The conservative analysis defined substantial relief as 3 consecutive assessments of improvement of the defining symptom; any attack that did not have 3 consecutive documented reports of improvement was considered a treatment failure. In the less conservative analysis, attacks also were considered to have responded if clinical improvement of the defining symptom occurred but data were incomplete due to cessation of symptom assessments.</description>
