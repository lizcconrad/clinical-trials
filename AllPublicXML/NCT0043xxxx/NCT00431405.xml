  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a symmetric, peripheral polyarthritis of uncertain etiology that
      can lead to joint deformity and destruction. However, the effects of RA are not confined
      simply to joint involvement. Virtually every organ system can be affected by RA if left
      untreated. Of particular note is RAâ€™s affect on the cardiovascular system. RA patients have a
      reduced lifespan compared to the general population primarily due to an increased
      cardiovascular disease burden (1). Recently, RA has been linked to the development of
      preclinical atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries as measured by ultrasonography (2). Women
      with RA have also been shown to have an increased incidence of nonfatal myocardial
      infarctions (3). Despite these studies showing the effects of RA on the cardiovascular
      disease burden of those who are afflicted, no study to date has compared the number of
      cardiovascular events in a large RA patient population to a risk factor and age matched
      control group. Consequently it is the goal of this study to determine whether the
      cardiovascular event ratio in an RA patient cohort exceeds an age and risk factor matched
      cohort of non-RA patients. This study will also attempt to ascertain whether specific
      cardiovascular risk factors contribute to the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
      associated with RA and if any standard cardiovascular medicines disproportionately contribute
      to patient outcome.

      Hypothesis: Given the increased cardiovascular disease burden associated with RA patients
      they are likely to suffer from a statistically significant increased risk of cardiovascular
      events when compared to an age and risk factor matched cohort.
