  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common cause of illness in patients who have undergone a
      transplant. Serious infections due to CMV can affect many parts of the body including the
      lungs, the gut, and the liver. Since transplant recipients are at risk for CMV or have
      evidence of infection with CMV, they are given an antiviral drug (usually ganciclovir or
      valganciclovir). Despite this, there are a chance that CMV infection may cause problems in
      the future. The purpose of this study is to assess how well patients'immune systems responds
      to the CMV virus, so that in the future it may be possible to predict which patients are at
      highest risk of CMV.
