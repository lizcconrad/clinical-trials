      Assess the dietary intake of children aged 6-12 years by means of a 24-hour recall and 3-day
      food record and asses the nutrient status of Vitamin B6, serum ferritin, serum zinc and serum
      copper of the same children by means of standard laboratory assessments.

      -  To document the use of vitamin and vitamin-mineral supplements

        -  To determine the percent consumption of low nutrient density (LND) foods

        -  To compare the dietary intake of ADHD children with the established standards of the
           Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)

        -  To compare the dietary intake of children with ADHD to the dietary recommendations of
           Canada’s Food Guide for Healthy Eating

        -  To determine whether dietary intake is moderated by drug treatment

        -  To assess the pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP), serum ferritin, serum zinc, and serum copper
           status of ADHD by standard laboratory blood test

        -  to measure height and weight in ADHD children
