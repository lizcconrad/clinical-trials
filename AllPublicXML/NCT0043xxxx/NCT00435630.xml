      The purpose of this study is to determine the learning curve for each of seven tasks in a
      virtual reality laparoscopic simulator by medical students.

      Developing objective methodology for assessing technical skill is paramount to superior
      surgical training. Alternatives to the traditional apprenticeship model of surgical training
      are necessary in today's emphasis on cost containment and professional competency.

      Metrics are widely employed in virtual environments and provide a yardstick for performance
      measurement. The current method of defining metrics for medical simulation remains more an
      art than a science. Many studies have demonstrated that trainees who practice laparoscopic
      skills in a simulated environment will improve their mastery of those skills when tested in
      that same environment. Fewer studies have been able to document the learning curve for
      mastery of tasks in a virtual reality simulator. This study will investigate the learning
      curve for tasks in a virtual reality laparoscopic simulator.
