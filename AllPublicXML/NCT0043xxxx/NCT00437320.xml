    <textblock>
      Skin photoaging or skin photodamage are terms used to describe the change in the structure,
      function and appearance of skin caused by prolonged and repeated exposure to sunlight or
      other ultraviolet light sources.

      The visible effects of skin photodamage are fine lines, skin sagging, skin roughness, liver
      spots and also the appearance of red patches made up of thin red vessels (called
      telangiectasia).

      More and more people are presenting to doctors with concerns about skin photodamage and the
      demand for corrective procedures is increasing.

      Metvix速 photodynamic therapy (Metvix速 PDT) is a procedure currently marketed in several
      countries in Europe (including the United Kingdom [UK] and Spain) and in Australia, for the
      treatment of benign forms of skin cancer (e.g. actinic keratosis).

      The aim of the study is to assess whether Metvix速 PDT will be effective in correcting the
      effects related to photodamage and whether it will be well tolerated.
