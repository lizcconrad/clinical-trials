    <textblock>
      Radiation treatment is often recommended as a safe and quick treatment that gives most people
      good relief from bone pain within a couple of weeks. However, some people can experience a
      short episode of increased pain (called a 'flare') a day or two after radiation treatment,
      that lasts about a day. The purpose of this sturdy is to find out if a medication called
      dexamethasone can help prevent pain flare as a result of radiation therapy.

      Of all people diagnosed with cancer, 25% will have their cancer come back and spread to the
      bones. This often results in significant pain and suffering. Radiation treatment is often
      recommended as a safe and quick treatment that gives most people good relief from bone pain
      within a couple of weeks. However, some people can experience a short episode of increased
      pain called a flare a day or two after radiation treatment that lasts about a day. Studies
      suggest that around a third of all people who receive radiation treatment to help pain from
      cancer in the bones will have a pain flare. This study is being done because it would be
      helpful to prevent extra bone pain from happening to people after they receive radiation
      treatments. The purpose of this study is to find out if a medication called dexamethasone can
      help prevent pain flare as a result of radiation therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented bone metastases by radiological imaging

          -  Patients at least 18 years of age

          -  Written consent

          -  KPS ≥ 40

          -  Baseline worst pain at the planned radiated bony metastatic site ≥ 2

          -  Patient able to inform the pain score at the planned radiated bony metastatic site

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent use of any corticosteroid medication other than topical or inhaled
             preparations

          -  Medical contraindications to corticosteroids such as diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled
             hypertension or active peptic ulcer

          -  Pathological fracture of the irradiated extremity

          -  Spinal cord compression

          -  Language barrier

          -  Immediate change in regular analgesic medication. If the oncologist thinks the patient
             is not receiving adequate analgesic, we recommend the oncologist to increase the
             analgesic first to stabilize ot lessen the pain before recruiting the patient to this
             study
