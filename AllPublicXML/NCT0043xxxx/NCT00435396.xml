  <brief_summary>

      This will be the first time in humans (FTIH) study with the GSK Bio recombinant gB antigen to
      evaluate safety and immunogenicity of this CMV candidate vaccine with a proprietary GSK
      adjuvant system. The vaccine will be administered to young male healthy subjects at 0, 1 and
      6 months. The trial will assess the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate CMV vaccine.
      An additional secondary objective of this trial is to identify and validate a test which will
      be able to differentiate between previous CMV infection and CMV vaccination. Subjects will be
      followed for a total of 2 years.
