      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as O(6)-benzylguanine and temozolomide, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving
      O(6)-benzylguanine together with temozolomide works in treating patients with glioblastoma
      multiforme that did not respond to previous temozolomide and radiation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of O6-benzylguanine and temozolomide in patients with
           temozolomide-resistant methylguanine methyltransferase-positive or -negative
           glioblastoma multiforme previously treated with radiotherapy.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive O6-benzylguanine intravenous (IV) over 1 hour and oral temozolomide
      once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 6
      months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
