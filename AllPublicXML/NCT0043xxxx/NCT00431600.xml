    <textblock>
      Noninvasive monitoring of blood flow in retinal circulation may elucidate the progression and
      treatment of ocular disorders, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular
      degeneration and glaucoma.

      Laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV), a noninvasive optical method combined with vessel size
      determination has been used extensively as a valuable research tool to examine blood flow
      dynamics in the human retina. However, no information on the velocity profile within the
      vessel is available. Ophthalmic color Doppler optical coherence tomography (CDOCT) provides
      laser Doppler information in addition to conventional optical coherence tomography, allowing
      the observation of blood flow dynamics simultaneously to imaging retinal structure.

      We have recently demonstrated the feasibility of Fourier domain CDOCT to assess velocity
      profiles in human retinal vessels in vivo.

      In the present study the validity of Fourier domain CDOCT for retinal blood flow measurements
      will be tested at baseline and during hyperoxia-induced vasoconstriction in humans by
      comparison with retinal blood flow measurements using a commercially available LDV system and
      the Zeiss retinal vessel analyzer (RVA)
