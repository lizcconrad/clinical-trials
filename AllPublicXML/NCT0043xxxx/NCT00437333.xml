  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metformin is an insulin sensitizing drug routinely used for the treatment of anovulatory
      patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). To date, the metabolic effects of the
      long-term metformin administration are know but no data are available on the effects after
      its suspension.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of metformin suspension on insulin
      sensitivity in PCOS patients.

      Thirty young normal-weight anovulatory PCOS women will be enrolled. The diagnosis of PCOS
      will be based on the presence of clinical [Ferriman-Gallwey score ≥ 8] or biochemical
      hyperandrogenism (serum testosterone levels (&gt;2 SD above our reference mean values) and
      chronic anovulation [serum luteal progesterone (P) below 2 ng/mL)].

      Patients will be randomly allocated into two groups (metformin and placebo group) using a
      computer-software. Fifteen PCOS patients will be treated with metformin at a dosage of 1700
      mg daily (one tablet of 850 mg twice daily; metformin group), whereas other 15 PCOS will be
      treated with placebo tables (one tablet twice daily; placebo group). The duration of the
      treatment will be 12 months. Patients will be instructed to follow their usual diet and
      physical activity, and to use barrier contraception throughout the study. The length and the
      frequency of the menstrual cycles, and the adverse experiences (AEs) will be reported on a
      daily diary.

      Each subject will undergo follow-up visits under (at six and 12 months from treatment
      starting) and after treatment (at six and 12 months from treatment withdrawal). At each
      follow-up visit, in all subjects the same operator will perform clinical, hormonal,
      metabolic, and insulin sensitivity assessments by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp.
