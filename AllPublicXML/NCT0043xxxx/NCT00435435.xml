      Context Alcoholism is common clinical problem and its treatment has no standard and is
      controversy. Different pharmacotherapyâ€™s, acamporsate, nalterxone and disulfiram have shown
      to improve the drinking outcomes, but there is no randomized comparative studies on the
      effects of these three medications.

      Objectives The aim of this study was to compare the effect of manual based cognitive therapy
      in adjunct of three different pharmacotherapy.

      Design and setting Randomized, open label, multicentre naturalistic study, 12 week continuous
      medication followed by targeted medication up to 52weeks and 67 week follow up on voluntary
      treatment seeking alcohol dependent outpatients.

      Participants 243 alcohol dependent adults. Intervention Subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to
      receive naltrexone, acamprosate or disulfiram, 50 mg, 1998 mg or 200 mg correspondingly per
      day. The patients were met weekly in first month, then after 3, 6 and 12 months.
