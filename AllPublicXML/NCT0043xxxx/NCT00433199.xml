    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Subjects were recruited in 63 centers in US from February 2007 to April 2007 in clinics. The study was designed with a double-blind period of 182 days on Placebo or Androgel 1.62% followed by an 182 days open-label period on Androgel 1.62%.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects started at a daily dose of 2.50 g testosterone gel 1.62% or matching placebo on Day 1. Within 2 days of each of visits (D14, D28 and D42), the dose was titrated up or down in 1.25 g steps if necessary, based on pre-specified normal range criteria, by an unblinded reviewer. The minimum and maximum daily doses were 1.25 g and 5.0 g.</pre_assignment_details>
