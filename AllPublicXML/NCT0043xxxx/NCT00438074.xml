      This study will investigate optical tissue characteristics as a function of neoadjuvant
      breast cancer treatment. Our objective in this pilot study will be to identify diffuse
      optical spectroscopy parameters that change with treatment and that may correlate with
      pathological response. The ultimate goal is to use such parameters ultrasound as an early
      predictor of pathological partial or complete response in women with locally advanced breast
      cancer receiving treatment with neoadjuvant treatments such as chemotherapy or neoadjuvant
      combined modality chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common malignancy for females in North America. Around 5-15% of the
      estimated 200,000 new cases diagnosed each year will present with locally advanced breast
      cancer (LABC) (The definition of what constitutes &quot;LABC&quot; is complex and variable. Clinically
      these tumours are usually considered to be those greater than 5cm in size and/or extend
      beyond the breast tissue into the surrounding skin or muscle. Patients with matted axillary
      lymph nodes (N2) or internal mammary nodes (N3) or ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node
      involvement are also considered to have LABC. In view of the extensive nature of these
      tumours at presentation, women with LABC have a poor outcome in terms of both local and
      systemic recurrence. Standard treatment for these patients is usually neoadjuvant systemic
      (chemotherapy or less frequently endocrine therapy) followed by surgery and radiotherapy.
      Patients who have hormone receptor positive tumours will then receive endocrine therapy. With
      the use of multidisciplinary therapy, 10-year disease free survival rates of 50% for Stage
      IIIA and 33% for Stage IIIB disease have been reported.

      The impetus for undertaking this study is that we are searching for imaging methods that
      could potentially serve as surrogate indicators of pathological response. One such modality
      that we wish to investigate as it may be ultimately useful in this patient population is
      diffuse optical spectrometry. This modality depends on differentiating oxygenated from
      deoxygenated tissue but is also sensitive to other changes in tissue characteristics. It has
      been used before in proof-of-principle studies differentiating benign from malignant disease
      but we hypothesize that it may be more useful in terms of monitoring tumour responses to
      treatment. This is a non-invasive imaging modality that is easy to administer and relatively
      inexpensive.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Locally Advance Breast Cancer

          -  Subjects must give appropriate written informed consent prior to participation in the
             study;

          -  Subjects must be able and willing to comply with the safety procedures during the
             Scanning Period;

          -  Subjects must be women of between 20 and 80 years of age, inclusive, on the day the
             Informed Consent Form is signed;

          -  Subjects must be women who will be receiving neoadjuvant radiation therapy and/or
             chemotherapy for locally-advanced breast cancer.

          -  Subjects of childbearing potential must be using an acceptable method of birth
             control. Subjects not of childbearing potential are defined as either surgically
             sterile or post-menopausal. Post-menopausal women are defined as those women with a
             documented menstruation cessation for 12 consecutive months prior to signing the
             Informed Consent Form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a past medical history of abnormalities, significant injury, or medical
             or surgical procedures (e.g.,silicone/saline implants) involving either breast,
             exclusive of the lesion at issue;

          -  Subjects with any dermatologic abnormalities (including tattoos, open sores, or
             breached skin) involving either breast;

          -  Subjects with a current or past medical history of connective tissue disease;

          -  Subjects who are pregnant or lactating;

          -  Subjects with an implanted electronic device such as a cardiac pacemaker,
             defibrillator, or neurological stimulator;

          -  Subjects with a history or expectation of significant anxiety associated with
             undergoing diagnostic evaluations;

          -  Subjects with a history of musculoskeletal disease which may predispose them to
             discomfort during the Scanning Period;

          -  Subjects with a known sensitivity to purified water, soybean oil, sucrose, polysorbate
             80, oleic acid, EDTA, benzalkonium chloride, FD&amp;C caramel color, butylated
             hydroxyanisole, and/or sodium hydroxide;

          -  Subjects with a known sensitivity to low-power infrared radiation (e.g., as a result
             of a dermatologic condition); and

          -  Subjects, who, in the opinion of the investigator or clinical research coordinator,
             may not otherwise be appropriate for inclusion into the study.
