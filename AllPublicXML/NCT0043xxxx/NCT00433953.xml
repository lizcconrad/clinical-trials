  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how genes influence the response to mycophenolate
      mofetil (CellCept) in children who have had a kidney transplant. The study will look at how
      differences in some genes effect blood levels of mycophenolate mofetil over time in children,
      how often side effects occur and the way that children respond to mycophenolate mofetil.

      The results may lead to better dosing based on individual needs.

      This is an open label, inpatient-outpatient prospective observational study to determine
      whether the inter-patient variability in mycophenolic acid (MPA) pharmacokinetics and
      exposure, adverse events and clinical response in pediatric transplant patients (ages 2-18
      years) is associated with identifiable pharmacogenetic factors. Specific aims: 1.) To
      determine whether common polymorphic variations in the uridine
      diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are associated with inter-individual variability
      in MPA pharmacokinetics and exposure (by affecting MPA metabolism). 2.) To determine whether
      common polymorphic variations in the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are
      associated with inter-patient differences in the incidence of adverse events (by affecting
      the formation of the acyl-glucuronide metabolite). Enrolled subjects will have been receiving
      mycophenolate mofetil as part of their clinical standard of care. It is anticipated that the
      clinical portion of the study will last up to 4 hours at one study visit to include one
      pharmacogenetic blood sample and 4 pharmacokinetic blood samples collected out to 3 hours
      post-dose. Safety data to be collected will include standard of care physical exam and safety
      laboratory tests as well as data on adverse events and clinical outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male subjects and non-pregnant female subjects aged 2 to 18 years who are about to
             receive a kidney transplant and will be on post transplant MMF containing
             immunosuppressive therapy.

          -  A signed and dated institutional review board (IRB) approved parental/guardian
             informed consent form and an IRB approved child assent form if applicable.

          -  Subjects with stable kidney allografts who are on a stable regimen of MMF (with
             tacrolimus and steroids)

          -  May have clinically important abnormalities on clinical and /or laboratory
             evaluations, only as these abnormalities relate to an underlying condition as
             determined by the principal investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children receiving cyclosporine therapy that may interact with MPA entero-hepatic
             recycling.

          -  Any medical condition(active or chronic) or prior surgery that may interfere with the
             pharmacokinetics of MMF as determined by the principal investigator.

          -  Concomitant medication that may interfere with the pharmacokinetics of MMF as
             determined by the principal investigator.
