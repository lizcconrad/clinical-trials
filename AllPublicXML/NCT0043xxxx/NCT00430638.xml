  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 16 week study will examine the ability of olmesartan medoxomil to lower the blood
      pressure of patients with moderate to severe high blood pressure in comparison to placebo.
      The medication being tested has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of high blood
      pressure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was to randomize an equal number of participants to either an olmesartan medoxomil
      based treatment or to placebo. The titration scheme was as follows:

        -  First 3 weeks (wks), all participants - olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg or placebo

        -  Next 3 wks, participants whose blood pressure was not controlled - olmesartan medoxomil
           40 mg or placebo

        -  Next 3 wks, participants whose blood pressure was not controlled - olmesartan medoxomil
           40 mg/HCT 12.5 mg or placebo

        -  Final 3 wks, participants whose blood pressure was not controlled - olmesartan medoxomil
           40 mg/HCT 25 mg or placebo

        -  Subjects with a mean BP of &lt;120/80 mmHg at any visit were considered responders and were
           not titrated up to the next dose level. However, they remained in the study at their
           currently assigned dose of study medication.

        -  Subjects with a mean office SBP ≥120 mmHg or a mean office DBP ≥80 mmHg at any
           subsequent visit(s) were considered 'uncontrolled' and were titrated to the next dose
           level according to the titration scheme above.

        -  Subjects who reach the highest dose (ie, olmesartan medoxomil 40 mg/HCT 25 mg) remained
           on that dose until study exit at Visit 8, unless safety concerns caused discontinuation
           of treatment.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Subjects were recruited at 29 US sites (private medical practices and small clinics) over 5 months from December 2006 to May 2007 from each physician's clientele base. About 450 potential subjects were to be screened so that about 250 eligible subjects, men and women at least 18 years of age with stage I or II hypertension, were randomized.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>After 3-4 weeks of placebo treatment, eligible subjects were randomized. 140 were randomized to drug; 138 to placebo. 2 active drug participants were given the wrong dose at entry. Because only 138 participants received Olmesartan 20 mg, any demography data totals are equal to 276 instead of 278. The subgroup analyses are similarly affected.</pre_assignment_details>
