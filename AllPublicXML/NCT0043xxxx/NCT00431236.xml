  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III trial designed to demonstrate that casopitant when added to dexamethasone
      and ondansetron is more effective in the prevention of vomiting then dexamethasone and
      ondansetron alone, in patients who receive a cisplatin-based highly emetogenic chemotherapy.

    <measure>The impact on participants daily life activities for the first 120 hours following the first cycle of chemotherapy as assessed by the Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE) questionnaire-Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 120 hours of each HEC cycle (up to 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The FLIE was a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 18 items indicating impact of nausea and vomiting on daily activities: physical, social and emotional function, and the ability to enjoy meals. Questions are divided into two domains: nausea 1-9; vomiting 10-18. Each item was scored on a VAS from 1: not at all to 7: a great deal; higher score indicates more severity. The initial score for each question was calculated by measuring the distance from the left hand end to the point where the participant had placed the mark. For questions 1, 2, 4, 5, 7-10, 12-14, 16 and 17, the final score: subtracting the initial score from 100 and for questions 3, 6, 11, 15 and 18, final score was the one provided in the dataset. The score for the nausea/vomiting domain was the sum of the individual scores divided by the number actually answered multiplied by 9. This sum was then multiplied by 0.06 and 9 added. The score ranged from 9-63 for each nausea and vomiting and sum both is provided.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of participants with impact on daily life activities for the first 120 hours following the first cycle of chemotherapy as assessed by the FLIE questionnaire-interpretation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 120 hours of each HEC cycle (up to 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The FLIE was a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 18 items indicating impact of nausea and vomiting on daily activities: physical, social and emotional function, and the ability to enjoy meals. Questions are divided into two domains: nausea questions 1-9; vomiting questions 10-18. Each item was scored on a VAS from 1: not at all to 7: a great deal. Higher scores indicate less impairment on daily life as a result of nausea or vomiting. No impact on daily life was defined as an average item score of &gt;6 on the 7-point scale. The total score for no impact of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) daily life, defined as a FLIE total score of &gt;108 (range: 18-126). The same method was applied to vomiting and nausea subscores: no impact of vomiting (nausea) on daily life was defined as a FLIE total score of &gt;54 (range: 9-63). The FLIE total score, as well as the vomiting and nausea subscores, for each treatment arm was calculated at Baseline and Day 6-10.</description>

             hypercalcemia, or any uncontrolled medical condition (other than malignancy) which in
             the opinion of the Investigator may confound the results of the study, represent
             another potential etiology for emesis and nausea (other than CINV) or pose an
             unwarranted risk to the subject.

          -  Has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to ZOFRAN, another 5-HT3 receptor

             history of alcoholism may be permitted provided that, in the investigator's opinion,
             the subject's disease state will not confound the results of the study.

          -  Receiving or planning to receive a systemic corticosteroid therapy at any dose within
             72 hours prior to the first dose of study medication, except where indicated as
