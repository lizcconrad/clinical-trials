  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracies of the Patient Activity Monitor to
      that of a standard pedometer during a walking task and some day-to-day activities in a
      simulated apartment setting.

      The ability to accurately measure daily activity levels in lower extremity amputee patients
      is important for a better understanding of their use of prosthetic limbs. Most studies have
      shown that patients often report their activity level inaccurately. More objective data on
      activity levels will not only provide information helpful for determining the appropriate
      prosthetic components for an individual, it will also be helpful when assessing the effects
      that medical illness have on activity levels and in objectively determining the benefits of
      rehabilitation. In addition, being able to measure activity accurately will allow further
      verification of currently developed clinical surveys designed to determine amputee activity
      in a practical form.

      Until more recently a practical, accurate and affordable means of monitoring lower extremity
      amputee activity has not been available for use. Currently a monitoring device designed
      specifically for this task is available for research use. It is called the Patient Activity
      Monitor (PAM). Many different models of more generic activity monitoring devices, called
      pedometers, also exist and need to be further tested in the amputee population.

      The objective of our study was to measure and compare the step count and ambulation distance
      accuracies of a Yamax Digi-Walker pedometer and the PAM in transtibial amputees at the K3
      Level within a simulated apartment setting and during relatively continuous gymnasium
      walking.
