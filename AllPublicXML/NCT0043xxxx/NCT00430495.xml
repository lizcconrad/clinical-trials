  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, multicentre, prospective
      dose-finding trial of the safety and efficacy of atacicept in subjects with active rheumatoid
      arthritis who had failed a three month therapeutic trial with a tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNFa) antagonist due to lack of efficacy.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving American College of Rheumatology 20 Response Based on C-reactive Protein (ACR20-CRP) at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>ACR20-CRP response is defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 20 percent (%) improvement in both tender joint counts (based on a total of 68 joints) and swollen joint counts (based on a total of 66 joints) together with &gt;=20% improvement in at least 3 of the following 5 measures: 1) participant's assessment of pain; 2) participant's global assessment of disease activity; 3) physician's global assessment of disease activity; 4) participant's assessment of physical function; and 5) acute-phase marker (CRP).</description>

    <description>ACR50-CRP response is defined as &gt;=50% improvement in both tender joint counts (based on a total of 68 joints) and swollen joint counts (based on a total of 66 joints) together with &gt;=50% improvement in at least 3 of the following 5 measures: 1) participant's assessment of pain; 2) participant's global assessment of disease activity; 3) physician's global assessment of disease activity; 4) participant's assessment of physical function; and 5) acute-phase marker (CRP).</description>

    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>ACR70-CRP response is defined as &gt;=70% improvement in both tender joint counts (based on a total of 68 joints) and swollen joint counts (based on a total of 66 joints) together with &gt;=70% improvement in at least 3 of the following 5 measures: 1) participant's assessment of pain; 2) participant's global assessment of disease activity; 3) physician's global assessment of disease activity; 4) participant's assessment of physical function; and 5) acute-phase marker (CRP).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints (DAS28) Based on CRP (DAS28-CRP) of Less Than or Equal to (&lt;=) 3.2 at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28-CRP incorporates non-graded joint counts for tenderness and swelling based on a total of 28 joints, CRP as a marker of inflammation, and a general health assessment using a 100-millimeter (mm) visual analog scale (the participant's global assessment of disease activity). DAS28 ranges between 0 and 10 representing current disease activity. A value above 5.1 represents high disease activity, a value below 3.2 represents low disease activity, and a value below 2.6 represents remission.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Improvement in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) of at Least 0.3 From Baseline at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI is a participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item was scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0 = no difficulty; 1 = some difficulty; 2 = much difficulty; 3 = unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range is 0 to 3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty. Percentage of participants achieving improvement in HAQ-DI of at least 0.3 from baseline at Week 26 was reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Good or Moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Response at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The EULAR response criteria evaluate change in DAS28 scores represented as &quot;good response&quot;, &quot;moderate response&quot;, or &quot;no response&quot; considering both the current DAS28 score and the observed improvement from baseline. Participants were considered to have &quot;good&quot; or &quot;moderate&quot; EULAR response if at the time of assessment, their DAS28 score was &lt;=5.1 and the improvement from baseline in their DAS28 score was greater than (&gt;) 0.6; or if at the time of assessment, their DAS28 score was &gt;5.1 and improvement from baseline in their DAS28 score was &gt;1.2.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 38</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

        <description>DAS28-CRP incorporates non-graded joint counts for tenderness and swelling based on a total of 28 joints, CRP as a marker of inflammation, and a general health assessment using a 100-millimeter (mm) visual analog scale (the participant's global assessment of disease activity). DAS28 ranges between 0 and 10 representing current disease activity. A value above 5.1 represents high disease activity, a value below 3.2 represents low disease activity, and a value below 2.6 represents remission.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Improvement in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) of at Least 0.3 From Baseline at Week 26</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI is a participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item was scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0 = no difficulty; 1 = some difficulty; 2 = much difficulty; 3 = unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range is 0 to 3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty. Percentage of participants achieving improvement in HAQ-DI of at least 0.3 from baseline at Week 26 was reported.</description>
