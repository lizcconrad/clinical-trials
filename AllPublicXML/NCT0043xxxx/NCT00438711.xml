  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study for people with inflammatory bowel disease (&quot;IBD&quot;--that is, ulcerative
      colitis, Crohn's colitis, or indeterminate colitis). We are studying how people with IBD
      decide to have surgery when a doctor has told them they should think about having their colon
      (large bowel) removed. This surgery is called a &quot;colectomy.&quot; Patients will be asked to fill
      out a questionnaire that takes about 60 to 90 minutes to complete. Questions ask about
      patients' background (age, etc.) and their IBD. They also ask about patients' decision to
      have surgery or not to have surgery. For instance, what kinds of things did they think about?
      Some questions ask about other people who affected the choice and how patients felt about the
      help they got from others. People who wish to join the study will receive payment to thank
      them for their time.

        -  Patients must be at least 18 years old

        -  Patients must speak English

        -  Patients must have been told by their doctor to think about having surgery to take out
           their colon to (a) lower their risk for cancer or (b) because they have pre-cancer
           (called &quot;dysplasia&quot;)

        -  Patients do not need to have had the surgery--they may have already had the surgery,
           they may not have had it yet, or they may have decided they do not want to have it
