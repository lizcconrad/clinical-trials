  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project contains experimental studies of the effects of the drug caffeine on glucose
      regulation in adults who have Type 2 diabetes. In our experiments, we are testing the
      hypothesis that moderate amounts of caffeine exaggerate the abnormal increases in glucose and
      insulin observed after meals in patients with type 2 diabetes. On separate study days
      subjects receive standard meals after taking capsules containing either caffeine or an
      inactive placebo. We measure levels of glucose, insulin, and other chemicals in blood samples
      drawn over the next 3 hours. In a separate study, we use continuous glucose monitoring to
      measure glucose levels during everyday activities on days when subjects receive caffeine or
      placebo.

      These studies do not involve clinical treatment or disease management. However, we hope to
      learn whether a very popular drug impairs the clinical management of a common disease.

      Pilot results suggest that caffeine, the most commonly used drug in the world, may interfere
      with postprandial glucose metabolism by increasing insulin resistance and/or by stimulating
      hepatic glucose production. This effect could have serious clinical implications for coffee
      drinkers who have type 2 diabetes. Early results suggest caffeine exaggerates the
      postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia present in these patients.

      The experimental (non-treatment) studies in this project include double-blind
      placebo-controlled cross-over laboratory tests of glucose tolerance in groups of type 2
      diabetic patients and prediabetic volunteers who are coffee drinkers.

      The lab studies test the hypothesis that caffeine (vs. placebo) increases postprandial
      insulin responses and results in a potentiation of glucose responses in the type 2 group.

      An ambulatory study examines the effects of caffeine administration on glucose levels during
      everyday activities in the natural environment. This study uses a double-blind
      placebo-controlled cross-over design. Ambulatory glucose data are collected with a MiniMed
      CGMS sensor and recorder worn for 72 hours. Caffeine and placebo are administered on separate
      days. Average glucose levels and glucose responses to meals are compared across treatment
      days within subjects.
