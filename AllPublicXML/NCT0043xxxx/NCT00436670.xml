             treatment with investigational agent. Must have used ICS for at least the last 3
             consecutive months before screening

          -  If receiving allergen immunotherapy, a stable dose for &gt; 3 months before screening and

             screening

          -  Respiratory illness within 4 weeks of screening

          -  History of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other chronic pulmonary
             condition other than asthma

          -  Received long-acting beta agonist, theophylline, inhaled anticholinergics, oral beta 2
             agonists, or cromolyn therapeutics within 1 week of first run-in visit.

          -  Leukotriene antagonists within 2 weeks before first run-in visit

          -  Oral or parenteral corticosteroids within 6 weeks before first run-in visit

          -  Live/attenuated vaccinations within 4 weeks of screening or during the study
