      The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that are associated with falls and near
      falls in community-dwelling older adults with early-stage dementia.

      The specific objectives of this six month study are to: characterize falls and near-falls in
      community dwelling older adults with early-stage dementia; determine which potentially
      modifiable physical fall risk factors contribute to falls and near-falls in older adults with
      early-stage dementia; examine the relationship between dementia sub-type, medical and
      neuropsychological factors, balance and gait, and falls and near-falls in community dwelling
      older adults with early-stage dementia.
