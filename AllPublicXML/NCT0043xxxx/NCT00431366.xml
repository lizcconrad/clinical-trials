      This study will explore sequence effect, a fatigue or tiredness commonly seen in patients
      with Parkinson's disease after they have been doing the same thing for a while. The study
      will use a new device called a modified peg board test (see description below) to measure
      whether antiparkinsonian medications (levodopa/carbidopa or dopamine) and repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS, see description below) of the brain can improve the
      symptoms of sequence effect.

      Patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease who have never taken antiparkinsonian
      medications and patients with advanced disease may be eligible for this study. Candidates
      must be 18 years of age or older and right-handed.

      Participants have five visits to the NIH Clinical Center as follows:

        -  Visit 1 (baseline): Patients have a neurological examination, including brief cognitive
           function tests, a rating for depression, and two types of ratings for fatigue severity.

        -  Visits 2 through 5 (experimental sessions): Patients who have been taking antiparkinson
           medication for a long time are asked to not take their medication for about 12 hours
           (overnight withdrawal) before visits 2 through 5. They are off medication for about 14
           hours total (until after the experiments are done). Patients may be admitted to the NIH
           Clinical Center for the overnight drug withdrawal if necessary. At the start of each
           session, participants are given either levodopa/carbidopa tablets or placebo (tablets
           identical in appearance but with no active medication). They perform the modified
           pegboard test before medication, after medication, and after brain stimulation with
           rTMS. During two of the sessions, they receive actual brain stimulation, and during the
           other two sessions they receive sham stimulation, which does not actually stimulate the
           brain.

      The modified pegboard test is a computer-based machine with eight pegs. Subjects transfer
      each peg from a line of holes on the right side to a line of holes on the left side using
      their right hand and moving as quickly as possible. After they finish moving all pegs to the
      left line of holes, they wait for a beep and then transfer the pegs from left line to right
      line of holes. They do this six times, three times with their right hand and three times with
      their left.

      rTMS involves repeated magnetic pulses delivered in trains or short bursts of impulses. A
      brief electrical current is passed through a wire coil held on the scalp. The current creates
      a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The subject hears a click and may feel a pulling
      sensation on the skin under the coil. There may be a twitch in muscles of the face, arm or
      leg. During the stimulation, the subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or
      perform other simple actions. The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected with small metal
      disk electrodes taped onto the skin of the right hand. Subjects receive four rTMS blocks per
      10 minutes. Each block consists of a total of 375 pulses.

      Objective:

      The long-term goal is to provide new insight into the effect of long-lasting sequence
      movements (sequence effect) by investigating de novo and advanced Parkinson's disease (PD)
      patients with an objective measurement. Our central hypothesis is that sequence effect is
      caused by depressed excitability of the motor cortex, and is partially associated with
      dopaminergic deficiency. Specifically, the aims of this study are to show that the sequence
      effect is more severe in advanced PD than in de novo PD and to evaluate the extent of
      improvement by levodopa and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and to show
      the correlation of fatigue.

      Study Population:

      Twelve de novo PD patients and 12 age- and sex-matched advanced PD patients.

      Design:

      We will compare objectively measured sequence effect with a modified Purdue pegboard, a
      computer-based device, in de novo and advanced PD patients. The modified Purdue Pegboard will
      detect start and stop times for individual peg insertion and for the task in its entirety.
      The sequence effect in this protocol is detected by the progressive changes of time intervals
      per peg insertion during the testing session. A time interval is defined as the period
      between the start and stop times for individual peg insertion. We will conduct a
      placebo-controlled, four-way crossover study to determine the beneficial effect of levodopa
      and rTMS on the sequence effect in de novo and advanced PD. The four interventions are:
      levodopa and rTMS; levodopa and sham; placebo and rTMS; and placebo and sham. A replicated 4
      periods and four intervention-Latin Square design will be used for the crossover design.

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary outcome will be the difference between two time intervals, individual 1st and 8th
      peg insertion time, in 1st run (8-consecutive peg insertions) with right hand, which will be
      compared between de novo PD and advanced PD. The secondary outcomes are: (a) the difference
      in progressive changes of six time values for six runs; (b) the beneficial effect of levodopa
      and rTMS on sequence effect; and (c) correlation between the time intervals of first and
      eighth peg insertion and the scores of two subjective fatigue scales, i.e., Fatigue Severity
      Scale (FSS) and Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI).
