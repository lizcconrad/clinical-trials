  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      multiple doses of pregabalin in pediatric patients with partial onset seizures that are
      incompletely controlled on their current medications.

    <measure>Number of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) by Severity: Double-blind Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis for severity of AEs was performed separately for double-blind and open-label treatment. AE = any untoward medical occurrence in participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AEs were classified as mild, moderate and severe based on severity assessment: Mild = no interference with participant's usual function; Moderate = some interference with participant's usual function; Severe = significant interference with participant's usual function. Treatment-emergent events for double-blind treatment included events between baseline and Day 7 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Participants may experience more than 1 AE.</description>

    <description>AUC (0 - ∞)= Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated infinite time (0 - ∞). It is obtained from AUC (0 - t) plus AUC (t - ∞). AUC (0 - ∞) for participants who received matching placebo from Day 1 to Day 7 and pregabalin on Day 8 morning is reported (single-dose participants).

    <time_frame>Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 hours post-dose on Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance (CL) of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed (F). Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood. CL/F for participants who received pregabalin from Day 1 to Day 8 morning is reported (multiple-dose participants).</description>

        <title>Number of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) by Severity: Double-blind Treatment</title>
        <description>Analysis for severity of AEs was performed separately for double-blind and open-label treatment. AE = any untoward medical occurrence in participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AEs were classified as mild, moderate and severe based on severity assessment: Mild = no interference with participant's usual function; Moderate = some interference with participant's usual function; Severe = significant interference with participant's usual function. Treatment-emergent events for double-blind treatment included events between baseline and Day 7 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Participants may experience more than 1 AE.</description>

          <title>Number of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) by Severity: Double-blind Treatment</title>
          <description>Analysis for severity of AEs was performed separately for double-blind and open-label treatment. AE = any untoward medical occurrence in participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AEs were classified as mild, moderate and severe based on severity assessment: Mild = no interference with participant's usual function; Moderate = some interference with participant's usual function; Severe = significant interference with participant's usual function. Treatment-emergent events for double-blind treatment included events between baseline and Day 7 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Participants may experience more than 1 AE.</description>
          <population>Safety analysis set included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication.</population>

          <description>AUC (0 - ∞)= Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated infinite time (0 - ∞). It is obtained from AUC (0 - t) plus AUC (t - ∞). AUC (0 - ∞) for participants who received matching placebo from Day 1 to Day 7 and pregabalin on Day 8 morning is reported (single-dose participants). Results are normalized to individual participant's Day 8 dose.</description>

        <title>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F): Multiple-Dose Analysis</title>
        <description>Clearance (CL) of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed (F). Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood. CL/F for participants who received pregabalin from Day 1 to Day 8 morning is reported (multiple-dose participants).</description>

          <description>Clearance (CL) of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed (F). Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood. CL/F for participants who received matching placebo from Day 1 to Day 7 and pregabalin on Day 8 morning is reported (single-dose participants).</description>
