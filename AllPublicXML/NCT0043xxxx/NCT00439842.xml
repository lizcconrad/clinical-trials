  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help people with heart failure (HF) to manage their HF and to
      prevent rehospitalizations. Another purpose is to test the usefulness of clinical
      appointments and educational videotapes in teaching patients how to manage their HF.

      It is proposed that the group clinic intervention (HFcareGroup)will reduce rehospitalization,
      depression, and improve problem solving related to heart failure symptoms.

      Aim 1 Hypothesis:

        1. The time to the 1st composite endpoint (HF Rehospitalization/death) will be longer for
           HFcareGroup than standard care group at 12 months.

        2. The HFcareGroup will have higher score than standard care on patient outcomes i.e.
           functional health status, quality of life, satisfaction with health care at 12 months.

        3. Health Services Use will be lower in HFcareGroup than standard care group at 12 months.

      Aim 2 Hypothesis:

        1. The HFcareGroup will have higher score than standard care on patients' HF
           self-management i.e., self-care behaviors, participation with health care professionals
           in HF management and problem-solving, HF knowledge and preparedness for home care at 6
           and 12 months.

        2. A greater proportion of HFcareGroup vs standard care subjects will report clinical or
           symptoms of HF decompensation (e.g. specific weight gain, shortness of breath, edema,
           fatigue, tachycardia, and medication side effects) to their health care provider.
