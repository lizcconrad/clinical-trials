  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A couple of studies have shown that illuminating the eye with diffuse flickering light is
      accompanied by an increase of retinal vessel diameters, optic nerve head blood flow and
      retinal blood flow. We have recently used this visual stimulation technique as a new and
      powerful tool for the non-invasive investigation of vascular reactivity. Additionally, we
      could show that this response is diminished in patients with vascular pathologies and that
      the response is dependent on nitric oxide, indicating that flicker induced vasodilatation may
      reflect endothelial dysfunction and may be a new approach to test endothelial function in
      vivo.

      One of the most widely used method for the assessment of endothelial function is flow
      mediated dilatation (FMD). FMD has been shown to give a reliable estimate of vascular
      function in vivo. In the present study, we set out to compare the standard method for the
      evaluation of endothelial function, FMD, to flicker induced vasodilatation in the retina.
