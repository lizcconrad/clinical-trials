    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of two different group-based
      exercise programs on fall risk (muscular strength and balance) and bone strength in older
      women aged over 65-75 years who have low bone mass. We are also trying to determine if once a
      week exercise is as effective on health outcomes as twice a week. We hypothesize that twice a
      week exercise will be more effective than once a week or sham exercise.
