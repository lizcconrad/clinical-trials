  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal obesity is strongly associated with dyslipidemia, which may account for the
      associated increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary disease. Weight reduction is
      suggested to be a preferred and effective first-line strategy to correct lipid abnormalities,
      particularly in overweight/obese subjects. This improvement may be related to the effect of
      reduction in abdominal fat mass on apoB and apoA-I metabolism, but this remains to be fully
      demonstrated.

      Hypothesis: Reduction in abdominal fat mass by weight loss decreases apoB concentration and
      raises HDL-cholesterol chiefly by increasing LDL-apoB fractional catabolic rate (FCR), as
      well as decreasing HDL apoA-I, respectively.

      We examined the mechanism of the effect of weight loss through dieting on LDL and HDL
      metabolism in abdominally obese men. LDL apoB-100 and HDL apoA-I kinetics were studied using
      a primed-constant infusion of 1-[13C]-leucine in a controlled, dietary intervention trial of
      16 weeks duration in middle-aged, obese men with the metabolic syndrome. Isotopic enrichment
      in apoB and apoA-I was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and fractional
      turnover rates estimated using multi-compartmental modelling.
