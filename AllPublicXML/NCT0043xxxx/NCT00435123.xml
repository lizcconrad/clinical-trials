  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind clinical study of a
      nutritional supplement, ProStat 64, in chronic hemodialysis patients with poor nutrition.
      Subjects receive either ProStat 64 or Placebo for three months. At the end of this period,
      all subjects will receive ProStat-64 for a further 3 months at which time the study is ended.
      Parameters of nutritional status (lean body mass and serum protein) will be collected at
      baseline, 3 months and 6 months.

      Fifty patients identified as having poor nutrition by the following criteria:

        1. Average of Serum Albumin for the consecutive two months prior to inclusion &lt;/= 3.7 g/dl
           and the serum albumin for the previous month is &lt; 3.7 mg/dl.

        2. one of the four following criteria:

             1. Protein catabolic rate less than 1.0 g/kg/d on at least 2 occasions over the past 6
                months

             2. Progressive unintentional weight loss more than 2.5% of the initial or ideal body
                weight and/or patients who are less than 90% of Standard Body Weight

             3. Subjective Global Assessment Score consistent with Moderate to Severe Malnutrition
                within the last month

             4. Biochemical parameters of malnutrition defined by 1 of 2 of the following
                measurements (if available) over the consecutive two months prior to inclusion:

                  1. Serum transferrin concentration less than 225 mg/dl

                  2. Serum prealbumin concentration less than 32 mg/dl

      will be randomized to receive either ProStat 64 or placebo for 3 months. At Baseline a Dexa
      for lean body mass and labs for BUN, creatinine, glucose, serum albumin, prealbumin and
      C-reactive protein will be drawn. Cholesterol and transferrin will be recorded from the
      regular monthly labs if available. In addition, a protein catabolic rate will be calculated
      and a SGA will be completed.

      Patients will take the supplement/placebo twice a day. Measurements will be repeated at month
      3. At the end of these measurements, all patients will be switched to open label ProStat64
      for an additional 3 months. At month 6 all study procedures/labs are repeated and the study
      is complete.
