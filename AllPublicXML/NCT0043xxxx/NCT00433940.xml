      The goal of this study is to clarify the degree of immune suppression in infants requiring
      therapy and to create guidelines for evaluation and prevention of infection in infants on
      oral steroids for hemangiomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants with large or complicated hemangiomas are often treated systemically with oral
      steroids. The side effects of the drug on young infants has not been studied. The goal of
      this study is to clarify the degree of immune suppression in infants requiring therapy and to
      create guidelines for evaluation and prevention of infection in infants on oral steroids for
      hemangiomas. Prednisone will be started according to established standard of care. Visits
      will occur every four weeks for follow-up. There will be six blood draws from baseline to
      completion of study. Approximately up to 1 Â½ teaspoons per blood sample will be drawn to test
      the strength of the infant's immune system. Participation in this study will last up to 14
      months or until stabilization of the hemangioma. Evaluation will occur 12 weeks after
      discontinuing the steroid for its long-term effects on the immune system.
