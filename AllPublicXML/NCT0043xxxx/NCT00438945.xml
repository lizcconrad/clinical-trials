  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We, the investigators at Holstebro Hospital, want to test the hypothesis that eprosartan
      reduces the activity of the sympathetic nervous system in patients with essential
      hypertension - during baseline conditions and after activation of the sympathetic nervous
      system.
