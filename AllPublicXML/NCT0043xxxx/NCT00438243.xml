  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to look at the effects of Bromfenac, also called Xibrom for the
      treatment of swelling in the retina (the light sensitive tissue in the back of the eye)
      called &quot;macular edema&quot; that occurs after cataract surgery. Swelling in the retina can lead to
      blurry vision.

      The most commonly used treatment is eyedrops that decrease inflammation and may help stop
      some of the swelling. The investigators want to see if the drug Bromfenac(Xibrom) can
      decrease the swelling in the retina after cataract surgery and improve vision in these
      patients.

    <textblock>
      Over 2.5 million cataract surgeries are performed yearly in the United States. Despite
      advances in cataract surgery, cystoid macular edema (CME) is the most common cause of loss of
      vision after cataract surgery, occurring in approximately 0.3% to 3% of all uncomplicated
      surgeries. If the surgery is complicated, CME can occur in up to 20% of these patients. In
      CME, fluid accumulates in cystic spaces within the outer plexiform layer of the retina,
      resulting in decreased vision.

      Ocular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely used in the treatment
      of CME. NSAIDs decrease inflammation and are hypothesized to decrease the production of
      prostaglandins via selective inhibition of the cyclooxygenase pathway, which can result in
      CME. The standard of care for management of postoperative pseudophakic macular edema to some
      extent remains unclear. There is currently no FDA-approved therapy for the prophylaxis or
      treatment of postoperative cystoid macular edema.

      Bromfenac (Xibrom)an NSAID and is FDA-approved for ocular use to treat pain and inflammation
      after ocular surgery. Therefore, these medications might decrease inflammation and be
      effective in treating CME. The investigators plan to conduct a controlled study to
      investigate the effect of Bromfenac (Xibrom)in patients who develop CME after cataract
      surgery. The results of this study may be important in better understanding the pathogenesis
      and treatment of acute postoperative cystoid macular edema to prevent chronic vision loss.
