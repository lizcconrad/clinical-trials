  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals disabled by stroke are at risk of losing cardiovascular fitness and muscle due to
      disease. This worsens disability and can increase the risk of having another stroke or a
      heart attack. We would like to find out if and how different types of regular exercise
      (intense walking, long walking) can increase fitness, balance and improve walking function
      and activities of daily living in individuals who have suffered a stroke.

      This randomized study compares effects of duration vs. velocity-based TM training regimens on
      fitness and ambulatory function in chronic stroke patients. Phase 1 - patients are screened
      (Mini Mental Status, CESD for depression, alcohol intake survey) and undergo routine medical
      and CV evaluations and blood labs in VA RRDC Assessment Clinic to establish medical
      eligibility. Standard neurological evaluations (NIH Stroke Scale, Modified Asworth Spasticity
      Scale, range of motion and manual motor testing) and review of imaging records assess
      neurological eligibility, deficit profiles and stroke subtypes. Physician supervised
      treadmill tolerance test and peak effort constant velocity exercise stress test with vital
      signs monitoring determine treadmill safety, functional eligibility to participate (must walk
      3 minutes at 0.2 MPH with handrail support), and cardiopulmonary safety in response to
      strenuous exertion. Eligible candidates undergo baseline testing (phase 2) including measures
      of fitness (VO2 peak, gait economy), ambulatory function and BOLD fMRI of knee movement.
      Phase 3 - 6 months TM training with either velocity or duration based progression, followed
      by Phase 4 -repeat of fitness and ambulatory function tests after 3 months, and Phase 5 -
      repeat of all baseline tests after 6 months training
