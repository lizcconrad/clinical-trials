      RATIONALE: Vaccines may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.
      Colony-stimulating factors, such as GM-CSF, may increase the number of immune cells found in
      bone marrow or peripheral blood. Giving vaccine therapy together with sargramostim may be an
      effective treatment for breast cancer and ovarian cancer. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is
      studying the side effects and identifying the best dose of vaccine therapy when given
      together with sargramostim in treating patients with stage III-IV breast cancer or ovarian
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety of intradermal administration of 3 doses of a
      plasmid-based DNA vaccine encoding the ICD of HER2 administered with a fixed dose of GM-CSF.
      II. To determine whether a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the ICD of HER2 can elicit HER2
      specific immune responses. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if the dose of the
      plasmid-based DNA vaccine effects immunologic responses. II. To determine the persistence of
      DNA at the site of vaccination. OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of a plasmid-based
      DNA (pNGVL3-hICD) vaccine. Patients receive pNGVL3-hICD vaccine admixed with GM-CSF
      intradermally once a month for 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up
      to 15 years with primary physicians.
