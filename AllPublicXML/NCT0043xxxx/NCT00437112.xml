    <textblock>
      A study to compare Human Inhalation Powder (also known as AIR® Inhaled Insulin) (AIR® is a
      registered trademark of Alkermes, Inc.)with insulin glargine injections in patients with Type
      2 diabetes who are currently taking oral medications and have not previously taken insulin.
      Change in HbA1c levels will be reviewed to determine superiority or inferiority of the AIR
      Inhaled Insulin regimen.
