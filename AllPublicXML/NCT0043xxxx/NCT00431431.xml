  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both tibolone and raloxifene have been demonstrated to prevent postmenopausal bone loss.
      During treatment with tibolone bone mineral density (BMD) of the spine has been shown to be
      increased between 1.8 and 5.8 % above baseline in two years, depending on the population
      studied. Since treatments aimed at prevention should ideally be used long-term, compliance
      with the treatment is crucial. Efficacy of and compliance with the two treatments will be
      measured and evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Only subjects who give voluntary written informed consent, and who are willing and
             able to make reasonable efforts to observe all clinical trial requirements are to be
             enrolled.

          -  Subjects will be osteopenic but otherwise healthy postmenopausal women, from 60 to 79
             years of age (inclusive) at entry.

          -  Screening BMD of the lumbar vertebrae (L1-L4) must be between -2.5 SD and

               -  1.0 SD of the T-score.

          -  Subjects should have a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt;19 and &lt; 30 kg/m2.
