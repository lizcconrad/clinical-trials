  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tamiflu in patients with
      clinically-diagnosed influenza occurring during an influenza outbreak within the community.
      Patients will be randomized to receive Tamiflu 75mg bid orally plus support therapy (NSAIDs
      and antibiotics) or support therapy alone. The anticipated time on study treatment is &lt;3
      months, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.
