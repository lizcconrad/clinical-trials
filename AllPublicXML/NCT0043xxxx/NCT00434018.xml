  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to test an evidence-based wheelchair skills training program to optimize
      wheelchair safety and performance in veterans with SCI. The proposed training program
      incorporates emerging evidence on wheelchair biomechanics and motor-skills learning, and
      addresses recommendations in a new clinical practice guideline. Given the difficulty in
      translating wheelchair skills learned in a therapy clinic with &quot;real world&quot; problems in the
      home and community post-discharge, we are proposing to conduct the wheelchair skills training
      in and around the veteran's home. The immediate goal is to enhance ability, performance time,
      safety, community participation, and quality of life, while minimizing physical strain. The
      ultimate goal is to reduce morbidity/mortality associated with wheelchair use and promote
      successful aging with a disability.

      The purpose of this 3-year randomized controlled clinical trial is to evaluate use of a
      community-based wheelchair skills training program (WSTP). Objectives include:

        1. Determine the immediate and sustained effects of a WSTP on ability, performance time,
           and physical strain.

        2. Examine the effects of mediating and moderating variables on ability, performance time,
           and physical strain.

        3. Examine the effects of a WSTP on safety, community participation, and quality of life.

        4. Promote dissemination of WSTP in VA SCI Centers through two key activities: (a) Design
           innovative marketing plans to increase participation and promote patient-centeredness
           based on patient-perceived benefits. (b) Estimate health care resources needed to add
           home-based

    <description>The WST is a standardized evaluation method that permits a set of representative wheelchair skills to be objectively, simply and inexpensively documented. The WST is an instrument for the objective evaluation of wheelchair skills. The WST consists of a series of commonly used wheelchair skills spanning the spectrum from those as basic as applying brakes to those as difficult as climbing curbs and performing wheelies. The WSC encompasses 57 skills (in Version 4.1) which result in a total score. The WST provide a pass-fail score for each skill. Refusal to attempt a skill (e.g. because of fear) constitutes a failing grade. The numerator is the Total Raw Score (i.e., the number of individual skills awarded a passing score) and the denominator is the number of applicable skills (i.e., the total number of skills minus those awarded NP scores). 100% is the maximum possible percentage score.</description>

    <measure>Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique (CHART): Physical Independence Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>long term (1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>Use as a measure of handicap that captures the interaction of the person and the environment, and of community reintegration and participation. The CHART quantifies handicap by evaluating five domains: physical independence, mobility, occupation, social integration, and economic self-sufficiency. The CHART is made up of 27 questions with responses that are countable or in a yes/no format. Each of the five subscales has a maximum score of 100, and they may be summed to form a total score. High scores indicate lesser handicap. The CHART was developed as a specific instrument to measure handicap, is the only measure of that concept validated specifically for persons with SCI, and is currently the most widely used measure related to community reintegration in SCI. The Physical Independence subscale measures the ability to sustain a customarily effective independent existence.</description>

        <title>Wheelchair Skills Test (WST)</title>
        <description>The WST is a standardized evaluation method that permits a set of representative wheelchair skills to be objectively, simply and inexpensively documented. The WST is an instrument for the objective evaluation of wheelchair skills. The WST consists of a series of commonly used wheelchair skills spanning the spectrum from those as basic as applying brakes to those as difficult as climbing curbs and performing wheelies. The WSC encompasses 57 skills (in Version 4.1) which result in a total score. The WST provide a pass-fail score for each skill. Refusal to attempt a skill (e.g. because of fear) constitutes a failing grade. The numerator is the Total Raw Score (i.e., the number of individual skills awarded a passing score) and the denominator is the number of applicable skills (i.e., the total number of skills minus those awarded NP scores). 100% is the maximum possible percentage score.</description>

        <title>Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique (CHART): Physical Independence Subscale</title>
        <description>Use as a measure of handicap that captures the interaction of the person and the environment, and of community reintegration and participation. The CHART quantifies handicap by evaluating five domains: physical independence, mobility, occupation, social integration, and economic self-sufficiency. The CHART is made up of 27 questions with responses that are countable or in a yes/no format. Each of the five subscales has a maximum score of 100, and they may be summed to form a total score. High scores indicate lesser handicap. The CHART was developed as a specific instrument to measure handicap, is the only measure of that concept validated specifically for persons with SCI, and is currently the most widely used measure related to community reintegration in SCI. The Physical Independence subscale measures the ability to sustain a customarily effective independent existence.</description>

          <title>Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique (CHART): Economic Self-Sufficiency Subscale</title>
          <description>Use as a measure of handicap that captures the interaction of the person and the environment, and of community reintegration and participation. The CHART quantifies handicap by evaluating five domains: physical independence, mobility, occupation, social integration, and economic self-sufficiency. The CHART is made up of 27 questions with responses that are countable or in a yes/no format. Each of the five subscales has a maximum score of 100, and they may be summed to form a total score. High scores indicate lesser handicap. The CHART was developed as a specific instrument to measure handicap, is the only measure of that concept validated specifically for persons with SCI, and is currently the most widely used measure related to community reintegration in SCI. The Economic Self-Sufficiency subscale measures the ability to sustain customary socio-economic activity and independence.</description>
