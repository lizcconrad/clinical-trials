  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Defects in the apoptotic process can lead to the onset of cancer by allowing cells to grow
      unchecked when an oncogneic signal is present. Obatoclax is designed to restore apoptosis
      through inhibition of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, thereby reinstating the natural process
      of cell death that is often inhibited in cancer cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase I study of obatoclax administered every 2-week or
      weekly cycles, or as a Prolonged Infusion every 2 to 3 weeks to patients with Acute Myeloid
      Leukemia (AML), Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)in Myeloid
      Blast Phase, Myelofibrosis, Previously-Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), or
      Aplastic Anemia. Due to the PK/PD sampling schedule Cycle 1 will require overnight
      hospitalization. For the following cycles treatment may be administered on an outpatient
      basis but is at the discretion of the investigator. No investigational or commercial agents
      or therapies other than those described within the protocol may be administered with the
      intent to treat the patient's malignancy. Supportive care measures including those directed
      at controlling symptoms resulting from hematological malignancies are allowed.
