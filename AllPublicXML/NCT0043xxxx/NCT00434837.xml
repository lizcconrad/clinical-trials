  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of four strong ligaments connecting the bones of
      the knee joint. If overstretched, the ACL can tear. Reconstruction of a torn ACL is now a
      common surgical procedure. The amount of tension applied to the ACL during reconstruction may
      indirectly affect the possible onset of arthritis over time. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the effect of initial graft tension set during ACL reconstruction surgery on the
      progression of knee arthritis over at least a 12-year period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Damage to the ACL is a common injury that usually requires surgical reconstruction to restore
      function and prevent progression of post-traumatic osteoarthritis. However, the
      reconstruction procedure frequently causes degenerative changes to the knee joint over time.
      The amount of tension applied to the ACL during reconstruction may indirectly affect the
      possible onset of arthritis over time. High tension would result in less joint motion during
      the initial healing stages, which may make the onset of arthritis less likely. On the other
      hand, high tension would result in increased compressive forces between the joint surfaces,
      which could lead to arthritis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of initial
      graft tension set during ACL reconstruction surgery on joint cartilage and the development of
      knee arthritis over at least a 12-year period.

      Participants will include candidates for ACL reconstruction surgery using patellar tendon
      grafts. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups:

        -  Low tension (Group 1) participants will receive low-tension treatment with initial graft
           tension set so that the anterior-posterior (A-P) displacement of the reconstructed knee
           is equal to that of the uninjured knee.

        -  High-tension (Group 2) participants will receive high-tension treatment with initial
           graft tension set to reduce A-P displacement by 2 millimeters relative to that of the
           uninjured knee.

      Participants will enroll in this 12-year study 1 to 6 weeks prior to ACL surgery. There will
      be two preoperative study visits: one will include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the
      other will include a knee evaluation, dynamic function testing, and questionnaires.
      Postoperative visits occurred immediately following surgery and at 6, 12, 36, 60, 84, 120 and
      144 months following surgery. Strength testing, functional testing, x-rays, questionnaires,
      and a knee exam will occur at most postoperative visits. MRIs will occur at some
      postoperative visits. An additional group of participants with no evidence of knee injury
      will serve as a control. The control group will attend all study visits except for the
      12-month visit. All participants may be followed for up to 10 years.

    <description>Medial joint space width measurements were obtained from radiographs preoperatively and postoperatively using the semiflexed metatarsophalangeal view. Radiographs were taken of each knee, and the medial compartment joint space width was measured at the midline of the compartment in the coronal plane using a validated computer algorithm.
(Duryea et al., Trainable rule-based algorithm for the measurement of joint space width in digital radiographic images of the knee, Medical Physics 27, 580 (2000); doi: 10.1118/1.598897). Subjects are identified as having radiographic signs of OA if they exhibit a change in the medial or lateral compartments greater that 0.30mm over the study period</description>

    <intervention_name>Initial graft tension during ACL reconstruction surgery</intervention_name>
    <description>The amount of tension that is applied to the graft at the time of fixation is being performed with the knee in two different positions. When the knee is at 30 degrees of flexion, the resulting laxity is approximately 2 mm less than the contralateral leg (the &quot;High Tension&quot; treatment). When the tension is performed with the knee in extension (0 degrees of flexion), the the laxity is equal to that of the contralateral leg (the &quot;Low Tension&quot; treatment). Both methods are commonly used in clinical practice. The effect it may have on articular cartilage remains unknown.</description>
