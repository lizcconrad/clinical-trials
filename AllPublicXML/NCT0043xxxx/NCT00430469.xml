  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The safety and tolerability of hLF 1-11 given in multiple doses has to be established first
      in HSCT recipients who are at risk of developing, but have not yet developed, infectious
      complications due to invasive fungal or bacterial disease. These patients are different from
      healthy volunteers because they have received myeloablative treatment, which not only arrests
      haematopoiesis resulting in neutropenia but also induces mucosal barrier injury both of which
      predispose to infections, which typically occur during the week after transplant. It is
      therefore essential to know that hLF 1-11 is safe and well tolerated when given during
      neutropenia and mucosal barrier injury before infections ensue.

    <textblock>
      Human lactoferrin (hLF) is a glycoprotein containing 692 amino acids and found in the saliva,
      milk, tears, and other body fluids. The peptide representing the first cationic domain, i.e.
      the peptide comprising the first eleven residues of hLF (further referred to as hLF1-11) was
      significantly more effective than the full length protein or the peptide representing the
      second cationic domain. As with other antimicrobial peptides, hLF1-11 shows poor
      antimicrobial activity under physiological conditions in vitro, but it is highly effective in
      vivo against infections due to a variety of microorganisms, including Gram negative and Gram
      positive bacteria and fungi. The objective is to develop hLF1-11 for the treatment of fungal
      and bacterial infections that develop during neutropenia that results from myeloablative
      therapy to prepare for a haematopoietic stem cell transplant(HSCT) formerly referred to as
      bone marrow transplant. Rates of infection and related morbidity are high in this population,
      making it an attractive target for testing clinically the proof-of-principle that hLF1-11 can
      provide effective treatment. Subsequently, hLF1-11 will be developed further as a systemic
      antifungal agent
