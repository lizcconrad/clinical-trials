  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the first phase of the study is to determine whether, and at what dose,
      depsipeptide, bortezomib and dexamethasone can be safely administered to patients with
      Multiple Myeloma. The second phase of the study will establish whether depsipeptide,
      bortezomib and dexamethasone is effective in the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma.
      The study will also examine the role of maintenance therapy with depsipeptide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several groups have explored the possible synergistic interactions between proteasome and
      HDAC inhibitors in malignant hematopoietic cells. Bortezomib and HDACIs synergistically
      induce apoptosis, mitochondrial injury (via BAX), ROS generation and oxidative injury in
      human leukemia and myeloma cells.

      In view of this evidence, we are proposing a trial to examine the clinical effects of
      combined romidepsin and bortezomib in patients with relapsed/refractory MM. However, there
      are currently no data as to whether these drugs are safe to administer in combination or at
      what dose toxicity they may become unacceptable.

      Trial Design Open label, single centre, single arm, phase I/II dose escalation trial of
      bortezomib-dexamethasone with the addition of romidepsin followed by maintenance therapy
      until disease progression.

      Primary objective:

      • To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of romidepsin administered with Bortezomib in
      patients with relapsed multiple myeloma by the assessment of adverse events and abnormal
      laboratory values.

      Primary endpoint:

      • Toxicity evaluation at each of four dose levels presented in the dose-escalation schedule

      Secondary objective:

      • To determine the efficacy of this combination at the MTD in terms of (i) overall response,
      (ii) time to progression and (iii) overall survival

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Overall response (OR), defined as the best response on treatment based on M Protein
           response criteria with CR documented to EMBT standard and in conjunction with soft
           tissue plasmacytomas response criteria and corrected serum calcium level.

        -  Time to progression (TTP), defined as the time from commencement of treatment to the
           date of first evidence of progressive disease.

        -  Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from commencement of treatment to the date of
           death from any cause
