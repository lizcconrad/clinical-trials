    <textblock>
      This project is a novel exploratory research project to investigate changes in activation
      patterns of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in inpatients with schizophrenia who
      received a 12-week computerized cognitive remediation (CRT) program. The hypothesis is that
      patients receiving CRT will show greater increase in activation patterns in the brain as
      compared to controls, and the degree of brain activation will correlate with improvements in
      working memory.

      Abnormalities in the domains of attention, working memory (WM) and information processing are
      important features of schizophrenia. There is growing literature that cognitive remediation
      therapy (CRT) can produce modest improvements in cognitive functioning in schizophrenia,
      suggesting that systematic efforts at improving cognitive functioning are feasible. Cognitive
      improvement after CRT may correlate with changes in brain activation patterns in specific
      areas.

      After screening, patients are randomized to a 12 week trial of CRT using COGPACK (Marker
      Software), or to a 12-week control condition. All patients attend 3 weekly 1-hour laboratory
      sessions, with 1 discussion session per week.

      Patients continue their antipsychotic treatment with a typical or atypical antipsychotic
      during the CRT and 4 weeks prior to enrollment in the study (Phase A). Following Phase A they
      receive baseline evaluations, including an cognitive activation task (N-back visual-letter
      task) while being scanned for fMRI , MATRICS neuropsychological test battery, and
      psychiatric, social functioning, and symptoms assessment.

      Patients then enter Phase B with randomization to control or CRT for 12 weeks (36 laboratory
      sessions). Upon successful completion of 36 sessions, endpoint evaluations include an N-back
      task while fMRI scan, MATRICS, psychiatric, and social functional assessments.

      All baseline and endpoint fMRI scans are conducted at the Center for Advanced Brain Imaging
      (CABI) at Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research.
