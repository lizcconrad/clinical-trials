  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is undertaken to investigate the effect of navigated knee implantation surgery on
      physical function, joint stiffness, pain, quality of life and coordinative abilities.

      One group of patients will receive navigated knee implantation surgery, the other traditional
      knee implantation surgery, without use of the navigation system.

      The study is designed as a randomized trial. That means that all patients who have given
      their consent to participate in this study will be allocated to either navigated or
      conventional surgery by chance.

      A total of 477 patients will be included in this study and will be followed up for 12 month.

      In this period all patients will be asked to fill in functional and quality of life
      questionnaires at baseline, 6 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 month follow-up. Coordinative abilities
      will be evaluated once in the time-frame 3 to 6 months postoperatively.

      Various risk factors influencing the success of Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) have been
      studied.

      Today age, gender, primary or revision surgery, comorbidities and baseline characteristics
      are known to influence the health-related quality of life after TKA.

      It is thought, that accurate mechanical alignment and ligament balance ensure optimal
      kinematic performance and wear, which in turn improves long-term outcome.

      During preparation of the bone for the implantation of the knee prosthesis, numerous cuts are
      performed. Traditionally mechanical adjusted jigs are used to accurately align and position
      the instruments.

      Since this alignment process is a source for deviation even in experienced surgeons, several
      navigation systems were developed. Using these systems, the surgeon is guided in the location
      of the instruments with the help of a computer.

      Several studies could show that the use of such a navigation system leads to an improved
      execution of planned axis relations, as measured on the radiographs. However, it is not
      clear, whether or to what extent the improved realization of the preoperative planned axis
      relations results in a positive effect for the patient.

      This multicenter randomized clinical trail is conducted to compare the operative results of
      navigated and non-navigated knee replacement surgery.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of a navigation system on health-related quality
      of life, measured as pain, stiffness, physical function, coordinative abilities, and patient
      satisfaction.

      The hypotheses tested is that the use of the navigation system for total knee arthroplasty
      leads to improved health-related quality of life.
