  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NT 201 is a botulinum toxin type A preparation free of complexing proteins, i.e. free of
      proteins other than the active toxin. Injected into the muscle, NT 201 causes local weakening
      to full paralysis depending on the administered dose. Botulinum toxin type A is widely used
      for aesthetic treatment of facial lines. This study will determine the optimal dose of NT 201
      in the treatment of glabellar frown lines.

    <measure>Percentage of responders at maximum frown at Day 30 as assessed by the investigator according to Facial Wrinkle Scale (FWS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) to Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Responders on the FWS are defined as subjects with glabellar line severity of none (0) or mild (1).
The Primary Analysis Set (PAS) will be used for all confirmatory tests for the primary efficacy variables of the co-primary endpoint. The PAS will consist of all subjects in the Full Analysis Set who have available assessments by the investigator for severity of glabellar frown lines at maximum frown on Day 30, as well as patient's assessment at Day 0 and Day 30. All analyses for this population will therefore use the same sample for both primary endpoints.</description>

    <description>Single treatment with 10, 20 or 30 Units of NT 201 given as intramuscular treatment injections of equal amount to 5 sites on Day 0. The same volume of reconstituted study medication (0.6 mL per subject) was administered irrespective of the treatment group. The total dose volume was administered in equal aliquots to the 5 injection sites. Thus, each of the 5 injection sites was injected with 0.12 mL study medication per injection site.</description>
