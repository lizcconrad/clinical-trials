  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clopidogrel pre-treatment before planned percutaneous coronary intervention was proved to
      reduce periprocedural complications. However, the vast majority of patients in the current
      interventional cardiology practice do not undergo planned PCI, but rather &quot;ad-hoc&quot; PCI
      performed immediately after coronary angiography . Whether clopidogrel should be administered
      as pre-treatment to all patients undergoing elective CAG with the aim to ensure therapeutic
      levels at the time of possible ad-hoc PCI is not known.
