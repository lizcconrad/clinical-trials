  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pleurodesis is a technique used to fuse the two layers of the lining over the lung. This is
      done to get rid of collections of fluid or air in this space. A common reason would be cancer
      of the underlying lung or elsewhere causing fluid to collect in the pleural space. In this
      situation it is a palliative procedure to free the patient from symptoms like breathlessness.

    <textblock>
      Pleurodesis is a technique used to fuse the two layers of the pleura. This is done to prevent
      reaccumulation of collections of fluid or air in this space. Common indications are malignant
      pleural effusions, recurrent pneumothorax and even benign effusions which are otherwise
      difficult to eradicate.
