  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and a lesser condition that occurs prior to ARDS,
      Acute Lung Injury (ALI), are medical conditions that occur when there is severe inflammation
      and increased fluids (edema) in both lungs, making it hard for the lungs to function
      properly. Patients with these conditions require treatment that includes the use of a
      breathing machine (ventilator). The purpose of this study is to find out whether giving
      albuterol (a drug commonly used in asthmatics) or not giving albuterol to patients with ALI
      or ARDS makes a difference in how long it takes for a patient to be able to breath without
      the ventilator.

      Aerosolized beta-2 agonist therapy is anticipated to diminish the formation of lung edema,
      enhance clearance of lung edema and decrease pulmonary inflammation in patients with acute
      lung injury. Because beta-2 agonists have been shown to reduce permeability induced lung
      injury, it is anticipated that the severity of lung injury will be reduced by aerosolized
      beta-2 agonist therapy. The therapy may work by enhancing resolution of pulmonary edema by
      upregulating alveolar epithelial fluid transport mechanisms that will in turn enhance the
      clearance of alveolar edema. A reduction in the severity of lung injury and the quantity of
      alveolar edema should result in earlier extubation and more ventilator free days, improved
      pulmonary oxygen uptake, and improved lung compliance.

      Study design: phase II/III prospective, randomized double-blind, placebo controlled trial.

        -  In Phase II, patients will be treated with aerosolized albuterol 5.0 mg vs. normal
           saline (n=40-50)administered every 4 hours for 10 days following randomization or until
           24 hours following extubation, whichever occurs first. The protocol stipulates that the
           5.0 mg dose will be reduced to 2.5 mg if patients exceed defined heart rate limits.

        -  In Phase III, the 5.0 mg dose will be used unless there is evidence that this dose has
           an unacceptable safety profile or dose reductions for tachycardia occur in a large
           fraction of patients. In that case, a lower dose of 2.5 mg will be used.

        -  Patients will be followed for 90 days or until discharge from the hospital to home with
           unassisted breathing whichever occurs first.

    <measure>Number of Ventilator Free Days (VFD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Determined 28 days after a subject entered the study</time_frame>
    <description>Ventilator-free days (VFDs) is defined as the number of days from randomization to Day 28 after achieving unassisted breathing for patients who maintained unassisted breathing for at least two consecutive calendar days. If a patient achieved unassisted breathing, subsequently required additional assisted breathing, and once again achieved unassisted breathing, we counted only the VFDs after beginning the final period of unassisted breathing. Patients who died before Day 28 were assigned zero VFDs.</description>

    <measure>Number of ICU-free Days at 28 Days After Randomization</measure>
    <time_frame>Determined 28 days after a subject entered the study</time_frame>
    <description>ICU (intensive care unit)-free days was defined as the number of days a subject was out of the ICU during study hospitalization from date of randomization up to study day 28. All incidences of ICU admission and discharge during the study hospitalization were captured. Any portion of a calendar day that a subject was in the ICU was counted as an ICU day.</description>

    <measure>Number of Organ Failure-free Days at Day 28 Following Randomization</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily from baseline to study day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were followed for development of organ failures from date of randomization to hospital discharge or study day 28, whichever was first. Organ failure was defined as present on any calendar day when the most abnormal vital signs or clinically available lab value met the definition of clinically significant organ failure according to the Brussels Organ Failure Table. Each day a patient was alive and free of a given clinically significant organ failure was scored as a failure-free day. The worst value for a calendar day was captured (lowest systolic BP, platelet count and highest creatinine and bilirubin values). Specific definitions of organ failure were: cardiovascular-systolic BP less than or equal to 90 mmHg or on a vasopressor; coagulation-platelet count less than or equal to 80 x 1000/mm3; Renal-creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL; Hepatic-bilirubin less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL.</description>

    <measure>Ventilator Free Days to Day 28 in the Subset of Participants With ARDS</measure>
    <time_frame>Determined 28 days after a subject entered the study</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in the main outcome Ventilator Free Days to study day 28 was calculated for the subset of patients with ARDS (defined as a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than or equal to 200). P/F ratio is an index of the effectiveness of arterial oxygenation that corresponds to the ratio of partial pressure of arterial O2 to the fraction of inspired O2. VFD to Day 28 is defined as the number of days from the end of ventilation to day 28 in patients who maintained unassisted breathing for at least two consecutive calendar days. Patients who died before day 28 were assigned a VFD count of zero. If a patient returned to assisted breathing, subsequently required assisted breathing, and once again achieved unassisted breathing, only the VFDs after beginning the final period of unassisted breathing were counted. An increase in the number of VFDs was considered a positive result.</description>

    <measure>Plasma Levels of IL-6 and IL-8 on Study Day 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and 3 days after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Biologic end-points were selected that would provide mechanistic insight into how albuterol improved lung function. Concentrations of two proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin 6 and 8 (IL-6 and IL-8), were measured. Plasma was collected and cytokine levels were measured at baseline and 3 days after randomization. IL-6 and IL-8 levels were normalized using log transformation. Wilcoxon's test was used to compare mean log-transformed interleukin levels per day and a mixed-effects model was fit to compare the slopes.</description>

        <description>Ventilator-free days (VFDs) is defined as the number of days from randomization to Day 28 after achieving unassisted breathing for patients who maintained unassisted breathing for at least two consecutive calendar days.

        <description>Subjects were followed for development of organ failures from date of randomization to hospital discharge or study day 28, whichever was first. Organ failure was defined as present on any calendar day when the most abnormal vital signs or clinically available lab value met the definition of clinically significant organ failure according to the Brussels Organ Failure Table. Each day a patient was alive and free of a given clinically significant organ failure was scored as a failure-free day. The worst value for a calendar day was captured (lowest systolic BP, platelet count and highest creatinine and bilirubin values). Specific definitions of organ failure were: cardiovascular-systolic BP less than or equal to 90 mmHg or on a vasopressor; coagulation-platelet count less than or equal to 80 x 1000/mm3; Renal-creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL; Hepatic-bilirubin less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL.</description>

        <title>Ventilator Free Days to Day 28 in the Subset of Participants With ARDS</title>
        <description>Difference in the main outcome Ventilator Free Days to study day 28 was calculated for the subset of patients with ARDS (defined as a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than or equal to 200). P/F ratio is an index of the effectiveness of arterial oxygenation that corresponds to the ratio of partial pressure of arterial O2 to the fraction of inspired O2. VFD to Day 28 is defined as the number of days from the end of ventilation to day 28 in patients who maintained unassisted breathing for at least two consecutive calendar days. Patients who died before day 28 were assigned a VFD count of zero. If a patient returned to assisted breathing, subsequently required assisted breathing, and once again achieved unassisted breathing, only the VFDs after beginning the final period of unassisted breathing were counted. An increase in the number of VFDs was considered a positive result.</description>

          <title>Ventilator Free Days to Day 28 in the Subset of Participants With ARDS</title>
          <description>Difference in the main outcome Ventilator Free Days to study day 28 was calculated for the subset of patients with ARDS (defined as a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than or equal to 200). P/F ratio is an index of the effectiveness of arterial oxygenation that corresponds to the ratio of partial pressure of arterial O2 to the fraction of inspired O2. VFD to Day 28 is defined as the number of days from the end of ventilation to day 28 in patients who maintained unassisted breathing for at least two consecutive calendar days. Patients who died before day 28 were assigned a VFD count of zero. If a patient returned to assisted breathing, subsequently required assisted breathing, and once again achieved unassisted breathing, only the VFDs after beginning the final period of unassisted breathing were counted. An increase in the number of VFDs was considered a positive result.</description>

        <description>Biologic end-points were selected that would provide mechanistic insight into how albuterol improved lung function. Concentrations of two proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin 6 and 8 (IL-6 and IL-8), were measured. Plasma was collected and cytokine levels were measured at baseline and 3 days after randomization. IL-6 and IL-8 levels were normalized using log transformation. Wilcoxon’s test was used to compare mean log-transformed interleukin levels per day and a mixed-effects model was fit to compare the slopes.</description>
