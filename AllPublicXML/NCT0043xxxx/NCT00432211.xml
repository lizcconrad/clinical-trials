  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being undertaken to investigate the efficacy and safety of Juvista (given as an
      intradermal injection of 200ng/100µl per linear centimetre of wound margin) in the prevention
      or improvement of scar appearance when administered intradermally to approximated wound
      margins following surgical scar revision.

      In addition, this study will compare the scar revision techniques of complete excision
      (excision of the entire scar during one surgical procedure) and staged excision (excision of
      the outmost segments and central core separately).

    <description>Complete Excision:- On Day 0,Following wound closure the two outer segments of the wound will receive either Juvista or placebo.100µl of vehicle containing 200ng of Juvista will be injected per linear centimetre into both margins of one segment of the wound,and 100µl of vehicle alone (placebo) will be injected per linear centimetre into the other segment of the wound. There will be a central area (at least 3cm) of untreated wound between the two segments.The treatments will be re-administered to each wound segment (A and B) 24 hours after the first administration.
Staged Excision On Day 0, the two end segments of the scar will be excised.Following wound closure each subject will receive 100µl of vehicle containing 200ng of Juvista per linear centimetre intradermally into one wound, and 100µl of vehicle alone (placebo) per linear centimetre into the other wound.The trial treatments will be re-administered to each wound 24 hours after the first administration.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects aged 18-85 years who have provided written informed consent.

          -  A body mass index between 15 and 35 kg/m2 .

          -  Subjects with, in the opinion of the Investigator, clinically acceptable results for
             the laboratory tests specified in the trial protocol.

          -  Female subjects of child bearing potential who are using method(s) of contraception
             acceptable to the Investigator and agree to do so from at least the screening visit
             until one month after administration of the final study dose.

          -  Subjects with linear scars that, in the opinion of the Investigator, are suitable for
             revision by excision and direct closure. The area of scar to be revised must be at
             least 5cm in length and have at least two comparable areas.

          -  Subjects, who, in the opinion of the Investigator have stabilised, mature scars.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who on direct questioning and physical examination have history or evidence
             of keloid scarring.

          -  Subjects with scars for revision that cross a joint or are in close proximity to an
             anatomical structure, which could lead to distortion of the resultant scar.

          -  Subjects with additional scars less than 3cm away from the area to be revised.

          -  Subjects with a history of a bleeding disorder.

          -  Subjects with diseases or conditions that could, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             interfere with the assessment of safety, tolerability or efficacy.

          -  Subjects who have had surgery in the area to be excised within one year of Day 0.

          -  Subjects with a skin disorder that is chronic or currently active and which the
             Investigator considers will adversely affect the healing of the acute wounds or
             involves the areas to be examined in this trial.

          -  Subjects who on direct questioning and / or physical examination, have evidence of any
             past or present clinically significant medical condition that would impair wound
             healing.

          -  Subjects with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity to any of the drugs
             or surgical dressings to be used in this trial.

          -  Subjects who are taking, or have taken, any investigational drugs including Juvista
             within 3 months prior to the screening visit.

          -  Subjects who are taking regular, continuous, oral corticosteroid therapy.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have significant ongoing psychiatric
             disorders, which may interfere with the trial assessments / visits.

          -  Subjects undergoing investigations or changes in management for an existing medical
             condition.

          -  Subjects who are or who become pregnant up to and including Day 0 or who are
             lactating.

             for whatever reason.
