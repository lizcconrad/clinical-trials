  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to compare the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of the combination
      valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg versus amlodipine 10 mg in patients with essential hypertension
      not adequately controlled (defined as mean sitting systolic blood pressure [msSBP] ≥ 130 mmHg
      and ≤ 160 mmHg) on amlodipine 5 mg alone. The study evaluated both the efficacy and
      tolerability of the treatments by providing data that assessed blood pressure and the
      proportion of patients developing peripheral edema.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP) From Baseline to Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure (BP) was measured at trough (24±3 hours post-dose). The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. If there was &lt; 0. 5 mmHg difference in BP between the 2 arms, the non-dominant arm was used. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor for 5 minutes, systolic and diastolic BP were measured 3 times with an automated BP monitor and appropriate size cuff. Means of the 3 measurements were calculated. A negative change indicates lowered BP.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Peripheral Edema From Baseline to Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Only occurrences of peripheral edema quantified as a reported adverse event coded as peripheral edema were included in the analysis. If a patient experienced more than one occurrence of peripheral edema between Day 1 and Week 8, it was only counted once in the analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (msDBP) From Baseline to Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure (BP) was measured at trough (24±3 hours post-dose). The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. If there was &lt; 0. 5 mmHg difference in BP between the 2 arms, the non-dominant arm was used. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor for 5 minutes, systolic and diastolic BP were measured 3 times with an automated BP monitor and appropriate size cuff.

    <measure>Change in Mean Sitting Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure (msSBP, msDBP) From Baseline to Weeks 4, 8, and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Weeks 4, 8, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure (BP) was measured at trough (24±3 hours post-dose). The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. If there was &lt; 0. 5 mmHg difference in BP between the 2 arms, the non-dominant arm was used. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor for 5 minutes, systolic and diastolic BP were measured 3 times with an automated BP monitor and appropriate size cuff.

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Achieving a Systolic Response at Weeks 4, 8, and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Weeks 4, 8, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic response was defined as msSBP &lt; 130 mmHg or at least a 20 mmHg reduction from baseline in msSBP at Weeks 4, 8, and 12. Blood pressure (BP) was measured at trough (24±3 hours post-dose). The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor for 5 minutes, systolic and diastolic BP were measured 3 times with an automated BP monitor and appropriate size cuff.

    <description>Twelve (12) weeks treatment with the combination of valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg. Together with the active medication, patients received a placebo that matched amlodipine 5 mg. The three capsules were taken by mouth with water once daily in the morning, regardless of meals. Patients were instructed not to take their study medication the morning of their study visits. Instead, they brought the study medication with them to the site and took it there as instructed by the investigator.</description>

    <description>Eight (8) weeks of treatment with amlodipine 10 mg (two 5 mg capsules). Together with the active medication, the patients received a placebo that matched valsartan 160 mg. At Week 8, patients were switched and treated with the combination of valsartan/amlodipine 160/5 mg and a placebo that matched amlodipine 5 mg for an additional 4 weeks until the end of the study. The three capsules were taken by mouth with water once daily in the morning, regardless of meals. Patients were instructed not to take their study medication the morning of their study visits.

        <title>Change in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP) From Baseline to Week 8</title>
        <description>Blood pressure (BP) was measured at trough (24±3 hours post-dose). The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. If there was &lt; 0. 5 mmHg difference in BP between the 2 arms, the non-dominant arm was used. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor for 5 minutes, systolic and diastolic BP were measured 3 times with an automated BP monitor and appropriate size cuff. Means of the 3 measurements were calculated. A negative change indicates lowered BP.</description>

The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. If there was &lt; 0. 5 mmHg difference in BP between the 2 arms, the non-dominant arm was used. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position with the back supported and both feet placed on the floor for 5 minutes, systolic and diastolic BP were measured 3 times with an automated BP monitor and appropriate size cuff. Means of the 3 measurements were calculated. A negative change indicates lowered BP.</description>
