    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to help answer the following research questions:

        -  To assess whether Enzastaurin combined with rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin
           (R-GEMOX) can help patients with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma remain free from disease
           and thus live longer.

        -  To assess for any side effects that might be associated with enzastaurin and R-GEMOX .

        -  To look at the characteristics and levels of certain genes and proteins to learn more
           about DLBCL and how enzastaurin works in the body.

        -  To look at the level of enzastaurin in the body and how long it remains.
