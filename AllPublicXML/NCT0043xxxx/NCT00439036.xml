  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop an opiate detoxification behavior therapy based on
      current Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) theory and method, and to test its
      feasibility and promise in the context of voluntary methadone detoxification.

    <textblock>
      This Stage I pilot study will employ a randomized, controlled, between groups design in which
      70 opiate dependent patients seeking methadone detoxification will be randomized into one of
      two treatment conditions: ACT opiate detoxification therapy or Drug Counseling. Both
      therapies will be delivered in the context of a 5-month methadone dose reduction based on a
      linear dosing strategy. Efficacy variables will include: (1) abstinence rates during and
      1-month after detoxification as assessed by regular urine screens; (2) retention of patients
      in treatment; and (3) patient satisfaction and treatment acceptability. Reduction in
      HIV/Hepatitis C risk behaviors and changes in psychosocial functioning (e.g., employment,
      family, legal) will also be explored, along with mediators/moderators of the therapy (i.e.,
      experiential avoidance). Subjects will be recruited from Houston area methadone clinics and
      the general community via advertising and will receive methadone as part of this protocol. A
      2-4 week stabilization period will precede the 5-month methadone dose reduction. During the
      dose reduction, participants will attend the clinic twice each week and will receive weekly
      therapy. Participants will be contacted for follow up assessments up to one month post
      treatment.
