      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Obtain informed consent from parents (and the child, when appropriate) of children
           diagnosed with cancer (who are under 21 years of age) to register their child's name and
           address with the Childhood Cancer Research Network.

        -  Obtain informed consent from parents (and the child, when appropriate) of children
           diagnosed with cancer (who are under 21 years of age) to be contacted in the future for
           possible participation in non-therapeutic research studies involving the parents and/or
           child.

        -  Facilitate the systematic registration of pediatric and adolescent patients diagnosed
           with cancer into the Childhood Cancer Research Network.

      OUTLINE: Consent is obtained from parents (and pediatric patients, where applicable) to
      register the patient's and parent's names and addresses with the Childhood Cancer Research
      Network, provide a copy of the pathology report to the Network, and contact parents in the
      future for possible non-therapeutic research studies involving the parents and/or child.

      Information provided will be held in strict confidence.
