      The primary objective of the the study is to investigate the changes in bone remodeling
      during Velcade treatment.

      20 patients will be included in the study over a 2 year period. Before, during and after
      treatment we will measure NTX-I, CTX-I, CTX-MMP, bALP, DKK-1, PINP, TRAcP and PTH. NTX, CTX
      and CTX-MMP are measured to estimate bone degradation. TRAcP is measured to estimate the
      activity of the osteoclasts. bALP and DKK-1 is measured to evaluate the activity of the
      osteoblasts and PINP is measured as a marker of new bone formation. PTH is measured in order
      to evaluate if the positive effects that is observed in bone formation in relations to
      velcade treatment is due to the pulsative way velcade is administered.

      The effect of the velcade treatment will be evaluated by x-ray, bone marrow and m-component.
