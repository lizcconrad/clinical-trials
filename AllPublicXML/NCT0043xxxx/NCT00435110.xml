  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current American-European Consensus Conference (AECC) definitions for ALI and ARDS are
      inadequate for inclusion into clinical trials due to the lack of standardization for
      measuring the oxygenation defect. We questioned whether an early assessment of oxygenation on
      specific ventilator settings would identify patients with established ARDS (persisting over
      24h).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We designed this study to determine whether standard ventilator settings applied on the day
      ARDS is identified (Day 0) or 24 hours (Day 1) later: (1) would have an impact on the
      reclassification of patients into ALI or ARDS, and (2) would identify groups with different
      clinical outcomes. Our hypothesis was that the assessment of PaO2/FiO2 on standard ventilator
      settings 24 hours after patients originally met the AECC definition of ARDS would identify
      patients with established ARDS (persisting over 24 h) from others with different degrees of
      lung injury. If this hypothesis is supported, it would suggest that patients with a better
      outcome could have been preferentially entered into one group of previously conducted
      clinical trials, resulting in a viable therapy being proved useless or useless therapy proven
      viable.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients meeting American-European Consensus Conference (AECC) ARDS criteria were
             approached for enrollment regardless of their current status or past medical history.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The only patients excluded were those in which &gt;24 hrs had pasted after initially
             meeting the AECC ARDS criteria before consent and results of initial standard
             ventilator settings could be obtained.
