  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies about the potential role of NK alloreactive during a n hematopoietic stem
      cells graft are based on genotypical analyses of the KIR receptors and on genotypic
      incompatibilities between KIR and HLA for couple donor/recipient. There is still a lot of
      issues non resolved: Are KIR really expressed and how occur their expression during time when
      hematopoietic reconstitution? Is it depending on HLA of the recipient?If KIR are expressed,
      what are the mechanisms of alloreactivity of NK cells? Are NK able to lyse tumoral cells?
      Could alloreactive NK cells constitute a therapeutic tool able to induce tolerance and
      elimination of leukemia during hematopoietic stem cells grafts?
