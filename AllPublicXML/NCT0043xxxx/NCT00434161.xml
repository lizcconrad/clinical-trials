  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and effect of palifermin on the
      incidence of oral mucositis in subjects with multiple myeloma receiving Melphalan followed by
      autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Amendment 01 (April 07) introduced
      three cataract assessments to be carried out at Screening, Month 6 and Month 12 in response
      to FDA and EMEA follow up measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter Phase IIIb study of
      palifermin given before and after dose chemotherapy (total 6 doses) or before dose
      chemotherapy only (total 3 doses), in subjects with Multiple Myeloma (MM)receiving high dose
      melphalan (chemotherapy), in a 1-day schedule, followed by autologous Peripheral Blood Stem
      Cell Transplantation (PBSCT).

      All subjects were to be followed for disease progression, second primary tumors, additional
      malignancies and survival for up to 10 years.

      Planned: 275 subjects, in fact, 281 subjects were randomized. Randomized: 115 subjects to
      palifermin pre/post-CT, 109 subjects to palifermin pre-CT and 57 subjects to placebo
      Analyzed: 281 subjects in the full analysis set, 277 subjects in the safety subset.

      Efficacy Oral cavity assessment, patient reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires (Oral
      Mucositis Daily Questionnaire [OMDQ], Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Esophageal
      [FACT-E], European Quality of Life Utility Scale [EQ 5D], Mucositis Chronic Symptoms
      Questionnaire [MCSQ]).

      Safety Physical examination (including body temperature), concomitant medications,
      transfusions, vital signs, laboratory assessments (hematology, chemistry), cataract
      assessments, adverse events (AEs).

    <time_frame>at Day 32</time_frame>
    <description>For the primary efficacy endpoint maximum severity of Oral Mucositis (OM) was assessed, the number of participants who had the different severity. To assess severity of OM, a 5-grade WHO scale (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4) was used.
0 = no findings or erythema only, 1= soreness present with or without erythema, 2=ulcers present but able to take solid food, 3 =ulcers present and only able to take liquids, 4 =ulcers present/not able to take anything orally.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Cataract Development or Progression at Month 12.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants from the primary cataract subset showing an increase from baseline of &gt;= 0.3 in the Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III score). The LOCS III is a standard system used for grading and comparison of cataract severity and type. The ophthalmologist trained in LOCS III uses a slit lamp for examining the lens of the eye. The classification evaluates four features: posterior subcapsular cataract(P),cortical cataract(C),nuclear opalescence(NO) and nuclear color(NC). NO and NC are graded on a decimal scale of 0.1 to 6.9, based on a set of 6 standardized photographs. C and P are graded on a decimal scale of 0.1 to 5.9, based on a set of 5 standardized photographs each. In the current study, cataract development or progression was defined as an increase from baseline of ≥ 0.3 on any of the three features P, C or NO (NC is of less importance and has not been analysed further in this study).</description>

The LOCS III is a standard system used for grading and comparison of cataract severity and type. The ophthalmologist trained in LOCS III uses a slit lamp for examining the lens of the eye. The classification evaluates four features: posterior subcapsular cataract(P),cortical cataract(C),nuclear opalescence(NO) and nuclear color(NC). NO and NC are graded on a decimal scale of 0.1 to 6.9, based on a set of 6 standardized photographs. C and P are graded on a decimal scale of 0.1 to 5.9, based on a set of 5 standardized photographs each. In the current study, cataract development or progression was defined as an increase from baseline of ≥ 0.3 on any of the three features P, C or NO (NC is of less importance and has not been analysed further in this study).</description>

          <title>Incidence of an Increase Posterior Subcapsular Cataract (P), Cortical Cataract (C) and Nuclear Opalescence (NO) at Month 6 and 12</title>
          <description>To assess the effect of palifermin on the incidence of cataract development or progression at Month 6 and Month 12 based on an increase of ≥ 0.3 in the Lens Opacities Classification System (LOCS III) score for Posterior (P), Cortical Cataract (C) and Nuclear Opalescence (NO).
For Subcapsular cataract (P), Cortical Cataract (C) and Nuclear Opalescence (NO): at month 6 and 12 adjusted difference of rate of cataract, Palifermin - Placebo were used and the confidence interval were calculated on the adjusted difference.</description>
          <population>281 subjects participated in the acute phase study of those 101 subjects were eligible for the cataract assessment study, 22 placebo and 79 palifermin. Month 6: 69 completed (17/22 [77.3%] in the placebo, 52/79 [65.8%] in the palifermin. Month 12: 66 completed (14/22 [63.6%] in the placebo, 52/79 [65.8%] in the palifermin group.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Posterior Subcapsular (P), Cortical (C) Cataract and Nuclear Opalescence (NO) on the Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III) Scale at Months 6.</title>
        <description>To study the change in cataract from baseline visit to months 6, three cataract main types: nuclear, cortical and posterior subcapsular measured on the Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III) Scale.
To assess the effect of palifermin on the incidence of cataract development or progression at Month 6 and Month 12 based on an increase of ≥ 0.3 in theLOCS III score for Posterior Subcapsular cataract (P), Cortical Cataract (C) and Nuclear Opalescence (NO).
The LOCS III is a standard system used for grading and comparison of cataract severity and type. The ophthalmologist uses a slit lamp for examining the lens of the eye. The classification evaluates: P,C and NO. NO is graded on a decimal scale of 0.1 to 6.9, based on a set of 6 standardized photographs. C and P are graded on a decimal scale of 0.1 to 5.9, based on a set of 5 standardized photographs each.</description>

        <population>All subjects in the acute phase study were also assessed for their eligibility for cataract assessment procedures according to predefined criteria. If a subject was not eligible for cataract assessment procedures, the subject could still have been eligible for inclusion in the study but was exempt from the cataract assessments.</population>

        <description>Number of participants from the primary cataract subset showing an increase from baseline of &gt;= 0.3 in the Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III score). The LOCS III is a standard system used for grading and comparison of cataract severity and type. The ophthalmologist trained in LOCS III uses a slit lamp for examining the lens of the eye. The classification evaluates four features: posterior subcapsular cataract(P),cortical cataract(C),nuclear opalescence(NO) and nuclear color(NC). NO and NC are graded on a decimal scale of 0.1 to 6.9, based on a set of 6 standardized photographs. C and P are graded on a decimal scale of 0.1 to 5.9, based on a set of 5 standardized photographs each. In the current study, cataract development or progression was defined as an increase from baseline of ≥ 0.3 on any of the three features P, C or NO (NC is of less importance and has not been analysed further in this study).</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits sponsor a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Sponsor may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multi-center studies, investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
