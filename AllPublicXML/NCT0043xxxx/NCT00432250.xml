      The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the use of sonographic cervical
      length (CL) on the hospital stay in women admitted because of preterm labor.

      Eligible women who agreed to participate in the study were randomized by means of a central
      randomization office into two groups:

      CONTROL group: cervical length was measured but the result was blinded to the physician in
      charge and women was managed according to the standard protocol.

      STUDY group: cervical length was measured and the result was reported to the physician in
      charge. If cervical length was of 25 mm or more, discharge in 12-24 h was recommended. If
      cervical length was less than 25 mm, decision on discharge was made following clinical
      criteria.
