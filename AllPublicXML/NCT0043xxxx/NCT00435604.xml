  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I, randomized, double-blinded, within-subject controlled, two-way crossover study
      comparing the time to inject (flow rate), safety, and tolerability of a subcutaneously (SC)
      administered, viscous antibody solution of with and without human recombinant hyaluronidase
      (rHuPH20) in volunteer subjects.

      The study hypothesizes that the time required to complete a 20-mL SC injection of a viscous
      antibody with rHuPH20 will be comparable or shorter than the time required for the injection
      without rHuPH20.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Volunteers of either sex, age 18 to 65 years, inclusive.

          2. Intact normal skin on both upper extremities without tattoos or potentially obscuring
             pigmentation or lesions.

          3. Vital signs (BP, HR, temperature, respiratory rate) within normal range.

          4. Metabolic panel (e.g., sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine,
             glucose, calcium, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, albumin, and total
             protein) within normal range within 7 days of injection.

          5. A negative serum or urine pregnancy test (if female of child-bearing potential) within
             7 days of injection.

          6. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must be practicing effective birth control
             or abstinence currently and plan to continue to do so for the duration of the study.

          7. Decision-making capacity and willingness and ability to comply with the requirements
             for full completion of the trial.

          8. Willingness and ability to sign an informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Upper extremity edema.

          2. Upper extremity pathology that could interfere with any protocol-specified outcome
             assessment (e.g., cellulitis, lymphatic disorder or prior surgery, preexisting pain
             syndrome, previous mastectomy and/or axillary lymph node dissection, etc.).

          3. Contraindication to an antibody, such as known history of anaphylactic or severe
             systemic reactions.

          4. Known predisposition to renal insufficiency or renal failure, including diabetes
             mellitus, volume depletion, sepsis, paraproteinemia, and subjects receiving known
             nephrotoxic drugs.

          5. Known allergy to hyaluronidase or any other ingredient in the formulation of Hylenex.

          6. Known allergy to bee or vespid venom.

          7. Known coagulopathy.

          8. Pregnancy or breast-feeding woman.

          9. Known clinically significant cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, neurological,
             psychiatric, endocrine, cancer, HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, intercurrent illness
             such as influenza, or other major systemic disease that would unduly risk the
             subject's safety or interfere with the interpretation of results.

         10. Participation in a study of any investigational drug or device within 30 days of
             enrollment in this study.
