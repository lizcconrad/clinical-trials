  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose
      of IPI-504 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study will examine how
      IPI-504 is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and eliminated by the body. The study will also
      evaluate the anti-tumor activity of IPI-504.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IPI-504 is a novel small molecule inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), an emerging and
      recently identified target for cancer therapy. Hsp90 is a protein chaperone that plays a
      central role in maintaining the proper folding, function and viability of various &quot;client
      proteins&quot;. Many of the client proteins stabilized by Hsp90 are oncoproteins and
      cell-signaling proteins important in cancer cell proliferation and cancer cell survival. This
      clinical trial will study the effects of IPI-504 in a molecularly defined sub-group of
      patients who carry client proteins found in non-small cell lung cancer.
