    <time_frame>At treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Technical success is defined as the ability to deploy the stent in satisfactory position across the stricture. It was assessed in the intent-to-treat cohort.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ability to Successfully Remove a Stent Upon Removal Attempt</measure>

    <description>The ability to successfully remove a stent upon a removal attempt was defined as removal without any clinically-significant complications or technical difficulties.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Re-interventions</measure>
    <time_frame>Until 6 months or death</time_frame>
    <description>Per the study protocol, re-intervention was defined as any type of endoscopic, percutaneous, or surgical procedure to improve biliary drainage after insertion of the initial stent.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Success at 1 Month After Stent Procedure as Defined by Reduction of Biliary Obstruction Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical success was defined as the reduction of biliary obstruction symptoms after treatment with the device.Symptoms included jaundice,pruritis,right upper quadrant abdominal pain,nausea,vomiting,fever and dark urine.For each patient,a total number of symptoms at baseline and at all post-treatment visits were recorded.Reduction in obstruction symptoms was defined as having a lower total number of symptoms at a post-treatment follow up visit compared to baseline.Here we report the number of subjects with a reduced total number of biliary obstructive symptoms at 1 month after stent treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Success at 3 Months After Stent Procedure as Defined by the Reduction of Biliary Obstruction Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical success was defined as the reduction of biliary obstruction symptoms after treatment with the device.Symptoms included jaundice,pruritis,right upper quadrant abdominal pain,nausea,vomiting,fever and dark urine.For each patient,a total number of symptoms at baseline and at all post-treatment visits were recorded.Reduction in obstruction symptoms was defined as having a lower total number of symptoms at a post-treatment follow up visit compared to baseline.Here we report the number of subjects with a reduced total number of biliary obstructive symptoms at 3 months after stent treatment.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bilirubin Level Reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Total bilirubin levels at 1 month follow-up were compared to initial bilirubin levels. Bilirubin level reduction was defined as total bilirubin levels being below 3mg/dl, or reduced by &gt;30% if the initial baseline value was greater than 3mg/dl.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stent Patency at 1 Month</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Per the protocol, stent patency was defined as lack of obstructive symptoms and/or a total bilirubin level of less than 3mg/dl. Patency evaluations at the Month 1 visit were done on those patients with both a total bilirubin level and assessment of biliary obstructive symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stent Patency at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Per the protocol, stent patency was defined as lack of obstructive symptoms and/or a normal total bilirubin level. Patency evaluations at Month 3 were done on those patients with an assessment of biliary obstructive symptoms (bilirubin levels were not measured at Month 3).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stent Patency at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Per the protocol, stent patency was defined as lack of obstructive symptoms and/or a normal total bilirubin level. Patency evaluations at Month 6 were done on those patients with an assessment of biliary obstructive symptoms (bilirubin levels were not measured at Month 6).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Stent Occlusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Until 6 Months or death</time_frame>
    <description>Time to stent occlusion(measured in days since stent placement) was recorded for any subjects who experienced occlusion.</description>

    <measure>Number of Device-Related Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Until 6 months or death</time_frame>
