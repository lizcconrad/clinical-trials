  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study utilizes a novel technique—expressive arts therapy—to facilitate social
      integration for youth recovering from acquired brain injury (ABI). Expressive arts therapy is
      defined as the use of the arts and artistic media to explore psychological aspects of life.
      An expressive art (also referred to as 'creative arts' or even just 'arts') encompasses
      drama, music, art (visual arts such as painting, sculpture etc) and dance/movement. It has
      great potential to improve community integration for youth recovering from ABI, through
      facilitating skills required for successful social communication and social cognition. It is
      hypothesized to improve social and emotional functioning compared to a less structured
      creative arts program. It is expected that a combination of directed group activities and
      self-reflection within a creative learning context will improve emotional awareness and
      social and community integration to a greater degree than a non-expressive creative arts
      therapy group, in youth who have suffered an ABIAs community integration enables meaningful
      and productive occupational engagement, enabling opportunities for occupational engagement
      through increased community integration would greatly enhance the quality of life of
      adolescents with ABI.

    <description>The experimental intervention was an intensive theatre skills training program. The group of adolescent participants recovering from ABI met daily for four hours over a period of 4 weeks. During this 4 hour period, regular breaks were scheduled to provide the participants with a mental and physical break from therapy. Theatre training included voice work, breathing, movement, physical warm-up, character development, script analysis, writing skills, three-dimensional awareness, group dynamics, story development, mask work and clowning among others.</description>
