  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Small pupils are not uncommon in situations requiring surgical intervention for glaucoma and
      cataract. Inadequate binocular view during combined trabeculaectomy and glaucoma surgery
      needs to be overcome by additional iris manupulations to dilate the pupils which increase the
      liklihood of inflammation, inraocular pressure rise after surgery and enhnced liklihood of
      failure of glaucoma surgery. The proposed trial is an observational study to analyse post
      operative outcome of eyes undrgoing trabeculectomy and phacoemulsification with intraocular
      lens implantation with small pupils in persons with glaucoma coexisting with cataract.
