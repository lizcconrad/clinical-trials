    <textblock>
      Regular exercise has been demonstrated to improve muscle strength, balance, coordination as
      well as improve cardiovascular fitness levels and overall quality of life in stroke
      survivors. This study is designed to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a 12-week
      intervention to education and encourage stroke survivors to exercise following discharge from
      rehabilitation settings using a walking program and targeted functional activity homework.
