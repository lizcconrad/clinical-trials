      RATIONALE: Chemotherapy may cause blood clots to form in the thigh, leg, and lung. This study
      may help doctors understand how often blood clots occur in patients undergoing chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how often blood clots occur in patients undergoing
      chemotherapy for solid tumors, including colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, lung cancer,
      ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, or metastatic breast cancer

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the incidence of venous thromboembolic events (i.e., deep vein thrombosis
           and/or pulmonary embolism) in patients undergoing chemotherapy for solid tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, multicenter survey.

      Patients undergo observation beginning on day 1 of chemotherapy and continuing for up to 3
      months in the absence of symptomatic, confirmed deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism;
      use of anticoagulant therapy for more than 5 days as curative treatment; or initiation of
      thromboprophylaxis for any reason. Patients undergo bilateral compression ultrasound of the
      lower limbs at baseline and at 3 months (or at an earlier timepoint, if indicated).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,000 patients will be accrued for this study.
