  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of febuxostat, once Daily
      (QD), to allopurinol in subjects with hyperuricemia and gout.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal impairment is common in subjects with gout, with the prevalence ranging from 50% to
      70%. This population represents an unmet medical need as uricosuric drugs are contraindicated
      in these patients, and the only available treatment, allopurinol, may have to be dose reduced
      to avoid overt side effects.

      Febuxostat (TMX-67) is a non-purine selective xanthine oxidase inhibitor being developed as
      an orally administered agent for management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout.

      Treatment duration will be 6 months.
