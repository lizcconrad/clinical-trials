      The purpose of this study was to determine whether a pediatric practice-based smoking
      prevention and cessation intervention increases abstinence rates among adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of adolescent smokers are interested in quitting and have attempted to stop with
      limited success. A recent review of cessation trials for adolescents has concluded that there
      are no proven programs to help teens stop smoking, but suggested interventions based on
      cognitive behavioral therapy and sensitive to stages of change appear promising. The American
      Academy of Pediatrics suggests that pediatricians are well-positioned to intervene with
      adolescent smokers, as well as with nonsmokers to prevent initiation. A comprehensive,
      practice-based smoking prevention and cessation intervention for adolescents delivered by
      pediatric providers and peer counselors in the context of routine care has the potential for
      assisting nonsmoking adolescents in remaining smoke-free and smoking adolescents to quit.
