      Goal:

      To define the causes and issues associated with nonadherence in our population

      Hypothesis:

      There is a difference in the rates and patterns of adherence to transplant medications versus
      other medications also taken by transplant patients

      Methods:

        1. A standardized interviewer-administered confidential survey exploring levels of
           adherence to transplant medications and other medications as well questionnaires on a
           variety of cognitive and other factors known to be associated with adherence.

        2. A brief review of demographics and pertinent laboratory information at the same
           encounter

      Objectives:

        1. To determine the prevalence of nonadherence in our population

        2. To assess possible causes of nonadherence and correlate those causes with demographic
           information and clinical findings

        3. To assess for differences between adherence with immunosuppressive regime versus
           adherence with other medications (for hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia)

      Methods:

        1. A standardized interviewer-administered confidential survey exploring levels of
           adherence to transplant medications and other medications as well questionnaires on a
           variety of cognitive and other factors known to be associated with adherence

        2. A brief review of demographics and pertinent laboratory information at the same
           encounter
