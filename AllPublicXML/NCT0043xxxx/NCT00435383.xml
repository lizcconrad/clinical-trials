      To determine the which method of pain relief is better after current anesthesia care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesized that in children, the current anesthesia care (combined light general
      anesthesia and caudal analgesia) may decrease incidence of intra and or postoperative
      de-saturation( SaO2 &lt; %95), the need of oxygen during child's transport to the PACU and
      during his stay in the recovery room, compared with children who receive intravenous
      narcotics for intra and postoperative pain relief.
