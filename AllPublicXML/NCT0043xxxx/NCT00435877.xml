      This study will determine if bone marrow stromal cells can be used as a graft for
      regeneration of bony defects. These cells have the ability to form new bone and to support
      the formation of blood. Stromal cells have been identified in other tissues, such as the
      dermis (underside of skin), spleen, thymus and fat, but it is not known whether these cells
      can make bone and support blood formation as well as bone marrow stromal cells.

      Patients undergoing surgery at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, in which some of the
      bone, dermis, spleen, thymus or fat tissue is removed may be eligible for this study.

      For this study, a small piece of the tissue that is removed during surgery for examination by
      a pathologist will be used for research. Stromal cells from the specimen will be collected
      and grown in the laboratory. The genes and proteins in the different cell types will be
      compared, and the ability of stromal cells from the different tissues to make bone and to
      support the formation of blood will be studied.

      Background: It is now apparent that virtually every human post-natal tissue contains some
      type of stem/progenitor cell population that is responsible for tissue turnover and repair.
      Our previous studies have identified a subset of human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) that
      is multi-potent and able to regenerate bone, cartilage, myelosupportive stroma and
      adipocytes, whereas stromal cells derived from human spleen (SpSCs) and thymus (TSCs) only
      form myelosupportive stroma. Recent studies suggest that human adipose-derived stromal cells
      (ASCs) may be similar to BMSCs, whereas stromal cells derived from human dermis (DSCs) have
      none of these properties (and serve as a negative control for most experiments in vitro and
      in vivo). How similar or dissimilar these different stromal cell populations are has yet to
      be determined. Molecular profiling is needed to compare these different populations and in
      order to elucidate the factors that control differentiation stromal cells into one cell type
      or another.

      Objectives: Surgical waste (bone with red marrow, dermis, spleen, thymus and adipose tissues)
      from males and females of varying ages undergoing clinically indicated surgical procedures
      will be used to establish stromal cell cultures to study the molecular profile and
      differentiation capacity of the stromal cell populations from different tissues and to
      further characterize the regulation of gene expression and protein synthesis in these
      stem/progenitor cells.

      Eligibility: Any patient who is undergoing clinically indicated surgery that entails removal
      of bone with red marrow, dermis, spleen, thymus and adipose tissue, and who do not have: 1) a
      history of metabolic bone disease, 2) any form of cancer or have been treated by chemotherapy
      or irradiation for cancer, and 3) have not received agents known to affect bone metabolism.

      Design: Normal surgical waste (bone with red marrow, dermis, spleen, thymus and adipose) from
      procedures that are performed on males and females at Suburban Hospital will be placed in
      nutrient medium (provided by NIDCR) and sent to the NIDCR for the establishment of cell
      culture strains. Only the age, gender and site from which the tissue was removed will be
      recorded. The cell cultures from the different tissues will be used to determine their
      phenotypic character and differentiation properties by molecular profiling, and for studies
      to elucidate the regulation of gene expression and protein synthesis. Similarly, a portion of
      the samples obtained at Suburban Hospital will be used to generate histological sections of
      the normal tissues that will be used to screen newly developed antibodies and molecular
      probes. In some cases, RNA will be extracted from the tissues for RT-PCR analysis. These
      samples (cells, sections, mRNA) will also serve as normal controls for studies performed on
      samples obtained from patients with various diseases recruited to NIH under current NIH
      protocols (97-D-0055, 97-D-0145, 01-D-0184).
