  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care patients are at high risk to develop deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary
      embolism. Despite anticoagulation with heparin 7% of ICU patients suffer from this serious
      complication. Optimal regimens for prevention of VTE have been established in medical
      patients only and are not known for ICU patients.

      It was therefore the aim of this study to compare the bioavailability of a low molecular
      weight heparin in ICU patients and in medical patients. Furthermore, we looked wether a 50%
      dose increase resulted in better bioavailability of this drug.

      Background: The optimal dose regimen of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) for
      thromboprophylaxis in critically ill patients is unknown.

      Objectives: We performed a prospective, randomized study to determine anti-Xa activities
      following subcutaneous administration of 5000 IU or 7500 IU dalteparin for thromboprophylaxis
      in ICU patients compared with medical patients receiving the standard dose of 5000 IU.

      Patients and Methods: Twenty-five ICU patients received 7500 IU (group 1) and 29 ICU patients
      received 5000 IU dalteparin subcutaneously (group 2) for thromboprophylaxis. Twenty-nine
      medical patients receiving 5000 IU dalteparin served as control group (group 3).
