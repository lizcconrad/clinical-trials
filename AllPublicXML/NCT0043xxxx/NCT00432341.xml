    <measure>Duration of Treatment Benefit</measure>
    <time_frame>20 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of treatment benefit was measured as the time (days) from Baseline until patients had a loss of therapeutic benefit, as defined by the achievement of their Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale Duration Target Score (TDTS) [loss of 80% of benefit].</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale Duration Target Score (TDTS) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The TDTS was the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) score representing a loss of 80% of the treatment benefit at Week 4. The TDTS is calculated from the TWSTRS score and ranges from 0 (least symptoms) to 68 (worst symptoms). The TWSTRS total score which is scored from 0 (least symptoms) to 85 (worst symptoms).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) Total Score at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The TWSTRS is an assessment scale used to measure the impact of cervical dystonia on patients. The score is comprised of 3 subscales: Severity, Disability, and Pain, each of which is scored independently. The total of these 3 comprises the TWSTRS total score which is scored from 0 (least symptoms) to 85 (worst symptoms). Higher scores indicate a greater degree of symptom severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Assessment of Benefit by Patient at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Patient evaluation of benefit from botulinum toxin type A treatment for cervical dystonia. Ratings were on a scale of +4 to -4, with higher scores denoting improvement in cervical dystonia: +4 was 'Complete abolishment of signs and symptoms (about 100% improvement)', 0 represented 'Unchanged', and -4 represented 'Very marked worsening (about 100% worse or greater)'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Global Assessment of Benefit by Physician at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Physician evaluation of benefit from botulinum toxin type A treatment for cervical dystonia. Ratings were on a scale of +4 to -4, with higher scores denoting improvement in cervical dystonia: +4 was 'Complete abolishment of signs and symptoms (about 100% improvement)', 0 represented 'Unchanged', and -4 represented 'Very marked worsening (about 100% worse or greater)'.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician Assessment of Cervical Dystonia Severity at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Physician assessment of cervical dystonia severity. The rating was assessed on a scale of 0 to 10, with higher scores denoting greater severity: 0 represented 'No evidence of dystonia' and 10 represented 'Worst cervical dystonia ever'</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician Comparison of Benefit to Previous Injections at Week 20</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Physicians assessed the improvement in cervical dystonia after the study treatment compared to previous treatment(s) for each patient. Physicians were required to answer &quot;How would you rate the benefit of the current treatment of cervical dystonia with botulinum toxin type A compared to the previous treatment using the following scale?&quot;. The response options were 'much worse', 'worse', 'somewhat worse', 'same as previous', 'somewhat better', 'better', and 'much better'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Comparison of Benefit to Previous Injections at Week 20</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Patients assessed the improvement in cervical dystonia after receiving the study treatment compared to previous treatment(s). Patients were required to answer &quot;How would you rate the benefit of the current treatment of cervical dystonia with botulinum toxin type A compared to the previous treatment using the following scale?&quot;. The response options were 'much worse', 'worse', 'somewhat worse', 'same as previous', 'somewhat better', 'better', and 'much better'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Visual Analog Assessment of Pain at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were required to assess their pain using a Visual Analog Scale in reference to their current perception of pain at that visit. This scale consisted of a line measuring 100 mm, and patients were instructed to put a mark on the line at the point that best described 'How much pain you are having right now'. Higher scores denoted higher pain intensity: 0 indicated 'No pain' and 100 indicated 'Worst possible pain'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Assessment of Need for Retreatment at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were queried regarding their need for another injection of botulinum toxin type A for cervical dystonia. Patients were required to answer &quot;How would you rate your need for another injection of botulinum toxin type A for cervical dystonia using the following scale?&quot;. The response options included 'absolutely requires injection', 'very much requires injection', 'somewhat requires injection', and 'does not require injection'.</description>

          <description>The TDTS was the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) score representing a loss of 80% of the treatment benefit at Week 4. The TDTS is calculated from the TWSTRS score and ranges from 0 (least symptoms) to 68 (worst symptoms). The TWSTRS total score which is scored from 0 (least symptoms) to 85 (worst symptoms).</description>

        <description>The TWSTRS is an assessment scale used to measure the impact of cervical dystonia on patients. The score is comprised of 3 subscales: Severity, Disability, and Pain, each of which is scored independently. The total of these 3 comprises the TWSTRS total score which is scored from 0 (least symptoms) to 85 (worst symptoms). Higher scores indicate a greater degree of symptom severity.</description>

        <description>Patients assessed the improvement in cervical dystonia after receiving the study treatment compared to previous treatment(s). Patients were required to answer &quot;How would you rate the benefit of the current treatment of cervical dystonia with botulinum toxin type A compared to the previous treatment using the following scale?&quot;. The response options were 'much worse', 'worse', 'somewhat worse', 'same as previous', 'somewhat better', 'better', and 'much better'.</description>

        <title>Patient Visual Analog Assessment of Pain at Week 4</title>
        <description>Patients were required to assess their pain using a Visual Analog Scale in reference to their current perception of pain at that visit. This scale consisted of a line measuring 100 mm, and patients were instructed to put a mark on the line at the point that best described 'How much pain you are having right now'. Higher scores denoted higher pain intensity: 0 indicated 'No pain' and 100 indicated 'Worst possible pain'.</description>
