  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyze whether the sympathetic tone, measured indirectly and
      directly by muscle sympathetic nerve activity recording, is elevated in patients with heart
      failure receiving an appropriate shock from their implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD)
      compared to heart failure patients not receiving a shock from their ICD. All parameters
      measured in this study will be used to build a risk algorithm able to identify heart failure
      patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death who could receive an ICD.

      We plan to perform an extensive study of the sympathetic nervous system activity in heart
      failure patients with an ICD. The SNS activity will be measured directly by a recording of
      the muscle sympathetic nerve activity and indirectly by post processing of 24-hour Holter
      recording, catecholamine levels assessment, and spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity. A global
      assessment of the patients status will also be realised. Patients will be followed for one
      year. During follow up, this cohort will be divided into two groups according to the
      occurrence or not of an appropriate shock. We assume that an appropriate shock is a surrogate
      marker for sudden cardiac death. We plan to compare the autonomic nervous system activity in
      both groups of patients in order to identify a score able to detect heart failure patients at
      high risk for sudden cardiac death.
