      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of oral dronabinol tetrahydrocannabinol
      (THC) on withdrawal symptoms in marijuana dependent volunteers, and evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and cardiovascular effects of the combination of oral dronabinol and
      smoked marijuana to determine if there are potential significant interactions before
      conducting outpatient studies.
