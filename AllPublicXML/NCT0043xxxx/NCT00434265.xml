  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is the consequence of a chronic disequilibrium of fat balance. Genetic factors
      determine predisposition to obesity, but the most often mentioned idea is that environmental
      factors, such as a high-fat diet and a sedentary lifestyle, join to favour weight gain and
      explain the increased prevalence of obesity in our westernized societies. Since lipogenesis
      is negligible in humans, obesity represents the consequence of altered fat partitioning
      between oxidation and storage, likely due to a preferential directing of dietary fat towards
      adipose tissue and away from muscle. Interventions that favour partitioning of dietary fat
      towards muscle for oxidation might thus protect against weight gain. Exercise may be one kind
      of such intervention but the scant data on dietary fat metabolism does not allow clear
      conclusions, in particular in obese subjects. One question concerns the impact of the type of
      fat eaten: the effects of physical inactivity may vary according to the length and saturation
      degree of the fatty acids. We hypothesize that 1) physical activity of moderate intensity,
      independently of its effect on energy balance, will favor a preferential trafficking towards
      adipose tissue, will modify the expression of genes implicated in fat oxidation and storage
      and partly correct the abnormalities observed in obese subjects, 2) effects of physical
      activity vary according to the saturation degree of fat. Twelve obese subjects, aged 18 to
      55, will undergo tests before and after 2 months of training at current recommendations to
      ascertain dietary fat partitioning using stable isotopes and to determine changes in gene
      expression with muscle and adipose tissue microbiopsies.
