  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK has constructed a new HIV immunogen comprised of conserved parts of the HIV virus (gag,
      pol and nef). The principal objectives of this study are to evaluate the reactogenicity and
      safety of this candidate vaccine with or without a GSK proprietary adjuvant system at three
      different doses and to evaluate the CD4+ T-cell response in terms of proportion of responders
      to the antigens two weeks after the second vaccination.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, observer-blind, randomized, dose-escalating, staggered study with 6
      groups: 3 groups of 50 subjects receiving the adjuvanted candidate vaccine, at 3 different
      doses and 3 groups of 10 subjects receiving the non-adjuvanted candidate vaccine in water for
      injection, at 3 different doses. The vaccination schedule will be 0-1 month. Blood samples
      will be collected at 8 visits. The duration of the study will be approximately 14 months for
      each subject. Rationale for Protocol Posting Amendment: The third vaccination will be
      cancelled and the visit at Month 7 will be postponed to Month 9. The Protocol Posting has
      also been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

The frequency of antigen specific CD4+ T-cells was calculated as the difference between the frequency of CD4+ T-cells producing at least 2 cytokines (among IFN-g, IL-2, TNF-a and/or CD40L), upon in vitro stimulation with the peptide pools derived from the antigen minus the frequency of CD4+ T-cells producing at least 2 cytokines upon in vitro stimulation in medium only.</description>

Frequency of CD4+ T-cells expressing markers in response to the F4co fusion protein (all antigens) was estimated by adding individual frequencies of CD4+ T-cells to each of the 4 antigens (p17, p24, Nef, RT).
