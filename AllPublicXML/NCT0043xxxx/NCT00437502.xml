  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of administering a peptide vaccine consisting of twelve
      different tumor-rejection antigens known to be present on ovarian tumor cells. The vaccine is
      designed to elicit immune responses against twelve different pathways that are essential to
      tumor growth, survival and metastasis.HLA-A2+ is a required criteria for subject eligibility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint will be to determine the safety and feasibility of administering ovarian
      cancer peptides to women who have undergone debulking surgery and systemic chemotherapy, with
      the secondary objectives of evaluating immune response as measured by ELISPOT to the
      immunizations, to compare the immune response as measured by ELISPOT achieved by the two
      different dosing strategies and to assess disease relapse survival. Two cohorts of 9 patients
      each will be treated with different doses of the OCPM vaccine. They will receive the peptide
      vaccine subcutaneously on weeks 0,1,2,3,5 and6 and then receive the immunizations every 1
      month for 6 months or disease recurrence. The first 9 patients will be entered into the first
      cohort; if 1 or fewer patients experience Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) then the next 9 will
      be enrolled into the second cohort. DLT is defined as any Grade 3 or greater hematologic or
      non-hematologic toxicity or autoimmune disease (except for fever, skin reaction, or alopecia
      which would be grade 4) occurring at any time from the first immunization until 30 days after
      the last immunization. Toxicity will be assessed at each dose level using CTC toxicity
      criteria. Ovarian cancer peptide-specific immune response will be measured by ELISpot. Time
      to disease relapse will be based on composite assessment of clinical signs, objective exam
      findings, radiologic imaging, and CA125 results. A dosing scheme will be considered safe if
      &lt;1 of the first 9 subjects treated at a dose level experience DLT (as described above). A
      subject will be considered evaluable for safety if treated with at least one immunization. A
      T cell response will be considered positive by ELISpot if: the mean number of spots in six
      wells with antigen exceeds the number of spots in six control wells by 10 and the difference
      between single values of the six wells containing antigen and the six control wells is
      statistically significant at a level of p â‰¤ 0.05 using Student's t test.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Must be HLA-A2+ patients with histologically confirmed, stage III-IV epithelial ovarian,
        tubal, or peritoneal cancer who have undergone optimal debulking and had a complete
        clinical response to front-line platin/taxane based chemotherapy.

          -  Subjects must have received front-line platin compound and taxane chemotherapy
             following primary surgical resection. Front-line treatment can include up to 12 cycles
             of treatment.Subjects must receive the first dose of study medication at least 4 weeks
             and up to 6 months since completing their last dose of front-line chemotherapy.A
             complete clinical response defined as: no evidence of disease on physical exam,CT
             imaging scans of the abdomen and pelvis, chest x-ray and a CA-125 below the upper
             limit of normal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of autoimmune disease, serious intercurrent chronic or acute illness, active
             hepatitis, serologic evidence for HIV, splenectomy, or be receiving steroid or
             immunosuppressive therapy.
