      This is a research study of an investigational product called Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).
      The study is designed to establish the safety and potential benefit of MMF. MMF has proven
      one of the most effective medications to date for SLE and associated nephritis. It also
      appears to be active in polymyositis and dermatomyositis. This medication inhibits inosine
      monophosphate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in synthesis of guanosine nucleotides.
      It blocks the type II isoform found in activated lymphocytes more potently than the type I
      isoform inhibiting both T- and B-lymphocytes. In SSc, MMF has been tried after anti-thymocyte
      globulin in one small open label study with efficacy with a significant improvement in skin
      score. We will test the safety and efficacy of MMF in SSc. All study patients will receive
      the study medication. The effect of the study medication will be examined in two subgroups of
      patients: those with early or progressive skin disease (skin substudy) and those with muscle
      disease (muscle substudy). The change in modified Rodnan skin score (MRSS) and creatinine
      phosphokinase (CK) for, respectively, the skin and muscle substudies at 6 months after
      treatment will be compared to baseline values.

    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune/connective tissue disease with complex pathogenesis
      involving immune system dysregulation, leading to fibrosis. Inflammatory and autoimmune
      aspects of this disease overlap systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a disease shown clearly
      to respond to MMF. Activated T-cells, the probable target of MMF in SLE, likely also play an
      important role in SSc pathogenesis. Evidence for this includes the similarity of SSc skin
      disease to chronic graft versus host disease, a disease in which T-cells play a critical
      role. MMF has proven one of the most effective medications to date for SLE and associated
      nephritis [1]. It also appears to be active in polymyositis and dermatomyositis, disease that
      also show significant overlap with SSc [2]. Myositis can also be a feature of SSc, suggesting
      that his disease manifestation might be particularly likely to respond to MMF. MMF inhibits
      inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in synthesis of guanosine
      nucleotides. It blocks the type II isoform found in activated lymphocytes more potently than
      the type I isoform inhibiting both T- and B-lymphocytes [3]. In SSc, mycophenolate has been
      tried after anti-thymocyte globulin in one small open label study with efficacy with a
      significant improvement in skin score [4]. However, MMF has not been tried alone inSSc and
      has not been tried in muscle disease associated with SSc. In this study, we will test the
      safety and efficacy of MMF in SSc. In this study all study patients will receive the
      medication.
