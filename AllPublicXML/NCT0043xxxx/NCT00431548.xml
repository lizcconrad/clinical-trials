  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ocular lesions, including cotton wool spots and retinal hemorrhage, are a common feature of
      HIV infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The aetiology of these
      apparently vasoocclusive phenomena in HIV related retinopathy is not well understood. Several
      hypotheses including infectious damage of the retinal vasculature and altered retinal
      hemodynamics have been postulated. The latter would be compatible with the theory that the
      retina of HIV patients is hypoxic. However, direct measurement of oxygen tension in the
      retina is not possible and indirect methods have to be employed. The study objective was to
      investigate the reactivity in retinal blood flow to 100% oxygen breathing in patients with
      HIV.
