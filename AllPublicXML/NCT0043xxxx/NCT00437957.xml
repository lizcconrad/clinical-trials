      This type of study is called a &quot;Phase I study&quot;. Its purpose is to determine the side effects
      of the two medicines listed in this study when given together with whole brain radiation, and
      the highest dose of valproic acid that can be given together with temozolomide and whole
      brain radiation. We will also study the drug combination's effectiveness in treating cancer.
      While both of these drugs and whole brain radiation have been used in people for many years,
      they have never been combined for the purpose of treating patients with cancer.

      At the start of the study, patients will be informed which dose level they will be treated
      with. On day 1, patients will have a physical exam and several blood draws including draws to
      measure the level of valproic acid in their body. Patients will start your whole brain
      radiation and also at the same time start the valproic acid and temozolomide pills. Patients
      will be asked to take the valproic acid pills every 12 hours and the temozolomide pills once
      daily. Patients will not need to come to the center for that but will need to come to the
      center to receive you whole brain radiation for 3 weeks (on weekdays, excluding holidays).
      Radiation therapy will not be administered on weekends but patients will still take their
      pills for the whole 3 weeks from starting the radiation.

      Patients will have to come back for a study visit weekly for the 6 months. Two more visits
      are also required: approximately 6 weeks and 10 weeks from starting the treatment. Patients
      will be asked about any old or new symptoms to determine if adjustment in the pill dose is
      required.

      Every study visit except the last one will include blood draws. These will evaluate blood
      counts, blood chemistry and also measure the level of valproic acid in your body. The Mini
      Mental Status examination described above will be repeated in every visit.
