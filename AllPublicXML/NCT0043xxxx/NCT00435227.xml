  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  The purpose of this study is to describe the effect of a single (IM) dose of motavizumab
           in the upper respiratory tract in children who present with RSV illness but who do not
           require hospitalization at the time of presentation and

        -  Describe the effect of a single 30 mg/kg IM dose of motavizumab in decreasing the need
           for hospitalization due to worsening RSV illness in children who receive outpatient
           treatment

        -  Describe the effect of a single 30 mg/kg IM dose of motavizumab on subsequent
           respiratory status as measured by the Respiratory Assessment Change Score (RACS) and
           change in oxygen saturation

        -  For children who require hospitalization, describe the effect of motavizumab on severity
           of RSV illness during hospitalization [i.e., RACS, oxygen saturation, heart rate, use of
           supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, and duration of intensive care unit (ICU)
           stay]

        -  Describe the effect of a single 30 mg/kg IM dose of motavizumab on duration of symptoms
           of RSV illness (fever, coryza, cough, and parental opinion of return to normal health
           and activity)

        -  Describe the nasal concentration of motavizumab following a single 30mg/kg dose

        -  Describe the serum pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of a single 30 mg/kg IM dose of
           motavizumab

        -  Describe the effect of motavizumab on markers of inflammation as measured by gene
           microarray and cytokine levels

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single 30 mg/kg IM dose of motavizumab in the
           outpatient treatment of children with RSV

        -  Describe the progression and severity of lower respiratory infection (LRI)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to
      determine the effect of a single 30 mg/kg IM dose of motavizumab on viral load and
      motavizumab levels in the upper respiratory tract of children who present with RSV illness
      but who do not require hospitalization. Using 1:1 randomization, 30 mg/kg motavizumab or
      placebo will be administered as soon as possible after a child's diagnosis of RSV and his/her
      eligibility for the study has been confirmed.
