      EFFICACY OF NEOADJUVANT ENDOCRINE THERAPY WITH ANASTROZOLE IN POMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH
      ER-POSITIVE BREAST CANCER.

      Flavia Morales-Vásquez, Horacio Noé López Basave.

      Background: Neoadjuvant Hormonal Therapy (HT) is being used increasingly to downstage locally
      advanced and large operable breast cancer. Following this treatment, inoperable breast cancer
      often becomes fully respectable and tumors requiring mastectomy may be successfully removed
      by breast-conserving surgery (BCS).

      Methods: Recruit postmenopausal women with ER(+) and/or PgR (+) breast cancer (BC) T2,N1-2 to
      T3,N0-1 were assigned to HT with anastrozole 1 mgr daily for 4 months.

      The primary endpoint was to compare overall objective response (OR) determined by clinical
      (palpation) and ultrasound. Secondary endpoint was the number of patients who qualified for
      BCS plus radiotherapy.
