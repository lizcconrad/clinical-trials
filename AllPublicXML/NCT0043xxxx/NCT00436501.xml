  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of VEGF Trap when given
      together with docetaxel and to see how well they work in treating patients with persistent or
      recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.
      VEGF Trap may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving VEGF Trap together with
      docetaxel may kill more tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of VEGF Trap and docetaxel in patients with
      persistent or recurrent ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.
      (Phase I [closed to accrual as of 3/14/2008]) II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of
      VEGF Trap in these patients. (Phase I [closed to accrual as of 3/14/2008]) III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of VEGF Trap when administered alone and in combination with docetaxel in
      these patients. (Phase I [closed to accrual as of 3/14/2008]) IV. Determine the effects of
      VEGF Trap on tumor perfusion and metabolism in these patients. (Phase I [closed to accrual as
      of 3/14/2008]) V. Determine the effect of VEGF Trap and docetaxel on circulating endothelial
      precursors and circulating endothelial cells in these patients. (Phase I [closed to accrual
      as of 3/14/2008]) VI. Determine the frequency of clinical response (partial response and
      complete response) in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II [open to accrual as of
      5/9/2008]) VII. Determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of
      patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II [open to accrual as of 5/9/2008])

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the duration of PFS and OS of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II) II.
      Determine the frequency and severity of adverse effects of this regimen in these patients.
      (Phase II) III. Determine the proportion of patients with PFS at 6 months. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of VEGF Trap followed by a
      phase II study.

      PHASE I (closed to accrual as of 3/14/2008): Patients receive VEGF Trap IV over 1 hour on day
      1 of course 1. Patients then receive VEGF Trap IV over 1 hour and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on
      day 1 in all subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of VEGF Trap until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      or 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PHASE II (opened to accrual as of 5/9/2008): Patients receive VEGF Trap at the MTD determined
      in phase I and docetaxel as in phase I. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients enrolled in phase I (closed to accrual as of 3/14/2008) undergo blood sample
      collection periodically for pharmacokinetic studies and surrogate marker studies. These
      patients also undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission
      tomography, and CT scan at baseline and on day 1 of courses 1 and 2 to evaluate blood flow
      parameters and metabolic activity of tumors. Patients enrolled in phase I (closed to accrual
      as of 3/14/2008) and phase II will also undergo blood collection for Anti-VEGF trap antibody.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 and 2 months and then
      periodically thereafter.

    <description>Escalating dose levels of VEGF Trap were administered intravenously over three dose levels (2, 4, or 6 mg/kg; one dose every 21 days) to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The MTD is defined as the highest dose level below which 2 or more patients encounter a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. MTD established on absence of observed DLT(s) in either cycle 0 (single agent) or cycle 1 (combination therapy) of any given dose level.</description>
