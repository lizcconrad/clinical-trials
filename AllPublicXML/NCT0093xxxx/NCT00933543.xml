    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to study the efficacy and safety of Visonac PDT in patients from
      9 to 35 years old with Aktilite® CL512. Patients was randomized to Visonac or vehicle cream
      without occlusion and red light(dose: 37J/cm2)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Double blinded, prospective, randomized, stratified, placebo-controlled, multi-center study
      in patients with moderate to severe acne vulgaris. Patients with facial severity grades 3 to
      4 on the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scale will be included. Each patient will be
      classified according to age in the two age groups 9 to 12 years and 13 to 35 years and
      randomized to either Visonac or vehicle cream within each age group. All patients will
      receive 4 treatments 2 weeks apart (at week 0, 2 ,4 and 6 week). Efficacy evaluation will be
      done after each treatment and at 12 weeks after the first treatment. Safety evaluations will
      be performed at each treatment visit and at 12 weeks after the first treatment.

      Photographs of patients will be taken before and after treatment at first and last treatment
      visit, and at 12 weeks after first treatment.

      Blood samples will be drawn at 3 visits; pre-treatment visit, one week after first treatment
      and at one week after last treatment visit.
