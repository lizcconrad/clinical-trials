  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In January of 2007, the World Health Organization's (WHO) World Alliance for Patient Safety
      initiated a project called &quot;Safe Surgery Saves Lives&quot; to identify minimum standards of
      surgical care that can be universally applied across countries and settings. Through a two
      year process involving international input from surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses,
      infectious disease specialists, epidemiologists and others, the WHO created a surgical safety
      checklist that encompasses a simple set of surgical safety standards that can be used in any
      surgical setting. Each safety step on the checklist is simple, widely applicable, and
      measurable. The Surgical Safety Checklist was piloted in 8 hospitals around the world and
      results demonstrated a significant decrease in death rate and postoperative complications.

      This study proposes to introduce an adaptation of the Surgical Safety Checklist for an
      ambulatory care surgical program and to assess the efficacy of its adaptation and
      implementation on staff safety attitudes and patient outcomes. Specific ambulatory-based
      items will be included in the checklist and patient outcomes will be assessed using the
      Institute for Health Improvement's Perioperative Surgical Outcomes Tool which will also be
      adapted for use for the ambulatory setting as well as routine follow up phone calls with
      patients on the 1st postoperative day.
