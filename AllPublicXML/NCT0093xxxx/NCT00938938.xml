      The purpose of this study is to test the effect of adding a &quot;press guide&quot; to standard
      materials that journalists routinely receive regarding research published in medical
      journals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The news media has a powerful influence on public perceptions about health and health care;
      and much of what people -- including many physicians -- know and believe about medicine comes
      from the print and broadcast media. Several studies, however, have raised questions about how
      well the press covers medical issues, pointing out errors and omissions in coverage and
      misleading presentations of statistics. The goal is to help train journalists to better
      understand and cover medical research, and to help improve communication between journalists
      and medical journals.

      Journalists traditionally write newspaper articles about medical research using information
      from press releases and the medical journal article's abstract or full text. The objective is
      to test whether the addition of a 'press guide' (a one-page summary of the study findings) in
      addition to these other materials improves comprehension of facts about the study article and
      the overall judgment of the newsworthiness of the study.
