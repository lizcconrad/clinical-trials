    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to assess the response rate of LBH589 in patients with
      relapsed or refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia. LBH589 is a newly discovered compound
      that has killed Waldenstrom cells in laboratory studies, however, it is not known if LBH589
      will show the same activity in people with Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia. This drug has
      been used in research for the treatment of other types of cancer, such as multiple myeloma.

      -  Each cycle lasts 4 weeks (28 days). Participants will take LBH589 orally once a day on
           Monday, Wednesday and Friday of each week.

        -  While participants are receiving LBH589, and before the start of each study cycle, they
           will come to the clinic for the following tests and procedures: physical examination,
           blood work and EKG.

        -  Participants may continue to receive LBH589 for as long as the study doctor determines
           that they are benefiting.
