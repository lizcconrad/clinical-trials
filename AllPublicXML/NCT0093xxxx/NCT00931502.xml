      This is a multicenter registry that examines treatment strategies and outcomes in patients
      who present with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to stent thrombosis in the coronary
      arteries. This study will take place at potentially 8 medical centers throughout the State of
      California. A total of 800 patients will be enrolled into the registry, 100 patients from
      each of the eight participating California medical centers. UC Davis will serve as the core
      lab for this study.

      Eligible subjects, patients who present to the hospital (medical center) with ACS due to
      stent thrombosis and receive a cardiac catheterization to treat the stent thrombosis, will be
      included in the retrospective analysis of this cardiac condition. Subjects who expire in
      hospital due to ACS with stent thrombosis will also be included in the retrospective analysis
      of this clinical registry. Patients, who consent for approval, will become eligible to
      participate in the 3-year prospective follow-up phase of the clinical registry. These
      patients will be followed for three years to learn more about long term clinical outcomes for
      this disease state.

      There are no specific/special procedures required for this clinical registry. This is a
      registry for data collection only to correlate prescribed medical care with individual short-
      and long-term clinical outcomes.
