  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In case of lack of compliance in HIV1 patients, the investigators hope to prove that
      enfuvirtide injection during almost 3 months, with nurse help at home and therapeutic
      education may contribute to obtain a good compliance more than 95% in these patients.
