  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm study evaluating a multi-peptide (tumor-associated
      antigens)/Montanide vaccine in patients &lt; 21 years of age with recurrent or refractory CNS
      tumors. The study primarily evaluates the safety of this regimen. Secondarily, immunogenicity
      and anti-tumor effects will be assessed.

      The primary aim is to evaluate the safety of subcutaneous injections of tumor associated
      antigens (TAA) mixed with Montanide ISA-51VG in patients with recurrent or refractory brain
      tumors.

      The secondary aims are to evaluate cellular immune responses induced in patients after
      subcutaneous injection of TAA mixed with Montanide ISA-51VG and to document tumor response in
      patients with measurable disease or time to progression in patients without measurable
      disease following subcutaneous injection of TAA mixed with Montanide ISA-51VG.

    <description>Montanide is an oil-based immunoadjuvant similar to Incomplete FreundÂ´s Adjuvant, which is commonly used in combination with peptide vaccines. Although its precise mode of action is not known, it acts to enhance the immune response to vaccination. It has a depot effect that depending on the type of emulsion will release the antigen slowly from the injection site.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Patients with primary central nervous system tumors recurrent or refractory to
             standard therapy. Patients with recurrent tumors other than refractory anaplastic
             astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiforme or medulloblastoma must have failed all available
             second line therapies considered to be standard of care prior to inclusion in this
             study.

          2. Patients with tumor histologies which have previously been shown to express at least
             one of the tumor associated antigens (TRP2, gp100, EphA2 or Her2) are eligible.
             Patients whose tumors are shown to express at least one of these antigens are also
             eligible.

          3. Patients must be HLA A*0201 positive.

          4. Age &lt; 21 years

          5. Patients must weigh &gt; 15kg due to the amount of blood required for immune function
             studies.

          6. Lansky performance status or Karnofsky performance status &gt; 50. Patients who are
             unable to walk because of paralysis but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered
             ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score.

          7. Adequate organ function:

             Hematologic: WBC &gt; 1000/mm3 Absolute lymphocyte count &gt; 500 Hemoglobin &gt; 9 gm/dl (may
             be transfused to achieve adequate hemoglobin level) Platelet count &gt; 50,000/mm3 INR
             and PTT &lt; 1.5 x the upper limit of normal

             Hepatic: AST/ALT &lt; 2 x the upper limit of institutional normal Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x
             the upper limit of institutional normal

             Renal: Serum creatinine &lt; upper limit of normal for the patient's age

          8. Life expectancy &gt; 3 months

          9. Patients must have fully recovered from previous surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy
             and biologic therapy. No chemotherapy, radiation therapy or immunotherapy within 4
             weeks prior to the first dose of study agent (6 weeks for nitrosureas)

         10. Measurable disease is not required.

         11. Informed consent must be signed by the patient or legal representative.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Serious illness, eg, uncontrolled infections requiring antibiotics.

          2. History of immunodeficiency disease (such as HIV) or autoimmune disease except
             vitiligo.

          3. Concomitant treatment with systemic corticosteroids greater than physiologic doses.
             Topical (but not at the proposed vaccination site) or inhalational steroids are
             permitted.

          4. Participation in any other clinical trial involving another investigational agent
             within 4 weeks prior the first dose of study agent.

          5. Pregnant or lactating women are not permitted.

          6. Women of child-bearing potential not using medically acceptable means of
