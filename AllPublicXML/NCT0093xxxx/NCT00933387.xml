  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical resection followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy is considered as the standard of
      care for locally advanced OSCC (LAOSCC). Although the treatment could provide prompt local
      control, but it is also associated with high incidence of distant failure. Systemic
      chemotherapy given either before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) definitive local treatment
      has been extensively evaluated to improve the clinical outcome in LAOSCC. Regimens of
      taxane/cisplatin-based combinations have been shown to improve the treatment outcome of
      patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in neoadjuvant
      setting. Recently, cetuximab (Erbitux®), a monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR), has also been proven to be an efficient agent for advanced and/or
      refractory HNSCC with acceptable toxicity profiles. In current study, we shall evaluate the
      feasibility, efficacy and safety of a triplet bio-chemotherapy consisting of cetuximab,
      paclitaxel, and cisplatin followed by cetuximab-based concurrent bio-radiotherapy (CBRT) in
      patients with LAOSCC.

      Patients with high-risk, locally advanced (TxN2b~3 or T4N0~3, M0) OSCC will be eligible. To
      detect an interested objective response rate (p1) of 80% versus a non-interested response
      (p0) rate of 60%, with an α and 1-β of 0.05 and 0.2, respectively (two-sided test), including
      the estimated dropout rate of 10%, a total of 47 patients will be recruited.
