  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high proportion of complete and good responders with modern chemoradiation and the
      improvement in magnetic resonance (MR)-imaging techniques have stimulated a renewed interest
      to the question whether in patients with complete or good response the overall benefits of a
      'wait-and-see policy' or transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) combined with intensive
      follow-up may outweigh the benefits associated with conventional surgery (total mesorectal
      excision (TME)or abdominoperineal resection (APR)). On the one hand, less invasive strategies
      will expose subjects to more diagnostic procedures and possibly a slightly higher risk of
      local failure and the need for salvage surgery. On the other hand, mortality and morbidity
      associated with radical surgery (e.g. anastomotic leakage, relaparotomy, wound and pelvic
      infection, chronic wound healing disturbances, abscess, colostomy, faecal or urinary
      incontinence and sexual dysfunction) can be avoided. The investigators believe that
      wait-and-see policy for complete responders and TEM for good responders after chemoradiation
      is a feasible alternative to standard surgery, provided these patients are intensively
      followed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years or older

          -  Patients with primary rectal cancer without distant metastases who underwent CRT and
             show clinical complete response or very good response: Clinical complete response
             (ycT0N0) or very good response (ycT1-2N0) after pre-operative chemoradiation will be
             determined clinically (digital rectal examination, endoscopy), radiologically
             (contrast-enhanced-MRI) and pathologically (biopsy)

          -  Informed consent and capability of giving informed consent

          -  Comprehension of the alternative strategies and the concept of unknown risks are clear
             to the patient (in other words that the patient understands the experimental base of
             the study).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Recurrent rectal cancer.

          -  Distant metastasis.

          -  Unable or unwilling to comply to the intensive follow-up schedule.

          -  Contra-indications for MRI. If MRI is not possible because of contra-indications (e.g.
             pacemaker) we will exclude patients. MRI is crucial for response evaluation and
             follow-up and can not be omitted in patients that follow the alternative strategies
             ('wait-and-see policy' or TEM).
