    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization until progressive disease (PD) or initiation of antitumor therapy in the absence of PD or death, assessed every 6 weeks (up to 112 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS: Time in months from randomization to first documentation of objective disease progression as determined by independent radiology review or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. PFS was calculated as (first event date minus the date of randomization plus 1) divided by 30.4. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), as at least a 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization until PD or initiation of antitumor therapy in the absence of PD or death, assessed every 6 weeks (up to 112 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with objective response based on assessment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1. CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level, all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 millimeter [mm] short axis). PR: at least 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. Objective response is based on independent radiology review.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Disease Control at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control: participants with CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST v1.1. CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level, all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis). PR: at least 30 % decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. PD: at least a 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions.

Duration of tumor response was calculated as (the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause minus the date of the first CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed plus 1) divided by 7.02. DR was calculated for the subgroup of participants with a confirmed objective tumor response.</description>
          <population>FAS included all participants who were randomized to study treatment. Here 'N' (number of participant analyzed) signifies participants with objective tumor response.</population>

        <title>Time to Tumor Response (TTR)</title>
        <description>Time from date of randomization to first documentation of objective tumor response. TTR was calculated for the subgroup of participants with objective tumor response. Objective tumor response was defined as CR or PR according to RECIST v1.1. CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level, all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis). PR: at least 30 % decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.</description>
        <time_frame>Randomization until PD or initiation of antitumor therapy in the absence of PD or death, assessed every 6 weeks (up to 112 weeks)</time_frame>
