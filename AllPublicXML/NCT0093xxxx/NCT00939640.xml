  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved systolic function (HF-PSF, or 'diastolic heart failure')
      accounts for half of hospitalizations for heart failure in patients over the age of 65. Most
      HF-PSF patients have systemic hypertension (HTN), and characteristic HTN-induced
      cardiovascular changes contribute to HF-PSF. However, it is unclear why most patients with
      HTN never develop HF-PSF or which specific aspects of HTN predispose to HF-PSF.

      In the Dahl S rat, the primary animal model of HF-PSF, high dietary sodium intake suppresses
      the systemic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, but upregulates renal and cardiac
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by inducing oxidative stress. In humans, the magnitude
      of blood pressure response to sodium ingestion and depletion can categorize subjects as
      &quot;salt-resistant&quot; and &quot;salt-sensitive.&quot; Human salt sensitivity is associated with structural
      and loading conditions that increase the risk for HF-PSF, including HTN, ventricular
      hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, arterial stiffening, and increased plasma volume. High
      dietary sodium intake induces oxidative stress in salt-sensitive humans. In humans with HTN
      and normal ventricular systolic function that do not have heart failure, increased oxidative
      stress predicts impaired exercise capacity, ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction,
      arterial stiffening, and vascular endothelial dysfunction. The investigators have proposed
      that &quot;salt sensitivity&quot; and the accompanying oxidative stress on the typical high-sodium
      Western diet may contribute to the initiation and progression of HF-PSF.

      In patients with HF-PSF, the investigators will relate dietary changes to biochemical and
      cardiovascular functional measures. The investigators will study subjects on ad-lib diet and
      and following three weeks of rigorous dietary modification with the Dietary Approaches to
      Stop Hypertension (DASH)/sodium-restricted diet (SRD). This diet is richer in natural
      antioxidants and lower in sodium than the usual American diet. The DASH/SRD is recommended to
      lower blood pressure in patients with HTN, and is particularly effective in elderly, obese,
      and salt-sensitive hypertensives. Dietary sodium restriction is recommended for all HF
      patients including those with HF-PSF. The investigators hypothesize that the DASH/SRD will
      have favorable effects on oxidative stress, ventricular and vascular function, and blood
      pressure control in patients with hypertensive HF-PSF.

    <description>Diet patterned after the intervention in the DASH-Sodium trial (Sacks FM et al. New Engl J Med 2001;344(1):3-10). The diet includes higher quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grain products, and low-fat dairy products than the standard American diet. The target sodium content is 50 mmol per 2100 kcal, and the caloric content is intended to maintain body weight. The diet is designed, prepared, and packaged by research dietitians and all food and beverages are provided for study participants.</description>

    <description>Baseline diet will be assessed via Block Food Frequency Questionnaire, and 24-hour urinary sodium, potassium, and 8-isoprostanes will be measured. Subjects will then be assigned to 21 days of the DASH/SRD, with all food and beverages provided. Adherence will be assessed through a three-day food diary at the midpoint of the intervention, and at the end of the study urinary sodium, potassium, and 8-isoprostanes will again be measured.</description>
