  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single site, Phase I, masked, randomized study to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of twice daily dosing of LGG (Lactobacillus GG ATCC 53103) in normal healthy
      adult volunteers. Study drug capsules (1x10^10 LGG/capsule or placebo) will be taken by mouth
      twice a day with cow's milk or soy milk on an outpatient basis. Volunteers will have study
      visits at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 7 months, and 12 months where they will be
      asked about any medical problems that have come up since the last study visit, have vital
      signs taken, review current medication use, and review any signs of potential adverse events.
      Blood and urine samples will also be collected at these visits, as well as throat and stool
      samples.

      Our goal is to assess the safety and tolerability of LGG when administered to healthy adult
      volunteers twice a day. Assessment of safety will be determined by vital sign measurements,
      physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, and from the incidence and severity of
      adverse events that occur during study participation. Additionally, we will assess whether
      LGG colonizes the throat and/or gastrointestinal tract of healthy adult volunteers and assess
      the effect of LGG on the bacteria that normally live in the throat and GI tract by using
      culture-independent techniques. Volunteers enrolled in this study will also be invited to
      participate in a companion genetic study that will investigate the host immune response to
      the bacteria in LGG.
