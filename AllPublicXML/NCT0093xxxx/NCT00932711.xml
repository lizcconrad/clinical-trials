  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if educational intervention is effective in
      reducing exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in patients with low-risk
      disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence about the effectiveness of case management in preventing adverse
      events in patients with high-risk chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD). But the
      majority of COPD patients belong to the low-risk category. We propose that a less intense
      educational intervention will have a similar beneficial effect in reducing hospital
      admissions and emergency department (ED) visits in this larger group of low-risk COPD
      patients.
