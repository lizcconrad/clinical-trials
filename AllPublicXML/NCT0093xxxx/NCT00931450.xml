      RATIONALE: Sunitinib malate and exemestane may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving sunitinib malate and exemestane before
      surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be
      removed.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of
      sunitinib malate to see how well it works when given together with exemestane in treating
      postmenopausal women with breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safe dose level of sunitinib malate that can be combined with exemestane
           (pilot phase I).

        -  Evaluate the clinical response of neoadjuvant therapy comprising exemestane and
           sunitinib malate in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive and HER-2
           negative primary breast cancer (phase II).

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the safety and feasibility of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the percentage of patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery after
           completion of study therapy.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the rate of complete pathological response in the breast and axillary lymph
           nodes at the time of surgery.

        -  Determine the extent of treatment-related inhibition of phosphorylation of VEGFR-2,
           PDGF, and c-KIT receptor tyrosine kinases.

        -  Find a genetic profile, based on the analysis of CYP19A1 polymorphisms, able to predict
           response to exemestane in neoadjuvant setting.

        -  Conduct exploratory investigation of biomarkers expression before and during therapy in
           order to identify molecular characteristics of responding tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of sunitinib malate followed by a phase
      II study.

        -  Phase I pilot: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate and oral exemestane once daily on
           days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups:

             -  Group 1: Patients receive oral exemestane and oral placebo once daily on days 1-28.
                Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
                or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Group 2: Patients receive oral exemestane once daily and oral sunitinib malate once
                daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of
                disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      At 7-15 days after completion of study therapy, patients undergo definitive surgery.

      Blood and tissue samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study to examine
      inhibition of phosphorylation of VEGFR-2, PDGF, and c-KIT receptor tyrosine kinases; CYP19A1
      polymorphisms; and biomarkers analysis by cDNA microarrays, ELISA, and RT-PCR.
