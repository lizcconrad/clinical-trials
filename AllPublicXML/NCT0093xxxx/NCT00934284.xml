  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if participation in physical therapy in conjunction
      with a selective nerve root block in the lumbar spine is more effective than just receiving
      the injection alone for patients with low back and leg pain from a disk herniation
      (sciatica).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent reviews report moderate to strong evidence for short-term relief but limited evidence
      for long-term improvement. Anecdotal reports and case studies suggest good outcomes with
      various physical therapy interventions however well-designed research studies examining
      treatments in combination are lacking. The management of lumbar radicular pain often includes
      the combination of physical therapy and therapeutic selective nerve root blocks with the
      rationale that reducing inflammation and pain will permit greater participation in physical
      therapy. The effectiveness of this combination of treatment has not been studied and is the
      purpose of this pilot study.
