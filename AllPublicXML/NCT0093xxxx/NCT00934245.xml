  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study described here will immunize children with trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) and
      determine whether this reduces influenza illness among the immunized children and their older
      family members. The comparison or control group for the children receiving influenza vaccine
      will be children immunized with inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). The study will also
      provide information on the amount of disease produced by influenza in the study population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza is an important cause of illness among children and adults in the United States.
      Influenza is likely also an important cause of illness in India, but published data on
      influenza infections in India are limited, especially for children. Although influenza
      vaccines are used routinely in the United States, including in young children, influenza
      vaccines have not seen widespread use in India. This is likely due to the lack of information
      from India about disease burden due to influenza and because the influenza vaccines have
      never been tested for efficacy in India. In addition, because young children are thought to
      be important in the spread of influenza in families, it is possible immunization of children
      against influenza will reduce influenza infections among older children and adults in the
      home.

    <description>Vaccine administration will occur twice, one month apart, in the first year of participation in the study. This will occur as TIV vaccine becomes available in India, in the early autumn. Subsequent years will provide one immunization. Due to the inclusion of the pandemic 2009 influenza A H1N1 virus in the 2010-2011 northern hemisphere vaccine formulation and recommendations that children should receive 2 doses of this vaccine this study will administer 2 doses of vaccine in the second year of the study.</description>
