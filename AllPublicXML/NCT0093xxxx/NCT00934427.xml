  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Vascana, a novel topical formulation of
      nitroglycerin, is effective in the treatment and prevention of the symptoms associated with
      Raynaud's Phenomenon.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Raynaud's Phenomenon is a sometimes debilitating condition in which blood flow to the fingers
      or toes is compromised when a patient is exposed to cold or stress. Current therapies for
      Raynaud's are suboptimal because they are associated with significant side effects. In this
      study, patient responses to cold temperature exposures in a climate-controlled room after
      application of the study medication are measured.
