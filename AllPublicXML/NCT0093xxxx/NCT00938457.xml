      RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor
      and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of stereotactic
      radiation therapy in treating patients with liver metastases.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I/II, dose-escalation study.

      Phase I: Patients undergo either percutaneous placement of metallic fiducial markers within
      the liver or respiratory-correlated cone-beam computed tomography for stereotactic targeting
      and planning. Patients then undergo single-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy over
      approximately 1 hour within 1 week of the marker placement.

      Phase II: Patients undergo treatment as in phase I at the maximum tolerated dose. After
      completion of study treatment, patients will be followed at weeks 4 and 12 and then every 3
      months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
