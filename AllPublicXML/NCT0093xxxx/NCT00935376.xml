    <textblock>
      The pilot project will investigate three short-term intervention programs for sleep
      management in cancer survivors in a randomized controlled clinical study. Three programs to
      be examined in the study are:

        1. the mind-body bridging program (MBBP),

        2. mindfulness meditation program (MMP), and

        3. sleep education program (SEP).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot randomized study investigates whether the two awareness training programs (ATP),
      MBBP and MMP are effective in improving sleep disturbance and in reducing stress in
      post-treatment cancer patients. The two experimental conditions and the SEP control will each
      comprise 3 sessions of 2 hr. duration and conducted over 3 consecutive weeks (Week 1-3).

    <description>The Mind-Body Bridging Program (MBBP) is an awareness training program (ATP)to help individuals improve their health condition and attain a state of well-being. Bridging is the primary technique that facilitates the healing process, by bringing one back to the present moment to experience thoughts, emotions and physical sensations. Bridging aims to reduce the impact of negative thought patterns that contribute to stress in the body.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Mindfulness Meditation Program (MMP) is based on Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), which teaches participants mindfulness skills such as meditation and yoga. Mindfulness may be defined as paying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally. The goal of MBSR is to provide participants with experiential tools and mindfulness practices to assist them to become more mindful of themselves, others and their external environment. The techniques are easy to learn and teach individuals to be aware of the present moment, with an open mind in which they can perceive their thoughts, physical sensations, and emotions nonjudgmentally.</description>
