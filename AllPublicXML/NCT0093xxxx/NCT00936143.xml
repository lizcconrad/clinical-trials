      This is a prospective open-label study to evaluated the efficacy and safety of
      infliximab(Remicade) in treating of patients with early ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
      Infliximab was injected intra-venous on baseline, 2nd week, 6th week, 12th week and 24th
      week, with dosing of 5mg/kg. The major outcome index is ASAS20, and minor outcome indexes
      include ASAS50 and ASAS70, BASDAI20,BASDAI50 and BASDAI70. And MRI of sacroiliac joint is not
      necessary. The adverse events at any time were recorded.
