    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for head and neck cancer relapses in previously irradiated patients is
      controversial. Reirradiation has had some success, but many patients still die from their
      disease. Cetuximab is helpful in relapsed head and neck cancer, and it improves the
      effectiveness of radiation in some head and neck cancer patients. But, it has not been
      studied with reirradiation. The purpose of this study is to see the effects, both good and
      bad, of reirradiation with cetuximab.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a pathologically confirmed recurrence (reappearance of previously
             cleared) squamous cell cancer in the upper aerodigestive tract or a second squamous
             cell primary. Patients may have experienced more than one recurrence as long as the
             first recurrence occurred ≥6 months following the end of the prior RT.

          -  The recurrence or second primary must be confined to the head and neck above the
             clavicles (loco-regional recurrence).

          -  The majority (≥75%) of the tumor volume must have been in areas previously irradiated
             to ≥45 Gy. The previous irradiation must not exceed a maximum of 75 Gy.

          -  Patients must be at least 6 months from prior radiation therapy.

          -  If a resection is performed after the diagnosis of recurrence and before enrollment,
             either microscopic or macroscopic disease must be present (i.e. positive margins or
             gross residual).

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status 60-100.

          -  Granulocytes ≥ 1500/mm3, platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3, bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dl, creatinine ≤
             1.5 mg/dl, within 6 weeks prior to registration.

          -  Must be able to submit previous radiation records (simulation and portal film if
             available) in order to assure that cord tolerance is not exceeded.

          -  Patients must sign a study-specific informed consent form prior to study entry.

          -  The patient must be between the ages of 18 and 75.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Distant metastases.

          -  Completely resected recurrence with negative margins.

          -  Other concurrent invasive malignancies.

          -  Prior invasive malignancy unless disease free for at least two years (prior in situ
             malignancies are permissible).

          -  Intercurrent medical illnesses which would impair patient tolerance to therapy or
             limit survival.

          -  Pregnant and nursing women are excluded because of the potential teratogenic effects
             and potential unknown effects on nursing newborns.

          -  Previous treatment with cetuximab.
