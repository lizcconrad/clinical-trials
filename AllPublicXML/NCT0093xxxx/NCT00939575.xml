  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are the medical complications more prevalent during
      pregnancy. In Canada, approximately 1% of pregnancies have complications due to a
      pre-existing hypertension, 5-6% because of hypertension of pregnancy without proteinuria and
      1-2% by preeclampsia. Metabolomics involves a new technology to investigate small molecules
      that characterize biochemical pathways of interest. The change in concentration levels of
      these molecules in various biological samples such as urine and blood in the presence of a
      disease or a patient can be particularly useful for identifying new biomarkers. Our
      hypothesis is that metabolic patterns in blood and urine of pregnant women who had
      preeclampsia differ from the metabolomics patterns of patients without preeclampsia.The whole
      research program has two complementary objectives in order to expect a decrease of
      prematurity: a) better understanding of all the physiological mechanisms leading to
      prematurity and b) better identification of patients at high risk for a better management of
      these women.

      Metabolomics involves a new technology using the methods of separation and detection complex
      to investigate a set of small molecules that characterize biochemical pathways of interest.
      The change in concentration levels of these molecules in various biological samples such as
      urine and blood in the presence of a disease or a patient can detect metabolic fingerprints
      that can be particularly useful for identifying new biomarkers. These will thereafter be
      quantified and validated by metabolic profiling. To our knowledge, there are few studies on
      metabolomics and pregnancy.

      Methods:

      The studied population will be women hospitalized for preeclampsia (after 20 SA). Women in
      the control group will be matched to women hospitalized for pre-eclampsia according to
      gestational age at diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, maternal age, parity, ethnicity and body mass
      index.

      Blood and urine samples will be taken:

      Case control:

        -  Following the diagnosis of preeclampsia

        -  At each blood test requested by the physician during the follow-up

        -  When the patient will be in labor (cervix ripening &gt; 5 cm) or before the caesarean
           section

        -  48 hours after delivery

        -  6-8 weeks after delivery

      Control group:

        -  Following the inclusion as a control in the study

        -  At admission for delivery

        -  When the patient will be in labor (dilation &gt; 5 cm) or before the caesarean section

        -  48 hours after delivery

        -  6-8 weeks after delivery
