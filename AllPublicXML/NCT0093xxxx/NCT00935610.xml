  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is typically associated with a decrease in skeletal muscle mass and muscle function,
      which contributes decisively to disability in old age and to the loss of quality of
      life.Resistance exercise can increase muscle strength, function and mass in older adults.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether the combination of resistance training
      with a supplementation of a cysteine- rich whey protein isolate (Immunocal) compared to
      combination of resistance training with casein used as control (casein contains little
      cysteine) could have the potential to provide a synergic beneficial impact on muscle mass and
      function which could translate to an improved quality of life in elderly persons.
