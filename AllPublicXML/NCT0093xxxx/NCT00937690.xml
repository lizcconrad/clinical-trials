      Design: this is a pilot study of infrared imaging of cutaneous lesions in patients and
      volunteers with and without clinically detectable melanoma, and with one or more palpable
      cutaneous lesions eligible for this imaging study. Participants will be evaluated with
      infrared camera imaging at cutaneous sites with known melanoma deposits, suspected melanoma
      deposits that are to be biopsied, or at cutaneous sites with other lesions, including other
      skin cancers, benign inflammatory lesions, benign neoplastic lesions (lipomas, epidermal
      cysts, dermatofibromas, scar, healing wound, etc.).

        Patients and volunteers over the age of 18 with palpable cutaneous skin lesions. Patients
        of all races and ethnic backgrounds are eligible. Efforts will be made to include pigmented
        and non-pigmented lesions in participants with a range of skin colors, including
        skin-colored papules in African-American and Hispanic patients when available.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients or volunteers with or without a history of melanoma.

          -  One or more palpable skin or subcutaneous lesions for which at least one of the
             following is true:

               -  A tissue diagnosis has been made for the lesion(s) in question, by prior
                  cytologic or histologic evaluation (Category A1).

               -  A tissue diagnosis will be obtained for the lesion(s) in question by cytologic or
                  histologic evaluation (Category A2).

               -  A tissue diagnosis is not available, but a clinical diagnosis of melanoma or
                  benign lesion is available with a high degree of confidence. Examples are
                  hemangiomas, skin tags, seborrheic keratoses, dermatofibromas, lipomas, or
                  growing pigmented skin lesions that are comparable to other cutaneous metastases
                  of melanoma in the same patient (Category B).

          -  All patients must have the ability and willingness to give informed consent and must
             be age 18 years or older at the time of study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known or suspected allergy to the adhesive skin markers or water-soluble ink used for
             the labeling of lesions.

          -  Very fragile skin that may be susceptible to injury from adhesive markers.

          -  Patients in whom there is a medical contraindication or potential problem in complying
             with the requirements of the protocol, in the opinion of the investigator.
