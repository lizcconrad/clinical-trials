      This study will examine whether treatment of inferior turbinates in patients with continued
      symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea, sleep related breathing disorder, snoring, disturbed
      sleeping, open mouth breathing, and upper airway resistance syndrome after tonsillectomy and
      adenoidectomy will improve these symptoms and should be included in the treatment paradigm
      for treatment of sleep related breathing disorders in infants, children, and adolescents.

      The question proposed by this study is one of treatment: To what extent does treatment of
      nasal obstruction from enlarged inferior turbinates with cold ablation inferior turbinate
      reduction in infants, children, and adolescents improve symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea,
      sleep related breathing disorder, snoring, disturbed sleeping, open mouth breathing, and
      upper airway resistance syndrome in patients that continue to have symptoms after
      tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.

      The trial seeks to provide evidence that the treatment of inferior turbinates in patients
      with continued symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea, sleep related breathing disorder,
      snoring, disturbed sleeping, open mouth breathing, and upper airway resistance syndrome after
      tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy will improve these symptoms and should be included in the
      treatment paradigm for treatment of sleep related breathing disorders in infants, children,
      and adolescents.

    <description>The procedure usually takes 30 minutes and involves the surgeon inserting the coblation inferior turbinate reduction wand into the inferior turbinates and allowing for the radiofrequency cold ablation to ablate soft tissues, with a resultant thermal lesion allowing for additional soft tissue attenuation and contracture with time.</description>
