  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      SAR 1118 within the anterior and posterior chamber of the eye and plasma in subjects
      undergoing elective vitrectomy when treated with escalating concentrations of the study drug
      for approximately 1 week.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SAR 1118 is a potent and selective small molecule lymphocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1)
      antagonist and may be therapeutically useful as a novel topical anti-inflammatory agent in a
      wide variety of ocular inflammatory conditions including diabetic retinopathy and diabetic
      macular edema. Recent evidence has demonstrated that topically delivered SAR 1118 ophthalmic
      solution can be detected in the aqueous, vitreous, and retina 4 to 12 hours after dosing at
      potentially therapeutic levels in animal models. However, the ability for the current sterile
      ophthalmic formulation of SAR 1118 to penetrate in sufficiently high therapeutic
      concentrations into the anterior and posterior chamber in humans is unknown.
