    <textblock>
      African American women living in the rural South are twice as likely as Caucasian women to
      develop cervical cancer and die of invasive cervical cancer at a higher rate than any other
      racial/ethnic group in the US (1). Reasons for low HPV vaccination rates among rural African
      Americans are not well understood. HPV vaccination compliance is likely influenced by
      barriers to health care access, misinformation regarding vaccinations, religious beliefs
      related to sexual health and behaviors, and mistrust of the medical community (2, 3). Because
      the vaccination of minors requires primary caregiver consent, vaccination commitment and
      compliance is strongly influenced by family beliefs and communication regarding health and
      sexuality. To date, little research has examined the cultural, familial, and intrapersonal
      influences on HPV vaccination compliance among rural African American women. This study will
      address these gaps in the literature and provide data needed to develop effective
      interventions and health promotion materials to encourage HPV vaccination among rural African
      American women.

      From a pool of approximately 800 families who are participating in ongoing longitudinal
      research through the Center for Family Research at the University of Georgia, the
      investigators will recruit 200 rural female African American youth aged 13-17 who have not
      received the HPV vaccine and their primary caregivers (n=200) into an observational,
      prospective study on vaccination commitment and compliance. The investigators hypotheses are
      as follows:

        1. Sociocultural factors that rural African Americans experience, including discrimination,
           previous health care experience, religious beliefs, and community norms regarding HPV
           vaccination and adolescent sexual behavior, will forecast primary caregivers' HPV
           vaccination commitment and compliance for their daughters. The investigators also
           predict that primary caregivers' HPV-related knowledge and attitudes will mediate this
           association.

        2. Sociocultural factors will influence sexual health-related family communication and
           interaction, primary caregivers' and youths' HPV-related attitudes, and HPV vaccination
           commitment and compliance.

        3. Primary caregivers' attitudes, youths' attitudes, and family health communication will
           contribute to youths' and caregivers' vaccination commitment and compliance.

        4. Youths' sexual behavior will influence their attitudes, family health communication, and
           vaccination commitment and compliance.
