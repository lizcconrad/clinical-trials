    <textblock>
      Positron Emission Tomography Imaging with 3-Deoxy-3'-[18F]Fluorothymidine (FLT) can
      selectively identify proliferating and non-proliferating tissues, including tumors. FLT
      uptake in the tumor is an indirect marker of DNA synthesis activity, which is a target of
      chemotherapy. Our hypothesis is that early change in FLT uptake in tumor with chemotherapy
      will predict pathological response to neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer. Tumor uptake of
      FLT will be imaged and measured with positron emission mammography (PEM), a PET scanner
      optimized for breast imaging with a significantly improved resolution compared to
      conventional whole-body PET imaging systems.

        Women diagnosed with breast cancer whose recommended treatment is neoadjuvant chemotherapy
        followed by surgical resection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          2. Subject must have histologically confirmed breast cancer.

          3. Subject must be scheduled to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery for
             their standard cancer care. Treatment decisions will be made by the treating surgeon
             and the medical oncologist.

          4. Females at least 18 years of age.

          5. Karnofsky at least 60% at time of screening.

          6. Life expectancy of greater than 6 months.

          7. Subject must have normal organ and marrow function (as defined below) within 30 days
             of study enrollment:

               -  leukocytes at least 3,000/microL

               -  absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/microL

               -  platelets at least 100,000/microL

               -  total bilirubin Equal or less than 1.0 mg/dl

               -  AST(SGOT) no greater than 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

               -  ALT (SGPT) no greater than 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

               -  Creatinine Equal or less than 1.4 mg/dl

               -  BUN Equal or less than 20 mg /dl

          8. The effects of FLT on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal
             or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the
             duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately. A screening urine hCG will be administered in the Nuclear Medicine to
             women of childbearing potential before each FLT scan and pregnant women will not be
             accepted as subjects in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          2. Subject with a Karnofsky score of below 60.

          3. Pregnant women are excluded from this study. FLT PET has potential for teratogenic
             effects. Because there are potentially unknown risks for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with FLT, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is imaged with FLT and may not resume for 48 hours after
             the FLT imaging.

          4. Subjects taking nucleoside analog medications such as those used as antiretroviral
             agents.
