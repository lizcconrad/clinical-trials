    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomized study comparing the efficacy and safety of randomized 2:1
      INC424/INCB018424 tablets versus best-available therapy, as selected by the investigator. The
      purpose is to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of INC424/INCB018424 given twice
      daily to the best-available therapy, in subjects with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post
      polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (PPV-MF) or post essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis
      (PET-MF).

    <textblock>
      Male or female individuals, aged 18 years or older who have been diagnosed with Myelofibrosis
      (either Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF) or Post-Polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis (PPV-MF) or
      Post-Essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis (PET-MF), were observed to have palpable
      splenomegaly, were not candidates for stem cell transplantation, and had 2 or more risk
      factors, thereby placing them in an intermediate-2 or high-risk prognostic group may enroll.
      Subjects were permitted to have received any or no prior therapy for MF. This is an open
      label, randomized study comparing the efficacy and safety of INCB018424 tablets versus
      best-available therapy, as selected by the investigator. The purpose is to compare the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of INCB018424 given twice daily to the best-available
      therapy, in subjects with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post polycythemia vera myelofibrosis
      (PPV-MF) or post essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (PET-MF).

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least 35% Reduction in Spleen Volume From Baseline at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The change in spleen volume from baseline to week 48 was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (or by computer tomography (CT) for participants unable to undergo MRI) and was calculated only for participants who had an evaluable spleen volume at baseline. The percentage of participants achieving a greater than or equal to 35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline to week 48 was then calculated by treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Maintenance of at Least 35% Reduction in Spleen Volume (DoMSR) From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, every 12 weeks until 25% progression from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>DoMSR is defined as the interval between the first spleen volume measurement that is &gt;=35% reduction from baseline and the first scan that is no longer = 35% reduction AND that is a &gt;25% increase over nadir. It was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate for each treatment arm. The analysis was performed only for subjects who achieved greater than 35% reduction in spleen volume.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, every 12 weeks until first 35% reduction in spleen is achieved</time_frame>
    <description>﻿This is defined as the interval between randomization and date of the first MRI showing a 35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume. The analysis was performed for participants who achieved a 35% reduction in spleen volume.</description>

    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) by Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>every three months after EOS until end of extension phase (96 weeks LPLV for the primary endpoint)</time_frame>

    <measure>Leukemia-free Survival (LFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>every three months after EOS until end of extension phase (96 weeks LPLV for the primary end)</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the interval between randomization and the date of the bone marrow blast count of 20% or greater OR the date of the first peripheral blast count of 20% or greater that was subsequently confirmed to have been sustained for at least 8 weeks OR the date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first.LFS was summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates for each treatment arm. The estimates were supplemented by tables of number of events and probability estimates at several timepoints.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS) by Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>every three months after EOS until end of extension phase (96 weeks LPLV for the primary end)</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the interval between randomization and death from any cause. Hazard ratios of OS and the corresponding 95% CIs were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model stratified by baseline prognostic category. For the comparison of OS between INC424 (INCB018424) and BAT, a stratified 2-sided log-rank test was used. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted for OS with the data being censored at the end of the Randomized Phase for those subjects who entered the Extension Phase. Unstratified analyses were also performed by reporting hazard ratios with 95% CIs.</description>

Therapy changed at different times during the treatment phase. No experimental agents (e.g. those not approved for the treatment of any indication) were allowed. BAT also included the option of no treatment.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>This is an open-label, 2:1 Randomized study comparing the efficacy and safety of INC424/INCB018424 tablets versus Investigator-selected BAT.
Not Completed in the Overall study refers to participants who were discontinued from the randomized treatment phase for the both the INC424/INCB018424 and BAT groups.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Starting dose of 15 mg BID or 20 mg BID were selected with starting dose based on baseline platelet count. Dose titration ranging from 5 mg BID to a maximum dose of 25 mg BID was permitted during the study based on safety and efficacy. Tablets were to be taken 12 hours apart. Administration instructions were provided at study visits.</description>

          <description>Best-available Investigator-selected therapy included a combination of available agents to treat the disease and/or its symptoms, and was selected by the investigator for each subject. Therapy changed at different times during the treatment phase. No experimental agents (e.g. those not approved for the treatment of any indication) were allowed. BAT also included the option of no treatment.</description>

Overall, (primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythemia vera-myelofibrosis(PPV-MF) and post-essential thrombocythemia-myelofibrosis (PET-MF) were diagnose in participants. The frequency of PMF was similar between ruxolitinib and BAT arms. In addition, the frequencies of PPV-MF and PET-MF were also similar between both treatment arms.</description>

Sensitivity analysis was also conducted for OS with the data being censored at the end of the Randomized Phase for those subjects who entered the Extension Phase. Unstratified analyses were also performed by reporting hazard ratios with 95% CIs.</description>

          <description>The starting dose of ruxolitinib tablets was determined based on baseline platelet count as follows: Subjects with baseline platelet count &gt; 200, 000/µL began dosing at 20 mg bid (four 5 mg tablets bid) or Subjects with baseline platelet count of 100,000/µL to 200,000/µL (inclusive) began dosing at 15 mg bid (three 5 mg tablets bid).
A standardized dosing paradigm was used to determine dose adjustments for safety and efficacy so that each subject was titrated to their most appropriate dose.</description>
