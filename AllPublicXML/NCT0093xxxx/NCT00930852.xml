      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is an association between migraine in
      children and certain patterns of appetite or eating behaviour that may lead to later obesity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of headache
      and associated symptoms. The condition affects approximately 11% of the child population and
      it can impose considerable burdens on the sufferer either due to the headache itself, or
      associated co-morbidities such as psychological stress, obesity, sleep problems, etc.
      Increasing attention is focussing on the shared genetic, environmental and neurobiological
      mechanisms of migraine co-morbidities to gain further insights into improving outcomes.

      We are interested in studying eating behaviours in children with migraine since there is
      evidence that altered patterns of eating behaviour (and underlying changes in appetite) are
      seen in migraineurs although not studied systematically. Altered appetite and eating
      behaviours may be a mechanism for the emerging association between obesity (or degree of
      adiposity) and migraine severity, detected in both adult and paediatric studies to varying
      extents. Studying the putative association between migraine, degree of adiposity and patterns
      of eating behaviour in children may help to tease out causal mechanisms, since both migraine
      and obesity often evolve over the course of childhood.
