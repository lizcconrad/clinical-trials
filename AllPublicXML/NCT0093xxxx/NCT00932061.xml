  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that biological markers are present in the body that are good
      indicators of chronic pain. Eligible participants will be assessed at baseline and after
      receiving a series of acupuncture or &quot;sham&quot; acupuncture (something that resembles, but is
      not, active acupuncture) sessions. If the subject qualifies for the investigators' research
      and are subsequently enrolled in this study, they will be randomly assigned (like the flip of
      a coin) to one of these two groups. Acupuncture, as previously shown by this group, leads to
      improvements in both clinical and evoked pain associated with fibromyalgia. The study
      involves two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans, one at the beginning and one at
      the end of the study. Another optional portion of the study would involve 2 PET (positron
      emission tomography) scans of the subject's brain, one at the beginning and one at the end of
      the study; this type of scan allows us to get more specific information about the subject's
      brain function during an acupuncture session.
