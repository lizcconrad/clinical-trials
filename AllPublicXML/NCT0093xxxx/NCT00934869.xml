  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotational deformity or malunion causes the most significant functional deficit in these
      common fractures. The evaluation of the rotation may be performed with the
      metacarpophalangeal joints flexed although postoperative swelling may not enable this
      examination with flexion of the fingers. Furthermore, it has been shown that swelling may
      cause rotation of the digit itself. The investigators propose that the swelling may cause a
      mistake in the estimation of rotation, during surgery and early follow up period. This is of
      special importance when open reduction and rigid fixation is performed.

      Methods:

      Prospective analysis of XX isolated metacarpal fractures treated, in YY patients was
      performed. End-on view of the finger-nail was taken with a digital camera on the day of OR,
      at 2 weeks and at 1 year. The photos were taken on a standard apparatus and from a distance
      of XX cm and evaluated using ZZ software in comparison with photos taken of the other hand,
      according to the involved digit. Range of motion, type of fracture and type of fixation were
      compared.
