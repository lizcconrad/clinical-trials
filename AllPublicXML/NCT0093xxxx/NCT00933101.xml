  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if diabetes damages the blood vessels of adolescents
      with good diabetes control compared to adolescents with less optimal control.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many published studies reveal that adult patients with T1DM can have early, silent and more
      advanced vessel wall thickness than normal subjects. This is influenced by the degree of
      their blood sugar control. If this is happening in adolescents, we want to know what
      proportion of adolescent children with type 1 diabetes show signs of early blood vessel
      damage. We also want to learn if these signs of damage are linked to other factors such as
      how long someone has had diabetes, blood sugar control or individual differences because of a
      difference in genetic make-up.
