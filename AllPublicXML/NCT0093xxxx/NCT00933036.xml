  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year in the United States more than 700,000 people suffer from compression fractures of
      the spinal column , and the number of people affected is much higher across the world.
      Osteoporosis is the main cause of fractures of the vertebral bodies. Other causes of
      vertebral fractures include malignant processes including benign lesions (hemangioma) and
      malignant lesions (metastatic cancers, myeloma), infections and trauma; however, osteoporosis
      is by far the main cause of this problem.

      In a normal person, the vertebral bodies are composed of a porous structure called trabecular
      or spongy bone encapsulated within a thin external cap of cortical (dense) bone. In a person
      with osteoporosis, the trabeculae that form the central porous bone become thinner and
      weaker. When this occurs, the vertebral bodies begin to fracture and become deformed. This
      deformation of the vertebral bodies is classified into three types, according to the shape:
      wedge, biconcave, and crush. The degree of severity of these deformations is classified as
      grade A1.1, grade A1.2, or grade A1.3

      The Crosstrees PVA™ Pod™ is a device designed to percutaneously provide controlled delivery
      of PMMA bone filler material during vertebral augmentation. The Crosstrees PVA System for
      Percutaneous Vertebral Augmentation (PVA) is designed for use with Crosstrees Fortibrae PMMA.
      The system is novel in providing the ability to control the delivery of PMMA to the vertebral
      body without the need for an additional permanent implant to remain within the patient. The
      Crosstrees System for Percutaneous Vertebral Augmentation will be used with Crosstrees Access
      Tools, which are regulated as Class I exempt orthopedic manual surgical instruments.

          5. Subjects affected vertebral body must have a loss of 0- 50% in vertebral height as
             compared with the height of an adjacent normal vertebral body confirmed by
             radiological evaluation.

          6. Subject fracture is confirmed by MRI imaging including T1, T2 and STIR-weighted
             studies to determine the type and presence of fracture(s).

          7. Subjects affected vertebral body height and geometry is adequate for insertion of
             access instruments of 5.2mm OD, as determined by the investigator.

             procedures.

         11. Subject is psychosocially, mentally, and physically able to fully comply with this
             protocol including adhering to scheduled visits, treatment plans, completing forms,
             and other study procedures.

         12. Subject signed the Informed Consent Form prior to any study related procedures

             the vertebral body, as measured against the nearest normal vertebral body. Degree of
             collapse will be determined by using the height of the nearest normal vertebral body
             to represent 100% and dividing the height of the collapsed vertebral body by the
             height of the normal vertebral body.

          3. Patient has symptomatic spinal stenosis.

          4. Patient has painful VCF with fracture age greater than 6 months.

          5. Patients has primary tumors of the bone (e.g., osteosarcoma) or solitary plasmacytoma
             at site of the index VCF. Patients with these tumors in anatomic sites other than the
             index VCF are eligible.

          6. Patient has a fracture that extends into the posterior vertebral body wall.

          7. Patient has neurological compromise (including myelopathy) and instability

          8. Patient has a retropulsion severe enough to cause myelopathy, unless prior surgical
             decompression is performed.

          9. Patient with significant clinical comorbidity that may potentially interfere with
             long-term data collection or follow-up (e.g., dementia, severe comorbid illness)

         10. Patient requires the use of high-dose steroid, IV pain medication, or nerve block to
             control chronic back pain unrelated to index VCF(s). Patients who receive high-dose
             steroids for treatment of their cancer (for at least 30 days) are eligible.

         11. Patient who may require allogenic bone marrow transplantation during the course of the
