  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a drug called lidocaine prevents cognitive injury (a
      decline in mental abilities) after heart surgery. Lidocaine is currently FDA approved and is
      commonly used for treating some heart rhythm disorders and for regional anesthesia (blocking
      nerves). The investigators are enrolling subjects in this research project to see if
      lidocaine will reduce the high incidence of cognitive injury seen after heart surgery. As
      part of this study, the investigators will also evaluate the relationship between cognitive
      injury and genetic makeup and the chemical changes in the subjects blood during and after
      surgery.

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Function From Baseline Characterized as Continuous Cognitive Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative to 6 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>To characterize cognitive function over time, while minimizing potential redundancy in the cognitive measures, a factor analysis was performed on the 14 cognitive test scores from baseline. We chose a five-factor solution, which represents 5 cognitive domains: structured verbal memory, unstructured verbal memory, executive function, visual memory and attention/concentration. To quantify overall cognitive function, a baseline cognitive index was first calculated as the mean of the 5 preoperative domain scores. The cognitive index score has a mean of zero, thus any positive score is above the mean, any negative score is below the mean. A continuous change score was then calculated by subtracting the baseline from the 6-week cognitive index. The resulting outcome measure is unbounded with standard deviation of 0.35. A negative change score indicating decline and a positive score indicating improvement.</description>

    <description>To characterize cognitive function over time, while minimizing potential redundancy in the cognitive measures, a factor analysis was performed on the 14 cognitive test scores from baseline. We chose a five-factor solution, which represents 5 cognitive domains: structured verbal memory, unstructured verbal memory, executive function, visual memory and attention/concentration. Each domain score is normally distributed with a mean of zero. A change score was calculated for each domain by subtracting the baseline from the 6-week score. A dichotomous outcome variable of post-operative cognitive deficit was defined as a decline of ≥1 standard deviation in 1 or more of the 5 domains.</description>

    <description>The DASI is a 12-item scale of functional capacity that has been found to correlate well with objective measures of maximal exercise capacity. Items reflect activities of personal care, ambulation, household tasks, sexual function, and recreational activities.

A trained observer rates the patent's ability to answer questions and perform activities. Ratings for each item are scored with 3 to 5 grades with 0 as normal, and there is an allowance for untestable items. The range of scores is from 0 (normal) to 42 (profound effect of stroke on patient).</description>

For the work activities scale, the reported score was the sum of four questions, each with values ranging from 1 to 4, the total score could range from 4 to 16. A higher score on Work Activities indicates more health-related problems For the general health question, the patients ranked their health from Excellent (1) to poor (5), the scale ranged from 1 to 5 with 1 being best health and 5 being worst. A high score in General Health indicates poorer health state.</description>

        <title>Change in Cognitive Function From Baseline Characterized as Continuous Cognitive Change</title>
        <description>To characterize cognitive function over time, while minimizing potential redundancy in the cognitive measures, a factor analysis was performed on the 14 cognitive test scores from baseline. We chose a five-factor solution, which represents 5 cognitive domains: structured verbal memory, unstructured verbal memory, executive function, visual memory and attention/concentration. To quantify overall cognitive function, a baseline cognitive index was first calculated as the mean of the 5 preoperative domain scores. The cognitive index score has a mean of zero, thus any positive score is above the mean, any negative score is below the mean. A continuous change score was then calculated by subtracting the baseline from the 6-week cognitive index. The resulting outcome measure is unbounded with standard deviation of 0.35. A negative change score indicating decline and a positive score indicating improvement.</description>

          <title>Change in Cognitive Function From Baseline Characterized as Continuous Cognitive Change</title>
          <description>To characterize cognitive function over time, while minimizing potential redundancy in the cognitive measures, a factor analysis was performed on the 14 cognitive test scores from baseline. We chose a five-factor solution, which represents 5 cognitive domains: structured verbal memory, unstructured verbal memory, executive function, visual memory and attention/concentration. To quantify overall cognitive function, a baseline cognitive index was first calculated as the mean of the 5 preoperative domain scores. The cognitive index score has a mean of zero, thus any positive score is above the mean, any negative score is below the mean. A continuous change score was then calculated by subtracting the baseline from the 6-week cognitive index. The resulting outcome measure is unbounded with standard deviation of 0.35. A negative change score indicating decline and a positive score indicating improvement.</description>

        <description>To characterize cognitive function over time, while minimizing potential redundancy in the cognitive measures, a factor analysis was performed on the 14 cognitive test scores from baseline. We chose a five-factor solution, which represents 5 cognitive domains: structured verbal memory, unstructured verbal memory, executive function, visual memory and attention/concentration. Each domain score is normally distributed with a mean of zero. A change score was calculated for each domain by subtracting the baseline from the 6-week score. A dichotomous outcome variable of post-operative cognitive deficit was defined as a decline of ≥1 standard deviation in 1 or more of the 5 domains.</description>

Items reflect activities of personal care, ambulation, household tasks, sexual function, and recreational activities. Activities done “with no difficulty” receive scores, which are weighted and summed, for a quantitative measure of functional status. Scores range from 0 to 60; a higher-weighted score indicates better function.</description>

A trained observer rates the patent’s ability to answer questions and perform activities. Ratings for each item are scored with 3 to 5 grades with 0 as normal, and there is an allowance for untestable items. The range of scores is from 0 (normal) to 42 (profound effect of stroke on patient).</description>

          <description>The Western perioperative neurologic scale was designed to detect neurologic deficits after cardiac surgery. It includes 14 items classified into eight domains (mentation, speech, cranial nerve function, motor weakness, sensation and cerebellum, reflexes, and gait). Each item is scored from 0 (severe deficit) to3 (normal), and a maximum score of 42 indicates normal neurological function.</description>
