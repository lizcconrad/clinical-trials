  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, single arm, pivotal trial.

      The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the IDev
      SUPERA® Nitinol Stent System in treating subjects with obstructive superficial femoral artery
      (SFA) disease. The primary endpoint will be the primary patency of the SFA evaluated at 12
      months. The outcome will be compared to a performance goal based on clinical trials of
      percutaneous transvenous angioplasty (PTA) alone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age greater than or equal to 18 years and of age of legal consent.

          2. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days
             prior to the index procedure.

          3. Subject has lifestyle limiting claudication or rest pain (Rutherford-Becker scale 2-4)
             with a resting ankle-brachial index (ABI) less than or equal to 0.9. TBI (toe-brachial
             index) is performed only unable to assess ABI. TBI must be less than or equal to 0.7.

          4. A single superficial femoral artery lesion with greater than 60% stenosis or total
             occlusion.

          5. Stenotic lesion(s) or occluded length within the same vessel (one long or multiple
             serial lesions) greater than or equal to 40 mm to less than or equal to 140 mm.
             Reference vessel diameter (RVD) greater than or equal to 4.0 mm and less than or equal
             to 6.0 mm by visual assessment.

          6. All lesions are to be located with the distal point at least 3 cm above the knee
             joint, defined as the distal end of the femur at the knee joint, and proximal point at
             least 2 cm below the origin of the profunda artery.

          7. Patent infrapopliteal and popliteal artery, i.e., single vessel runoff or better with
             at least one of three vessels patent (less than 50% stenosis) to the ankle or foot.

          8. The target lesion(s) can be successfully crossed with a guide wire and dilated.

          9. Poor aortoiliac or common femoral &quot;inflow&quot; (i.e., angiographically defined greater
             than 50% stenosis of the iliac or common femoral artery) that would be deemed
             inadequate to support a femoropopliteal bypass graft must be successfully treated
             prior to treatment of the target lesion. This can be done just prior to treatment of
             the target lesion. Successful treatment is defined as less than 30% stenosis after
             either PTA or stenting of the inflow lesion. After treatment of the inflow lesion, the
             pressure gradient across the target lesion will be obtained and if the pressure
             gradient is greater than or equal to 20 mmHg, then the subject will be included in the
             study.

         10. A subject with bilateral obstructive SFA disease is eligible for enrollment into the
             study. If a subject with bilateral disease is enrolled, the target limb will be
             selected at the Investigator's discretion, who may use the criteria of lesion length,
             percent stenosis, and/or calcification content. The contra-lateral procedure should
             not be done until at least 30 days after the index procedure (staged); however, if
             contralateral treatment is performed prior to treatment of the target lesion, the
             waiting period will be at least 14 days prior to the index procedure.

         11. The subject is eligible for standard surgical repair, if necessary.

         12. A subject who requires a coronary intervention should have it performed at least 7
             days prior to the treatment of the target lesion.

         13. Subject must provide written informed consent.

         14. Subject must be willing to comply with the specified follow-up evaluation schedule.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Thrombophlebitis or deep venous thrombus, within the previous 30 days.

          2. Receiving dialysis or immunosuppressant therapy within the previous 30 days.

          3. Thrombolysis of the target vessel within 72 hours prior to the index procedure, where
             complete resolution of the thrombus was not achieved.

          4. Stroke within the previous 90 days.

          5. Ipsilateral femoral aneurysm or aneurysm in the SFA or popliteal artery.

          6. Required stent placement via a popliteal approach.

          7. Required stent placement across or within 0.5 cm of the SFA/PFA bifurcation.

          8. Procedures which are pre-determined to require stent-in-stent placement to obtain
             patency, such as in-stent restenosis.

          9. Significant vessel tortuosity or other parameters prohibiting access to the lesion or
             90° tortuosity which would prevent delivery of the stent device.

         10. Required stent placement within 1 cm of a previously deployed stent.

         11. Subject required a coronary intervention, and the coronary intervention was done less
             than 7 days prior to or planned within 30 days after the treatment of the target
             lesion.

         12. Known allergies to any of the following: aspirin and all three of the following:
             clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix®), ticlopidine (Ticlid®), and prasugrel (Effient®);
             heparin, nitinol (nickel titanium), or contrast agent, that cannot be medically
             managed.

         13. Presence of thrombus prior to crossing the lesion.

         14. Known or suspected active infection at the time of the procedure.

         15. Presence of an ipsilateral arterial artificial graft.

         16. Use of cryoplasty, laser, or atherectomy devices at the time of index procedure.

         17. Restenotic lesion that had previously been treated by atherectomy, laser or cryoplasty
             within 3 months of the index procedure.

         18. Subject has tissue loss, defined as Rutherford-Becker classification category 5 or 6.

         19. History of neutropenia, coagulopathy, or thrombocytopenia that was unexplained or is
             considered to be at risk for reoccurrence.

         20. Known bleeding or hypercoagulability disorder or significant anemia (Hb &lt; 8.0) that
             cannot be corrected.

         21. Subject has the following laboratory values:

               1. platelet count less than 80,000/μL,

               2. international normalized ratio (INR) greater than 1.5,

               3. serum creatinine level greater than 2.0 mg/dL.

         22. Subject requires general anesthesia for the procedure.

         23. Subject is pregnant or plans to become pregnant during the study.

         24. Subject has a co-morbid illness that may result in a life expectancy of less than 1

        <description>Stent fractures were analyzed by X-ray evaluation by a designated core laboratory and defined as type I, II, III, IV or V.
Stent fracture classification
Type I - a single strut fracture only.
Type II - multiple single nitinol stent fractures that can occur at different sites.
Type III - multiple nitinol stent fractures resulting in complete transverse linear fracture but without stent displacement.
Type IV - a complete transverse linear type III fracture with stent displacement.
Type V - a spiral dissection of a stent.</description>

          <description>Stent fractures were analyzed by X-ray evaluation by a designated core laboratory and defined as type I, II, III, IV or V.
Stent fracture classification
Type I - a single strut fracture only.
Type II - multiple single nitinol stent fractures that can occur at different sites.
Type III - multiple nitinol stent fractures resulting in complete transverse linear fracture but without stent displacement.
Type IV - a complete transverse linear type III fracture with stent displacement.
Type V - a spiral dissection of a stent.</description>

          <description>Defined as an improvement in the Rutherford-Becker Clinical Improvement Scale of greater than or equal to one.
Grade +3 = Markedly improved. Symptoms are gone or markedly improved. ABI increased to &gt;0.90.
Grade +2 = Moderately improved. Still symptomatic but with improvement in lesion category. ABI increased by 0.10 but not normalized.
Grade +1 = Minimally improved. Categorical improvement in symptoms without significant ABI increase (0.10 or less) or vice versa (but not both).
Grade 0 = No change. No categorical shift and less than 0.10 change in ABI. Grade -1 = Mildly worse. Either worsening of symptoms or decrease in ABI of 0.10.
Grade -2 = Moderate worsening. Deterioration of the subject’s condition by one category or unexpected minor amputation.
Grade -3 = Marked worsening. Deterioration of the subject’s condition by more than one category or major amputation.</description>
          <population>Per ITT set.
Patients are included in the Limb ischemia improvement if:
They had a baseline Rutherford Becker Clinical Classification done. They return for their visit and Rutherford Becker Clinical Classification was done.</population>

        <description>The Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short form survey (SF-12) was used to assess generic QoL. SF-12 Health Survey is validated measure using 12 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the patient's point of view. Scores on the scale are 0% (indicating poor perceived health status) to 100% (indicating excellent perceived health status) possible. Physical and mental summary scores from the SF-12 are scaled to a U.S. population mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 (higher scores are better). Multiple groups have suggested minimum clinically important changes in SF-12 summary scores to be greater than 2-2.5 points, and moderate changes to be greater than 5 points.</description>
