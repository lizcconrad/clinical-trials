      The aim of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of
      KW-3357 in asymptomatic subjects with congenital antithrombin deficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Congenital Antithrombin Deficiency are at increased risk of venous thrombosis
      and pulmonary embolism especially when undergoing certain high risk procedures. Antithrombin
      replacement therapy is often administered during these periods, with or without low molecular
      weight heparin. Prior to assessing the efficacy of KW-3357, a new recombinant human
      antithrombin, the present study will determine it's pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability
      in subjects who have Congenital Antithrombin Deficiency but who are currently asymptomatic
      and not undergoing a high-risk procedure. Up to 16 evaluable subjects will be enrolled at
      multiple investigational sites over a period of approximately 7 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects at least 18 years of age with congenital Antithrombin
             deficiency (AT activity â‰¤60% of normal) in a stable condition without evidence of
             acute thromboembolic events

          -  Signed IEC-approved Informed Consent Form

          -  Subjects must not have received an infusion of Antithrombin for at least 14 days
             before Screening

          -  Patients of reproductive potential must agree to follow accepted birth control methods
             during the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are classified as morbidly obese (defined by the presence of a body mass
             index &gt;40 kg/m2)

          -  Subjects who have participated in a study with an investigational drug within 30 days
             of Screening or within 5.5 times the elimination half-life of the investigational drug
             before Screening, whichever period is greater

          -  Subjects with any clinically relevant medical history or current condition or physical
             findings, ECG, or laboratory values which could interfere with the objectives of the
             study or the safety of the subject

          -  Subjects using non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, fondaparinux sodium, dabigatran or
             rivaroxaban or who are expected to be treated with these drugs during the study

          -  Subjects who have concomitant nephrotic syndrome

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Subjects who are taking heparin, low molecular weight heparin and/or oral
             anticoagulants, with the exception of vitamin K antagonists (eg, warfarin)
