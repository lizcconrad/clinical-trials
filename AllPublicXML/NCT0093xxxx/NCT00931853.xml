      Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the clinical efficacy of Naturetti (jelly sugar free)

        -  To test medication on subjects who suffer chronic functional constipation in 30 days
           use.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate the clinical tolerability when daily used (repeated doses) of the
           components of the study drug. The components will be evaluated by the adverse events
           occurrence classified by possibly related, probably related and definitely related

        -  To demonstrate the clinical tolerability of the study medication by the continuous use
           during the second phase study

        -  To identify any adverse events related to the study drug

        -  To identify any drug interaction.
