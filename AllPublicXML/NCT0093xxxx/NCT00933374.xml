      This is a single arm open- label phase II- trial evaluating safety and efficacy of paclitaxel
      and RAD001 in patients with metastatic urothelial bladder cancer who failed prior
      platin-based systemic therapy.

      The screening phase for checking eligibility and evaluation of the patient prior start of
      study treatment will last up to 21 days.Tumor histology must be predominant urothelial
      carcinoma and confirmed histological or cytological.Patients who meet the inclusion criteria
      will be treated with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks and RAD001 10 mg once daily. Each
      cycle will use the combination of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 3-weekly with RAD001 10 mg daily
      starting at day 1 of a 21 days treatment cycle. Additional visits after day 1 are performed
      at day 8 and day 15 of each cycle Assessment of safety and toxicity will be performed at
      every visit.

      Patients will be treated until no signs of clinical or radiological progression are evident
      and the study treatment is well tolerated for a maximum of 6 cycles.
