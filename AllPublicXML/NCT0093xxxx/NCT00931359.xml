  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, parallel, randomized, blinded study. The study has two
      groups, where in one study group the subjects receive treatment for axillary hyperhidrosis
      (excessive underarm sweating) with the DTS-G2 System in both axilla (&quot;treatment group&quot;). The
      other study group receives a sham treatment in both axilla where the subjects will have the
      same procedure performed but no energy from the device will be applied (&quot;sham group&quot;).
      Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (treatment group: sham group).

      Subjects enrolled in the study will be blinded regarding which study group they are in. The
      study hypothesis is that subjects that receive the treatment will have a reduction in
      underarm sweating compared to those in the sham group, as measured by a quality of life
      questionnaire.

      All subjects will undergo follow up assessments at 14 days, 30 days, 3 months and 6 months
      post final treatment session. Subjects randomized to the treatment group will also have
      follow-up visits at 9 months and 12 months post final treatment session.

    <description>The Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) is a validated scale for measuring the effect of excessive sweating on the quality of life. It is a 4-point scale, with the following descriptors:
- My underarm sweating is never noticeable and never interferes with my daily activities
- My underarm sweating is tolerable but sometimes interferes with my daily activities
- My underarm sweating is barely tolerable and frequently interferes with my daily activities
- My underarm sweating is intolerable and always interferes with my daily activities</description>

    <description>Adverse events were defined in the protocol and included anticipated side effects of the procedure. These events were tracked by the clinical site and did include subject-reported events. The events reported here only included side effects that were attributed by the principal investigator as being possibly to definitely related to the device or procedure. They did not include expected treatment effects, such as swelling or bruising in the treatment area.</description>

- My underarm sweating is barely tolerable and frequently interferes with my daily activities
