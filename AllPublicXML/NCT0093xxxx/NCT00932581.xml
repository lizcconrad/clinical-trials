      The purpose of this study is to examine whether scores on questionnaires that rate how much
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) has slowed movements of the body differ when the order of the
      questions are changed. The consistency and accuracy of the questionnaires will also be
      examined. It is hypothesized that there will not be a difference.
