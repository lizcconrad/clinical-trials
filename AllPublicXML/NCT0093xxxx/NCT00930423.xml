  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atypical hemolytic uraemic syndrome is caused by defects in the regulating factors in the
      alternative pathway of the complement system. Triggering can cause an uncontrolled complement
      activation with endothelial damage and thrombotic micro-angiopathy, especially in the
      kidneys. This can result in endstage renal failure. Complement activation during hemodialysis
      has been described as a result of contact between blood and the dialysis membrane. Our
      hypothesis is that patients with atypical hemolytic uraemic syndrome have a stronger
      complement activation during hemodialysis than patients with another underlying kidney
      disease. This could be a reason to treat patients with endstage renal failure due to atypical
      hemolytic uraemic syndrome preferentially with peritoneal dialysis instead of hemodialysis.
