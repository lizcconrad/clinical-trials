  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to test the hypothesis that zolpidem taken the night before major surgery
      for endometrial cancer will improve sleep efficiency and reduce post surgery pain, as well as
      reduce the need for analgesic medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite continuing improvements in surgical procedures and ancillary care, post surgery pain
      continues to be a nearly universal patient experience following major operative procedures.
      Opioids provide considerable pain relief, but they have multiple adverse side effects and are
      not entirely effective. For cancer patients, uncontrolled postoperative pain can have a
      substantial negative effect on quality of life, can slow recovery, increase the likelihood of
      complications, and contribute to poorer postoperative outcomes. The identification of novel
      modifiable patient risk factors for post surgery pain that could become the target of
      presurgery interventions is thus an important goal. We will conduct a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind intervention trial design to evaluate the effects of an FDA
      approved hypnotic (zolpidem) on post surgery pain. Since presurgery psychological factors
      (e.g., heightened anxiety) are known to predict the severity of post surgical pain and may be
      associated with poor sleep, we will also assess psychological factors (with questionnaires)
      as well as sleep (using actigraphy) in order to determine their individual and combined
      impact on women's experiences of post surgery pain in this stressful clinical context. Aim 1:
      To determine the impact of zolpidem administered the night prior to endometrial cancer
      surgery on women's experiences of pain over the initial 7-10 day follow-up period after
      surgery using a double-blind placebo-controlled design (final n=128). Aim 2: To investigate
      psychological factors on the morning before surgery, as well as objective sleep variables on
      the night before surgery, as possible mediators of the beneficial effects of zolpidem on post
      surgery pain. Aim 3: To examine psychological factors, as well as sleep variables, assessed
      prior to the sleep intervention as possible moderators of the ameliorative effects of
      zolpidem on post surgery pain. The results of the proposed exploratory study would provide
      the preliminary data necessary for an R01 application to support more comprehensive
      investigations, including explorations of biological mechanisms underlying the preventative
      effects of better presurgery sleep on patients' experiences of post surgery pain.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (Short-form)</measure>
    <time_frame>at the clinical follow-up appointment approximately 7-10 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity and pain interference subscales from the Brief Pain Inventory (Short-form) (BPI) will be used to measure pain over the interval following surgery. Both subscales have a range of 0-10 with higher scores indicating worse outcomes (more intense pain and more pain interference).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Severity Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>each of the days following surgery until the clinical follow-up appointment</time_frame>
    <description>Pain severity will be assessed daily following surgery with a visual analogue scale (VAS) completed by participants each night before they go to bed (daily diary PM). VAS pain severity yields a score of 0 to 100, with 100 indicating pain &quot;as bad as it could be.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Daily Analgesic Medication Consumption (Morphine Equivalency)</measure>
    <time_frame>daily from the day of surgery until the clinical follow-up appointment</time_frame>
    <description>Analgesic medication consumption will be calculated (morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD)) on a daily basis using data down loaded from the patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump supplemented by information from clinical charts and patient self report on the daily diary form. MEDD starts at zero and does not have an upper limit; higher daily doses indicate more analgesic medication consumption, and thus more pain.</description>

        <description>Pain intensity and pain interference subscales from the Brief Pain Inventory (Short-form) (BPI) will be used to measure pain over the interval following surgery. Both subscales have a range of 0-10 with higher scores indicating worse outcomes (more intense pain and more pain interference).</description>

        <description>Analgesic medication consumption will be calculated (morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD)) on a daily basis using data down loaded from the patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump supplemented by information from clinical charts and patient self report on the daily diary form. MEDD starts at zero and does not have an upper limit; higher daily doses indicate more analgesic medication consumption, and thus more pain.</description>
