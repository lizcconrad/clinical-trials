  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute laryngotracheobronchitis, better known as croup, is one of the common respiratory
      complaints among children and the most common cause of airway obstruction in children aged
      six months to six years. Patients with croup are typically visited by physicians during two
      peak time periods throughout the year. The first one is in the autumn, usually as a result of
      parainfluenza virus, and the second peak occurs in early winter, a consequence of RSV. Croup
      affects males more commonly than females and affects children between the ages of 6 months to
      6 years. The incidence of croup peaks in children at 2 years of age; croup in older children
      is uncommon, and recurrent episodes are frequently observed.

      Croup symptoms are generally short-lived, with about 60% of children showing resolution of
      their barky cough within 48 h. However, a few children continue to have symptoms for up to 1
      week. Although most children with croup recover without specific treatment, up to 15% require
      hospital admission, and, among those admitted, up to 5% may require intubation.

      Nebulised adrenaline is effective but it has a short duration of action and potentially
      dangerous side effects, and it is therefore not recommended for use in the community in
      mild-moderate Croup.

      Oral and intramuscular steroid treatment, when given in adequate doses in hospital, has been
      shown to be effective for moderate to severe croup in a number of trials and a meta analysis.

      It has been suggested that nebulised administration is superior to the oral or intramuscular
      route of administration for a more rapid onset of action and fewer side-effects.

      This study is aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of nebulised steroid administration as
      beclomethasone dipropionate in croup patients compare to placebo.

             onset barky cough, stridor, hoarseness, and respiratory distress

          3. Children with a diagnosis of moderate croup (Westley score 3-8)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Symptoms or signs of any other cause of stridor;

             drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in
             the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into
