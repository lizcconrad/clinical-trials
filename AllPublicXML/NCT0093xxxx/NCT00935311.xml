  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate analgesic efficacy and safety of
      hydrocodone/acetaminophen compared to placebo in moderate to severe pain following molar
      extraction.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dosing started within 6 hours after completion of third molar extraction. Study drug was
      given once every 6 hours for 12 hours (for a total of 2 doses). Participants were randomized
      to receive placebo or active drug (either experimental drug or comparator). The total dose
      was the same for both groups receiving active drug, but was given as either 1 dose of
      extended-release tablets (experimental drug), or 2 doses of immediate-release tablets (active
      comparator).

    <measure>Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) Using the Pain Intensity Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of first study drug administration to 12 hours following first study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed pain intensity on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) with 0 meaning &quot;no pain&quot; and 100 meaning the &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;. The SPID VAS score for 0 to 12 hours following initial study drug dose measured the cumulative pain intensity difference during treatment with higher mean SPID VAS scores indicating greater improvement from Baseline. The SPID score is a measure of the cumulative pain intensity difference during treatment and the area under the curve was estimated using the linear trapezoidal rule.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TOTPAR (Total Pain Relief)</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of first study drug administration to 12 hours following first study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>TOTPAR was the time-interval weighted sum of pain relief. Pain relief was assessed by participants' responses to how their pain relief was compared with the pain they had just before receiving the first dose of study drug: no relief, a little relief, some relief, a lot of relief, or complete relief. Higher mean TOTPAR scores indicate better pain relief. The TOTPAR score is a measure of the cumulative pain intensity difference during treatment and the area under the curve was estimated using the linear trapezoidal rule.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Rescue Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of first study drug administration to 12 hours following first study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>The median time (minutes) from first dose of study drug to first use of analgesic rescue medication.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>AEs were recorded from study drug administration until 30 days following discontinuation of study drug (total 30 days); SAEs were recorded from the time informed consent was obtained until 30 days following discontinuation of study drug (total 51 days).</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is considered a serious adverse event (SAE): results in death or is life-threatening, results in admission or prolongation of hospitalization, results in congenital anomaly or persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is an important medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent serious outcome. AEs were categorized by severity (mild, moderate, severe) and relationship to treatment (probably, possibly, probably not, not related). Please see Adverse Events section below for more details.</description>

        <title>TOTPAR (Total Pain Relief)</title>
        <description>TOTPAR was the time-interval weighted sum of pain relief. Pain relief was assessed by participants’ responses to how their pain relief was compared with the pain they had just before receiving the first dose of study drug: no relief, a little relief, some relief, a lot of relief, or complete relief. Higher mean TOTPAR scores indicate better pain relief. The TOTPAR score is a measure of the cumulative pain intensity difference during treatment and the area under the curve was estimated using the linear trapezoidal rule.</description>

        <title>Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is considered a serious adverse event (SAE): results in death or is life-threatening, results in admission or prolongation of hospitalization, results in congenital anomaly or persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is an important medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent serious outcome. AEs were categorized by severity (mild, moderate, severe) and relationship to treatment (probably, possibly, probably not, not related). Please see Adverse Events section below for more details.</description>
        <time_frame>AEs were recorded from study drug administration until 30 days following discontinuation of study drug (total 30 days); SAEs were recorded from the time informed consent was obtained until 30 days following discontinuation of study drug (total 51 days).</time_frame>
