      Objective/study hypothesis To evaluate how much of a taboo UI is and how it compares to other
      medical conditions that may also pose a taboo issue like depression and cancer.

      Background Urinary incontinence (UI) is a highly prevalent condition with more than 200
      million people worldwide being affected. While physical health does not necessarily have to
      be impaired much, restriction of social activities leads to isolation, a significant
      reduction in quality of life and will often bring about subsequent morbidity. Despite its
      prevalence, many patients suffering from UI go undiagnosed and untreated. Patients often
      hesitate to report the problem, and health care professionals often do not ask about it. In a
      study Minassian (2003) estimated that just one in four patients actively seeks medical
      attention. The reason for this may lie in the shame, embarrassment, and stigma associated
      with this condition, which in turn pose significant barriers to seeking professional
      treatment. Although mentioned by many narrative reviews and included in some epidemiological
      papers on UI, surprisingly we found no data addressing the taboo of UI exclusively. The aim
      of our study therefore was

      Methods/Design A 13-question self-administered questionnaire was developed and face validity
      tested by 2 of the authors (KH, EH). The anonymous questionnaire contained simple questions
      on gender and age and then asked yes/no questions on whether test persons knew people with
      UI, or suspected other people to be incontinent, if they would address this issue with the
      suspected person, and if they thought that UI was a taboo issue in the society. On a scale
      from 0 - 10 they were then asked to grade the amount of embarrassment and anxiety if they
      themselves were incontinent, compared to depression or cancer. A few questions on knowledge
      of the condition of UI and to whom test persons would turn to in case of UI concluded the
      short questionnaire, which took about 5 minutes to fill in. A convenience sample of 150 test
      persons from waiting areas of a teaching hospital and in private practices of general
      practitioners in Austria agreed to take part in the study, with an additional 10 persons
      (6.2%) declining after being informed about the subject. Data were analysed with the SPSS
      10.0.5 software package using the U-test, Chi-square-test, Yates-correction, Fisher's exact
      test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test where appropriate.
