      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
      formulation, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.
      Giving paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation together with everolimus may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of everolimus when
      given together with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and to see how
      well it works in treating women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of everolimus when
           administered in combination with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation
           in women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. (Phase I)

        -  To determine the antitumor activity of this regimen, as measured by clinical tumor
           response according to RECIST criteria, in these patients. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of everolimus when administered at the
           recommended phase II dose in combination with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
           formulation in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study of everolimus followed by a
      phase II study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1, 8, and 15. Patients also receive oral everolimus once daily or once every other day
      on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

    <description>Phase I:
Abraxane will be given by IV for 30 minutes on the first day of the first three weeks of each 28 day cycle.
RAD001 will be given by tablet. The first group of patients will receive RAD001 once daily depending on side effects seen drug could be increased later to twice a day for a 28 day cycle.
Once a safe and effective drug range is established, the study moves into Phase II.
Phase II:
The maximum tolerated dose (established in Phase I) will be given as scheduled below and we will measure the effectiveness of the study drug combination.
Abraxane will be given by IV (intravenous infusion) for 30 minutes on the first day of the first three weeks of each 28 day cycle (Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15 of each cycle).
RAD001 will be given by tablet based on the dose established in the Phase I part of the study.</description>
