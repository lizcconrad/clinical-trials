  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of six intravenous (IV) infusions of
      magnesium chloride versus placebo in patients who have residual muscle weakness from a stroke
      that occurred three months to four years ago.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis being tested is that these six treatments will improve muscle weakness and
      lead to an improvement in functioning/activities of daily living as measured by the 100-point
      Barthel index, three months after their last treatment versus their baseline measure, and
      that the mean difference between the treatment and placebo groups of patients will be at
      least three points in this index.
