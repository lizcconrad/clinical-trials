    <textblock>
      The first part of the pilot study, as detailed in Unique Protocol ID No. 27522, is a
      randomized clinical trial that compares the effects of a mind-body bridging program with a
      sleep hygiene program to improve sleep quality in patients suffering from sleep disturbances.
      In Part II of the study, the investigators will perform a six month follow-up on the same
      subjects.

      In this follow-up, we ask subjects to answer the same questionnaires that they completed at
      the beginning of the study. In addition we will ask subjects to complete a survey reflecting
      their medical history over the past 6 months and a second survey establishing their
      behavioral patterns and whether they continued practicing techniques of the intervention they
      were assigned to.
