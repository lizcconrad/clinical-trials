    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the effect of duloxetine treatment on (1) cognitive
      functions, the brain mechanisms involved with thinking, reasoning, learning, and remembering;
      (2) psychosocial functions, how someone interacts with his/her social environment; and (3)
      the relationship between these two functions, in people who have major depressive disorder, a
      severe form of depression.

      People who have difficulties with concentration and/or cognition as part of their depression
      will be treated with duloxetine for 12 weeks and their cognitive performance will be assessed
      before and after treatment using cognitive tests. Eligible participants will have eight
      clinic visits.
