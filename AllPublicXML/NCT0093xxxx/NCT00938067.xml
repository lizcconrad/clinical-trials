      The purpose of this study is to provide American Indian trauma patients, treated at the
      Harborview Level 1 urban trauma center, compassionate and culturally sensitive care and to
      link them to care in their distant tribal communities. The specific aims include 1) interview
      Native healers to gather information on culture-specific aspects of recovery from traumatic
      injury and on linking care to tribal communities, 2) conduct a randomized controlled trial to
      evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the intervention. The investigators
      hypothesize that intervention patients will demonstrate greater improvement than controls in
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression, functioning, diagnoses, and fewer
      new injuries during the 6 months after the index injury.

    <textblock>
      American Indians are at a greater risk for traumatic life events than the general population
      and compared to Whites they have a 2.04 (95% CI 1.11, 3.54) fold increased risk of Post
      Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Among more than 2,900 injured trauma survivors
      treated at 69 hospitals nationwide, American Indians had the highest risk of all
      racial/ethnic groups of developing symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of PTSD 12 months
      after injury. Similarly, among 269 traumatically injured patients hospitalized at 2 level 1
      trauma centers in the Western U.S., PTSD and peritraumatic dissociative symptoms were
      significantly more frequent among American Indians compared to Whites.

      Nine percent of 6,000 injured trauma survivors admitted annually to the Harborview Level 1
      trauma center are American Indian. Approximately 40 percent of these patients live more than
      50 miles from the trauma center, including tribal communities in Eastern Washington and the
      Olympic Peninsula. Through prior work, researchers have found that care management
      interventions can reduce PTSD symptoms among diverse injured urban patients. Investigators
      from the Center of Excellence suggest that American Indian trauma survivors may have unique
      culture-specific idioms for posttraumatic distress (e.g. &quot;wounded spirit&quot;), and that trauma
      interventions with indigenous approaches may be productively applied to patients suffering
      from posttraumatic distress.(5)

      In an effort to reduce the risk of PTSD and other general symptoms of trauma among American
      Indians, we plan to conduct a pilot study to develop and evaluate an American Indian culture
      specific care management intervention, Staying Connected.

      Based on the Trauma Survivors and Support Study (TSOS), the purpose of Staying Connected is
      to provide American Indian trauma patients, treated at the Harborview Level 1 urban trauma
      center, compassionate and culturally sensitive care and to link them to care in their distant
      tribal communities. The specific aims include 1) interview Native healers to gather
      information on culture-specific aspects of recovery from traumatic injury and on linking care
      to tribal communities, 2) conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the
      implementation and effectiveness of the intervention. We hypothesize that intervention
      patients will demonstrate greater improvement than controls in PTSD symptoms, depression,
      functioning, diagnoses, and fewer new injuries during the 6 months after the index injury.

    <description>The intervention combines case management, psychopharmacological and culturally appropriate and individually tailored trauma support activities with evidence-based treatments.A key feature is the provision of a continuous healing relationship by a care management treatment team.The care manager, informed by the Native healer interviews, will provide a culturally appropriate and ongoing helping relationship to each intervention patient in the weeks and months post-injury and will remain in close contact with the trauma survivor subject for 6 months.Together, the care manager and trauma survivor subject will work on a plan to readjust to daily activities. The care management team will also coordinate psychopharmacological interventions for PTSD and related co-morbidities with primary care and or other community providers.</description>

    <description>The overarching goal of the Staying Connected intervention is to establish a compassionate and culturally sensitive treatment trajectory that diminishes posttraumatic suffering by reducing symptomatic distress, improving functional recovery, and reducing the risk of injury recurrence. This trajectory begins with surgical treatment and extends through outpatient care and community rehabilitation. The collaborative care intervention fundamentally restructures the delivery of mental health care within trauma care systems by bringing together providers currently working independently to form an interdisciplinary mental health team. Team members work together and in a liaison capacity with other trauma center providers and community practitioners in order to bridge care across service delivery sectors.</description>
