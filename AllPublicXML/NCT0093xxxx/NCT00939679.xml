    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the short term and long term effects of Roux-en-Y
      gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery on energy expenditure, gastrointestinal and appetite regulating
      hormone levels, and appetite sensation. We hypothesize that following RYGB surgery,
      metabolism will be elevated in comparison to patients who have not yet had RYGB but who are
      losing weight simultaneously using a low calorie diet. We further hypothesize that this
      higher metabolism will be associated with alterations in fasting and postmeal levels of
      gastrointestinal and appetite regulating hormones. Long term (1.5 years after RYGB), we
      hypothesize that differences in metabolism, body composition, and hormone levels will
      distinguish between patients who have maintained their weight loss after RYGB vs those who
      have regained weight.

    <description>Briefly, RYGB is characterized first by creation of a small stomach pouch. The small intestine is then divided approximately 75 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz, creating a proximal intestinal limb that transports the secretions from the stomach remnant, liver, and pancreas, and a 'Roux' limb, that is attached to the new stomach pouch to drain consumed food. The distal end of the proximal limb is then reattached approximately 100 cm distal to the new stomach drainage site, creating a common channel where digestive enzymes mix with ingested food.</description>
