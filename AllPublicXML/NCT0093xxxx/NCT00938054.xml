  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism is defined as a lifelong pervasive developmental disability, as such, symptom recovery
      is considered rare. Reports by Lovaas and McEachin, Smith &amp; Lovaas and more recently by
      Cohen, Amerine-Dickens, &amp; Smith, Smith Groen et al. and Sutera Pandey et al suggest that
      intensive behavioral intervention programs during preschool years may result in improvement
      to the point where some children no longer meet criteria for autism by the time they reach
      school age. Similarly, there are a large number of anecdotal reports of children with autism
      who, following intensive biomedical intervention (e.g., gluten/casein free diets, vitamin
      supplements, chelation), are indistinguishable from their typically developing peers. The
      goal of the current research is to characterize the behavioral and biological profiles of
      children with autism who show significant symptom reduction such that they no longer meet
      criteria for autism (Remitted Autism [REM-AUT]) and to contrast them with a group of children
      who continue to meet criteria for autism (AUT) and to typically developing (TD) group of
      children. Examining whether neurobiological and neurobehavioral symptoms commonly reported in
      autism are as frequent and severe in children who have responded to treatment is an important
      first step in determining what factors may contribute to symptom remission in autism. In
      addition, understanding how children with remitted autism compare to typically developing
      children will help us better understand whether symptom improvement is through remediation
      (normalization of function) or compensation (achieving the same behavioral/adaptive outcome
      but through an alternative process).

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        STUDY SUBJECTS:

        Remitted Autism (REM-AUT) Group:

          1. Diagnosis of autism prior to symptom improvement

               1. valid administration of ADI and/or ADOS with accompanying interpretive report
                  yielding an autism diagnosis

                  OR

               2. clinical/developmental evaluation including a detailed review of the child s
                  history and direct observation of current behavioral functioning resulting in a
                  documented diagnosis of autism by a child developmental specialist experienced
                  with autism spectrum disorders such as a developmental pediatrician,
                  developmental psychologist, child clinical psychologist, or a child psychiatrist

               3. measure of cognitive ability from within 1 year of initial autism diagnosis

               4. objective measure indicative of prominent autism symptoms using a recognized and
                  standardized assessment of autism symptoms such as the Social Responsiveness
                  Scale (SRS), Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), or the Modified Checklist for
                  Autism in Toddlers (MCHAT) or video tapes of assessments

               5. initial diagnosis of autism prior to age 6

                  AND

               6. Medical, educational, treatment record review by PDN branch clinicians to confirm
                  diagnostic impressions including a detailed description of child s behaviors that
                  support an autism diagnosis

               7. The final decision for meeting diagnostic and treatment history inclusion
                  criteria is based on PDN branch staff review of the case

               8. Treatment history: all participants must have received adequate treatment
                  intervention for their autism symptoms. Participant medical and treatment records
                  will be carefully reviewed to ascertain their treatment history

          2. Current functioning:

             a. Parent report and report of at least one professional that child is no longer
             autistic

          3. At screening visit (after meeting initial eligibility), will not meet criteria for
             autism

               1. Must not meet criteria for autism per overall clinical impression based on
                  information collected from administration of the ADOS, current ADI-R symptoms,
                  and other clinical observations made the assessment.

               2. Teacher/informant report of autism symptoms (such as results from the SRS) not
                  indicative of autism diagnosis

               3. Minimum improvement of symptoms required from group assignment: approximately 2
                  point CGI severity of illness change (or equivalent) based on PDN impression of
                  change in illness severity from initial diagnosis (estimated based on review of
                  past medical records) and current functioning

                  OR

               4. Current assessment of functional impairment due to autism symptoms using a
                  standardized assessment measure such as the Developmental Disability-Children s
                  Global Assessment Scale will reflect adequate functioning in all areas and/or a
                  clinically significant improvement in functioning, consistent with common
                  psychiatric treatment definitions for treatment response

          4. Able to participate in study procedures.

        AUTISM Group:

          1. Diagnosis of autism following the same criteria as described above

          2. Treatment history: all study participants must have received adequate treatment
             intervention. Treatment history will be matched to treatment provided to children in
             the REM-AUT group.

          3. Screening visit (after meeting initial eligibility): will meet criteria for autistic
             disorder using the same diagnostic process described for the REM-AUT group above

          4. Matched to REM-AUT group on IQ, age of diagnosis, and treatment history. IQ matching
             between the AUT and REM-AUT groups will be based on pretreatment estimates of
             cognitive level obtained from the medical record review.

          5. Able to participate in study procedures.

        TD Group:

          1. IQ matched to a sub-sample of children in the REM-AUT group with normal range
             intellectual functioning. IQ matching between the TD and REM-AUT groups will be based
             on current intellectual functioning at the time of study participation.

          2. Able to participate in study procedures.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All groups: May not be pregnant or have a known genetic disorder, mitochondrial disease,
        history of birth trauma, or current uncontrolled seizures

        TD Group:

             psychiatric condition.

          2. Prematurity at birth less than 36 weeks gestation); or birth weight significantly
             below normal for gestational age (SGA- small for gestational age).
