    <textblock>
      Purpose:

      The involvement of Natural Killer cells (NK) in the efficiency of the treatment in lymphoma
      and the beginning of new therapies based on function and activation of NK, justify an
      improvement of knowledge about the status of the population of NK (number, function, genic
      expression) in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).

      Method: prospective, monocentric, descriptive study

      Primary objective:

      Evaluation of the expression and function of receptors activator of NK cell (KIRs) in
      patients with CLL at stage A with therapeutic abstention, or stage B or C which require a
      treatment.

      Secondary objectives:

      Measure of the evolution of cytotoxic function of NK cells and theirs biomarkers of
      activation when the patient receives an immunochemotherapy with Rituximab/ Fludarabine/
      Cyclophosphamide (RCF).

      Verification, by analysis, of functions and biomarkers of the adaptive and innate immunity
