             haemoglobin result outside the reference range of the local laboratory.

          -  Abnormal vital signs or abnormal 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) results, as judged by
             the Investigator to be clinically significant.

          -  Females, pregnant or lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the time the
             subject is on study.

          -  Subjects with a history of pulmonary infiltrate or pneumonia in the previous 6 months

             screening visit.

          -  Blood donation &gt;=500 mL in the previous 12 weeks from the date of the screening visit.

          -  Use of any prescription medication (excluding hormonal contraceptives) within 14 days

          -  Receipt of over-the-counter medicines which have not yet cleared from the body (five
             half-lives must have passed for the medicine to be considered to have cleared from the
             body). Vitamins, minerals and nutritional supplements may be taken at the discretion
             of the Investigator.
