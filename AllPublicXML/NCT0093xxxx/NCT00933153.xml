  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers will measure weight, height, hand grip strength and quality of life information
      of Meals on Wheels (MOW) clients who are considered to have nutrition problems. Participants
      will randomly be put into a group that receives either typical meals from Meals on Wheels or
      Ensure Plus supplements with their meals. Three months later the same data will be collected
      again. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of providing oral
      nutritional supplements (ONS) to MOW clients with or at risk of malnutrition on nutritional
      status over a 3-month period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While it is well known that older adults are at increased nutritional risk and that nutrition
      intervention, such as oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) is beneficial in this
      population, there is limited research on the effect of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) in
      the Meals on Wheels population. This prospective randomized controlled trial will determine
      the effectiveness of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) in addition to daily meals from Meals
      on Wheels on weight status, hand grip strength, quality of life, and malnutrition screening
      scores in MOW clients with or at-risk of malnutrition over a 3-month study period.
