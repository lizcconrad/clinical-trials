  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the influence of pantoprazole on the pharmacokinetic
      profile of cladribine, especially in terms of extent of absorption of cladribine since
      pH-modifying drug may potentially affect the stability of cladribine and thereby its
      bioavailability

        <title>Apparent Volume of Distribution During the Terminal Phase Following Extravascular Administration (Vz/f) of Cladribine</title>
        <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>

        <population>The PK analysis set included all the subjects who received cladribine alone and cladribine + pantoprazole according to the randomization and completed the full PK sampling.</population>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 1 year, that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre treatment state. AEs Leading to Death and AEs Leading to Discontinuation were also presented in the outcome measure.</description>
