  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used for the detection of breast lesions in
      genetically high-risk women due to its high sensitivity. As non-cancerous conditions
      including normal changes due to a woman's menstrual cycle may have the appearance of cancer
      on MR images, a biopsy (generally performed under ultrasound-guidance) of the suspicious mass
      is required for definitive diagnosis. However, only a limited percentage of MRI-visible
      lesions are also visible on ultrasound (US). Even if found, it is often unclear whether the
      lesion identified on US corresponds to the MRI-detected lesion in question. The investigators
      have developed a visualization tool to assist the visualization of MRI-detected lesions in
      US-guided procedures (e.g., biopsy). This tool provides a simultaneous display of the
      previously acquired MRI data alongside real-time US images. The investigators propose a pilot
      study to assess the usefulness of this tool in identifying MRI-detected lesions using
      real-time US-guidance.

        Patients clinically suspicious for breast cancer will undergo the standard bilateral MRI
        protocol, with the patient in the prone position and both breasts immobilized. Patients
        with a BIRADS reading of 4 or 5 based on the initial MRI are called back for a second-look
        US examination to determine if the lesion can be found using US imaging. If the lesion is
        occult to US during this second-look examination, the radiologist may recommend a follow-up
        high-resolution unilateral MRI to further characterize the lesion.

        For this feasibility study, 10 patients with MRI-identified lesions that cannot be
        visualized under the second-look ultrasound examination, and who will undergo the
        recommended unilateral MRI follow-up will be asked to participate in our research study.
