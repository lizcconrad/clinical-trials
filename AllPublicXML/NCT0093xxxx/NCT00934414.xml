      MKC-TI-016 is a parallel, prospective, controlled, open-label, 1-period, single-dose trial
      utilizing a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure to evaluate the bioavailability and
      bioeffect of inhaled TI Inhalation Powder in type 2 diabetic subjects who smoke compared to
      nonsmoking type 2 diabetic subjects.

             factor when taking trial medication.

          -  ALT or AST &gt; 3 times the upper limit of the normal reference range.
