      The hypotheses that will be studied are:

      H0: Providers trained by a web based application for skill competency in basic life support
      (BLS) and automated external defibrillation (AED) are as competent as those who were trained
      by certified instructors using the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) curriculum

      H00-1: Providers who trained themselves with the used of web based training are more
      competent when they had a personal manikin for home exercise compared to providers who
      trained themselves with only a web based training

      H0-2: Providers who did not receive any training will score lower than those who did.

      Research questions for this study are:

        1. What are the results in skill competency for non trained people?

        2. What are the results in skill competency for trained people immediately after training?

        3. What is the retention of skills for trained and non trained people after six months?
