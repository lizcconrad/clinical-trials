    <textblock>
      This multicenter study will determine the response rate, the complete response rate, duration
      of response, time to progression, time-to-treatment failure, safety, and survival following
      treatment with Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody for the retreatment of patients with non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma who previously responded with a duration of response of at least 3 months to
      Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody therapy. Patients will undergo two phases of study. In the first
      phase, patients will receive a dosimetric dose of unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody (450 mg)
      followed by Anti-B1 Antibody (35 mg) which has been radiolabeled with 5 mCi of Iodine-131.
      Whole body gamma camera scans will be obtained after the dosimetric dose and data from three
      imaging time points will be used to calculate a patient-specific dose to deliver the desired
      total body dose of radiotherapy. In the second phase, patients will receive the therapeutic
      dose of unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody (450 mg) followed by 35 mg of Anti-B1 Antibody labeled
      with the patient-specific dose to deliver the desired whole body dose of radiation. Patients
      will be treated with thyroid blocking medication at least 24 hours prior to the first
      infusion and continuing for 14 days following the last infusion.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Complete Response and Confirmed Complete Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 months until disease progression, death, or for 2 years following the dosimetric dose, whichever occurred first (average of 80.2 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Complete response (CR) is defined as the complete resolution of all disease-related radiological abnormalities and the disappearance of all signs and symptoms related to the disease. Response is defined as the best response achieved at any evaluation. A confirmed response is defined as a response that was confirmed by two separate response evaluations occurring at least 4 weeks apart.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response for All Confirmed Responders (CR + CCR + PR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 months until disease progression, death, or for 2 years following the dosimetric dose, whichever occurred first (average of 80.2 months)</time_frame>
    <description>For participants with CR, clinical CR (CCR), or partial response (PR), duration of response is defined as the time from the first documented response to the first documented progression. CCR is defined as the complete resolution of all disease-related symptoms, but residual foci, thought to be residual scar tissue, are present. Generally, an unchanging lesion &lt;=2 centimeters (cm) in diameter by radiographic evaluation or &lt;=1 cm in diameter by physical examination can be considered scar tissue. The extent of disease must be unchanged or decreased upon follow-up evaluations and, if unchanged or if further decreases for 6 months or longer are present, the participant will then be reclassified as a CR (complete resolution of all disease-related radiological abnormalities and the disappearance of all signs and symptoms related to the disease). PR is defined as a &gt;=50% reduction in the sum of the products of the longest perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions, with no new lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 months until disease progression, death, or for 2 years following the dosimetric dose, whichever occurred first (average of 80.2 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (time to progression or death) is defined as the time from the start of retreatment (i.e., the dosimetric dose) to the first documented progression or death. Disease Progression (PD) is defined as a &gt;=25% increase from the nadir value of the sum of the products of the longest perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions or the appearance of any new lesion. Individual lesions must be grater than 2 cm diameter by radiographic evaluation or grater than 1 cm diameter by physical examination.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Treatment Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 months until disease progression, death, or for 2 years following the dosimetric dose, whichever occurred first (average of 80.2 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to treatment failure is defined as the time from the dosimetric dose to the first occurrence of treatment withdrawal, a decision to receive additional therapy, study withdrawal, disease progression, or death.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 months until disease progression, death, or for 2 years following the dosimetric dose, whichever occurred first (average of 80.2 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to death (overall survival) is defined as the time from the start of retreatment (i.e., the dosimetric dose) to the date of death from any cause.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 months until disease progression, death, or for 2 years following the dosimetric dose, whichever occurred first (average of 80.2 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is defined as those events that were fatal or immediately life-threatening, and those events that resulted in hospitalization; prolonged an existing hospitalization; or resulted in disability, congenital anomaly, or cancer. Refer to the general AE/SAE module for a complete list of all AEs and SAEs.</description>

        <title>Duration of Response for All Confirmed Responders (CR + CCR + PR)</title>
        <description>For participants with CR, clinical CR (CCR), or partial response (PR), duration of response is defined as the time from the first documented response to the first documented progression. CCR is defined as the complete resolution of all disease-related symptoms, but residual foci, thought to be residual scar tissue, are present. Generally, an unchanging lesion &lt;=2 centimeters (cm) in diameter by radiographic evaluation or &lt;=1 cm in diameter by physical examination can be considered scar tissue. The extent of disease must be unchanged or decreased upon follow-up evaluations and, if unchanged or if further decreases for 6 months or longer are present, the participant will then be reclassified as a CR (complete resolution of all disease-related radiological abnormalities and the disappearance of all signs and symptoms related to the disease). PR is defined as a &gt;=50% reduction in the sum of the products of the longest perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions, with no new lesions.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Any Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and Adverse Event (AE)</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is defined as those events that were fatal or immediately life-threatening, and those events that resulted in hospitalization; prolonged an existing hospitalization; or resulted in disability, congenital anomaly, or cancer. Refer to the general AE/SAE module for a complete list of all AEs and SAEs.</description>

            <description>Participants were treated with a saturated solution of potassium iodide (KI), Lugol’s solution, or KI tablets orally starting at least 24 hours prior to the first infusion of Iodine I-131 Tositumomab (TST) and continuing for 14 days following the last infusion of Iodine I-131 TST. Participants received treatment in two phases. The dosimetric dose was administered in Phase 1 as 450 milligrams (mg) of TST infused over 1 hour, followed by 35 mg of antibody containing 5 millicurie (mCi) of Iodine I-131 TST infused over 20 minutes (min), followed by a 10-min normal saline flush. The therapeutic dose, administered 7–14 days after the dosimetric dose, was administered as 450 mg of TST infused over 1 hour, followed by 35 mg of antibody radiolabeled with enough Iodine I-131 TST to deliver 75 centigrey (cGy) infused over 20 min, followed by a 10-min normal saline flush.</description>
