      Cleft lip and palate patients normally present with a sunken face due to collapse in the
      middle part of the face and inability of the upper and lower teeth to meet during chewing.
      This situation constitutes a serious aesthetic and mastication problem. A single surgical
      operation known as orthognathic surgery was traditionally performed to move the upper jaw
      forward to a more normal position and allow chewing function to be regained. However, due to
      scar tissue from the original surgical repair of the cleft palate, this procedure is known to
      be unstable causing bone to rapidly go back to its original position. A new concept of moving
      the upper jaw bone gradually by 1mm per day using a special device attached to the bone
      called distraction osteogenesis was established in 1996. Animal studies have shown that this
      technique can produce stable results with minimal relapse. The feasibility of correcting
      cleft deformities by gradual distraction has been confirmed by our own clinical studies. The
      aim of this study (which is the first of its kind) is to conduct a prospective randomized
      controlled study and compare the treatment outcomes of the current standard (orthognathic
      surgery) with distraction osteogenesis (gradual bone movement). The objectives focus on four
      aspects: morbidity, stability, speech function and psychological impact. The results from
      this study will clarify several clinical dilemmas in decision making when choosing whether to
      use orthognathic surgery or distraction osteogenesis in the treatment of cleft lip and palate
      patients. In addition, it will also inform our multidisciplinary research team to improve the
      total care of the cleft lip and palate patients.

      Gradual bone distraction of the midface in cleft palate patients is more stable, less
      detrimental to speech, and no more troublesome to the patient than conventional osteotomy and
      bone transposition (orthognathic surgery).

      Maxillary hypoplasia leading to sunken midface is a common developmental problem in CLP
      patients and is related to a combination of congenital reduction in midfacial growth and the
      surgical scar from the repair of the cleft palate. Therefore CLP patients commonly present
      with short midface and narrow hard palate and severe malocclusion.

      Conventional orthognathic surgery can advance, expand and lengthen the maxilla to a normal
      position in relation to the skull and the occlusion. However, such immediate surgical
      transposition of the cleft maxilla is technically difficult due to the severe deformity
      demanding large surgical movement and the tension from the palatal scar. Studies have
      demonstrated that the repositioned maxilla is rather unstable in the long term. In addition,
      velopharyngeal competence could be compromised by this immediate advancement technique
      resulting in abnormally nasal speech.

      The feasibility of gradual lengthening of the under-developed mandible in syndromal patients
      by distraction osteogenesis has been proven. The gradual movement of the maxilla activated by
      the implanted distractors can theoretically overcome the tension from the palatal scar and
      the soft palate musculature. This may reduce the long term skeletal relapse of the cleft
      maxilla and the speech distortion. On the other hand, the distraction procedures involve the
      surgical insertion and removal operations and the retention of the devices over a two month
      period. This may increase the chance of infection, social inconvenience and ultimately affect
      the patient's satisfaction.
