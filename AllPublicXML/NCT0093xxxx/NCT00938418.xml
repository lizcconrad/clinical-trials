  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer can be treated successfully with chemotherapy and
      radiation. However, the cure rate is low.

      This study is carried out to find out whether giving radiotherapy at a higher dose over fewer
      treatment sessions with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) can improve the treatment
      outcome.

      This study aims to recruit 43 patients from National University Hospital and Tan Tock Seng
      Hospital over a period of about 2 years.
