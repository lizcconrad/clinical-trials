    <textblock>
      The Lung HIV goal is to facilitate the data and specimen collection efforts of eight
      individual HIV and pulmonary studies that operate under the direction of the NHLBI. The Lung
      HIV study will build on existing studies to facilitate the start-up of new projects to
      further the understanding of the relationship between pulmonary disease and HIV infection.
      There is only one clinical trial being performed in this network at Ohio State University and
      it will be reported here.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Men and women at the AIDS Clinical Trials Unit(ACTU) will be eligible to participate if
        they meet four criteria: (a) 18 years of age and older; and (b) diagnosis of HIV; and (c)
        self-reported smoking on a daily basis; and (d) provide informed written consent.

        Exclusion criteria

        Persons who meet one or more of the following criteria will be excluded from the study: (a)
        persons with active psychosis or impaired mental status as judged by the clinic staff and
        confirmed with a Mini-Mental Status Exam); (b) unable to understand spoken English; (c) age
        less than 18 years.

        Rationale: Persons with cognitive impairment may participate in the study if they are able
        to provide consent and answer questionnaire questions. No reason is identified to exclude
        persons with this characteristic. No special risks are posed to cognitively impaired
        persons who are able to provide consent. Persons who have active psychoses or impaired
        mental status as judged by the clinic staff and confirmed with a Mini-Mental Status Exam
        are not able to provide informed written consent and are unlikely to benefit from the
        treatment. These persons will be referred to appropriate mental health services and invited
        to participate when their mental status has improved.

        Persons who are unable to understand spoken English would not be able to complete the
        assessments or benefit from the treatments. Less than 1% of the clinic population will be
        excluded on this basis. However, persons excluded from the study on this basis will be
        referred for standard smoking cessation treatment delivered in their native tongue. These
        community resources may be identified through the Ohio State University Nursing Center for
        Tobacco Intervention.

        Younger adolescents (&lt;18 years) will not be invited to participate in the study because we
        believe that they require treatments that are qualitatively different from those designed
        for older adolescents and adults. The treatments that will be evaluated in the proposed
        research are well suited to older adolescents and adults, but not developmentally tailored
        to younger adolescents. Less than 1% of the clinic population will be excluded on this
        basis. Most HIV+ children living in Columbus, Ohio receive HIV medical care through the
        F.A.C.E.S. outpatient clinic at Columbus Children's Hospital. Standard, age appropriate,
        smoking cessation treatment is available through the Health and Wellness Center at Columbus
        Children's Hospital. In the unlikely circumstance that a child &lt;18 years of age wishes to
        participate in the proposed study, s/he will be referred to Health and Wellness Center at
        Children's Hospital for treatment or the Ohio State University Nursing Center for Tobacco
        Intervention for age appropriate smoking cessation community resources.

        Pregnant women may not be included as subjects. While smoking during pregnancy is an
        important modifiable cause of poor pregnancy outcomes, little information is available on
        the safety or efficacy of varenicline. Therefore, participants who are pregnant will be
        excluded as subjects. Also, women who are breast-feeding will be excluded.

        Other persons who are unable to use varenicline will be allowed to participate in the study
        but will not receive the varenicline component of treatment. A history and physical
        examination will be conducted as a component of the baseline evaluation.

        People that have kidney problems or undergo kidney dialysis will not take the study drug,
        but will be given the option to take nicotine replacement therapy.

        All persons excluded from the study will have the opportunity to receive smoking cessation
        treatment. We will provide referrals for treatment as clinically indicated.
