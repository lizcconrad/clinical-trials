      Objective of the study is to show, on an exploratory basis, that treatment with SUBLIVAC
      Birch is also effective compared to treatment with Staloral Birch by means of reduction in
      allergic symptoms during nasal provocation in subjects suffering from IgE mediated allergic
      complaints triggered by birch pollen.

    <description>Start with 1 drop daily of SUBLIVAC Birch and increase by 1 drop daily, until the maintenance dose of 5 drops is reached. This maintenance dose should then be taken daily. Or 1 puff of Staloral Birch 10 I.R./ml on day one, 2 puffs on day two and increase by 2 puffs until at day six 10 puffs are reached. At day seven 1 puff of Staloral Birch 300 I.R./ml is taken, at day eight 2 puffs and day nine 4 puffs. From then on 4 puffs daily are taken.
Route of administration: Sublingual application. Drops (for SUBLIVAC Birch) or puffs (for Staloral Birch) are to be held underneath the tongue and then will be swallowed.
