        Patients with cardiovascular disease (acquired or congenital; cyanotic or acyanotic;
        unrepaired, palliated or fully repaired) requiring cardiac catheterization to diagnose or
        treat the disease will be eligible for study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is male or female;

          -  The subject is of any racial or ethnic group;

          -  The subject is between 0 days and 12 years of age;

          -  Is less than 40 kg;

          -  The subject is scheduled for a cardiac catheterization for treatment or diagnosis of a
             cardiovascular disease;

          -  The scheduled cardiac catheterization includes catheter placements in the central
             venous circulation and central arterial circulation, or catheter placement in the
             central venous circulation with a pre-existing arterial catheter;

          -  The subject is American Society Anesthesiologist (ASA) status 1 through 4; and

          -  The subject's legally authorized representative has given written informed consent to
             participate in the study and, when appropriate, the subject has given assent to
             participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is greater than twelve (12) years of age;

          -  Has pre-existing allergies to adhesive tapes or adhesives on neonatal ECG pads;

          -  Has pre-existing skin condition at the site where the Nonin cerebral oximeter sensor
             will be placed (e.g., eczema, dermatitis);

          -  Has craniofacial disease preventing application of the sensor to the forehead;

          -  Has sickle cell anemia or other hemoglobinopathy;

          -  Has disease of the cerebrovasculature including the jugular or carotid vessels;

          -  Was previously on ECMO involving the carotid or jugular vessels that could have
             resulted in disease or ligation;

          -  Is not able to be in a supine position with cardiac catheterization laboratory table
             angle zero degrees with a neutral neck position at zero degrees rotation;

          -  Has acute neurological injury (seizure, stroke, encephalopathy, meningoencephalitis
             currently or within the past 10 days), or a structural brain lesion (eg, arteriovenous
             malformation, cyst) in the optical field beneath the sensor;

          -  Has an emergency, life-threatening condition (American Society of Anesthesiologists
             Physical status 5 or 6) impacting the ability to obtain informed consent;

          -  Or has another condition, which in the opinion of the principal investigator would not
             be suitable for participation in the study.
