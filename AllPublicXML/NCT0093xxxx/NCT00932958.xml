      This protocol describes an observational study whose goal is to collect de-identified
      Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) acquisition factors and interpretations (findings) from
      several hundred U.S. and international imaging facilities. The study uses an electronic data
      capture tool to collect de-identified CCTA utilization parameters and clinical findings in
      order to create a multi-center registry. This registry will be used for scientific analysis
      and publication of pertinent medical trends such as CT utilization, radiation dose, and
      common cardiovascular findings. The registry will be used to determine areas of interest for
      future randomized controlled trials.

      All data will be collected with patient identifiers removed and in complete accordance with
      HIPAA regulations. All data will be analyzed in aggregate, thus further minimizing the risk
      of patient confidentiality violations.
