      The purpose of this study is to test a class for Queens Cancer Center patients. We want to
      find out if patients think this program is helpful.

    <textblock>
      It is well accepted that effective physician-patient communication is associated with
      important outcomes. Communication training interventions for oncologists and other clinicians
      has been shown to be effective in changing behavior and improving outcomes. Less attention
      has been given to improving cancer patients' communication with their physicians. Most of the
      studies in this area have been focused on activating patients through training them to ask
      questions. Although question asking is a vitally important patient communication skill, other
      patient communication skills should also be encouraged for patients.

      In the primary care setting, studies on patient communication training have focused on three
      additional communication skills to asking questions: presenting information, checking
      understanding, and expressing concerns. The goal of this study is to pilot test a patient
      communication workshop that builds on the work done in the primary care setting, offering an
      intervention that focuses on a broad range of skills. The proposal aims to improve
      communication skills in an underserved population, which may be a factor contributing to
      minority health disparities.
