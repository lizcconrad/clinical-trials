  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reminiscence is the systematic use of memories and recollections to strengthen self-identity
      and self-worth. The study aim was to investigate the consequences for nursing home residents
      and staff of integrating reminiscence into daily nursing care. Ten nursing homes were
      randomised into either an Intervention Group, who implemented reminiscence, or a Control
      Group, who continued with usual care. Data were collected at baseline and again 6 and 12
      months after the intervention start. Results suggested that use of reminiscence can improve
      residents' quality of life and possibly delay progression in dementia symptoms. Nursing staff
      can experience greater satisfaction with personal and professional roles and develop a more
      positive view of the residents.
