    <textblock>
      This observational study is conducted in Europe. The aim of this observational study is to
      investigate the changes in a score (GET-score) which includes quality of life, body
      composition and cholesterol metabolism in patients on growth hormone treatment. The GET score
      stands for: Growth hormone deficiency and Efficacy of Treatment, and is a quantitative
      measurement of the efficacy of the treatment with growth hormone in adults.
