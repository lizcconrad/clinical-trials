    <textblock>
      Randomized, two arms, open study in order to evaluate treatment satisfaction of using OmniPod
      system compared with conventional insulin pump in adults with type 1 diabetes.

      The study will include two consecutive 12 weeks treatment periods. According to
      randomization, each patient will be treated consecutively with both treatment arms: 12 weeks
      with OmniPod system and than 12 weeks with patient's previous insulin pump or vice versa.

      A Randomized, two arms, open, crossover study in order to evaluate treatment satisfaction of
      using OmniPod system compared with conventional insulin pump in adults with type 1 diabetes.

      The study will include two consecutive 12 weeks treatment periods. According to
      randomization, each patient will be treated consecutively with both treatment arms: 12 weeks
      with OmniPod system and than 12 weeks with patient's previous insulin pump or vice versa.

      Study will consist of 4 clinic visits taking place at -2,0,12 and 24 weeks and additional 4
      telephone visits taking place at 4,8,16 and 20 weeks. In addition, patients will be invited
      one week prior to visit 5 and visit 8 in order to insert a continuous glucose sensor.
      Patients will complete DTSQ and Comfort &amp; Function questionnaires at weeks 0, 12 and 24,
      before and at the end of each study arm.

      On each clinical visits the following parameters will be evaluated: vital signs, HbA1c, 4 and
      7 points glucose profile, hypoglycemia events, hyperglycemia events and pump related
      technical problems.

      The telephone visits will include pump related technical problems solving and AE/SAE
      reporting.
