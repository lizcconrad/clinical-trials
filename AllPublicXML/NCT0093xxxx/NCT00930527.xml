  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no data regarding the use of supplements to alleviate the musculoskeletal pain and
      stiffness inducted by the use of aromatase inhibitors. This study is designated to test the
      safety and efficacy of omega 3 fatty acid supplementation to alleviate musculoskeletal pain
      in postmenopausal breast cancer patients.

      There are no data regarding the use of these supplements in other types of musculoskeletal
      pain and discomfort, namely AI induced joint pain and joint stiffness. Given the lack of
      effective treatments for AI induced joint pain/ stiffness and the safety and efficacy of
      omega 3 fatty acid for musculoskeletal pain, it is therefore reasonable to test the efficacy
      of these dietary supplements in a population of postmenopausal breast cancer patients who
      experience joint pain related to aromatase inhibitors. Since women with hormone receptor
      positive breast cancer require long term hormonal therapy, an important objective is
      minimizing long term side effects to enhance patient compliance and improve quality of life.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;21 years

          -  Postmenopausal status defined as cessation of menses for &gt;1 year or FSH &gt;20 mIU/mL or
             bilateral oophorectomy.

          -  History of stage I, II or III hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, without
             metastatic disease

          -  Currently taking a third-generation aromatase inhibitor for at least 3 months

          -  Clinical symptoms of knee and/or hand joint pain and/or stiffness for at least 3
             months prior to study entry

          -  Ongoing musculoskeletal pain/stiffness in hand and/or knee joints (50 or higher on the
             100 point global assessment VAS) that started or increased since initiating aromatase
             inhibitor therapy, and has been present for at least 3 months.

          -  Patients must agree to refrain from use of omega-3-fatty acid from sources outside of
             this study

          -  If taking bisphosphonates, on a stable dose for at least 1 month and tolerating the
             dose. Patients must agree to refrain from initiating bisphosphonate use during the
             course of the study, therefore it is recommended that routine bone density testing be
             performed prior to enrollment or after completing trial.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2.

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of omega-3-fatty acid within the past three (3) months

          -  Concurrent medical/arthritic disease that could confound or interfere with evaluation
             of pain or efficacy including: Inflammatory arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis,
             systemic lupus, spondyloarthropathy, psoriatic arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica),
             gout, episodes of acute monarticular arthritis clinically consistent with pseudogout,
             Paget's disease affecting the study joint, a history of septic arthritis or avascular
             necrosis or intra-articular fracture of the study joint, Wilson's disease,
             hemochromatosis, alkaptonuria, or primary osteochondromatosis.

          -  History of significant collateral ligament, anterior cruciate ligament or meniscal
             injury of the index joint requiring surgery or non-weight bearing (requiring use of
             crutches or cane) for more than 3 weeks (minor ligamentous injury prior to 6 months is
             not an exclusion).

          -  History of bone fracture or surgery of the afflicted knees and/or hands within 6
             months prior to study entry.

          -  History of any illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the
             results of the study or pose additional risk to the patient.

          -  Allergy to, or history of significant clinical or laboratory adverse experience
             associated with omega-3 fatty acid

                  study.

               3. Administration of intra-articular steroids to the study joint, within 3 months of
                  Randomization Visit.

               4. Administration of intra-articular steroids to any other joint, within 3 months of
                  Randomization Visit.

          -  Intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid or congeners into the study joint within
             12 months.

          -  Topical analgesics (e.g., capsaicin preparations) to the study joint, or any oral
