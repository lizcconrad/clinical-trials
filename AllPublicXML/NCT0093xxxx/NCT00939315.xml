      The aim of this study is to establish the diagnostic value of
      O-(2-[18F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET-CT, [18F]-fluorocholine (FCH) and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) combined with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in patients with
      suspected cerebral glioma using neuronavigated biopsies with histopathological analysis as
      reference.

      The objectives of the study are:

        -  To demonstrate if the multimodal approach, combining the morphological aspect of the MRI
           with the metabolic aspect of the tumor with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and
           O-(2-[18F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) or 18F]-fluorocholine (FCH) PET/CTthe FCH
           allows to improve the location of a active metabolic tumor and its impact on the ideal
           choice of sampling biopsy.

        -  To underline the differences and similarities between MRS and 18F]-fluorocholine PET /
           CT in the assessment of metabolism of the choline. To establish the diagnosis value of
           both methods, separately and in combination.

        -  To determine which examinations are useful and complementary for the diagnosis and the
           management of gliomes.

      FET combined with MRS may be a powerful, widely applicable new method to improve the
      diagnosis of cerebral gliomas. The extent to which FCH and MRS provide similar information is
      not known precisely and this study will establish their respective diagnostic value in
      differentiating tumoral from non-tumoral tissue.
