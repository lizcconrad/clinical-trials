  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether sleep-wake changes of luteinizing hormone
      pulse frequency are different in early pubertal girls with high testosterone levels compared
      to early pubertal girls with normal testosterone levels.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During early puberty, luteinizing hormone (LH) pulse frequency normally increases during
      sleep. In contrast, preliminary data suggest that obese girls (who have high testosterone
      levels in general) demonstrate low LH frequency during the day and night during early
      puberty; but at mid puberty rapidly transition to a high LH frequency during the day and
      night. We hypothesize that in early pubertal girls with high testosterone levels, overnight
      increases of LH frequency are less prominent than those observed in early pubertal girls with
      normal testosterone levels. We will assess this using a frequent sampling protocol for
      assessment of LH pulse frequency (with sampling occurring while awake and while asleep) in
      early pubertal girls with and without high testosterone levels. Sleep will be formally
      evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Early to midpubertal girls (late Tanner 1 [i.e., estradiol &gt; 20 pg/ml] to Tanner 3)

          -  Premenarcheal

          -  Approximate ages, 8-15 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  BMI-for-age &lt; 5th percentile

          -  Inability to comprehend what will be done during the study or why it will be done

          -  Being a study of GnRH pulse regulation in adolescent girls with and without HA, boys
             are excluded

          -  Obesity associated with a diagnosed (genetic) syndrome (e.g., Prader-Willi syndrome,
             leptin deficiency), obesity related to medications (e.g., glucocorticoids), etc.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Virilization

          -  Total testosterone &gt; 150 ng/dl (confirmed on repeat)

          -  DHEAS &gt; upper limit of age-appropriate normal range (confirmed on repeat) (mild
             elevations may be seen in adolescent HA, and elevations &lt; 1.5 times the

             possibility of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. NOTE: If an elevated follicular
             17-hydroxyprogesterone is confirmed on repeat testing, an ACTH stimulated
             17-hydroxyprogesterone &lt; 1000 ng/dl will be required for study participation

             etc.)

          -  Persistent liver test abnormalities (confirmed on repeat), with the exception that
             mild bilirubin elevations will be accepted in the setting of known Gilbert's syndrome

          -  Persistently abnormal sodium, potassium, or elevated creatinine concentration
             (confirmed on repeat)

          -  Bicarbonate concentrations &lt; 20 or &gt; 30 (confirmed on repeat)

             inpatient GCRC study (or in the 2 months prior to screening)

               -  Such medications include oral contraceptive pills, progestins, metformin,
                  glucocorticoids, psychotropics, and sympathomimetics/stimulants (e.g.,
                  methylphenidate)

               -  Patients taking restricted medications will be excluded unless written permission
                  (for the subjects to discontinue the medication) is received from the subject's
                  physician

          -  Weight &lt; 22 kg is an absolute exclusion criterion (to ensure safe blood withdrawal)
