  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Addiction treatment is often characterized by long delays between first contact and treatment
      as well as high no-show and drop out rates leading to unused capacity in apparently full
      agencies. Patients do not get needed care and agency financial stability is threatened. The
      Network for Improvement of Addiction Treatment (NIATx) began as a high-intensity improvement
      collaborative of 39 addiction treatment agencies distributed across 25 states. NIATx
      substantially improved time to treatment and continuation in treatment by making improvements
      to organizational processes (such as first contact, intake and assessment, engagement, level
      of care transitions, paperwork, social support, outreach, and scheduling) in preliminary
      studies. While the results are very encouraging, they have, by intent, been obtained from a
      select group of agencies using a high-cost combination of services. A more practical
      diffusion model is needed to spread process improvements across the spectrum of treatment
      agencies. This study is a cluster-randomized trial to test the effectiveness and cost of less
      expensive combinations of the services that make up the NIATx collaborative (interest
      circles, coach calls, coach visits and learning sessions).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This cluster-RCT randomly assign 201 treatment agencies in 5 states to four experimental
      arms. The agencies were randomized to an intervention for 18 months with a 9 month
      sustainability period. The study aimed to: 1) Determine whether a state-based strategy can
      (with NIATx support) can lead mainstream treatment agencies to implement and sustain process
      changes that improve the study's primary outcomes: time to treatment, annual clinic
      admissions, and continuation in treatment; and 2) Evaluate the effectiveness and cost of the
      services making up NIATx. This study aims to create a practical model for improving
      efficiency and effectiveness of addiction treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Average Waiting Time From First Contact to Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>The average length of time in days it takes from when a patient first calls for help to the time a patient was able to meet a clinician. In this quality improvement study, changes in this measure over time are reported. Estimates of improvement show the average days of improvement per month based on a best linear unbiased predictor estimate for each site.
Note: this study has three primary outcomes. The number of participants analyzed varies for each outcome. The (higher) number of clinics shown in the flow diagram results because clinics may have been analyzed on a subset of the three primary outcomes (e.g., analyzed for waiting time and continuation, but not for annual number of new patients). To be considered &quot;analyzed&quot; in the flow diagram, a clinic must have been included in at least one primary outcomes analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Annual Number of Patient Admissions</measure>
    <time_frame>48 months (2 year baseline period and 2 year post-intervention period)</time_frame>
    <description>We aimed to increase clinics' treatment capacity in this quality improvement study. Capacity was measured by counting clinics' annual number of patient admissions. We monitored changes in admission counts, per clinic, in a pre-post analysis. Changes in the natural logarithm of annual admissions are presented, which approximates the average percentage change (year-to-year) in the number of new patient admissions per clinic.
Note: this study has three primary outcomes. The number of participants analyzed varies for each outcome. The (higher) number of clinics shown in the flow diagram results because clinics may have been analyzed on a subset of the three primary outcomes (e.g., analyzed for waiting time and continuation, but not for annual number of new patients). To be considered &quot;analyzed&quot; in the flow diagram, a clinic must have been included in at least one primary outcomes analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Average Continuation Rate Through the Fourth Treatment Session</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 21 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome represents change in the rate at which a clinic's patients continue in treatment. Continuation rate is defined as the percentage of patients that make at least 4 visits to the clinic, on different days, before being discharged. Estimates of improvement show the average percentage points of improvement per month based on a best linear unbiased predictor estimate for each site.
Note: this study has three primary outcomes. The number of participants analyzed varies for each outcome. The (higher) number of clinics shown in the flow diagram results because clinics may have been analyzed on a subset of the three primary outcomes (e.g., analyzed for waiting time and continuation, but not for annual number of new patients). To be considered &quot;analyzed&quot; in the flow diagram, a clinic must have been included in at least one primary outcomes analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost of Group</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The goal of the economic analysis was to estimate costs of each group for governmental authorities who might organize improvement collaboratives. We collected the cost of personnel (state employees, NIATx employees, coaches and consultants), data management, buildings and facilities, lodging, travel, telephone calls and miscellaneous costs. Costs were categorized as group specific (such as hotel costs for the learning sessions group) or non-group-specific, which included state-incurred costs for outreach, data management and infrastructure, encouraging participation and administration. Cost data were collected three times during the study period and aggregated to create a total cost estimate. Figures reported below represent costs at the arm/group level (costs were not assessed at the organizational level). Measure type is &quot;Number.&quot;</description>

    <description>Interest Circles are monthly teleconferences where agency change leaders discuss change-related issues and progress. Circles address how to improve timeliness, continuation, admissions, dropouts and transitions. They also address specialty topics (e.g., programs for women, adolescents). Participants discuss successes, failures, and challenges, and get advice and assignments for their improvement plans. Meeting summaries appear on the Web site. Interest Circles are inexpensive, but are they are sufficient? Should Interest Circles prove effective, they would provide a low-cost, convenient diffusion approach.</description>

          <title>Interest Circle Call + Website</title>
          <description>Interest Circles are monthly teleconferences where agency change leaders discuss change-related issues and progress. Circles address how to improve timeliness, continuation, admissions, dropouts and transitions. They also address specialty topics (e.g., programs for women, adolescents). Participants discuss successes, failures, and challenges, and get advice and assignments for their improvement plans. Meeting summaries appear on the Web site. Interest Circles are inexpensive, but are they are sufficient? Should Interest Circles prove effective, they would provide a low-cost, convenient diffusion approach.</description>

          <title>Coaching + Website</title>
          <description>Coaching assigns an expert in process improvement to work with an agency to make, sustain, and spread process improvement efforts. Consultations focus on executive directors, change leaders and improvement teams. Coaches help agencies address key issues, but also broker relationships with other agencies, offer process improvement training, and promote the innovations to make and how to make them. Coaching takes place during site visits, monthly phone conferences, and via email.</description>

          <title>Learning Session + Website</title>
          <description>Learning Sessions occur bi-annually as change teams convene to learn and gather support from each other and outside experts who offer advice on how best to adopt the innovations and learn about new directions for the collaborative (e.g., the need to create business cases for improvements). Learning Sessions and Interest Circles (see below) have similar objectives—to help agencies learn and gather support from each other and from outside experts.</description>

          <title>Rating of management quality</title>
          <description>The management score resulted from a telephone interview of a senior leader at each clinic that assessed management quality across 14 subscales grouped into four areas: intake and retention; quality monitoring and reviewing, including performance tracking and review; (3) targets, including the realism and transparency of program goals; and (4) employee incentives, which includes promotion criteria, pay and bonuses. Each subscale was rated between 1 and 5, with a higher score indicating better management. Subscales were averaged together for an overall management rating ranging from 1-5.</description>

        <title>Change in Average Waiting Time From First Contact to Treatment</title>
        <description>The average length of time in days it takes from when a patient first calls for help to the time a patient was able to meet a clinician. In this quality improvement study, changes in this measure over time are reported. Estimates of improvement show the average days of improvement per month based on a best linear unbiased predictor estimate for each site.
Note: this study has three primary outcomes. The number of participants analyzed varies for each outcome. The (higher) number of clinics shown in the flow diagram results because clinics may have been analyzed on a subset of the three primary outcomes (e.g., analyzed for waiting time and continuation, but not for annual number of new patients). To be considered &quot;analyzed&quot; in the flow diagram, a clinic must have been included in at least one primary outcomes analysis.</description>

            <description>Interest Circles are monthly teleconferences where agency change leaders discuss change-related issues and progress. Circles address how to improve timeliness, continuation, admissions, dropouts and transitions. They also address specialty topics (e.g., programs for women, adolescents). Participants discuss successes, failures, and challenges, and get advice and assignments for their improvement plans. Meeting summaries appear on the Web site. Interest Circles are inexpensive, but are they are sufficient? Should Interest Circles prove effective, they would provide a low-cost, convenient diffusion approach.</description>

            <description>Coaching assigns an expert in process improvement to work with an agency to make, sustain, and spread process improvement efforts. Consultations focus on executive directors, change leaders and improvement teams. Coaches help agencies address key issues, but also broker relationships with other agencies, offer process improvement training, and promote the innovations to make and how to make them. Coaching takes place during site visits, monthly phone conferences, and via email.</description>

        <title>Change in Annual Number of Patient Admissions</title>
        <description>We aimed to increase clinics' treatment capacity in this quality improvement study. Capacity was measured by counting clinics' annual number of patient admissions. We monitored changes in admission counts, per clinic, in a pre-post analysis. Changes in the natural logarithm of annual admissions are presented, which approximates the average percentage change (year-to-year) in the number of new patient admissions per clinic.
Note: this study has three primary outcomes. The number of participants analyzed varies for each outcome. The (higher) number of clinics shown in the flow diagram results because clinics may have been analyzed on a subset of the three primary outcomes (e.g., analyzed for waiting time and continuation, but not for annual number of new patients).

        <title>Change in Average Continuation Rate Through the Fourth Treatment Session</title>
        <description>This outcome represents change in the rate at which a clinic's patients continue in treatment. Continuation rate is defined as the percentage of patients that make at least 4 visits to the clinic, on different days, before being discharged. Estimates of improvement show the average percentage points of improvement per month based on a best linear unbiased predictor estimate for each site.

          <title>Change in Average Continuation Rate Through the Fourth Treatment Session</title>
          <description>This outcome represents change in the rate at which a clinic's patients continue in treatment. Continuation rate is defined as the percentage of patients that make at least 4 visits to the clinic, on different days, before being discharged. Estimates of improvement show the average percentage points of improvement per month based on a best linear unbiased predictor estimate for each site.
Note: this study has three primary outcomes. The number of participants analyzed varies for each outcome. The (higher) number of clinics shown in the flow diagram results because clinics may have been analyzed on a subset of the three primary outcomes (e.g., analyzed for waiting time and continuation, but not for annual number of new patients). To be considered &quot;analyzed&quot; in the flow diagram, a clinic must have been included in at least one primary outcomes analysis.</description>

        <title>Cost of Group</title>
        <description>The goal of the economic analysis was to estimate costs of each group for governmental authorities who might organize improvement collaboratives. We collected the cost of personnel (state employees, NIATx employees, coaches and consultants), data management, buildings and facilities, lodging, travel, telephone calls and miscellaneous costs. Costs were categorized as group specific (such as hotel costs for the learning sessions group) or non-group-specific, which included state-incurred costs for outreach, data management and infrastructure, encouraging participation and administration. Cost data were collected three times during the study period and aggregated to create a total cost estimate. Figures reported below represent costs at the arm/group level (costs were not assessed at the organizational level). Measure type is &quot;Number.&quot;</description>

            <description>Interest Circles are monthly teleconferences where agency change leaders discuss change-related issues and progress. Circles address how to improve timeliness, continuation, admissions, dropouts and transitions. They also address specialty topics (e.g., programs for women, adolescents). Participants discuss successes, failures, and challenges, and get advice and assignments for their improvement plans. Meeting summaries appear on the Web site. Interest Circles are inexpensive, but are they are sufficient? Should Interest Circles prove effective, they would provide a low-cost, convenient diffusion approach.</description>
