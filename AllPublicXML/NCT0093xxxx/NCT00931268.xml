    <measure>Change From 6 Months to Baseline in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Pain After 15 Minutes of Sitting</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after treatment compared to baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Pain at sitting was evaluated using a 100 mm VAS with the descriptors 0 = &quot;no pain&quot; to the left and 100 = &quot;worst possible pain&quot; to the right. Pain was assessed by the subject after sitting 15 minutes on a standardized chair. The VAS pain at 6 months was compared to baseline and the change was calculated.</description>

    <description>Pain at sitting was evaluated using a 100 mm VAS with the descriptors 0 = &quot;no pain&quot; to the left and 100 = &quot;worst possible pain&quot; to the right. Pain was assessed by the subject after sitting 15 minutes on a standardized chair. The change in VAS pain was assessed at the time points 1, 3, 9, 12 and 18 months compared to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Assessed by MOS-HIV (Medical Outcome Study-HIV) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 6 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A physical health summary score and a mental health summary score was generated on a rating scale of 0 to 100 where higher scores indicate better health. The change in health summary scores were assessed at the time points 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months compared to baseline.</description>

    <description>Number of participants maintaining an improvement compared to baseline using the Global Esthetic Improvement Scale (GEIS) consisting of 5 grades (worse/no change/improved/much improved/very much improved), where the three latter indicates improvement. GEIS was assessed at the time points 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months compared to pre-treatment photos.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Gel Displacement Evaluated by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>MRI was performed at baseline and at 1, 6, 9, and 12 months to determine the implant volume, thickness, localization and the possible local displacement of the implant. At the 6, 9 and 12 month visits any displacement was evaluated with MRI by comparison to the 1-month position of the gel. The number of participants with gel displacement are shown below.</description>

    <measure>Time Until it Became Impossible to Stay Sitting</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 6 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of when (in minutes) it became impossible for the subject to stay in the sitting position on a standardized chair, at the time points 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months compared to baseline. In this analysis &quot;more than 60 minutes&quot; was handled as 60 minutes.</description>
