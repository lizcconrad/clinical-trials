      The investigators are testing the effects of a change in teaching attending physicians'
      rotations (from 4- to 2-week blocks) on patient outcomes (unplanned urgent visits to the
      health care system, inpatient mortality, and length-of-stay), the educational experiences of
      residents and medical students and on the quality of the professional lives of the attending
      physicians.
