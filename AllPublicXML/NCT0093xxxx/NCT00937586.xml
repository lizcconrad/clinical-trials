  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this research is to determine if certain genes increase the chance of
      developing prostate cancer and once diagnosed increase the chance of the prostate cancer
      spreading to other parts of the body.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DNA will be isolated from each person and then studied for the presence of certain genes that
      may increase the chance of developing prostate cancer. Certain genes will also be studied in
      patients with known prostate cancer to determine if they increase the chance of cancer
      spreading to other parts of the body and decrease one's chance of being cured. Small
      differences in genes can slightly affect their ability to function. While these differences
      are normal, they may influence the way the cancer responds to therapy. An understanding of
      which genes increase (or decrease) the chance of being cured of a disease, such as prostate
      cancer, will improve our ability to take care of patients more effectively.

      A second purpose of this study is to collect blood and cancer tissue for future studies.
      While the small differences in genes may be the best marker of bad cancer, it is also
      possible that proteins in blood or tumor may be a better marker.
