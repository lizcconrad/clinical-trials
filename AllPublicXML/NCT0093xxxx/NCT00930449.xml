  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary aim is to determine whether a computerized working memory (WM) training program
      will help students with severe learning and attention problems, in terms of improving their
      WM. Additional aims are to determine whether the WM training will also result in improvements
      in the students' concentration and school work, and how long any beneficial effects will last
      (i.e., whether the students will continue to show improvements once the training program has
      stopped).

      We have established a collaborative partnership between OISE, HSC, OPDS, and JVS to evaluate
      the effectiveness of a WM training program when conducted in a school setting. To determine
      whether the WM training program does improve WM, attention, behaviour, and/or academic
      achievement, we will compare its effects to those expected to result from two other
      intervention programs that focus on academic skills only: 1) a computerized software program
      known to improve math skills (Academy of Math®); and 2) extra, individualized tutoring in an
      area of academic weakness supervised by a trained and experienced staff person. We will
      assess WM, related cognitive abilities, ADHD symptoms, academic achievement, before and after
      intervention, and also at 3- and 6-month follow-up to determine whether any improvements are
      sustained and increased after the training has finished.

    <description>This program includes a set of visual-spatial and auditory-verbal WM tasks presented via the computer (see Appendix 1 for a description of these tasks). All tasks involve: a) maintenance of simultaneous mental representations of multiple stimuli; b) unique sequencing of stimulus order in each trial; and c) progressive adaptation of difficulty level as a function of individual performance.
Training will require about 30 minutes per day, 5 days per week, for 5-6 weeks: participants are required to complete 90 WM trials on each training day. Training plans are individualized and are modified according to performance, but the typical plan includes 13 tasks, with 15 trials of 8 tasks each day.</description>

    <description>This is an established evidence-based program designed to help at-risk learners (Grades K-12) develop mathematical proficiency by incorporating a mastery-learning approach to foster conceptual understanding, computational fluency, and strategic competency across 10 mathematical subject areas.
Training is will require about 30 minutes, 5 days per week, for the same duration as the WM program (5-6 weeks), with a counselor or teacher acting as the training aide.</description>
