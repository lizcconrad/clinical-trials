      The purpose of this study is to examine whether pedometer step count recommendations (10,000
      steps/day versus an adaptive recommendation) are differentially associated with the primary
      outcome of adherence to the pedometer-based physical activity regimen and the secondary
      outcomes of change in physical activity and body mass index (BMI).

    <textblock>
      Long-term promotion of physical activity is necessary to achieve obesity prevention. This
      represents a particular challenge for our intervention design, as few studies have
      demonstrated positive long-term physical activity promotion outcomes among Black women. We
      have demonstrated the utility of pedometers among low income, ethnically diverse populations.
      The efficacy of pedometer utilization for the prevention of weight gain, however, hinges on
      long-term utilization of the devices. We hypothesize that recommendation for the step count
      attainment may affect individual's long-term utilization of pedometers, as well as physical
      activity levels and BMI.

      This study is a 24-week experimental trial to examine whether intervention recommendations
      promote long-term adherence to a pedometer-based physical activity regimen. A two-group,
      block design will be used in the proposed study. Eligible women will be randomly assigned to
      one of two experimental conditions (n=75 per condition): 1) receiving a 10,000 steps/day
      recommendation and 3 health education sessions or 2) receiving an adaptive recommendation and
      an obesity prevention intervention. The adaptive step recommendation will update
      participants' recommended step counts, starting at 7,000 steps/day, then 8,000 steps/day,
      then finally 10,000 steps/day. Participants in the adaptive recommendation group will be
      provided with 3 educational sessions and will be asked to report their daily progress on
      weight maintenance goals via text message.

      Participants will be provided pedometers and will be asked to wear them every day of the
      24-week trial period.

      Assessments (including self-report survey and anthropometric measurements) will be conducted
      at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks post-baseline.

    <description>The adaptive recommendation will update the participant's recommended step count attainment from 7,000 to 8,000, then 10,000 steps/day. The SMS-based self-monitoring system will collect three data points each day from participants in this group: 1) total number of steps/d recorded by the pedometer during the previous day (steps/d); 2) performance on 2nd weight loss goal; and 3) performance on 3rd weight loss goal.</description>
