  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, randomized, controlled trial conducted in Emergency Departments (ED)
      compares computed tomography (CT) coronary angiography with the traditional approach (usual
      care) for low- to intermediate-risk chest pain patients. The primary objective is to estimate
      the rate of major cardiac events (heart attack or cardiac death) within 30 days in trial
      participants in Group B who were not found to have significant coronary artery disease by CT
      coronary angiography. Additional evaluations will comprise health care utilization
      assessments, including length of hospital stay and re-admissions, cost analysis, and 1-year
      post-triage/presentation major cardiac event rates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with potential ACS will be randomized to traditional &quot;rule out&quot;
      care (Group A) or to traditional care plus CT coronary angiography (Group B) in a ratio of
      1:2 traditional versus traditional plus CT coronary angiography.

      In Group A, all management and disposition decisions will be made by the healthcare providers
      caring for the participant. Participants will be admitted to hospital, admitted to cardiac
      diagnostic unit, or discharged to home. Diagnostic testing and treatment will be decided by
      the team caring for the participant. Follow up will comprise telephone interviews after 30
      days and 1 year from triage/presentation.

      In Group B, participants will receive initial cardiac troponin and creatinine blood tests.
      Upon return of normal laboratory values, the participants will receive a CT coronary
      angiography an estimated 90 minutes after the initial values assessment or as soon as the CT
      scanner is available. Participants with negative test results will be discharged; follow up
      will comprise telephone interviews after 30 days and 1 year from triage/presentation.
      Participants with positive test results will be admitted to the hospital for further
      management dictated by the admitting team.

    <description>In the traditional-care arm (Group A), all management and disposition decisions will be made by the healthcare providers caring for the participant.

    <description>In the study CT coronary angiography-based rapid &quot;rule out&quot; arm (Group B), participants will receive initial cardiac troponin and creatinine tests. Upon return of normal laboratory values (including a calculated creatinine clearance), the participants will receive a CT coronary angiography an estimated 90 minutes or as soon as the CT scanner is available following the initial values assessment. Participants with negative test results will be discharged unless other indications for admission per standard of care and follow up will comprise telephone interviews 30 days and 1 year after triage/presentation. Participants with positive test results will be admitted to the hospital for further management as dictated by the admitting team.</description>

    <description>CT coronary angiography will be performed without and with contrast in participants randomized to receive imaging as well as traditional care. (For applicable purposes, the decision to perform contrast-enhanced imaging in the presence of a large amount of calcium should be made according to procedures at each individual site.) The imaging test will be considered positive if the participant has a greater than 50% stenosis of the right coronary, left main, left anterior descending, or circumflex arteries or of their branches in contrast-enhanced CT coronary angiography. Results will be communicated to the responsible ED and treating staff immediately upon interpretation; ED staff will determine appropriate course of management. Negative results will result in patient discharge.</description>
