    <textblock>
      It is apparent that the head of a preterm infant should not be left uncovered, however it
      remains unclear whether covering the head of a preterm baby with plastic wrapping is
      effective in preventing heat loss.

      We conducted a prospective, randomised, controlled trial in very preterm infants to evaluate
      if a polyethylene cap prevents heat loss after delivery better than polyethylene occlusive
      wrapping and conventional drying. Furthermore, we assessed body temperature 1 hour after
      admission to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) to evaluate whether the polyethylene cap
      prevents postnatal heat loss.

      The primary outcome measure was axillary temperature taken on admission to the NICU
      (immediately after cap and wrap removal) and again 1 hour later. Axillary temperature was
      measured using a digital thermometer (Terumo Digital Clinical Thermometer C202, Terumo
      Corporation, Tokio, Japan). The occurrence of hypothermia, defined as axillary temperature
      less then 36.4Â°C, on NICU admission was also evaluated.

      Secondary outcomes included mortality prior to hospital discharge, presence of major brain
      injury (sonographic evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage with ventricular dilatation,
      parenchymal hemorrhagic infarction, or periventricular leukomalacia), tracheal intubation at
      birth, Apgar scores, delivery to admission time, blood gas analysis and serum glucose
      concentration on NICU admission.
