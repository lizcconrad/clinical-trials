    <measure>Abdominal Pain and Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movement (APC) Responder, 9 Out of 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A patient is considered to be a 9 out of 12 week APC responder if, for at least 9 out of the first 12 weeks of the treatment period, the patient had at least 3 CSBMs, had an increase of at least 1 CSBM from baseline, and had a decrease of at least 30 percent in their Abdominal Pain (AP) score from baseline during a particular week.
The AP score assesses patient's worst AP in the past 24 hours using an 11-point scale (from 0-10), where 0 represents no AP and 10 represents very severe AP.
SBM is defined as a bowel movement that occurs in the absence of laxative, enema, or suppository use on either the calendar day of the bowel movement or the calendar day before the bowel movement. CSBM is defined as an SBM associated with a sense of complete evacuation.</description>

A CSBM was defined as a Spontaneous Bowel Movement (SBM) that was associated with a sense of complete evacuation.

    <description>A patient is considered to be an abdominal pain responder if, for at least 9 out of the 12 weeks of the treatment period, they experienced a decrease of at least 30 percent in the mean abdominal pain score from baseline during a particular week.
The Abdominal Pain score assesses patient's worst abdominal pain in the past 24 hours using an 11-point scale (from 0-10), where 0 represents no abdominal pain and 10 represents very severe abdominal pain.</description>

    <measure>12-Week Change in Stool Consistency</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>

        <title>Abdominal Pain and Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movement (APC) Responder, 9 Out of 12 Weeks</title>
        <description>A patient is considered to be a 9 out of 12 week APC responder if, for at least 9 out of the first 12 weeks of the treatment period, the patient had at least 3 CSBMs, had an increase of at least 1 CSBM from baseline, and had a decrease of at least 30 percent in their Abdominal Pain (AP) score from baseline during a particular week.
The AP score assesses patient's worst AP in the past 24 hours using an 11-point scale (from 0-10), where 0 represents no AP and 10 represents very severe AP.
SBM is defined as a bowel movement that occurs in the absence of laxative, enema, or suppository use on either the calendar day of the bowel movement or the calendar day before the bowel movement. CSBM is defined as an SBM associated with a sense of complete evacuation.</description>
        <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>805 patients were randomized to treatment. 804 patients had at least 1 postrandomization entry of the primary efficacy assessment and were included in the Intent to Treat (ITT) Population. An observed-cases approach to missing postbaseline data was applied.</population>

          <title>Abdominal Pain and Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movement (APC) Responder, 9 Out of 12 Weeks</title>
          <description>A patient is considered to be a 9 out of 12 week APC responder if, for at least 9 out of the first 12 weeks of the treatment period, the patient had at least 3 CSBMs, had an increase of at least 1 CSBM from baseline, and had a decrease of at least 30 percent in their Abdominal Pain (AP) score from baseline during a particular week.
The AP score assesses patient's worst AP in the past 24 hours using an 11-point scale (from 0-10), where 0 represents no AP and 10 represents very severe AP.
SBM is defined as a bowel movement that occurs in the absence of laxative, enema, or suppository use on either the calendar day of the bowel movement or the calendar day before the bowel movement. CSBM is defined as an SBM associated with a sense of complete evacuation.</description>
