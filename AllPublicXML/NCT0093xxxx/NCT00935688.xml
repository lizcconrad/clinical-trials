  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In areas of which are co-endemic for vivax and falciparum malaria, treatments for the two
      diseases often differ and this may lead to mistreatment. This places an emphasis on diagnosis
      at the health service provision level. Diagnosis is also important when malaris endemicity is
      low - most fevers are not caused by disease. These two issues mean that most malaria and
      fevers are not adequately treated, even though the drugs may be effective; many patients who
      do not have malaria are treated for the disease, and patients with malaria may get the wrong
      treatment for their species. The study aims to test the effectiveness of employing rapid
      diagnostic tests and will study the effect on correct treatment.

  <detailed_description>

      The study will randomly assign diagnostic methods, either with clinical diagnosis, field
      microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests. The study will take place in 22 clinics in Eastern and
      Northern Afghanistan, both areas with low transmission of predominantly vivax malaria. They
      differ in their locations and their current standard diagnostic methods.

      The study will examine the result of the diagnostic test in the clinic against the result of
      reference slides and PCR to estimate the number of cases correctly treated in each arm. This
      will be a measure of the effectiveness of diagnosis (and the physicians response to the
      diagnosis) and be influential in considering modalities for diagnostic delivery

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient where the clinician* considers malaria in the diagnosis - either
             prescribing an antimalarial or would request a malaria test if available or referring
             for diagnosis of malaria elsewhere.

          -  Patient, or parent/guardian, gives informed consent to the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a result from another facility

          -  Patients referred on for diagnosis in the private sector

          -  Patients the clinician decides to treat presumptively without requesting a test
             (defined as treating prior to randomisation)

          -  Where the clinician requests microscopy specifically due to clinical need prior to
             randomisation will not be randomised in the trial, but will be noted as part of the
             study and a reference slide and clinical information will be taken following consent.
