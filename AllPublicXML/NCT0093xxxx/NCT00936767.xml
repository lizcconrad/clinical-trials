  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has now been demonstrated clearly that in Western Cambodia parasitological responses to
      artesunate and artemether containing treatment regimens for uncomplicated falciparum malaria
      are slower than elsewhere in the world. Median parasite clearance time (PCT) in patients
      treated with artesunate 4 mg/kg/day was 78 hours and with 2 mg/kg/day 82 hours, compared to
      54 and 48 hours, respectively, in Western Thailand; at 72hours peripheral blood parasitaemia
      was still detectable in 55% of patients in Western Cambodia, compared to 7.5% in Western
      Thailand. Although occasional poor responses to artesunate have been described previously the
      current reports suggest a consistent problem. These antimalarials are central to current
      treatment strategies, and so spread of parasites with reduced artemisinin susceptibility
      outside this area would be a disaster. A recent consensus meeting Pnomh Penh agreed that this
      should indeed be termed resistance, and represented a major threat to malaria control.
      Radical containment measures would be needed. This study aims to address whether a
      semi-synthetic or fully synthetic peroxide antimalarial would be more effective than
      artesunate and could therefore be used in Cambodia as part of the elimination strategy.
      Artemisone is a semisynthetic derivative of dihydroartemisinin, which importantly changes its
      tertiary structure. This drug has also shown promising efficacy for the treatment of
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria in phase II trials in Thailand and seems to be at least as
      efficacious as artesunate. No significant toxicity has been reported for artemisone and it is
      very well tolerated. If sensitivity for artemisone has remained intact in Western Cambodia,
      this will have important implications for the strategies available for containment of the
      threatening problem of artesunate resistance in Western Cambodia. It will also have important
      implications for further development of these drugs for the use in artemisinin combination
      therapies (ACTs).

      This is a small detailed randomised open-label clinical trial comparing the efficacy of oral
      artemisone with oral artesunate in the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in
      Western Cambodia. A detailed pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic evaluation and in vitro
      sensitivity for the study drugs will be part of the assessments. The overall design and
      proposed conduct is very similar to the recently completed studies of high dose
      artesunate.Fever patients in the villages surrounding Pailin (or equivalent study site) in
      Western Cambodia will be screened with a PfHRP2-based malaria rapid test (Paracheck) by the
      village malaria workers. In case of a positive test result, the patient will be transported
      by the study team to the hospital, full consent (as described above) and enrolment procedures
      will be conducted. It will be made clear from the outset that refusal to participate will in
      no way jeopardize subsequent antimalarial treatment.Eligibility can only be confirmed by a
      medically qualified investigator. Subjects who fulfil all the inclusion criteria and have
      none of the exclusion criteria will be randomised to one of the three treatment arms
      according to the randomisation schedule. Subject numbers will be will be assigned when the
      subject is enrolled after screening and prior to randomisation.Patients will be randomized in
      blocks of 15 to receive either artemisone 4 mg/kg/day for 3 days plus mefloquine 15mg/kg on
      day 3 and 10mg/kg on day 4 (N=50) or artesunate 4mg/kg/day for 3 days plus mefloquine 15mg/kg
      on day 3 and 10mg/kg on day 4 (N=25.
