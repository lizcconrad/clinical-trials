  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mefloquine is a quinolinemethanol antimalarial that is effective as therapy and prophylaxis
      for all species of malaria infecting humans, including multi-drug resistant Plasmodium
      falciparum. The marketed anti-malaria drug consists of two enantiomers of mefloquine.

      Mefloquine's clinical utility has been impaired by its association with neuropsychiatric side
      effects. The pharmacological basis of mefloquine's side effects is not known but two of the
      most reported hypotheses relate to its action on (i) the adenosine receptor and (ii) its
      effect on the cholinesterase enzyme. For both of these mechanisms, there is a significant
      stereoselective activity of the two enantiomers. In vitro studies show that the (-) isomer is
      50-100 fold more potent towards adenosine receptors compared with the (+) isomer. In
      addition, (-)-mefloquine has considerably more anti-cholinesterase activity. It has therefore
      been hypothesised that (+)-mefloquine may have a better central nervous system (CNS) safety
      profile compared with either the racemate or (-)-mefloquine.

      This study is a randomized, ascending dose, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled,
      parallel group study in healthy male and female volunteers designed to investigate this
      hypothesis and to describe the comparative pharmacokinetics of the racemate and the single
      enantiomer.
