  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of photodynamic therapy with verteporfin
      (PDT) and IVTA vs triple therapy (TT) in patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization
      (CNV) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

      The investigators designed a prospective, comparative, randomized, double blind, controlled
      study. 15 patients with classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization secondary to
      age-related macular degeneration were randomized. Triple therapy can potentially offer a new
      treatment modality for choroidal neovascularization in patients with macular degeneration and
      other diseases.

      Purpose: To compare the efficacy of photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (PDT) and IVTA vs
      triple therapy (TT) in patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary
      to age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

      Methods: Prospective, comparative, randomized, double blind, controlled study. 15 patients
      with classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization secondary to age-related macular
      degeneration were randomized. Group 1: receive PDT followed by 4 mg IVTA (n=7) or group 2: TT
      (triple Therapy) PDT followed by 4 mg IVTA + 0.5 mg Ranibizumab (n=8).The main outcome
      measures were visual acuity (VA), mean change in lesion size, mean change in foveal
      thickness, retreatment rate and the incidence and severity of adverse events.

      Results: At 6 months 5 of 7 patients (71.4%) of group 1 and 8 of 8 patients (100% ) of group
      2 had lost fewer than 15 letters (P&lt;.001). Three patients (37.5%) of group 2 had an
      improvement of 3 lines or more. Lesion type, patient age, and lesion size had no influence on
      the outcome, but baseline VA had a statistically significant effect (P =.006). The median
      number of treatments in both groups was one. The 28% of PDT-triamcinolone group and 25% of
      triple therapy group had an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) that required therapy.
      Progression or development of cataract was observed in 14.2 % in PDT- IVTA group and 12.5% in
      Triple therapy group. There were no cases of endophthalmitis. No cardiac or cerebrovascular
      accidents where presented.

      Conclusions: The combination of PDT, intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide and intravitreal
      ranibizumab is a safe treatment option for neovascular AMD and prevents a considerable
      decrease in VA. In our patients it seems to be superior than combinated therapy with PDT and
      triamcinolone.

      Clinical Relevance: Triple therapy can potentially offer a new treatment modality for
      choroidal neovascularization in patients with macular degeneration and other diseases.
