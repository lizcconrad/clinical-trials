  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated study of safety, efficacy and tolerability of dutasteride
      given for 18 months, including a 1-year double-blind randomized co-administration with either
      tolterodine ER or placebo in men suffering from lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) including
      urgency and frequency, with or without urgency urinary incontinence (i.e., overactive bladder
      (OAB) symptoms).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men who are treated with an alpha blocker (AB) or 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (5-ARI) for
      benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) often have
      symptoms including urinary frequency and urgency. ABs and 5-ARIs may improve the obstructive
      voiding symptoms but not necessarily the storage symptoms.

      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily for 6
      months in an open label fashion. Those patients who continue to report storage urinary
      symptoms, will be randomized to receive dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily for an additional one
      year together with double-blind tolterodine ER 4 mg or matched tolterodine ER placebo once
      daily.

             abnormalities would be left at the discretion of the investigator with always keeping
             in mind to not pose a hazard to the patient.

         17. PSA &gt; 10 ng/mL (if the PSA is greater than 4 ng/mL and less than or equal to 10 ng/mL,
             subjects may be included at the discretion of the Investigator if the PSA has been
             stable and the patient has had a prostate biopsy showing no evidence of prostate
             cancer)

         18. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to dutasteride or tolterodine ER .

         19. Participation in a clinical trial involving an investigational drug, within 30 days

         20. History of diagnosed gastrointestinal obstruction disease.

         21. Myocardial infarction within the past 8 weeks.

         22. Known or suspected drug and/or alcohol abuse.

         23. Any clinical condition, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would not allow
             safe completion of the study.
