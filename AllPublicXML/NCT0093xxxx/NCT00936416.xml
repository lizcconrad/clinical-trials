  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Estimation of Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is the primary test used to assess patients
      with renal disease. Although serum creatinine based GFR and nuclear medicine based
      estimations are routinely used in clinical practice, GFR estimation by Inulin is the
      recommended gold standard. Inulin based estimation of GFR is cumbersome and time consuming.

      A decrease in blood flow to the kidney (Renal Blood Flow (RBF)) is known to cause a decrease
      in GFR. RBF is typically determined using radioactive tracers, contrast MRI or a cumbersome
      para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) clearance method.

      MRI based assessment of GFR and RBF have been suggested to provide reasonable accuracy. Most
      of these studies did not compare the GFR and RBF estimation directly to Inulin and PAH
      clearance which are ther gold standards . In this study we propose to estimate MRI based GFR
      estimation directly to Inulin and noncontrast MRI based derived RBF to PAH to assess if MRI
      is an accurate test of kidney function.
