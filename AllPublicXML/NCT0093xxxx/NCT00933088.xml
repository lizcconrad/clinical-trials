      The aims of this study are to determine the differential coping strategies used by adolescent
      daughters whose mothers have breast cancer, and how this relates to the stress responses they
      exhibit. Adolescent age, and their relationship with their mothers will also be examined in
      relation to their coping. This group of adolescent daughters has reported a 25% increased
      rate of stress responses, specifically anxiety and depression, than a normative sample and
      than sons. They additionally report emotional distress and worries, and fear engaging in
      health promoting activities. Forty percent of adolescent daughters who are initially
      diagnosed with depression, like those whose mothers have breast cancer, will experience a
      second bout of depression, and 70% of those will have a relapse in adulthood. The strategies
      that adolescents use to cope with stress are potentially important mediators of the impact of
      stress on current and future adjustment. Yet little is known about the differential coping
      strategies used when adolescent daughters are faced with their mothers' breast cancer, and
      how these mediate that impact. Additionally, the generalizability of the research findings to
      date is limited due to the inclusion of largely Caucasian, middle-income families in the
      samples.

      Many cancer centers in the United States provide psychosocial support services for the over
      200,000 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer each year. There are few supportive care
      services however that target the coping of their adolescent daughters with the stress of
      their mother's breast cancer. Before developing these services we need to understand more
      about which coping strategies can mediate the stress of mothers' breast cancer and be
      included in any interventions. With the increased risk that these daughters face of acquiring
      breast cancer, developing fear about health screening, and potentially facing life-long
      depression, it is imperative to understand more about the coping strategies and factors that
      can mediate the stressfulness of this event. This cross-sectional, correlational study will
      target 90 adolescent daughters and their mothers with breast cancer recruited through the New
      York University Medical Cancer Center (NYUMC) and Bellevue Hospital/New York City Health and
      Hospitals Corporation (NYCHHC) cancer clinics. A contribution of this study to the research
      to date includes an active outreach to include the minority population. Data collection will
      include data sheets for mother and daughter demographic information and history, and
      instruments that target adolescent daughters, the different coping strategies they use, and
      their level of adjustment or distress with the maternal disease within the first year
      following diagnosis. Ultimately, the knowledge gained from this study will lead to the
      development of interventions that target coping and promote adjustment in this vulnerable
      group.
