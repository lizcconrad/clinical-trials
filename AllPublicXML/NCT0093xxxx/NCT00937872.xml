      The primary objective of this study is to determine the absolute bioavailability of SRT2104
      as a 250 mg suspension, and to define the intravenous pharmacokinetics of SRT2104.

      The secondary objective of this study is to assess the potential systemic metabolite burden
      of SRT2104, and to provide plasma and urine samples for subsequent metabolite profiling and
      identification.

      This will be a single centre, combined IV and oral single dose, open-label study in healthy
      male volunteers.

      Each subject will receive the following formulations on a single study day:

        1. Regimen A: A single 10 mL oral dose of 250 mg SRT2104 delivered as a suspension
           formulation;

        2. Regimen B: A single intravenous dose of 10 mL containing 100 µg (not more than 250 nCi,
           9.25 kBq) Carbon-14 radio-labeled SRT2104 , administered by IV infusion over 15 minutes,
           starting 2 hours and 45 minutes after the oral dose.

             months;)

          -  Positive drugs of abuse test result (Section 7.8);

          -  Regular alcohol consumption in males &gt;21 units per week (1 Unit = ½ pint beer, a 25 mL

             be expecting to have symptoms during the study period;

          -  Donation of blood within the previous three months;

          -  Subjects will be excluded from the study if they are considered by the PI to be at
             risk of transmitting, thorough blood or other body fluids, the agents responsible for

             the study;

          -  Failure to satisfy the PI of fitness to participate for any other reason.
