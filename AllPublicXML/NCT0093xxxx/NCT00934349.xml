      The purpose of this study is to assess the existence of a genetic factor, suspected to be
      involved, aside from likely food deficiency contribution, in occurrence of dry beriberi, in
      patients who experienced dry beriberi and in a case group composed of 3 people, free from
      beriberi, within the same household.

    <textblock>
      A team of 2 investigators, a nurse and an investigator speaking French, Shibushi and Shimaore
      (3 languages in use in Mayotte), will visit exposed patients who agreed to participate to the
      study.

      3 controls, fulfilling inclusion criteria, will be recruited within the household by drawing
      lots.

      Clinical examination and food survey by means of a questionnaire will be performed.

      Blood samples will be drawn to determine thiamine status, vitamin B1 dosage, erythrocyte
      transketolase activity and thiamine pyrophosphate effect, analysis will be performed by
      Biomnis laboratory in Lyon.

      For the genetic study, 4 drops of blood will be put down on Whatman paper and sent to Dr
      Johannes COY in Darmstadt Germany, for DNA extraction and PCR screening for mutations.
