    <textblock>
      Since thyroid cancer becomes refractory to radioactive iodine, treatment options are very
      limited. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib have recently shown promise. This trial
      seeks to expand treatment options for this disease with a new, oral drug called RAD001. It is
      an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway and has shown activity in neuroendocrine cancers of the
      gastrointestinal tract and has been approved for the treatment of metastatic renal cell
      cancer.

      -  RAD001 will be taken once a day in the morning starting on Day 1 and continue until the
           participant is no longer participating in the study treatment.

        -  A history and physical exam will be performed the first day of the study and then once a
           month. Blood tests including coagulation studies, and thyroid studies will be performed
           monthly. A urine sample will need to be provided on the first day of treatment and then
           every 2 months. Imaging consisting of a CT or MRI of the neck, chest and abdomen will be
           done every 8 weeks after starting RAD001.

        -  Participants will remain on this research study for up to 24 months. However, if the
           participants doctor feels that they are benefiting from the study drug and they do not
           have severe side effects, they may be given the option to continue taking RAD001.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer, excluding
             thyroid lymphomas not amenable to or refractory to surgical resection, external beam
             radiotherapy, radioiodine or other local therapies.

             allowed.

          -  Medullary thyroid cancer with documented evidence of disease progression by modified
             RECIST within 6 months before study day 1 or symptomatic disease at the time of
             screening in the absence of documented disease progression.

          -  Differentiated thyroid cancer with documented evidence of disease progression by
             modified RECIST within 6 months before study day 1.
