    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Telbivudine in pregnancy
      for the prevention of HBV perinatal transmission in highly viraemic mothers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, we evaluated the effect of telbivudine given during the second and
      third trimesters of pregnancy to highly viremic, HBV DNA-positive mothers on maternal HBV DNA
      and HBeAg levels prior to delivery and the rate of vertical transmission of HBV to infants
      who received passive-active immunoprophylaxis. Additionally, we investigated the timing of
      the administration of telbivudine on reducing the risk of perinatal transmission and the
      safety of telbivudine during pregnancy.
