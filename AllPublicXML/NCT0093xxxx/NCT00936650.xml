  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients with primary HPT was designed to
      evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL)
      of AMG 073 when administered 2 times a day (BID). The study consisted of 3 phases: a 12-week
      dose-titration phase, a 12-week maintenance phase, and a 28-week follow-up phase.

             during the 12 months preceding day 0 (at least 1 of these determinations should have
             been made during screening by the central lab) and serum calcium concentration &gt; 10.3
             mg/dL and ≤ 12.5 mg/dL on at least 2 occasions at least 7 days apart
