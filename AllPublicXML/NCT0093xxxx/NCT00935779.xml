    <textblock>
      Peritoneal metastases appear in a great proportion of patients affected by gastric carcinoma.
      Involved mechanisms are poorly understood though experimentally it has been demonstrated that
      neoplastic cells exfoliated from primary tumor can only implant and proliferate in areas of
      damaged peritoneum. Objectives: to study ultra-structure of peritoneal surface by electronic
      microscopy in control subjects and in patients with early or locally advanced gastric cancer
      looking for spontaneous changes in peritoneal surface not related with surgical injury.

      18 out of 32 cases were eligible for analysis. Four patients operated on for benign diseases
      served as control and 14 patients with operable local gastric adenocarcinoma (4
      mucosa/submucosa/muscular y 10 serosa lesions) were studied. At the beginning of surgery, a 2
      x 2 cm. sample from macroscopically normal visceral peritoneum at mesenterium root was
      carefully obtained, washed with saline and fixed in glutaraldehyde solution. Besides a sample
      of peritoneal washing fluid was studied to exclude patients with free cancer cells.
      Peritoneal tissue was fixed during 24 hours and then all samples were evaluated by electronic
      microscope.
