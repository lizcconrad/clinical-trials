    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect real-life data of the Promus™ stent, the Cypher™
      stent and the Endeavor™ stent in routine clinical practice, and compare outcomes.

      Boston Scientific is developing the present PROENCY registry to collect real world data with
      the Promus™ Stent and to compare outcomes to the Cypher™ and Endeavor™ stents.

      All three stents have received CE Mark and are commonly used in Europe. All the data
      collected in this registry will be from patients treated according to the physician's
      choices, per Product Directions/Instructions for Use, per approved indications and per local
      standard of care.

      The results from this registry will provide an understanding of the use and outcomes
      associated with the Promus™, the Endeavor™ and the Cypher™ stent systems in a real world
      setting.

        All patients eligible and planned for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with any of
        the three stents and willing to give consent to allow for collection of their clinical
        data. Patients also need to express willingness to comply with all standard of care
        follow-up evaluations and medical therapies.

        All the data collected in this registry will be from patients treated according to the
        physician's choices, per Product Directions/Instructions for Use, per approved indications
        and per local standard of care.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Per PROMUS or CYPHER or Endeavor DFU/IFU

        PROMUS Indications:

          -  PROMUS™ Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System is indicated for improving coronary
             luminal diameter in patients with symptomatic ischemic heart disease due to discrete
             de novo native coronary artery lesions (length 28 mm) with a reference vessel diameter
             of 2.5 mm - 4.0 mm.

        CYPHER Indications:

          -  CYPHER SELECT Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent is indicated for improving coronary
             luminal diameter in patients with symptomatic ischemic disease due to discrete de novo
             and in-stent restenotic lesions (length 30 mm) in native coronary arteries with a
             reference vessel diameter of 2.25 mm to 5.00 mm.

        Endeavor Indications:

          -  Endeavor Stent is indicated for improving coronary luminal diameter and reducing
             restenosis in patients with symptomatic ischemic heart disease in de novo coronary
             artery lesions in native coronary arteries with a reference vessel diameter of 2.25 mm
             to 4.0 mm and a lesion length of &lt; 27 mm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        PROMUS Contraindications:

          -  Patients in whom anti-platelet and / or anti-coagulant therapy is contraindicated.

          -  Patients judged to have a lesion that prevents complete inflation of an angioplasty
             balloon.

          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to everolimus, cobalt,
             chromium, nickel, tungsten, acrylic and fluoro - polymers may have an allergic
             reaction to this implant; therefore, the implant is not recommended for such patients.

        CYPHER Contraindications:

          -  Patients in whom antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation therapy is contraindicated.

          -  Patients judged to have a lesion that prevents complete inflation of an angioplasty
             balloon.

          -  Transplant patients.

        Endeavor Contraindications:

          -  Patients with hypersensitivity or allergies to aspirin, heparin, clopidogrel,
             ticlopidine, drugs such as ABT-578, rapamycin, tacrolimus, sirolimus or similar drugs
             or any other analogue or derivative, cobalt, chromium, nickel, molybdenum, or contrast
             media.

          -  Patients in whom antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation therapy is contraindicated.

          -  Patients who are judged to have a lesion that prevents complete inflation of an
             angioplasty balloon.
