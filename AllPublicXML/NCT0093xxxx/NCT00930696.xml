  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical treatment of deep endometriosis with bowel involvement is widely accepted to require
      complete excision of all endometriosis also when invading the bowel. In case of opening of
      the bowel a subsequent inflammatory reaction follows the surgery, as demonstrated by the
      increase in blood levels of C-reactive protein during the first post-operative week.
      Furthermore it increases the risk of post-operative bowel complications. In case of
      peritonitis the general surgeons use extensive lavage in order to decreases mortality,
      morbidity and post-operative adhesions formation, as demonstrated in animal models and
      clinically in patients with peritonitis. Considering the efficacy of extensive lavage for
      peritonitis and the inflammatory reaction as judged by the increased C-reactive protein (CRP)
      following full thickness deep endometriosis resection from the bowel, the study aims to
      evaluate, in women undergoing this procedure, the effect of extensive abdominal lavage on
      abdominal inflammation and post-operative bowel complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a consecutive series 20 women with full thickness resection for deep endometriosis
      received randomly, at the end of the procedure, a standard abdominal rinsing (n=10) or
      extensive abdominal lavage with 8 Liters of saline (n=10). C-reactive protein and white blood
      cell count values were collected daily for 7 days. Women were observed for complications
      during the first post-operative week and during the follow up at 1 and 6 months.

      The primary end point was to evaluate the effects of extensive abdominal lavage on
      post-operative inflammation. Secondary end-point was to explore the potential protective rule
      against post-operative bowel complications.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patients (aged 18-50 years) were all recruited from a single, tertiary referral
             hospital at Leuven University, Belgium, specializing in the surgical treatment of
             severe endometriosis.

          -  All the women were scheduled for a surgical excision of a rectovaginal nodule.

          -  Women with a full thickness involvement of the bowel requiring discoid resection were
             included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  evidence on chest x-ray in the previous 3 months of old or currently active TB, even
             if adequately treated;

          -  evidence of serious infections (such as pneumonia or pyelonephritis) in the previous 3
             months

          -  evidence of a documented HIV infection, active hepatitis-B or C, or an opportunistic
             infection (e.g. herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus, pneumocystis carinii, aspergillosis,
             histoplasmosis, or mycobacteria other than TB) in the previous 6 months

          -  Previous transplant surgery, a lymphoproliferative disorder or other malignancy

          -  Positive cervical cytology in the previous 6 months

          -  Any haematological or biochemical abnormalities on routine screening.
