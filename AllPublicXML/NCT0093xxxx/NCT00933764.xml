      This is a multi-center study designed to assess the accuracy and precision of the Cholestech
      LDX Cardiac hsCRP test for the quantitative determination of C-reactive protein (CRP) in
      whole blood, serum and plasma from individuals being assessed for risk of cardiovascular
      disease. The Cholestech LDX Cardiac hsCRP test consists of the CRP cassette and LDX analyzer
      and measures CRP with high sensitivity on fingerstick or venous whole blood at the
      point-of-care (POC). The results of this study are intended to be used for regulatory 510k
      filings for use as an in vitro diagnostic test.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults (18 years of age or older) presenting to their physician's office or outpatient
