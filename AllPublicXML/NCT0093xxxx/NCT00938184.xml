    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to to assess the pharmacokinetics of paroxetine after
      single doses of paroxetine CR at the dose levels of 12.5, 25 and 50mg in healthy Japanese
      male volunteers.

    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile after single oral doses of
      the proposed final market tablet formulations of paroxetine CR in Japan (the 12.5mg and 25mg
      tablets), at the dose levels of 12.5, 25 and 50mg in the healthy male Japanese volunteers.
      Treatment sequence of the 3 dose levels in each subject is randomized.
