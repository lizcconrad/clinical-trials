  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of low intensity ultrasound therapy
      over the cartilage morphology (thickness and volume) of patients with mild or moderate knee
      osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) negatively influences the healthy aging process of the population.
      Until today, there are no interventions that have proved effective for enhancing the
      cartilage regeneration of these patients. The use of Low Intensity Ultrasound (LIUS) therapy
      has demonstrated promising effects on cartilage regeneration in vitro and in vivo. The aim of
      this study was to assess the effects of 24 sessions of LIUS on the cartilage volume and
      thickness of patients with grades 1 and 2 (medial joint space narrowing OARSI atlas 2007)
      knee osteoarthritis (OA).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Medial compartment knee cartilage thickness and volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after completion of 24 sessions</time_frame>
    <description>A propietary software is been used to measure the cartilage thickness and volume of Magnetic Resonance Imaging obtained trough a coronal 3DGRE sequence. This measurement is been done by a trained physiatrist. The medial compartment is considered to be the primary outcome measure while the lateral compartment is considered as a secondary outcome.</description>

    <measure>6 minutes walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after completion of 24 sessions</time_frame>
    <description>The test will be conducted on a flat surface-rectangular hallway by instructing the participants to &quot;Cover as much as distance as possible in a comfortable pace&quot;, the distance will be measured with a mechanical road distance measuring wheel (The Measure Meter ®, Truemeter 5500, UK), and the time was set using the timer function on an ipod touch. Standardized encouragement &quot;you are doing fine, just keep going&quot; will be given every minute.</description>

    <measure>Patient´s global assessment of disease severity (Likert scale 0- 5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after completion of 24 sessions</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' perceptions of their disease severity was measured by the question &quot;Considering all the ways knee osteoarthritis affects you, how would you rate your condition today?&quot; and a Likert scale ( 1-very poor, 2- poor, 3- fair, 4-good, 5- very good).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Semi quantitative scoring of the knee joint</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 24 sessions</time_frame>
    <description>A semi quantitative score of MRI features related to the OA process (cartilage grade of injury, bone marrow edema, subchondral cyst) for each compartment (medial and lateral) along with independent scores of the medial meniscus, lateral meniscus, and joint effusion will be made by a trained radiologist</description>

    <measure>Pain at the end of the 6 minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 24 US sessions</time_frame>
    <description>The level of pain at the end of the 6MT was recorded using a numeric pain scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (terrible pain).</description>
