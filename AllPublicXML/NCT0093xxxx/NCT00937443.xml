  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of heart failure grows as the population continues to age. Heart failure
      incidence approaches 10 per 1,000 persons after the age of 65. Although pharmacotherapy
      improves the treatment of heart failure it remains insufficient in preventing the progression
      of this debilitating disease. Cell based therapy has gained great strides over the last
      decade, launching cellular therapy into the mix of artillery for the treatment of chronic
      heart failure and coronary disease. While early pre-clinical work demonstrates that stem cell
      based therapy improves heart failure the exact mechanism in which these endothelial
      progenitor cells (EPC's) are recruited from the bone marrow, proliferate under the mediation
      of growth factors, and migrate to the injured tissues endogenously still remains obscured.
      Therefore in order for clinicians and scientist to impact heart failure treatment, a greater
      understanding of the physiological changes in EPC's and other modulators of cardioreparative
      process need further investigation.

      Heart failure remains a devastating progressive chronic disease in which pharmacotherapy is
      not often sufficient. Although cell based therapy is gaining publicity in the treatment of
      coronary artery disease and heart failure. Determining how endothelial progenitor cells are
      recruited, proliferate, and home to injured tissue is an important area of investigation.
      Equally important is determining factors which improve EPC stimulation and efficiency such as
      realistic levels of exercise and the modulation of various cardioreparative factors (VEGF,
      NRG-1, and SDF-1) within heart failure patients. Since the endogenous repair mechanism is
      down regulated in heart failure patients such efforts may uncover ways to tip the balance in
      heart failure back to normal reparative maintenance.

      60 ml of blood will be used to measure baseline levels of EPC's, NRG-1, VEGF, and SDF-1.
      Repeat venipuncture will be done at Week 12. Approximately 60 ml of blood for the measurement
      of EPC's, NRG1, VEGF, and SDF-1.
