      This is a multicentre, open labeled, prospective, randomized, controlled phase I/II study
      designed to assess the clinical performance of chemoembolization with LC Bead, loaded with
      irinotecan in combination with intravenous chemotherapy and bevacizumab versus intravenous
      chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab in the treatment of unresectable liver

        Inclusion:

          -  Patients over 18 years of age, of any race or sex, who have histologic or radiologic

             be eligible.

          -  Patients with at least one measurable liver metastases, with size &gt; 1cm (modified
             RECIST criteria)

          -  Patients with liver dominant disease defined as ≥80% tumor body burden confined to the
             liver

          -  Patients with patent main portal vein

          -  ECOG Performance Status score of &lt; 2

          -  Life expectancy of &gt; 3 months

          -  Non-pregnant with an acceptable contraception in premenopausal women.

          -  Hematologic function: ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, platelets ≥75 x109/L, INR ≤1.3* (*If patient
             is on anticoagulants, they must be able to stop medication temporarily prior to TACE
             and must have INR ≤1.3 prior to receiving TACE) Adequate liver function as measured
             by: Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0mg/dl, ALT, AST ≤5 times ULN, albumin ≥2.5g/dl, Adequate
             Hemoglobin and Hematocrit as measured by (Male: for approximate 45 - 62%; and
             approximate Female: 37 - 48%) or Hemoglobin (Male: approximate 13 - 18 gm/dL Female:
             approximate 12 - 16 gm/dL). If patient is asymptomatic with Hemoglobin for male 10 to
             12.9 or Female 9.5 to 11.9 and do not wish to be transfused they still will be
             eligible for treatment.

          -  Adequate renal function (creatinine ≤ 2.0mg/dl)

          -  Women of child bearing potential and fertile men are required to use effective
             contraception (negative serum βHCG for women of child-bearing age)

          -  Patient is at least one year out from any treatment for their Stage IV colorectal
             cancer.

             - these patients should not be candidates for curative treatments, and will have
             recovered from any chemotherapeutic toxicities' they may have experienced.&quot;

        Exclusion:

          -  &quot;Any patient eligible for curative treatment (i.e. resection or radiofrequency
             ablation). Note: resectability is defined as a single tumor &lt;5cm with adequate liver
             function defined: Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0mg/dl&quot; non-resectability includes patients with
             greater than 6, tumors close to blood vessels, patients with hepatic-pulmonary
             shunting, or patients of poor performance&quot;

          -  Active bacterial, viral or fungal infection within 72 hours of study entry

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast feeding

          -  Allergy to contrast media that cannot be managed with standard care (e.g. steroids),
             making magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) contraindicated.

          -  Presence of another malignancy with the exception of cervical carcinoma in situ and
             stage I basal or squamous carcinoma of the skin.

          -  Any contraindication for hepatic embolization procedures:

               -  Large shunt as determined by the investigator (pretesting with TcMMA not
                  required)

               -  Severe atheromatosis

               -  Hepatofugal blood flow

               -  Main portal vein occlusion (e.g. thrombus or tumor)

          -  Other significant medical or surgical condition, or any medication or treatment, that
             would place the patient at undue risk and that would preclude the safe use of
             chemoembolization or would interfere with study participation

          -  Patients with prior contraindications for the use of irinotecan therapy-this would
             include chronic inflammatory bowel disease and or bowel obstruction, history of severe
             hypersensitivity reactions to irinotecan hypochloride, trihydrate, lactic acid or to
             any of the excipients of Camptostar, severe bone marrow failure, history of Gilbert
             Syndrome or concomitant use with St. John's Wort
