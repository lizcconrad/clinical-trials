  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effect of combining prolonged exposure, a cognitive-behavioral
      treatment program for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with medication (varenicline) and
      counseling treatments for smoking cessation. Subjects will be randomly assigned to a 3-month
      treatment of either: 1) varenicline and smoking cessation counseling alone, or 2) prolonged
      exposure, varenicline, and smoking cessation counseling. Assessments will be completed at the
      end of treatment and 6-month follow-up.

      We hypothesize that, at the end of treatment and at follow-up, abstinence rates and decrease
      in cigarettes smoked will be greater among participants who receive the combined treatment
      for both PTSD and smoking.
