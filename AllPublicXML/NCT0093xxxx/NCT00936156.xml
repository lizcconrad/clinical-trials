    <description>Conventional chemotherapy: carboplatin injection (160 mg/m²/day by infusion over one hour in 5 % glucose saline) administered from D1 to D5 and from D22 to D26. Etoposide injection (100 mg/m²/day by infusion over one hour in 5 % glucose saline) administered from D1 to D5 and from D22 to D26. Double intensification by high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous PBSC rescue: thiotepa injection (200 mg/m²/day as an infusion over one hour in 200 ml/m² of 5 % GS) administered from D42 to D44 and from D63 to D65. Autologous PBSC rescue on D47 and D68. Surgical resection of any tumor residue. Irradiation of the primary tumor site and cerebrospinal axis: 54 Gy to primary tumor, 36 Gy to cerebrospinal axis. Maintenance treatment: Temozolomide 150 mg/m²/day orally for 5 days every 28 days, from 1 month after the end of irradiation. 6 cycles planned. Duration of treatment: 13 months</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Type of tumor:

               -  Metastatic medulloblastoma whatever the quality of the initial resection
                  (radiologically visible metastases by MRI and/or CSF invaded by at least one mass
                  of tumoral cells).

               -  Incompletely resected local medulloblastoma with a residue &gt; 1.5 cm2.

               -  Anaplastic, large cell medulloblastoma whatever the risk criteria (localized or
                  metastatic, complete or incomplete resection).

               -  Medulloblastoma with amplification of c-myc or N-myc whatever the risk criteria
