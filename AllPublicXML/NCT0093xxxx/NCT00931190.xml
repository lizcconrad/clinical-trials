  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives are to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment of cervical intraepithelial
      neoplasia (CIN) by loop electrosurgical excision procedure using persistence of human
      papillomavirus (HPV) as outcome, and to perform a long-term follow-up on the ability of HPV
      testing, as compared to cytology, to predict recurrence of high-grade CIN.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical samples for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA analysis and cytological analysis were
      obtained from women with abnormal smears referred to Umeå university hospital, Sweden, for
      treatment with conization. These women were scheduled for HPV DNA testing and Pap smears
      before and 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after treatment. The HPV DNA testing was performed with
      a PCR-based genotyping method.
