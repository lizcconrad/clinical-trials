  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study was to determine the effect on overall survival and progression free
      survival by adding iniparib (BSI-201/SAR240550) to the combination of gemcitabine/carboplatin
      in adult patients with triple negative breast cancer (estrogen receptor (ER)-negative,
      progesterone receptor (PR)-negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      (HER2)-negative).

      Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi, it is concluded that iniparib does not possess
      characteristics typical of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor class. The exact
      mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells
      performed in the laboratory, iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that
      induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in
      the G2/M phase in tumor cell lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging
      modalities in tumor cell lines. Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its
      metabolites are ongoing.

      Participants were treated for 21-day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity,
      or consent withdrawal. After treatment discontinuation, participants were followed until end
      of study or death or receipt of new anticancer therapy, whichever was first.
