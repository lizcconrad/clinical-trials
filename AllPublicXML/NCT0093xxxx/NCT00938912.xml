      SP848 is an open-label study to evaluate long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy in
      children with epilepsy treated with Lacosamide (LCM) oral solution (syrup) or LCM tablets as
      adjunctive therapy. In addition, the study is designed to provide continued availability of
      LCM to subjects who have completed the SP847 (NCT00938431) study and to subjects who have
      discontinued from SP847 (NCT00938431) and who, in the investigator's opinion, would benefit
      from long-term administration of LCM.

      SP848 will be open to subjects who have participated in other LCM pediatric clinical studies
      in epilepsy and will also be open to up to 100 subjects enrolling directly into SP848.
      Permissible LCM doses in SP848 are between 2-12 mg/kg/day (oral solution [syrup]) or the
      corresponding tablet dose up to a maximum dose of 600 mg/day.

      Subjects enrolled in SP848 have the option of remaining on the oral solution formulation of
      LCM or switching to the commercial tablet formulation, if feasible.
