          1. Have in the clinical judgment of the investigator, experienced significant clinical
             benefit while on belimumab treatment in the HGS Protocol LBRA99.

          2. Over the course of the study and for 60 days after the last dose of study agent, any
             woman with an intact uterus who is not post-menopausal must agree to practice a
             medically accepted method of contraception.

          3. Over the course of the study and for 60 days after the last dose of study agent, all

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Had not been previously treated with belimumab in LBRA99 or were discontinued from
