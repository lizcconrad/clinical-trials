  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a syndrome characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and hyperalgesia
      with a prevalence of 2-4% in the general population; it is often accompanied by fatigue,
      insomnia, anxiety, depression and other conditions. It is a difficult condition to treat, and
      only recently have drugs been approved by the FDA specifically for the treatment of this
      condition (Lyrica was approved in 2007, Duloxetine in 2008). There are now several clinical
      trials of drugs commonly used to treat neuropathic pain (amitriptyline, gabapentin,
      pregabalin, acetaminophen/tramadol, duloxetine, minserin) reporting some degree of efficacy
      in treating fibromyalgia. This efficacy makes it practical to consider fibromyalgia along
      with other neuropathic pain conditions. However, such drug trials report only partial
      efficacy in relieving pain and/or other symptoms. Current treatment recommendations indicate
      the need for a multimodal approach; this includes medical management using appropriate drug
      therapies, psychological therapies, exercise and complementary approaches. The current
      proposal is for a randomized controlled trial to compare qigong (a complementary modality) to
      a wait list control to determine if qigong is a useful complementary therapy for
      fibromyalgia.

      The investigators recently completed a pilot trial in which they examined a specific form of
      qigong (CFQ Qigong, available locally in Halifax), and observed beneficial effects against
      pain, fibromyalgia impact, and on quality of life scores; importantly, these benefits were
      all sustained for 6 months to the end of the trial. On the basis of these preliminary
      observations, the investigators now propose a controlled trial in which CFQ Qigong is
      compared to a wait list control group. The latter group will be offered qigong training at
      the end of the trial, so could really be characterized as a delayed treatment group. The
      study will consist of a 3-day training period, weekly review of technique sessions for 8
      weeks, daily practice for 8 weeks, with assessments at baseline, at 8 weeks following the
      training and practice, and follow-up assessments at 4 and 6 months. Study outcomes will
      include: (a) pain (numeric rating scale - pain intensity), (b) impact (fibromyalgia impact
      questionnaire), (c) quality of life measures (SF-36), (d) patient assessments (patient global
      impression of change and satisfaction scales), (e) sleep measures (Pittsburgh sleep quality
      index, actigraphy, sleep diary). In addition to these assessments, the investigators will
      also conduct qualitative assessments in which participants provide a more open-ended
      assessment of their health status at these same intervals. The main hypothesis being examined
      is that CFQ Qigong will produce benefits compared to the wait list group.

    <description>Qigong training con- sisted of an initial workshop conducted over three con- secutive half-days by a qualified CFQ instructor. Participants received training in level 1 CFQ; this con- sisted of instruction in seven key movements known as &quot;the hexagram&quot; and ancillary exercises. Hexagram move- ments consist of choreographed movements that emphasize softness, relaxation, downward releases and full body distribution of &quot;qi&quot;. Once initial training was complete, participants were asked to practice CFQ at home for 45 to 60 minutes per day for eight weeks; time could be broken up into shorter sessions during the day. Participants returned for a 60 minute weekly review/group practice sessions for these eight weeks.</description>
