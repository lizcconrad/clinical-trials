      This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, parallel group, study being conducted in the
      United States and in Europe in postmenopausal women. Approximately 800 subjects will be
      randomized across about 65 sites in a 1:1 ratio to either denosumab 60mg SC Q6M, or
      ibandronate 150mg PO QM.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ambulatory, postmenopausal women (based on medical history) 55 years or older at
             screening

          -  Postmenopause will be defined as no vaginal bleeding or spotting for at least 12
             months

          -  If the subject is 55 - 59 years old and there is uncertainty regarding menopausal
             status, confirmation of serum FSH (&gt;= 50 mIU/mL) and serum estradiol (&lt;= 20 pg/mL)
             must be obtained

          -  If the subject is 60 years or older, evaluation of FSH and estradiol levels is not
             needed to confirm menopausal status

          -  Have received their first prescription of daily or weekly bisphosphonate therapy at
             least 1 month prior to screening

          -  May have received

          -  raloxifene, calcitonin, prior to initiation of daily orweekly bisphosphonate therapy.

          -  up to 3 doses of monthly bisphosphonate prior to initiation of daily or weekly
             bisphosphonate therapy

          -  calcium, and vitamin D

          -  Hormone replacement therapy (e.g. estrogen use for mitigation of menopausal symptoms)

          -  Subject has:

          -  Stopped daily or weekly bisphosphonate therapy (is denoted as non-persistent) at least
             one month before the screening visit, or

          -  Demonstrated low adherence to therapy assessed by a score of less than 6 on the
             OS-MMAS

          -  Screening BMD (g/cm2) values, at the lumbar spine OR total hip, that occur within the
             following ranges, based on the particular scanner that is used:

        GE Lunar Lumbar spine 0.700 &lt; or = BMD &lt; and = 0.940 Total hip 0.504 &lt; or = BMD &lt; or =
        0.756

        Hologic Lumbar spine 0.607 &lt; or = BMD &lt; or = 0.827 Total hip 0.454 &lt; or = BMD &lt; or = 0.698
        Both the initial and the repeat DXA scan of the lumbar spine OR the total hip must meet the
        above eligibility criteria.

          -  At least 2 lumbar vertebrae must be evaluable by DXA.

          -  At least one hip must be evaluable by DXA (eg, no history of either bilateral hip
             replacement or pins in both hips)

          -  Provide signed informed consent before any study-specific procedures are conducted

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any disorder that compromises the ability of the subject to give written informed
             consent and/or to comply with study procedures

          -  Current or prior use of medications prescribed for osteoporosis treatment other than
             oral daily or weekly bisphosphonate

          -  Contraindicated to receive oral ibandronate 150mg PO QM, including

          -  Hypersensitivity to ibandronate 150mg PO QM or other constituents of ibandronate 150mg
             PO QM tablets

          -  Abnormalities of the esophagus, which delay esophageal emptying such as stricture or
             achalasia

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results aftercompletion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
