      Two main objectives of the study are:

      Primary:

      To determine the MTD of Busulfex ® that can be given safely over the least number of days to
      myeloma patients who are either ≥65 years of age (Group 1) or have renal insufficiency (Group
      2), defined as creatinine &gt;3mg/dL or creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min.

      Secondary:

      To perform pharmacokinetic (PK) studies to evaluate individual variability and the
      relationship to toxicities in each of the two groups at each proposed dose level.

      This study is for first line treatment for multiple myeloma patients in patients &gt;65 years or
      have renal insufficiency Busulfan introduces cytopenia much slower than melphalan while the
      time to recover after transplantation is the same. The duration of cytopenia with busulfan
      should therefore be shorter. Busulfan given in myeloma patients with renal failure has proven
      to be effective.

      The initial proposed dose level in our study will be 3.2mg/kg of body weight over 6 hours for
      3 days. The next levels will be 3.2mg/kg of body weight over 6 hours for 4 days, 4.3 mg/kg of
      body weight over 6 hours for 3 days, 5.6 mg/kg of body weight over 6 hours for 2 days, and
      6.4 mg/kg of body weight over 6 hours for 2 days. Three patients per group will be entered at
      the first level. Further enrollment will be dependent upon toxicities observed. All dose
      escalations will be initiated after the PI has reviewed the toxicity data available on the
      prior dose levels and confirms that it is safe to proceed to subsequent dose level(s).
      Maximum tolerated dose will defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at
      which ≥ 2 of 6 patients experiences a grade 4 non-hematological toxicity that is unexpected,
      related, and serious, and it will be evaluated separately for patients &gt; 65 years of age or
      in patients with renal insufficiency.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have ≥ 3 x 106 CD34 cell/kg in storage for this study.

          2. Subjects must have symptomatic multiple myeloma at their new patient consult at HCI
             that, in the opinion of the enrolling physician, requires treatment.

          3. Subjects must be at least 65 years of age and/or diagnosed with renal insufficiency,
             defined as serum creatinine ≥3mg/dL or a creatinine clearance of less than
             30mL/minute.

          4. Subjects must not have a history of chronic obstructive or chronic restrictive
             pulmonary disease. Subjects must demonstrate adequate pulmonary function studies
             defined as ≥50% of predicted on mechanical aspects (FEV1, FVC) and diffusion capacity
             (DLCO).

          5. Subjects must demonstrate adequate cardiac function (≥40% LVEF on ECHO or MUGA).

          6. Subjects must demonstrate adequate liver functions with total bilirubin and

             (If total bilirubin is &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, a direct bilirubin needs
             to be assessed. Subject eligible as long as the direct bilirubin is not &gt; 1.5 times
             the upper limit of normal)

          7. Subjects must have at least one evaluable myeloma marker by which to judge response:
             serum M protein &gt;1g/dL, free light chains in the serum that more than four times the
             upper limit of normal, urine M protein of ≥ 500 mg, urine free light chains of ≥ 500
             mg/day, bone marrow plasmacytosis with &gt;20% plasma cells, extramedullary

             a direct bilirubin &gt;1.5 time the institutional upper limit of normal (direct bilirubin
             to be assessed only if the total bilirubin is &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal)

          2. Subjects must not be HIV positive or have active Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infection.
