    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety profile and the Maximum Tolerated Dose
      (MTD) of TAK-901 in adult patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma. This study will
      help to identify the recommended phase 2 dose and infusion duration, and describe the
      pharmacokinetics of TAK-901.

    <description>This study consists of three sequential parts.
Part 1: Escalating doses of TAK-901 will be administered via IV infusion over a 3-hour period on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, and 18 of each 28-day cycle.
Part 2: Escalating doses of TAK-901 (starting at one-third of the dose identified as the MTD in Part 1) will be administered as a 1-hour infusion on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, and 18 of each 28-day cycle.
Part 3: TAK-901 will be administered to approximately 20 patients using the dose identified as the MTD in the escalation phase. The infusion duration of TAK-901 will be determined after completion of Part 2.</description>
