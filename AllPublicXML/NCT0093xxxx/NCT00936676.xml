      Eligible participants, who participated in the ADAGIO trial and who sign an approved informed
      consent form, will be enrolled into the study at their original study locations. participants
      who have stopped rasagiline therapy and in the opinion of the investigator will gain clinical
      benefit from restarting treatment can also be considered for enrollment in the Core follow-up
      study period. Use of any other anti-PD treatment is permitted as deemed necessary by the

    <description>Part I is designed to rate mentation, behavior and mood (questions 1-4). Part II (questions 5-17) is designed to rate activities of daily life. Both parts I and II are to be collected as historical information. Part III (questions 18-31) is done as a motor examination at the time of a visit as defined in this protocol. The various items to be rated are scored using a 5-point system (i.e., 0 is normal and 4 indicates a severe abnormality, half point scores are allowed for Part III questions).</description>
