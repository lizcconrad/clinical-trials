      The purpose of the study is evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety profile of the Cox-2
      specific analgesic Etoricoxib (arcoxiaÂ®) when administrated pre and postoperatively for
      controlling pain in adult patients undergoing thyroid surgery. Patients will be followed up
      in the immediate postoperative period, during the first postoperative (POD) day and in POD 2,
      3 and 7. It is expected that with the addition of Etoricoxib, patients will experience less
      pain during the overall postoperative period and also a better quality of recovery when
      compared with the traditional analgesic regimen.
