  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cervix cancer usually require external radiation given to the whole pelvis then
      an internal radiation boost, also called brachytherapy, to treat any remaining tumour.
      Standard brachytherapy has been used successfully for many years, but does not take into
      account differences in the shape of the tumour or normal structures between patients. This
      study aims to implement individualized -optimized- brachytherapy, based on international
      recommendations. MR scanning with the intra-uterine applicator in place allows improved
      identification of residual tumour and normal structures, allowing brachytherapy to be
      individualized for each patient with the aim to reduce side-effects and improve outcome.
      Additionally, repeating MR scans during brachytherapy treatment will allow further assessment
      on motion of the applicator during treatment and the effect on radiation dose. Sexual health
      assessments aim to identify the relationship between sexual health and treatment effects.

      Pre-treatment: Prior to examination under anaesthesia and placement of the intra-uterine
      applicator, in addition to standard assessment of treatment toxicity, the patient may
      complete an optional Sexual Health assessment taking approximately 15 minutes. Following
      standard insertion of the intra-uterine applicator under general anaesthetic and planning MRI
      scan, there is an optional additional MRI scan taking an extra 30 minutes This extra scan
      will not affect the commencement of treatment planning as images from the planning scan will
      be transferred to the treatment planning system as soon as they are obtained. From the MRi
      planning scan, target and specific normal structures are contoured. An individual BT plan
      will be derived based on a standard plan to deliver dose within specified dose volume
      constraints.

      During treatment: During inpatient BT optional MRI scans, each taking 15 minutes will be
      obtained in the period between treatment pulses once during each 24 hours of admission. The
      information from the additional MRI scans will not be used to alter or influence treatment.

      Follow-up: Standard follow-up procedures will be followed, with the optional addition of the
      Sexual Health evaluation at each visit.
