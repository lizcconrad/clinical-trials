    <textblock>
      This study compares three treatments for low back pain that started during pregnancy. The
      study hypothesizes that exercise, spinal manipulation, and a mind-body technique called
      neuroemotional technique (NET) equally affect pain intensity and disability associated with
      pregnancy-related low back pain. The study also hypothesizes that pain intensity and
      disability levels do not influence maternal heart rate variability (a measure of stress) and
      intrauterine attachment (a measure of relationship quality). Ten women will additionally
      provide blood and salivary oxytocin samples during pregnancy and periodically for three
      months after birth. These women and their babies will also be videotaped playing for 5
      minutes at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months postpartum.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy-related low back pain is experienced by over half of all pregnant women. In the
      United States it is thought of as a normal constituent of pregnancy. However, in Europe low
      back pain associated with pregnancy is treated. In the United States pregnancy-related low
      back pain is thought to resolve with birth. However about 1/3 of women who experience
      pregnancy-related low back pain continue to experience back pain for one year postpartum.
      Those women whose low back pain persists into the postpartum period are more at risk of
      experiencing comorbidities such as postpartum depression.

      In the extrauterine life maternal pain limits a mother's ability to securely attach with her
      child. Furthermore, interpretation of pain intensity is influenced by the type of attachment
      the individual has with her parents. Little is known how maternal pain may influence
      intrauterine attachment. Similarly, heart rate variability is influenced by pain and by
      spinal manipulation in non-pregnant populations. However, normal non-pregnant patterns of
      heart rate variability are altered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and
      little is known about why this happens or what this means.

    <description>Specific strengthening exercises demonstrated to improve pregnancy-related low back pain are taught to participants of this arm. Additionally, each participant will be evaluated and additional exercises will be prescribed relevant to her particular needs. Study participants of this arm are asked to perform the exercises at home at least once a day. Exercise is recorded in a diary. Participants follow the same study visit schedule as the two other arms.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Spinal Manipulation</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Women randomized to this arm will be evaluated for spinal subluxations and, if appropriate, treated with chiropractic manipulation. Type of manipulation is determined by presentation. Woman may be manipulated with high velocity low amplitude thrust, blocking, activator, or other appropriate means of manipulating.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Neuroemotional technique (NET)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Neuroemotional technique (NET) is a mind-body technique which combines elements of chiropractic medicine, Chinese medicine, and behavioral psychology. Muscle response testing, a form of functional neurology, and visceral somatic reflexes are used to ascertain whether the pain or dysfunction experienced by the participant has an emotional component. If an emotional component is present, it is identified and the original &quot;triggering&quot; occurrence is identified. The participant creates a snapshot of that original occurrence and while she holds that image in her mind spinal levels which innervate the associated organ are adjusted.</description>
