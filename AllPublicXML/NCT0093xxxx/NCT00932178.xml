    <textblock>
      Calmer Life is a research study for older adults with anxiety. In the program participants
      will have the opportunity to learn skills that may help cope with anxiety. Participants have
      the option of including religion and spirituality into the skill. Skills participants can
      learn include: how to relax, how to change the way you think about things, and how to solve
      problems more effectively.

    <textblock>
      Preliminary work in a related study (H-22763) suggests that a significant percentage of older
      patients think that incorporating religion and/or spirituality into counseling is important.
      Based on data from this study, available scholarly literature, and input from consultants, we
      have developed an initial version of Calmer Life that is sufficiently flexible to incorporate
      a range of religious and spiritual beliefs and coping skills based on each patient's unique
      values and beliefs. The manual for this treatment includes intervention components from
      evidence-based treatment for late-life anxiety (H-23798; H-15958), suggested strategies for
      incorporating religion or spirituality into the coping skills for anxiety and depression, and
      spiritually-based interventions (e.g., forgiveness, gratitude). Patients have a choice to
      include or not include religious or spiritually based components. The proposed project will
      begin to test this broad spiritually based CBT for older adults (Calmer Life) with
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) with or without depression. Further modifications to the
      Calmer Life manual and in the treatment approach will be made based on patient, clinician,
      and consultant input.
