  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) requiring surgery frequently have brain injury
      seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This occurs in approximately 40% of these newborns,
      and even though these are full-term infants, the injury seen closely resembles the same form
      of brain injury that can be seen in premature babies. Much like premature newborns, infants
      with CHD also have long-term neurodevelopmental problems (in over 50%).

      The investigators do not know why infants with CHD get this specific form of brain injury.
      One risk factor is felt to be the inflammation that occurs in response to heart-lung bypass
      (cardiopulmonary bypass, or CPB), a necessary feature of open-heart surgery. Newborns have a
      stronger inflammatory reaction to CPB than older children or adults. The investigators do
      know from animal experiments and other human data that inflammation can be harmful to the
      developing brain.

      The investigators hypothesize that children with CHD requiring surgery as a newborn have
      brain injury due to toxicity from the inflammatory response. The investigators will test this
      by enrolling newborns undergoing heart surgery to measure markers of inflammation, measure
      brain injury by MRI, and then test their developmental outcome at 1 and 2 years of age.

      An association between inflammation and injury might impact what medicines are chosen to
      protect the brain in future studies, even in other populations such as preterm infants.

      Term infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) requiring neonatal surgery have an unusual
      susceptibility to white matter injury (WMI), a neuropathology typically seen in preterm
      infants. The mechanism of this brain injury is unclear. Newborns with CHD may experience a
      dramatic peri-operative inflammatory response during critical periods of neurodevelopment.
      Experimental models suggest certain pro-inflammatory cytokines can be toxic to developing
      oligodendrocytes, resulting in white matter pathology. The consequence of exposure to the
      systemic inflammatory response (SIR) in this group of patients is unknown; however,
      neuroimaging abnormalities (seen in approximately 40%) and neurodevelopmental impairment
      (noted in approximately 50%) are both well established in children with CHD. We hypothesize
      that term newborns with complex CHD requiring neonatal surgery have WMI due to neurotoxicity
      from the profound peri-operative inflammatory response. These hypotheses will be tested in a
      prospective longitudinal study that will characterize the SIR (Aim 1) in a heterogeneous
      group of congenital lesions/surgeries, assess brain injury in the post-operative period (Aim
      2), asses neurodevelopment outcomes at 1 and 2 years (Aim 3), and determine whether
      inflammation plays a mechanistic role (Aim 2a, 3a).
