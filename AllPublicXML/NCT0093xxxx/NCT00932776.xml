  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing intubation and mechanical ventilation require removal of secretion by
      means of trachoebronchial suctioning. Timing of the procedure is mainly based on clinical
      parameters. TBA Care® is a new commercially available device designed to generate a signal
      when secretions are present in the respiratory tract of intubated patients, thus indicating
      the need for endotracheal suctioning only when necessary and prior to clinical deterioration.
      In a prospective randomized trial in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients of a
      general ICU the researchers investigated the efficacy of TBA Care® in detecting the presence
      of retained secretions compared to the standard indicators.
