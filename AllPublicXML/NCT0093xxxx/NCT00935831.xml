  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of single doses of
      compound 1278863A in subjects with renal impairment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compound 1278863A is a novel small molecule agent, which stimulates erythropoiesis through
      inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-prolyl hydroxylases (EGLNs). This compound is
      being developed for the treatment of anemia. This study, PHI112843, will be the first
      administration of 1278863A to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and/or
      pharmacodynamics of single oral doses of 50 mg and 150 mg in pre-dialysis subjects with
      moderate or severe renal impairment and 150 mg in hemodialysis-dependent subjects. Four to
      eight subjects will complete each dose cohort. Multiple blood samples for pharmacokinetic
      and/or pharmacodynamic analyses will be obtained post-dose in each cohort. Safety will be
      assessed by measurement of vital signs, cardiac monitoring, collection of adverse event
      assessments and laboratory safety tests.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A male or female is eligible to enroll and participate in this study if he/she:

               -  (Part 1) has Moderate to Severe Renal Impairment (equivalent to NKF KDOQI Stage 3
                  or 4, not receiving dialysis) as determined by estimated Glomerular Filtration
                  Rate (eGFR) calculated by the abbreviated MDRD equation, OR has Normal Renal
                  Function determined by creatinine clearance (CLCR) via the Cockcroft-Gault
                  equation, using serum creatinine and demographic data, obtained at Screening.
                  Subjects with Normal Renal Function should have no greater than trace blood or
                  protein on Screening urinalysis.

               -  (Part 2) has severe renal impairment (end-stage renal failure) and has been on
                  stable hemodialysis treatment (three times weekly) for 3 months prior to
                  Screening.

               -  otherwise healthy or considered clinically stable with respect to underlying
                  renal impairment as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based
                  on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination,
                  laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring.

               -  has clinical laboratory test results that are considered clinically stable in the
                  opinion of the Principal Investigator, especially if the clinical abnormality or
                  laboratory parameter is deemed associated with the subject's underlying renal
                  impairment. A normal subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
                  outside the reference range may be included only if the Investigator and the
                  Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk
                  factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          2. Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          3. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

             - Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal
             ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is
             confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal
             status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods described
             in the protocol if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they
             must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study
             enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage
             of HRT.

             Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT
             during the study without use of a contraceptive method.

          4. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the
             protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             drug until completion of the Follow-up visit.

          5. Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg and BMI within the range 17 - 33 kg/m2
             (inclusive).

          6. AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5xULN (isolated
             bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin
             &lt;35%).

          7. QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block. These
             can be based on single ECG value or average of triplicate values obtained over brief
             recording period.

          8. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          2. The values of hematological parameters at Screening, for healthy subjects only, are
             outside the reference range and clinically significant deemed by the Investigator and
