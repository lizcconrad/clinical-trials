  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clofarabine is a drug approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for treating
      children (age 1-21) with leukemia. This research study will use clofarabine with two other
      cancer fighting drugs. Clofarabine will be used together with etoposide (VePesid®, VP-16) and
      cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan®).

      Clofarabine, etoposide and cyclophosphamide have been used together in a phase I study to
      find out the highest doses of these drugs that can be safely given to children with relapsed
      or refractory leukemia. This study is a phase II study which will use the drugs to study how
      well these drugs work against AML. This study will also examine the safety of this drug
      combination.
