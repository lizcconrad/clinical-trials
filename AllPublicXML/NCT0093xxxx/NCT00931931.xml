  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed solid tumors such as sarcomas and neuroblastoma have a poor survival,
      generally &lt; 20%. There is an urgent need for new treatments that are safe and effective.

      HSV1716, an oncolytic virus, is a mutant herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I, deleted in the
      RL1 gene which encodes the protein ICP34.5, a specific determinant of virulence. Mutants
      lacking the RL1 gene are capable of replication in actively dividing cells but not in
      terminally differentiated cells - a phenotype exploited to selectively kill tumor cells. In
      previous clinical studies, HSV1716 has been shown to be safe when injected at doses up to
      10^5 plaque forming units (pfu) directly into human high-grade glioma and into normal brain
      adjacent to tumour, following excision of high-grade glioma. In an extension study, HSV1716
      has been shown to be safe when injected at a dose of up to 10^6 pfu directly into brain
      tumours. Replication of HSV1716 in human glioblastoma in situ has been demonstrated.
      Following a single administration of HSV1716 by direct injection into active recurrent tumor
      or brain adjacent to tumor, some patients have lived longer than might have been expected.
      This study seeks to evaluate the safety of a single injection of HSV1716 in the treatment of
      extracranial solid tumors in adolescents and young adults.

      HSV1716 has also proved safe when given by direct intra-tumoural injection in patients with
      squamous carcinoma of the head and neck, and in patients with malignant melanoma.

      Replication of HSV mutants in human sarcomas and neuroblastoma in cultured cells and human
      xenograft models has been demonstrated.

      This study is designed in two parts. PART 1 of the study specifies a single dose of virus.
      Participants who experience at least stable disease or relapse following a determination of
      stable disease, may qualify for subsequent doses in PART 2. PART 2 requires signing of a
      separate consent.

          -  Anti-HSV antivirals: Subjects whose physicians determine that anti-HSV antiviral
             therapy (such as acyclovir, ganciclovir, foscarnet, etc.) cannot be safely
             discontinued from 2 days prior to the injection to 28 days following the injection
             should not be in the study.

          -  Subjects who have other conditions which in the opinion of the investigator
             contra-indicate the receipt of HSV1716 or indicate subject's inability to follow
             protocol requirements.
