  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether extended-release oxymorphone hydrochloride
      taken orally with a high-fat meal, generating an approximately 50% higher Cmax, impacts
      cognitive functioning, using Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB)
      tests, to a greater extent than when taking under conditions of fasting.
