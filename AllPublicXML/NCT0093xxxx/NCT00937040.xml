  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the ADHD symptom response of adults with ADHD treated
      with OROS MPH to those treated with placebo.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that Osmotic Release Oral System (OROS) Extended Release Methylphenidate
      HCL (OROS MPH) is safe and effective in improving Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
      (ADHD) symptoms in adults with ADHD when compared to placebo as demonstrated using specific
      study measures. This is a double-blind (neither participant nor investigator knows the name
      of the assigned study drug), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), placebo-controlled
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OROS MPH using the optimal dose for each adult
      patient in the study with ADHD. The primary efficacy variable in this study is the change
      from baseline to final evaluation using the Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale
      (AISRS) to measure patient ADHD symptoms. Participants will also be assessed for adverse
      events throughout the study. Patients will initiate treatment with oral OROS MPH 18 mg or
      matching placebo at baseline and continue morning dosing with increases every week until an
      optimal dose is achieved, up to the maximum of 72 mg/day of OROS MPH or matching placebo.
      Eligible patients will remain in the study for a maximum of 6 weeks.

    <measure>Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Investigator Symptom Rating Score (AISRS) Over Time Using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) Fourth Edition for Diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, endpoint (42 days or early discontinuation)</time_frame>
    <description>The Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Score (AISRS) assesses 18 core ADHD symptoms corresponding to the DSM-IV diagnostic symptoms for adult subjects based on the investigator's rating for each of the symptoms using a four point scale (0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, and 3=Severe). If a single item is missing the score is imputed and if more than one item is missing, the total score is treated as missing. The AISRS total score is derived by summing the score assigned to each of the 18 symptoms (low=0, high=54, a higher score signifies a greater severity of symptoms).</description>

        <description>The Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Score (AISRS) assesses 18 core ADHD symptoms corresponding to the DSM-IV diagnostic symptoms for adult subjects based on the investigator’s rating for each of the symptoms using a four point scale (0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, and 3=Severe). If a single item is missing the score is imputed and if more than one item is missing, the total score is treated as missing. The AISRS total score is derived by summing the score assigned to each of the 18 symptoms (low=0, high=54, a higher score signifies a greater severity of symptoms).</description>

          <description>The BRIEF-A is a self-reported measure (low=61, high=225, lower scores indicate higher executive functioning) capturing views of the subject's own functioning in the everyday environment. The BRIEF-A contains 75 scored items (1=never, 2=sometimes, 3=often) in 9 non-overlapping clinical scales (Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control, Self-Monitor, Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Task Monitor, and Organization of Materials). The Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI), Metacognition Index (MI), and GEC are then derived.</description>

There are 25 items (questions 15-39) on the scale that describe types of behaviors/ subjective feelings that are highly likely to reduce work productivity/efficiency. These 25 items are rated on a 5-point scale (0=never, 1=rarely, 2=sometimes, 3=often, to 4=almost always) indicating how often the behavior, feeling or attitude has been manifested in the past week. The total score is the sum of the 25 items.</description>

        <title>Subject's Rating of Satisfaction With Treatment Questionnaire - Overall, How Satisfied or Dissatisfied Are You With the Medication You Are Taking for ADHD?</title>
        <description>The satisfaction with treatment questionnaire (low=0, high=20, a lower score indicates lower satisfaction with treatment) requires subjects to answer 4 questions related to how much their ADHD symptoms have changed since starting the medication, how much benefit they received from the medication, the extent, if any, the advantages outweighed the disadvantages, and overall satisfaction with the medication. The responses for this question vary with range of satisfaction (e.g. extremely satisfied, very satisfied, satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied, or extremely dissatisfied).</description>

        <title>Significant Other's (a Spouse, Significant Other or Other Adult in the Household, Described in This Study as the Designated Observer) Rating of Adult ADHD Rating Scale IV</title>
        <description>The ADHD Rating Scale-IV (Significant Other) is an 18-item list of core ADHD symptoms corresponding to the DSM-IV diagnostic symptoms. Each item is rated on a four point Likert type scale (0 = never or rarely, 1 = sometimes, 2 = often, and 3 = very often). The subject’s designated observer will complete this scale, with baseline assessment based on the subject’s usual functioning when not on medication. The total score is derived by summing the score assigned to each of the 18 symptoms (low=0, high=54, a higher score signifies a greater severity of symptoms).</description>

        <description>The Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS) completed by DOs who were spouses or significant others assesses the relationship satisfaction or adjustment of partners in committed couple relationships. The 32-question DAS includes 4 empirically validated subscales that measure: dyadic satisfaction, dyadic consensus, dyadic cohesion and affectional expression. Possible responses include 5-, 6-, and 7-point Likert-scale questions and two yes/no items. The 10-question DAS subset, the Dyadic Satisfaction Subscale, was used in this study (low=0, high=50, higher score means better relationship satisfaction).</description>

        <description>The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) assesses 18 core ADHD symptoms corresponding to the DSM-IV diagnostic symptoms for adult subjects based on the subject's own rating for each of the symptoms using a four point scale (0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, and 3=Severe). If a single item is missing the score is imputed and if more than one item is missing, the total score is treated as missing. The ASRS total score is derived by summing the score assigned to each of the 18 symptoms (low=0, high=54, a higher score signifies a greater severity of symptoms).</description>

        <title>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Total Score</title>
        <description>The PSQI discriminates between good and poor sleepers. The self-administered scale contains 15 multiple-choice items concerning frequency of sleep disturbances and subjective sleep quality and 4 write-in items that inquire about typical bedtime, wake-up time, sleep latency, and sleep duration over the past month. The PSQI generates 7 scores corresponding to the different sleep domains. Each component score ranges from 0 to 3. Total sleep index is calculated by adding up the 7 component scores (low=0, high=21, the lower the score, the better in sleep quality).</description>

        <title>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</title>
        <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is an 8-item self-rated questionnaire designed to assess the overall level of daytime sleepiness. Each item describes normal daily situations (i.e., watching TV, lying down in the afternoon, sitting inactive in a public place) and subjects rate the likelihood of dozing off or falling asleep in each situation. Responses use a 4-point rating scale (0=would never doze, 1=slight chance of dozing, 2=moderate chance of dozing, 3=high chance of dozing). Item scores are summed to produce a total score (range of 0-24) with lower score suggesting more alertness.</description>
