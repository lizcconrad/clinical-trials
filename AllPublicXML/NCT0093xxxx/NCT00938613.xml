      The primary objective of this study was to compare the relative efficacy of Budesonide
      administered via Captisol-Enabled Budesonide nasal solution and Rhinocort Aqua in patients
      with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) exposed to controlled ragweed pollen using an EEC
      model.

          -  Adults (males and females) aged 18 to 65, inclusive

          -  Patients must have documentation of a positive skin test within 12 months of screening
             to ragweed allergen

          -  Non-pregnant, non-lactating females, or women who are post-menopausal or are naturally
             or surgically sterile. Females of childbearing potential must have a confirmed absence

             greater than 50% obstruction

          -  Previous participation in a budesonide study within three months prior to the
             Screening Visit.

          -  Participation in any investigational drug trial within the 30 days preceding the
             Screening Visit, and thereafter.

          -  A known hypersensitivity to any corticosteroid or any of the excipients in the
             formulation of the investigational drug

          -  History of severe respiratory infection or disorder

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse

          -  History of a positive test for HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

          -  Active asthma requiring treatment with inhaled or systemic corticosteroid and/or
             routine use of ß-agonists or any controller drugs, intermittent use (less than or
             equal to 3 uses per week) of inhaled short acting ß-agonists is acceptable.

          -  Use of any of the prohibited medications within the identified exclusion periods

          -  Use of antibiotic therapy for acute conditions within 14 days prior to the Screening
             Visit and thereafter. Low doses of antibiotics taken for prophylaxis are permitted

             Screening Visit AND is expected to continue throughout the study.

          -  Initiation of immunotherapy or dose escalation during the study period. However,
             patients may be considered for inclusion if the immunotherapy was initiated 90 days or
             more prior to the Screening Visit AND if the dosing was stable (maintenance dose) for
             30 days or more prior to the Screening Visit. No immunotherapy injections may be
             received within 48 hours prior to a ragweed pollen exposure visit.

             21 days preceding the Screening Visit.

          -  Exposure to systemic corticosteroids for any indication, chronic or intermittent
             (e.g., arthritis), during the 60 days preceding the Screening Visit, or presence of an

             corticosteroids during the course of the study.

          -  Use of topical corticosteroids in concentrations in excess of 1% hydrocortisone or
             equivalent for dermatological conditions within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit

             significant cardiovascular disease.

             clinical trial:

               -  Impaired hepatic function including alcohol related liver disease or cirrhosis

               -  History of ocular disturbances (e.g., glaucoma or posterior subcapsular
                  cataracts)

               -  Any systemic infection
