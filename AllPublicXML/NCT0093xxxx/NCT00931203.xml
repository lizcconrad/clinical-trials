  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase II trial with combined celecoxib, tegafur-uracil, folinate and
      preoperative radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. The primary end
      point is pathological complete response (pCR) rate. The secondary endpoints are toxicities of
      combined celecoxib and chemoradiation, negative resection margin rate, clinical tumor
      response by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), sphincter preservation rate, disease-free
      survival and overall survival.

      The primary objective is to determine the pathological complete response (pCR) of combining
      preoperative tegafur-uracil, folinate, radiation and celecoxib for locally advanced rectal
      cancer.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to determine:

        1. Toxicity profile of combining celecoxib, tegafur-uracil, folinate and preoperative
           radiation for locally advanced rectal cancer.

        2. Negative resection margins (circumferential resection margin) rate.

        3. Downstaging rate.

        4. Sphincter preservation rate

        5. Locoregional and distant failure rate.

        6. Overall survival

          5. Biopsy proven adenocarcinoma, superior margin of the tumor below the L5-S1 spine
             junction.

             bilirubin &lt; 1.25xULN (upper limit of normal), AST/ALT &lt; 3x ULN, serum creatinine &lt;
             1.25xULN.

          7. Informed consent signed.

             conditions which preclude radical therapy.

          2. History of malignancy within five years (except nonmelanoma skin cancer, CIN cervix).

          3. Pregnancy.

          4. Hypersensitivity to celecoxib, NSAID, sulfonamides or 5-FU.

          5. Cardiovascular disease like congestive heart failure, symptomatic coronary artery
             disease, or myocardiac infarction.
