    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate long-term performance of the 4196 LV Lead. This
      evaluation is based on the number of lead-related complications occurring during the study
      compared to the number of leads enrolled in the study. The leads will be followed for 5 years
      after implant. This study is required by FDA as a condition of approval of the Model 4196 LV
      Lead and is integrated within the Product Surveillance Registry (PAN Registry).
