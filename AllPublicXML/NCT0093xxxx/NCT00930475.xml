  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, mono-center phase I/II study designed to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of RAD001 in combination with
      carboplatin in taxane- and anthracycline-pretreated patients with progressive metastatic
      breast cancer. Additionally, the study is designed to characterize the safety, the
      tolerability and efficacy of this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the phase I part the study will include at least 3 patients at each dose-level until
      MTD is reached. Each cohort will consist of newly enrolled patients. Intra-patient dose
      escalation is not permitted. Once MTD is reached a total of 6 patients will be treated at MTD
      (phase I). For the phase II the minimax two-stage design will be applied. After testing the
      drug on 16 patients in the first stage of phase II, the trial will be terminated if 1 or
      fewer respond (SD, PR, CR). If the trial goes on to the second stage, a total of 34 patients
      will be studied during the phase II part.
