      The aim of our study was to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of the drug Imescard
      compound water smartweed, adrenalin and hamamelis ointment in the treatment of hemorrhoidal
      disease in adults, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

      The drug Imescard compound water smartweed ointment is currently registered at the brazilian
      National Sanitary Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) as a topic hemorrhoidal treatment. It's
      composed by adrenalin, which produces vasoconstriction, benzocaine, an anesthetic, hamamelis,
      which is believed to have a desiccative and astringent activity, and water smartweed
      (Polygonum hydropiperoides), commonly used in the treatment of this condition, with, however,
      little or no evidence other than tradition to support its use. The aim of this study was to
      assess the clinical efficacy and safety of this drug in the treatment of hemorrhoidal disease
      in adults, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

      Sixty healthy volunteers with ages between 18 to 70 years old who presented with 2nd to 4th
      degree hemorrhoids were enrolled after clinical and laboratory evaluation (day 0) and then
      randomized (day 1) to receive either the Imescard ointment after waking up, after evacuations
      and before bedtime, for 5 days, or placebo, with the exact same appearance and posology. At
      followup (day 8), patients underwent new clinical and laboratory evaluation. Main outcome was
      the percentage of patients with 50% improval of symptoms, assessed by a diary containing
      symptom questionnaires concerning every day of treatment. Secondary outcomes were mean scores
      of the symptom questionnaires, life quality improval assessed by WHOQOLbrief at days 1 and 8
      and adverse effects evaluation.
