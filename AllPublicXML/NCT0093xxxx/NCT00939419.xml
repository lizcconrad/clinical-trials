  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is whether the provision of tuberculosis care using volunteer
      community health workers or self-administered treatment for 7 months is equally effective
      with the existing 8 months of TB care in public health facilities by health workers. Patient
      care by volunteer community health workers and 7 months of self-administered treatment are
      more patient-convenient delivery options than the ongoing TB care in health facility.

      Study setting

      The study will be conducted in 10 districts which fully implemented the DOTS program in all
      their health facilities in order to determine whether better patient quality of care and
      convenience using three TB care options could improve treatment outcome. In the study
      districts there are 149 tabias and 1163 kushets with 1.2 million residents representing 30%
      of the total population of the region. All public health facilities (8 hospitals, 11 health
      centres and 48 health posts) in these districts will be included. District hospitals and
      health centres provide TB diagnostic services. The study districts comprise 2316 volunteer
      community health workers (CHWs) who are functional and accountable to the public health
      system.

      Study population

      Patients will be recruited from the 10 study districts of all public health institutions
      which serve both urban and rural population. New patients diagnosed in the study districts (8
      hospitals and 10 of the health centres) and those referred for treatment will be included.
      Patients suspected of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) disease will be diagnosed based on the
      following case definitions:

        1. A patient with at least one of the following criteria will be diagnosed as smear
           positive PTB:

             1. Two initial smear examinations positive by direct microscopy for acid-fast bacilli
                (AFB) or,

             2. One initial smear examination positive by direct microscopy and culture positive,
                or

             3. One initial smear examination positive by direct microscopy and x-ray abnormalities
                suggestive of active TB as determined by the physician.

        2. A patient is diagnosed as smear negative PTB when three initial smear examinations were
           negative by direct microscopy for AFB, and there was failure to respond to a course of
           broad-spectrum antibiotics followed by there were three negative smear examinations and
           x-ray abnormalities suggestive of active TB as determined by the treating physician.

      Both smear positive (PTB+) and smear negative pulmonary (PTB-) patients will be recruited to
      increase the generalizability of the study.

      Pre-trial measures

      Interventions to improve the quality of TB care

      Baseline studies were conducted to determine the quality of TB diagnosis, patient care and
      treatment outcome and to identify alternative options TB care appropriate to local
      conditions. Six months prior to the trial, the limitations of the ongoing DOTS found by these
      studies were communicated to district health office heads, hospital directors and district TB
      experts in order to strengthen the quality of TB care and management of district TB programs.
      Specific tools that were not developed by the National Tuberculosis Program (NTC) to ensure
      consistent application of diagnostic criteria, patient counselling/health information,
      standards on supervisory support, drug supply and district evaluation were prepared in
      consultation with district health management experts and hospital directors. Subsequently,
      district TB coordinators, health institution-based TB focal persons and clinicians were
      trained on patient diagnosis, patient care, community-based tuberculosis care and the study
      protocol. Based on our baseline assessment of quality of care, the following measures which
      improve patient-centred care were instituted at health facility level:

        1. Quality control measures to improve the quality of diagnosis.

        2. Definition of what health information should be conveyed to patients,

        3. Patient teaching using a one to one interactive counselling method.

        4. Training of health workers in TB management (TB focal person) with particular emphasis
           on patient management, management of drug side effects and interpretation of treatment
           outcome, and reporting.

        5. Treatment in patients' most convenient health facilities.

        6. Provision of daily out patient TB services in health facilities.

        7. Continuous support by health workers or CHWs with a workable referral system.

      Tuberculosis treatment registers were translated into the local language and were modified to
      fit with the monitoring and interpretation of treatment outcomes at health facility level for
      patients in the three treatment groups. Volunteer CHWs were also trained by their nearby
      health institution TB focal person on patient care, drug handling, indications for referral,
      managing side effects, and the use of the patient adherence card. Quarterly supervisory
      support was given by regional experts to district health offices, while health institutions
      were supervised on a monthly basis by district TB coordinators. The nearby TB focal person
      provided technical support to volunteer CHWs during their monthly meeting in the respective
      health facilities. Biannual evaluation between district health staff with HQ staff and
      district health staff with TB focal persons were instituted. The implementation of the above
      measures prior to the launching of the trial created 'operational conditions' of components
      of the strategy as recommended by the NTC and International Union against Tuberculosis and
      Lung disease (IUTL)/WHO (Wold Health Organisatio) guidelines. Strengthening the health system
      based on local conditions is assumed to be a basis for determining specific needs, and for
      creating the conditions for the development of the necessary managerial and technical skills
      for effective implementation of a community-based TB care.

      Selection of delivery options for TB care

      Four prominent TB care delivery options were identified from our community based survey:
      Volunteer CHWs, Public health workers, Self-administered treatment and Family member. Further
      assessment regarding their reliability and implications for the DOTS strategy was made using
      the following selection criteria:

        1. Uninterrupted supply of anti-TB drugs to patients could be ensured,

        2. Quality of care comparable to the prevailing health facility based TB care could be
           instituted,

        3. Accountability in terms of guaranteeing proper use of drugs and monthly reporting of
           treatment outcomes of patients to the public health system,

        4. Feasibility in terms of cost when applied on a larger scale and,

        5. Level of acceptance by local communities as determined from our cross-sectional study.

      In addition to the prevailing health facility-based TB care, the use of volunteer CHWs and
      self-administered treatment were found to be appropriate options for pilot testing. Based on
      our criteria, care by family members had the least operational feasibility because the costs
      involved to families (labour cost from interruptions of daily activities and transport cost)
      and the health systems (health worker time and cost of training) could be high. Operational
      difficulties were also anticipated in setting up an appropriate system for monitoring of
      anti-TB drugs used, provision of health education, referral, monthly reporting of treatment
      outcome particularly among family members who could be in remote parts of the region.

      The decentralization of TB care at community level using the existing volunteer CHWs program
      was anticipated to be a feasible option to institute most of the components of the
      WHO-recommended DOTS strategy. Volunteer CHWs can be trained in patient care on a continuous
      basis. Accountability on anti-TB drugs used and reporting on treatment outcomes can be
      obtained using the existing link between CHWs and nearby public health facilities. The
      services they render are appreciated by respective communities. The self-administered
      treatment option was considered after critical examination of previous effectiveness studies,
      patients' convenience to tuberculosis care and, most importantly, taking into account the
      views expressed by communities and patients. Operational challenges, in which health workers
      could be forced to allow patients to take treatment by themselves when there are no volunteer
      CHWs who could offer TB care in remote areas was also considered.

      Defining intervention arms

      The final step was how optimal quality of TB care with less inconvenience could be reached
      among the two alternative options from patients' perspective in order to achieve optimum
      treatment outcome target. These integrated interventions were therefore targeted to test
      treatment outcome by instituting both a comparable patient quality care and patient
      convenience to TB care among the three strategies. In order to do this three factors were
      considered.

        1. Epidemiological factors From the baseline study, most patients do not interrupt
           treatment during the intensive phase of treatment. But, the occurrence of death is high
           during the first 2 months of treatment. Even though its contribution is unknown in
           Ethiopia, the high HIV-TB co-morbidity and mortality during anti-TB therapy has been
           attributed in other sub-Saharan countries. Thus, proper management in health facilities
           during the first 28 days for patients assigned into volunteer CHW care or
           self-administered groups would ensure their health care needs.

        2. Operational factors The intervention was designed to be implemented under operational
           conditions of the district health system and the ongoing community-based volunteer CHW
           programme. CHWs get technical and material support form nearby health facilities. They
           are required to submit their activity report at these facilities on a monthly basis.
           This arrangement has been found effective in maintaining the functionality of CHWs while
           minimizing disruptions in their daily life. Given this operational condition, patients
           have to be managed in nearby health facilities for the first four weeks until proper
           selection and introduction with respective CHWs are made. Other operational factors in
           favour of this arrangement include its feasibility when scaling up the intervention, low
           time cost of CHWs and the health system. This operational set up was anticipated to
           enable TB focal persons to organize a monthly evaluation session with CHWs in their
           catchments.

        3. Ethical issues Health interventions should be safe and minimize potential risks leading
           to patient morbidity and mortality. In Ethiopia a significant proportion of tuberculosis
           patients are also infected with HIV. The fact that assigning such patients into an
           intervention whose effectiveness is unknown (volunteer CHWs) or allowing them to die
           (self-administer group) was also regarded as unethical.

      Interventions

      Accordingly, all patients should receive daily TB care including observed daily doses of
      treatment for the first 28 days from the most convenient health facility. Patients have to be
      properly counselled about their illness and managed accordingly by the TB focal persons.
      Counselling should be conducted using a standard procedure developed from our baseline
      studies in order to ensure good quality of tuberculosis care. They should be taught
      specifically on the causes and prevention of TB, side effects of drugs, treatment adherence
      and the schedule for follow up examinations. During this time, the TB focal persons need to
      assist patients to select volunteer CHWs from their village. They should explain their role
      and created confidence between them. All eligible patients should be treated using anti-TB
      drugs recommended by the national tuberculosis control of Ethiopia. PTB+ patients should
      receive weight adjusted Ethambutol (E), Rifampicin (R), Isoniazid (H) and Pyrazinamide (Z)
      during the first 8 weeks of treatment followed by 6 months of EH, while PTB- should be
      treated with weight adjusted RHZ for two months, followed by 6 months of EH.

      Patients assigned to the health worker-TB care group (HW-TC) should be followed as per the
      national TB guideline, i.e. daily care including observed treatment by the TB focal persons,
      in their respective nearby health institutions during the first 8 weeks followed by
      self-administered treatment for the remaining 6 months. During the continuation phase
      patients are expected to visit their nearby health facility every month for follow up.
      Supervisory support will be given to TB focal persons by the respective district TB
      coordinators on a monthly basis. Anti-TB drugs will be delivered to health institutions on a
      quarterly basis by district TB coordinators during supervision.

      Patients assigned to the volunteer CHW-TB care group (CHW-TC) should have daily TB care by
      the CHWs in their villages for the second month followed by a monthly visit to the CHWs' home
      for the remaining 6 months of self-administered treatment. Patients are expected to visit
      health facility at the end of the second months and the end of treatment for sputum
      examination. Technical support and anti-TB drugs should be given to CHWs by TB focal persons
      every fortnight.

      Those assigned to the self-administered treatment group (SA-TC) should take their medication
      at home for seven months. They should be taught by the TB focal person to collect their
      anti-TB drugs fortnightly and report missed daily doses. Follow up assessment and continued
      support should be made by TB focal persons on a monthly basis in their nearby health
      facility. Patients should also be told to report when they encountered severe side effects.

      Procedures

      A randomized controlled design will be used to compare the existing HW-TC with CHW-TC and
      self-administered treatment. Eligible PTB+ and PTB- patients should be assigned using random
      numbers, computer generated by a statistician at regional level. To avoid disproportionate
      allocations among treatment groups two separate random blocks of 3 for PTB+ and PTB- are
      arranged. Two sets of sequentially numbered sealed envelopes for each district will be
      prepared. Two separate boxes containing sealed envelopes for PTB+ and PTB- will be given to
      the head of each district health office. The district recruiting officers should obtain the
      allocation arm for each patient from these district health office heads. For each district,
      allocation codes used should be recorded weekly by telephone. A statistician will monitor the
      quality of assignment by cross checking the original list in the research HQ with the
      sequence of patients' attendance for recruitment. Recruiting officers will be trained using a
      pre-tested guideline prepared to ensure that standard procedures are applied consistently in
      screening and informing patients. Written consent should be obtained from every patient
      following proper counselling, with particular emphasis on tuberculosis treatment and the
      alternative options of care. Patients who refused the randomly assigned method of TB care
      should be allowed to select either of the two remaining care options.

      A request for a haemoglobin test from every eligible patient should be made by the health
      facility TB focal person in the diagnostic health facilities (hospitals and health centres)
      in order to collect serum for anonymous HIV testing before patients are sent to the district
      recruiting officer. Laboratory technicians should send 5 cc of serum labelled by a coding
      system developed by the Regional Research Laboratory (RRL) in the HQ. HIV test (Determine®
      HIV-1/2, Abboti Laboratories) results should be made available to the research team at the
      end of the trial. Baseline data should be collected from each eligible patient before he/she
      is referred to the most convenient health facility. Patients are only identified by code
      numbers in order to maintain confidentiality about their assignment. The codes should be
      revealed to the study team after the preliminary data analysis and draft reporting phases are
      completed.

      Standard treatment outcome indicators developed by the WHO and the NTC will be used to
      compare the effectiveness of the strategies. Treatment outcome data will be collected by a
      team of three tuberculosis experts who are not involved in the study. Treatment outcome of
      PTB+ patients should be assessed by sputum microscopy for the presence of acid fast bacilli
      while clinical improvements and adherence to treatment will be used to assess the outcome of
      PTB- patients by clinicians. Cure and treatment completion rates are used to compare
      treatment groups. A patient is declared cured if confirmed to be sputum smear negative at the
      end of treatment or one month prior to the completion of treatment and on at least one
      previous occasion. A patient should be recorded as &quot;treatment completed&quot; if smear results
      were not available on at least two occasions or has negative pre-treatment results. A patient
      who has been on treatment for at least 4 weeks and whose treatment was interrupted for more
      than 8 consecutive weeks or for a cumulative period of more than 12 weeks should be
      classified as a defaulter and a patient who remains smear-positive at 5 months or later
      during treatment should be considered to be a failure. A patient who had started treatment
      for at least 4 weeks and had been transferred to another district should be recorded as
      transferred out.

      Statistical analysis

      The comparative effectiveness of health workers-TB care to that of volunteer CHW-TC and SA-TC
      in randomized control trials has never been reported so far. It is hypothesized that no
      significant difference in cure and treatment completion rate among the three care groups
      would be shown, taking the prevailing health facility-based TB care as the gold standard of
      care. The sample size for PTB+ (179 patients per arm) was planned to detect at least a 10%
      difference in treatment success rates between any of care groups (assuming 85% treatment
      success rate in the highest arm and a baseline treatment success rate of 72%) with a power of
      80% at a significant level of 5%. With the same assumption (85% treatment completion rate in
      the highest arm and a baseline treatment completion rate of 69%), all eligible PTB- patients
      (131 patients per arm) should also be included during the study period. Separate comparisons
      of effectiveness between the three methods of TB care will be carried out for PTB+ and PTB-
      patients. Comparison of effectiveness of the care groups will be undertaken according to the
      principle of intention-to-treat. The strength of association between treatment outcomes and
      each care group will be determined using the chi-square test. Adjusted effects of patients'
      characteristics, area of residence, HIV status, time elapsed by each patient for treatment,
      the type of health facility and method of TB care used on treatment outcomes will be computed
      using logistic regression analysis.
