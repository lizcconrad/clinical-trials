  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative anxiety is characterized by subjective feelings of tension, apprehension,
      nervousness and worry. In children, preoperative anxiety is reported to result in
      postoperative negative psychological effects, including nightmares, eating problems and
      increased fear of doctors. Previous studies have assessed anxiety in children during the
      preoperative period and the effects of premedication and parental presence. Midazolzam has
      been shown to reduce preoperative anxiety in children but post operative recovery maybe
      delayed for children undergoing a short operative procedure. Distraction may be particularly
      helpful in children ages 6-12 as these children are curious about their environment. An
      association between preoperative anxiety and emergence agitation has been suggested.
      Emergence agitation in children is not well understood but is a frightening experience for
      child and parent. A previous study demonstrated the efficacy of hand held video games used as
      an interactive distraction to allay preoperative anxiety. The purpose of this study is to
      treat preop anxiety with premedication, or video game and to evaluate the impact of these
      interventions on the incidence and severity of emergence agitation.
