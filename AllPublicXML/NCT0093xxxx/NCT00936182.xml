  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antifungal therapy is widely used for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The
      current investigation will examine the effects of fluconazole on behavioral functioning among
      children with ASD. This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of oral
      fluconazole in children who meet criteria for ASD. Pre- and post-treatment behavioral ratings
      will be used to evaluate the efficacy of fluconazole therapy. In addition, children will
      undergo comprehensive medical history, physical examination, and laboratory analyses.

      Our objective is to quantify differences in behavioral functioning between the fluconazole
      treatment and a placebo. Our primary hypothesis is that, on average and relative to the
      placebo, children with ASD who receive fluconazole will show greater improvements in symptoms
      of autism.
