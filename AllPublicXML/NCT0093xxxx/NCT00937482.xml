  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of cediranib maleate when given
      together with whole brain radiation therapy in treating patients with brain metastases from
      non-small cell lung cancer. Cediranib maleate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth or by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Radiation
      therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink
      tumors. Giving cediranib maleate together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability (maximum tolerated dose, or MTD) of AZD2171 when
      combined with WBRT in patients with brain metastases.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the objective response rate (ORR) in the central nervous system (CNS),
      neurologic progression-free survival (N-PFS), overall survival, and cause of death, and to
      explore the vascular normalization window using serial, noninvasive imaging parameters.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral cediranib maleate on day 1. Patients undergo whole-brain radiotherapy 5
      days a week for 3 weeks beginning on day 3. Treatment continues treatment in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
