  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of a
      valsartan/amlodipine-based treatment with a losartan-based treatment in patients with Stage 2
      systolic hypertension (high blood pressure, mean systolic blood pressure greater than 160 and
      less than 200 mmHg).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female outpatient of 18 years of age or greater

          -  Stage 2 systolic hypertension defined as office Mean Sitting Systolic blood pressure
             (MSSBP) greater than or equal to 160 and &lt; 200 mmHg at randomization

          -  Patients who were able to participate in the study, and who gave written informed
             consent before any study assessment was performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Office systolic blood pressure &gt;200 and/or mean sitting diastolic blood pressure
             (MSDBP) greater than or equal to 110 mmHg at Visit 1.

          -  Use of four (4) or more antihypertensive medications within 30 days of Visit 1.

          -  Refractory hypertension, defined as blood pressure &gt;140/90 mmHg while taking three (3)
             drugs at the maximum dose of each drug, one of which must be a diuretic. (Therapy with
             a fixed-dose combination of two active medications represents two drugs).

          -  Inability to safely discontinue all antihypertensive medications for 1-2 weeks prior
             to randomization.
