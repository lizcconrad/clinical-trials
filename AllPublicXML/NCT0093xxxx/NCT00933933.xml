      To test blood specimens using a new investigational test that detects antigen and antibody to
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Results will be compared to an approved HIV antibody test
      and supplemental testing performed to determine HIV status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All specimens collected under separate specimen collection protocols or obtained from
      specimen suppliers will be provided to the clinical sites performing the investigational HIV
      test.

      This includes 6252 specimens collected from normal healthy individuals (7B5-02-05Z01-01:
      Collection of Specimens Used in Abbott Laboratories In Vitro Diagnostic HIV and Hepatitis
      Assays Clinical Studies)and from specimen suppliers. 588 specimens from HIV-infected
      pediatric subjects and 448 pregnant females at risk for HIV infection collected under
      protocol (7B5-02-05Z01-02: Collection of Pediatric and Pregnant Female Specimens Used in the
      Abbott Laboratories In Vitro Diagnostic HIV Assay)and from specimen suppliers. All specimens
      were previously collected and frozen, except for a subset of 586 specimens from normal
      healthy population and 55 specimen from pregnant females at risk for HIV infection which were
      collected under separate specimen collection protocols and tested as fresh specimens during
      the study.

      In addition, 83 specimens that were HIV antigen positive, 1121 specimens that were HIV-1
      antibody positive, 201 specimens that were HIV-2 antibody positive, and 1409 specimens from
      US at risk for HIV infection or from HIV-2 endemic area were all obtained from specimen
      suppliers, except for 11 pediatric specimens collected under a separate protocol
      (7B5-02-05Z01-02: Collection of Pediatric and Pregnant Female Specimens Used in the Abbott
      Laboratories In Vitro Diagnostic HIV Assay).

            <description>Specimens collected from 203 pregnant females: 153 specimens collected from pregnant females with documented risk factors for HIV and 50 were surplus serum specimens collected pregnant females from a health clinic offering HIV testing. Spcimens from 55 of the pregnant females with risk for HIV infection were collected under a specimen collection protocol and tested with the investigational and FDA-licensed comparator assay during the study. The remaining specimens were obtained from specimen vendors and tested with the investigational HIV test.</description>

          <description>Reactivity was determined by the results of the Architect HIV Ag/Ab Combo assay and supplemental testing by HIV-1 Western blot, HIV-2 Western blot, and HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) test.</description>
          <population>Final HIV status determined for specimens reactive by investigational assay and/or comparator by supplement testing algorithm. Supplemental testing involved HIV-1 Western blot, HIV-2 EIA, HIV-2 Western blot, HIV-1 p24 Antigen assay and HIV-1 RNA. HIV positive status determined by HIV-1 Western blot.</population>
