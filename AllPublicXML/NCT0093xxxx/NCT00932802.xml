    <textblock>
      The observation period for each patient covered an initial treatment period with Avelox® plus
      optional 2 long-term follow-up periods (6 and 12 months).For each patient, the physician
      documented data at any initial visit (baseline) and at least one short-term follow-up visit
      (=initial treatment period).Optionally, long-term follow-ups (6 and 12 months) were
      documented, and a patient questionnaire was filled in.
