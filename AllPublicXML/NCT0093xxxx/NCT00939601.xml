  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a serious sleep disorder in which a person repeatedly stops
      breathing or experiences shallow breathing for short periods of time during sleep. The most
      common treatment for OSA is the use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine,
      but many people have trouble adhering to the treatment schedule. This study will evaluate the
      effectiveness of two behavioral therapy programs used in combination with CPAP for improving
      treatment adherence in people with OSA.
