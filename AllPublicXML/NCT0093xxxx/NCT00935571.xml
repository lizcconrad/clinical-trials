  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of postthoracotomy pain between total
      intravenous anesthesia (TIVA)and inhalation anesthesia after lung surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thoracotomy is one of the most painful surgical incisions. It has been shown that 5-80% of
      patients still suffer from thoracic pain 2-3 months after surgery and the international
      association for the study of pain (IASP) defines postthoracotomy pain syndrome (PTTS)as pain
      that recurs or persists at least 2 months after surgical procedure. Previous reports have
      shown that the incidence of PTTS varies according to preoperative pain, pain intensity, sex,
      and types of procedure. However, little is known about the effect of the type of anesthesia
      to postthoracotomy pain.
