  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate time to progression in breast cancer patients
      vaccinated with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with peptides in combination with adjuvant
      aromatase inhibitor (AI), Thymosin 1 alpha and interleukin-2. The secondary aim is to
      investigate whether a measurable immune response can be induced, and to evaluate the clinical
      effect (objective response rate) of the vaccination regime.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only patients who have tumors &gt; 5 % positive for p53 by IHC can be referred to this
      treatment. All patients will receive standard dosage of AI +/- p53-DC vaccination. Patients
      who express HLA-A2 will also receive DC vaccination. Patients that do not express HLA-A2 will
      receive only AI and be regarded as controls.

      The vaccination regime consists of primary 10 intradermal injections of 1-2 weeks interval
      (q1w x 4 → q2w x 6) with p53 peptide-pulsed dendritic cells, followed by monthly injections
      until progression; proleukin and Zadaxin are used as vaccine adjuvants.

      Defined procedures are employed for generation of autologous dendritic cells for clinical
      application in a classified laboratory. Unmobilized leukapheresis will be used for isolation
      of large-scale mononuclear cells, and dendritic cells will be generated from monocytes by
      cytokine stimulation and loaded with p53 peptides. Frozen preparations of dendritic cells
      will be prepared using automated cryopreservation.Each patient will receive a minimum of
      5x10^6 dendritic cells per treatment supplemented with interleukin-2 6 MIU/m² sc per vaccine
      and 1.6 mg Thymosin 1 alpha sc x 2/week.

      Toxicity including autoimmunity will be evaluated using the common Toxicity Criteria (CTC).
