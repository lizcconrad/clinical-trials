    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of montelukast on symptom-free days in
      unselected group of very young children with wheeze and recurrent asthma like symptoms. The
      secondary aim was to evaluate the effect of montelukast on lung function, airway
      responsiveness, airway inflammation and use of rescue medication.

      The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of montelukast in wheezy very
      young children with persistent respiratory symptoms. This study was a prospective,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 6 to 24 months old children, who had at least one
      physician-diagnosed wheezing episode and persistent asthmatic symptoms. Patients were
      randomised to placebo or montelukast 4 mg / day for 8 weeks period. The clinical response to
      treatment was determined, the functional residual capacity (FRC) and specific air-way
      conductance (sGaw) was measured using an infant whole-body pletys-mograph, the maximal flow
      at functional residual capacity (VÂ´maxFRC) was re-corded using the squeeze technique and
      airway responsiveness was evaluated by performing a dosimetric methacholine challenge test.
