      chronic post-thoracotomy pain.

      This study is a prospective double blind randomized controlled trial evaluating the
      peri-operative use of gabapentin in the prevention or modulation of post-thoracotomy
      hyperalgesia. Treatment will consist of a 600 mg dose of gabapentin or placebo given
      preoperatively the night before surgery, based on a computer generated randomized assignment.
      The treatment group will continue to be medicated with gabapentin 300 mg twice daily for one
      month following surgery. Those not included in the treatment arm of the study will continue
      to take a placebo for the same duration. Follow-up will consist of a postoperative visit at
      approximately 48 hours and a one month clinical visit.
