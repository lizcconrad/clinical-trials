      RATIONALE: Crizotinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of crizotinib and
      to see how well it works in treating young patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors
      or anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To estimate the maximum-tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of crizotinib
           administered orally twice daily to children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors or
           anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL).

        -  To define and describe the toxicities of this drug when administered on this schedule.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of this drug within the confines of a
           phase I study.

        -  To obtain initial phase II data on the antitumor activity of this drug in children with
           relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma or ALCL.

        -  To preliminarily examine the relationship between response to treatment and anaplastic
           lymphoma kinase gene status (e.g., the presence of a mutation, duplication,
           amplification, and/or translocation) in children with relapsed or refractory
           neuroblastoma or ALCL.

        -  To preliminarily examine the relationship between minimal residual disease status and
           clinical response to treatment in children with ALCL.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive oral crizotinib twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Plasma and whole blood samples are collected for pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic
      analysis. Tumor tissue (from patients with neuroblastoma) and bone marrow and/or peripheral
      blood (from patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma) samples are collected for further
      correlative laboratory studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
