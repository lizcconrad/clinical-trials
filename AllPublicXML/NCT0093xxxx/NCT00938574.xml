      This is a phase I, prospective, open-label, single center, dose finding study with Atu027 (an
      siRNA formulation) given as single treatment followed by repeated treatment (repeated
      treatment phase: 8 treatments within 4 weeks) as therapy in subjects with advanced solid
      cancer.

          5. Subjects must have recovered from the acute reversible effects of previous anti-cancer
             therapies. At least 30 days since major surgery and at least 5 half-lives (t1/2) must
             have elapsed since treatment with any investigational agent.

          6. Adequate marrow, hepatic, renal, and heart function at the time of screening.

          7. Weight &gt;/= 50kg.

          8. Subjects must have at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST.

          9. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at baseline.

         10. Women of childbearing potential and men must be willing to use highly effective
             contraceptive methods during the course of the study and three months after.

         11. Subjects must be willing and able (in the opinion of the investigator) to understand
             the subject information and informed consent form and to comply with the study
             protocol and procedures.

         12. Subjects must be willing and able to give written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases.

          2. Peripheral venous access insufficient to permit intravenous infusion or acquisition of
             laboratory specimen.

          3. Major surgery within 30 days prior to first study treatment.

          4. Evidence that subject has only insufficiently recovered from the acute reversible
             effects of previous anti-cancer therapies or surgery.

          5. Abnormal hematologic parameters as defined:
