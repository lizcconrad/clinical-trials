  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to define the effect of Tysabri in patients with
      relapsing-remitting (RR) multiple sclerosis (MS) over 2 years. The investigators will also
      explore the extent of remyelination in MS patients treated with Tysabri over 2 years.

      A secondary objective of this study is to investigate differences in the capacity for
      remyelination between patients who do or do not respond to Tysabri monotherapy during the
      same 24 months.

      A tertiary objective of this study is to monitor Tysabri effect in MS antiphospholipid
      antibodies positive and MS antiphospholipid antibodies negative patients and to determine
      perfusion differences according to the antiphospholipid antibodies positivity status.

    <textblock>
      Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) is a widely used tool for characterizing the evolution
      of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions and normal appearing brain tissue (NABT). As remyelination
      and demyelination are heterogeneous in each lesion and NABT, techniques such as voxel-wise
      based MTR dynamic mapping may help predict an individual's clinical course, as well as the
      effect of treatment, by revealing evidence of myelin repair and neuroprotection.

      Natalizumab (Tysabri) showed a robust effect on the decrease of inflammation in phase II and
      III clinical trials, as evidenced by the decrease in Gd enhancing and T2 lesions and on the
      decrease of clinical activity as measured by reduction of clinical relapses and progression
      of disability. The effect of Tysabri on non-conventional measures is only partially known.
