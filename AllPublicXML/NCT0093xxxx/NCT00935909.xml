  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this prospective, randomized trial is successful intravenous (IV)
      cannulation on first attempt with the use of either the Vein Viewer (VV) or standard
      cannulation method. The secondary purpose is to find out if there is a difference in the
      total time to successful cannulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single initial data page will be filled out by one of the study team members present with
      the IV Team at the time of the cannulation. The data from these forms will be entered by the
      investigator or research assistant into a database maintained only for this study. There will
      be two groups in this randomized study. One group will receive IV cannulation with the VV and
      the second group will receive standard cannulation without the VV. The chance of receiving
      either treatment is based on randomly generated computer codes, unknown by the IV team. We
      want to evaluate successful IV cannulation on first attempt as well as the time taken for
      cannulation. All documents will be de-identified of data that contains HIPAA protected health
      information (PHI) at the end of the study. We estimate approximate enrollment to be 790
      children. The study is expected to last 12 months and will only be conducted at Children's
      Medical Center Dallas.
