      The aim of this study is to verify, through clinical examination and doppler, the
      non-inferiority of the drug test (heparin sodium 5.000UI/0.25 mL - HIPOLABOR) in relation to
      the drug compared (heparin sodium 5.000USP/mL - APP) in preventing the development of venous
      thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing surgery for medium risk for the development of
      this pathology.
