    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase II study of a vaccine comprising melanoma peptides and a tetanus
      helper peptide, administered in GM-CSF-in-adjuvant. Patients will be randomized to receive
      one of two different vaccine regimens. Patients will be stratified by stage of disease (IIB
      versus III versus IV).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each vaccination will be administered over a 6-week period (days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, 43).
      Patients will be randomized into one of two groups, Group A or Group B.

      Group A will receive 4 class I MHC-restricted synthetic melanoma peptides (1 each restricted
      by HLA-A1, -A3, and two restricted by HLA-A2) and a tetanus helper peptide.

      Group B will receive the 12 class I MHC-restricted synthetic melanoma peptides (4 each
      restricted to HLA-A1, -A2, and -A3) and a tetanus helper peptide.

      All vaccines will contain GM-CSF-in-adjuvant and will be administered intradermally and
      subcutaneously. Concurrent with the first three of these vaccinations, each patient will also
      receive an additional set of 3 identical vaccinations in a distal site, the response to which
      will be evaluated at the draining lymph node. This node will be harvested using lymphatic
      mapping and sentinel node biopsy methods and will be referred to as the sentinel immunized
      node (SIN).

          -  Patients may not have been vaccinated previously with any of the peptides that are
             included in this protocol. Other investigational drugs or investigational therapy will

             females must agree, in the consent form, to use effective birth control methods during
             the course of vaccination. This is consistent with existing standards of practice for
             vaccine and chemotherapy protocols.

          -  Patients who have systemic autoimmune disease with visceral involvement.

          -  Patients who have another cancer diagnosis, except that the following diagnoses will
             be allowed: squamous cell cancer of the skin without known metastasis, basal cell
             cancer of the skin without known metastasis, carcinoma in situ of the breast (DCIS or
             LCIS), carcinoma in situ of the cervix, any cancer without distant metastasis that has
             been treated successfully, without evidence of recurrence or metastasis for over 5
             years.

          -  Patients with known addiction to alcohol or drugs who is actively taking those agents,
             or patients with recent (within 1 year) or ongoing illicit IV drug use.
