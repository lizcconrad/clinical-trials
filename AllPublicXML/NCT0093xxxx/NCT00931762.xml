    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of Panobinostat as a single agent in the
      treatment of Primary Myelofibrosis, Post-Polycythemia Vera and Post-Essential
      Thrombocythemia. There will be two cohorts - patients with JAK2 mutation and patients without
      JAK2 mutation.
