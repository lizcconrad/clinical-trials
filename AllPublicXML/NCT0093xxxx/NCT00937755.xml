  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is one of the most severe mental illnesses. The antipsychotic drugs, introduced
      in early 1950s, have revolutionized the treatment of schizophrenia. About 2 to 4 times as
      many patients relapse when treated with a placebo as do those treated with antipsychotic
      drugs. For these medications to be maximally beneficial, they must have an acceptable side
      effect profile and be taken as prescribed. One untoward effect of many antipsychotic drugs is
      weight gain. The extent of weight gain apparently varies by drug, which may be because of
      drugs'differing degrees of action on serotonergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic, and other
      neurotransmitter systems. Obesity is a threat to health and longevity. Weight gain may also
      cause patients taking antipsychotic medication to discontinue their medication, which may
      predispose them to relapse.

      The pattern of weight gain and metabolic disturbance may vary between the different
      antipsychotic agents. The underlying mechanism and treatment of these adverse metabolic
      effects remain unclear. This study will recruit 60 schizophrenic patients during. The
      patients received monotherapy with atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine, or
      risperidone). The assessment of metabolic profile will be monitored at baseline, week 2, week
      4, and week 8. The measurements include anthropometrical parameters, body composition,
      glucose level, insulin level, lipid profile, and leptin level. Intra-venous glucose tolerance
      test will be used to assess the insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity.

      This proposal broadly aims to discover the underlying mechanism of antipsychotics induced
      metabolic disturbance and develop efficient treatment to correct it.
