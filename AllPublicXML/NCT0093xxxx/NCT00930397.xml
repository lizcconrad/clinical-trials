  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-eclampsia and intra uterine growth restriction (IUGR) represent major complications for
      pregnant women, with a high related maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. It is now
      widely admitted that these pathologies, which can concern up to 7% of pregnancies, are in
      relation with hypo-perfusion of the placenta because of an early deficient trophoblast
      invasion and uterine vascular remodelling.Advances in ultrasound imaging now permit non
      invasive 3D volume and Doppler signal quantification using automatic
      acquisitions.Quantitative comparison of volumes and Doppler parameters between control
      pregnancies and IUGR ought to confirm the theory of UTERO-placental hypo-perfusion. This
      technique might allow an earlier prediction for IUGR. The aim of this study is to evaluate
      the interest of 3D Doppler quantification as a new screening tool for pre eclampsia and IUGR.

      One hundred high risk women and 70 low risk women will be included. Inclusion criteria for
      the high risk group are: personal history of pre eclampsia and/or IUGR in a previous
      pregnancy, diabetes, auto-immune syndrome such as LUPUS, hypertension, renal insufficiency,
      and anti-phospholipid syndrome.Patients (over 18 years old) will be included between 11 and
      14(+6days) WG. Only singletons pregnancies will be included.3D Doppler standardized
      acquisitions of the UTERO-placental unit will be performed at each usual ultrasound
      examination of the pregnancy.Data will be analysed after delivery, in terms of quantified
      Doppler values, comparing two groups: pregnancies with pre eclampsia / IUGR (group with
      pathology) and normal pregnancies (control group).This is an observational study.
