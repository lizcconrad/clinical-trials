      Primary:

      To assess the effects of CYP2B6 inhibition by repeated dose Clopidogrel (75 mg/day)
      co-administration on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of Neramexane

      Secondary:

      To assess safety and tolerability of Neramexane single dose treatment alone and
      co-administration of a Neramexane single-dose with a Clopidogrel repeated dose treatment

             potential must agree to use a highly effective method of birth control defined as
             those which result in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1 % per year) when used
             consistently and correctly such as sexual abstinence, vasectomised partner, non
             hormonal IUDs, double barrier methods, for instance, e.g. condom and spermicide cream.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of clinically relevant allergy or known hypersensitivity to Neramexane/
             Memantine/Amantadine and their derivatives

          2. History of clinically relevant allergy or known hypersensitivity to Clopidogrel

          3. Exposure to another investigational agent within the last two months before Day 1 of
             Period 1

          4. History of clinically relevant allergy or known hypersensitivity to any inactive
             ingredient in any of the used investigational products or the metabolic inhibitor

          5. Lactating or pregnant females or females planning to become pregnant during study
             conduct or within 2 months after end of study

          6. Any contraindications which are indicated in the topically valid SPC for Plavix®:

             intracranial hemorrhage

             Lack of suitability for the trial:

          7. Any evidence of a significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatic,
             gastrointestinal, endocrinological, metabolic or other disease at screening

          8. History of malignancy

          9. Any clinically relevant deviation in clinical or laboratory assessment

         10. ECG abnormalities of clinical relevance, in particular abnormal prolongations of
             QT/QTc-interval (i.e. QTc ≥ 450 ms, PQ ≥ 220 ms)

         11. Systolic blood pressure &lt;95 mmHg or &gt;150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &lt; 50 mmHg or

             absorption or may otherwise influence the pharmacokinetics of the investigational
             medicinal products (e.g. cholecystectomy, ulcus, etc.)
