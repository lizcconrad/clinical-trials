  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether the oral administration of the probiotic VSL#3
      under randomized, placebo-controlled conditions will improve symptoms of irritable bowel
      syndrome in children, safely.

      Determine the safety and efficacy of different doses of VSL#3 in the treatment of children
      with irritable bowel syndrome: Children will be recruited from the pediatric gastroenterology
      clinic at The Children's Medical Center in Dayton, Ohio. Eighty four children will be
      enrolled in this controlled, double-blinded, randomized study. All children will have had a
      prior evaluation by a pediatric gastroenterologist who has diagnosed these patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome and excluded organic disease as a cause of the child's abdominal
      pain.
