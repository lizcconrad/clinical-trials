  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, blinded, two-period, two-sequence, crossover study, with
      a minimum 3-week washout period between treatments.The study is designed to evaluate the
      bioequivalence of SID530 to Taxotere.

      It will be conducted in study participants with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have
      failed platinum therapy and also in participants with locally advanced or metastatic breast
      cancer who have failed at least one line of chemotherapy.

      Eligible study participants must be planning to have at least two consecutive 21-day cycles
      with 75 mg/m2 docetaxel monotherapy.

      The duration of study participation will be approximately 7 weeks. The study has three study
      phases: Screening (&lt;=1 week), Cycle 1 (21 days), and Cycle 2 (21 days).

      Study participants who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to one of two treatment
      sequences (i.e., SID530 on Day 1 followed by Taxotere on Day 21 or Taxotere on Day 1 followed
      by SID530 on Day 21). Randomization will be stratified by whether the study participant
      received prior docetaxel treatment.

      All study participants will be premedicated with oral dexamethasone, 16 mg per day (e.g. 8 mg
      b.i.d.) for three days, starting one day prior to each study drug infusion, in order to
      reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well as the severity of
      hypersensitivity reactions. During each treatment cycle, both the test and the reference
      treatments will receive identical dosages of docetaxel (i.e., 75 mg/m2, by i.v. infusion,
      over 1 hour).

      Study completion will be defined as completing all protocol-specified procedures. Study
      participants who are prematurely withdrawn from the study will be requested to complete the
      assessments conducted at the Final Visit.

      Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be obtained at the predefined times during
      Cycle 1 and Cycle 2.

      Adverse events will be assessed throughout the study, including 21 days after the last study
      drug infusion. Hematology assessments,other laboratory parameters and vital signs will be
      assessed.
