    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the proposed study is to determine whether whole body vibration is
      beneficial in promoting bone health, physical fitness and neuromotor performance in patients
      with chronic stroke.

      Subjects in the experimental group will undergo whole body vibration therapy (1 session per
      day, 3 sessions per week) for 8 weeks. The vibration frequency used in this study will be
      30Hz. The total duration of exposure to vibration for the experimental group will be 10
      minutes. While standing on the vibration platform, patients will be instructed to repeat the
      following set of light exercises: (1) light squatting,(2) deep squatting, (3) side-to-side
      weight-shift, (4) Forward and backward weight-shift, (5) forward lunge, (6) marching on the
      spot. The control exercise group, on the other hand, will perform the same exercise program
      on the platform, but no vibration will be given. The training will be conducted by a
      qualified personnel with physiotherapy background.

      The outcome measurement will be performed 4 times: (1) immediately before the commencement of
      intervention, (2) immediately after termination of treatment, (3) at 1 month after
      termination of treatment. Each subject will be evaluated for bone markers, leg muscle
      strength, balance, spasticity, and walking ability.
