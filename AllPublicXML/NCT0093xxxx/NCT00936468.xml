  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the optimal dose of JVRS-100 and assess safety,
      tolerability and immunogenicity of Fluzone® vaccine administered with JVRS-100 adjuvant at
      one of three dose levels compared to Fluzone® vaccine administered alone, in 472 adults aged
      ≥65 years.

    <textblock>
      Approximately 472 subjects will be enrolled in this study. The study population will include
      elderly male and female subjects aged ≥65 years who are living in the community (including
      assisted living environments) and who are very fit to moderately frail.

      One hundred subjects (approximately 25 in each treatment arms) will be vaccinated, and 14
      days will elapse during which safety parameters are monitored by a Data and Safety Monitoring
      Board (DSMB), before randomizing the remaining 372 subjects.
