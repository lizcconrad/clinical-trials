  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of LCM syrup in
      children ages from 1 month to 17 years with uncontrolled partial seizures when added to 1 to
      3 other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

    <textblock>
      Six subjects aged 5-11 (Cohort 1) were initially enrolled at the 8 mg/kg/day dose level. Upon
      completion of the study for these subjects, pharmacokinetic and safety data were analyzed to
      determine the target dose for the remaining subjects (either 8, 10 or 12 mg/kg/day).
      Depending on the selected target dose, four additional age-based cohorts of subjects were to
      be enrolled. LCM was increased 2 mg/kg/day per week until the target dose or maximum dose
      able to be tolerated was achieved.

    <description>For the assessment of the Caregiver Global Impression of Change, the caregiver (including parent/legal guardian) provided his/her assessment of the subject's clinical status, compared to Baseline (Visit 1), including an evaluation of seizure frequency and intensity, the occurrence of Adverse Events (AEs), and subject's functional status.
The caregiver will be asked to check the number that best describes the subject's condition over the past 4 weeks compared to Baseline:

    <measure>Plasma Ctrough Values for Lacosamide at Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>During SP0847, the time points for collection of blood samples for plasma concentration analysis varied per enrollment cohort. To provide a standard summary of this information, we present the mean plasma trough concentrations (Ctrough). Ctrough levels represent the lowest level of LCM that was present in the subject with measurement taken pre-dose before the next scheduled dose of LCM.
The blood sample for plasma concentration schedule varied per enrollment cohort and with protocol amendments. A PK sample was not required for a subject to be in the included in the SS although all subjects did have at least one PK sample taken during SP0847. Therefore the number of subjects presented for the PK assessments is based on the subjects in the SS who attended the respective visits and had PK concentration data at the respective time point.</description>

        <title>Plasma Ctrough Values for Lacosamide at Day 7</title>
        <description>During SP0847, the time points for collection of blood samples for plasma concentration analysis varied per enrollment cohort. To provide a standard summary of this information, we present the mean plasma trough concentrations (Ctrough). Ctrough levels represent the lowest level of LCM that was present in the subject with measurement taken pre-dose before the next scheduled dose of LCM.
The blood sample for plasma concentration schedule varied per enrollment cohort and with protocol amendments. A PK sample was not required for a subject to be in the included in the SS although all subjects did have at least one PK sample taken during SP0847. Therefore the number of subjects presented for the PK assessments is based on the subjects in the SS who attended the respective visits and had PK concentration data at the respective time point.</description>

        <title>Plasma Ctrough Values for SPM 12809 at Day 35</title>
        <description>SPM 12809 is major metabolite of LCM and is known as O-desmethyl-lacosamide. During SP0847, the time points for collection of blood samples for plasma concentration analysis varied per enrollment cohort. To provide a standard summary of this information, we present the mean plasma trough concentrations (Ctrough). Ctrough levels represent the lowest level of LCM that was present in the subject with measurement taken pre-dose before the next scheduled dose of LCM.
The blood sample for plasma concentration schedule varied per enrollment cohort and with protocol amendments. A PK sample was not required for a subject to be in the included in the SS although all subjects did have at least one PK sample taken during SP0847. Therefore the number of subjects presented for the PK assessments is based on the subjects in the SS who attended the respective visits and had PK concentration data at the respective time point.</description>

        <population>The analysis consists of the Safety Set, which is all subjects who signed the informed consent form and took at least 1 dose of LCM in SP0847.
