      Objective: To compare the effects of a protective versus a conventional ventilatory strategy,
      on systemic and in lung production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and
      interleukin-8 (IL-8) in patients without lung disease.

      Hypothesis: High tidal volumes induce inflammation in patients without lung disease Design:
      Prospective control-randomized study. Patients and Setting: Twenty patients without lung
      disease and submitted to mechanical ventilation admitted to one trauma and one general adult
      intensive care unit of two different university hospitals.

      Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive mechanical ventilation either with tidal
      volume (VT) of 10-12 ml/kg predicted body weight (high VT group) or with VT of 5-7 ml/kg
      predicted body weight (low VT group) with an O2 inspiratory fraction (FIO2) enough to keep
      arterial oxygen saturation &gt; 90% with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O
      during 12 hours after admission to the study.

    <description>twenty patients were randomly (opaque sealed envelopes) assigned to receive mechanical ventilation in volume-controlled mode either with VT of 10-12 ml/kg predicted body weight (high VT group, n=10) or with VT of 5-7 ml/kg predicted body weight (low VT group, n=10) with an inspiratory fraction of oxygen (FIO2) set at the minimal level at which an arterial oxygen saturation of &gt; 90% and minimal PEEP (4-5cmH2O).
