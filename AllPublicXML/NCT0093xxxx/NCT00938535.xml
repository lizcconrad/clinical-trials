      This study will evaluate the efficacy of a behavioral intervention, designed to prevent
      weight gain among overweight and low obese (25-34.9 kg/m2) Black women (aged 25-44), compared
      to usual care.

    <textblock>
      Obesity prevention among Black women is a major public health priority; presently, nearly 54%
      of the adult Black female population is obese. To date, most intervention attention has been
      focused on weight reduction among the overweight and obese. However, both conditions are
      notoriously recalcitrant to treatment, particularly among Blacks. We posit that obesity
      prevention might represent a particularly effective intervention strategy for overweight
      Black women. Most studies have shown that Black women have a greater social acceptance of
      overweight, less body weight dissatisfaction, and higher ideal body weights, compared to
      Whites. Furthermore, numerous studies have shown that obesity is less lethal and causes fewer
      co-morbidities among Black vs. White women, suggesting that maintaining overweight may be an
      appropriate public health goal for Black women. We posit that an intervention approach that
      emphasizes maintaining overweight, while preventing the transition to obesity will resonate
      among the target population. Very few obesity prevention RCTs appear in the published
      literature and, to our knowledge, none have been conducted solely among Black women.

      We propose to randomize overweight, Black women (n=184) to either usual care (UC) or an
      obesity prevention (OP) intervention condition. The OP condition is comprised of several
      intervention components that will be delivered over 12 months; each participant will receive
      a tailored action plan, tailored print materials, monthly coaching calls, and weekly
      self-monitoring via an interactive voice response system. Assessments will be taken at
      baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months post baseline.
