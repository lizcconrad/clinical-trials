  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients on a breathing machine are at risk of developing a type of pneumonia
      called Ventilator Acquired Pneumonia (VAP). The purpose of this study is to determine if
      regular lung rinses sent for microbiological testing can reduce the time to diagnose VAP. The
      study also plans to test the accuracy and speed of a new technology, using multiplexed
      automated digital microscopy, to identify the germs causing the VAP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common, life-threatening hospital-acquired
      infectious complication of prolonged mechanical ventilation (MV). Despite aggressive efforts
      to prevent VAP, rates remain high because clinical diagnosis is imprecise and microbiological
      diagnosis is frequently delayed. Diagnosis of VAP depends on clinical signs as well as
      microbiologic evidence from Bronchioalveolar Lavage (BAL) cultures. Ordinarily, these
      cultures are only ordered after the patient presents with clinical signs and symptoms of VAP,
      which can significantly delay diagnosis and effective therapy. This research proposes to
      implement additional surveillance BAL cultures in order to reduce the time to diagnosis of
      VAP in mechanically ventilated critically ill adults. To further reduce the time to diagnosis
      of VAP, this research aims to test part of the BAL cultures using a novel
      flowcell/surface-capture device that allows direct from specimen visualization of bacteria
      using multiplexed automated digital microscopy (BACcel™) for rapid bacterial identification
      and antibiotic resistance testing. Additionally, molecular assays of the BAL sample will
      characterize lower respiratory tract antimicrobial peptide host-innate immune molecule and
      local anti-oxidant defenses in mechanically ventilated adults at risk for VAP.
