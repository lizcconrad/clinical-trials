    <textblock>
      This study is for a population of patients with few or no alternative options that was
      conducted to determine the response rate to clofarabine. Additionally the study will provide
      information on the safety profile, impact of overall survival, and impact on remission
      duration with clofarabine. It is a single arm study and has no comparator.
