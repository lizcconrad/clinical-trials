      Objective:

      To examine respiratory/physiological and subjective responding as well as genetic
      transmission among offspring of parents with a history of or current panic disorder (PD)
      diagnosis to determine whether diagnoses/symptoms, endophenotypes, or genetic profiles in
      offspring is differentially related to parent PD subtypes (i.e., respiratory and
      non-respiratory panic).

      Study population:

      Approximately 400 offspring of about 200 parents with current or past PD. Approximately 200
      offsping/100 parents with PD will be enrolled at NIH/NIMH and the remainder at Virginia
      Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA.

      Design:

      A high-risk family design will be used wherein parents with either a current or past
      diagnosis of PD who have an offspring(s) (ages 9 to 20) will be recruited.

      &lt;TAB&gt;

      Outcome measures:

      Outcome measures will include physiological recordings of respiratory, cardiac, and
      electrodermal responding during a 10 minute baseline followed by 15 minutes of 5% carbon
      dioxide enriched air (CO2). Research participants also will complete parent and child
      self-report measures and provide a DNA sample using a saliva protocol. A full listing of
      self-reports is provided in the Outcome Measures Section.

      Objective:

      The objective of this study is to examine respiratory/physiological and subjective responding
      as well as genetic transmission among offspring of parents with a history of or current panic
      disorder (PD) diagnosis. Our goal is to determine whether diagnoses/symptoms, endophenotypes,
      or genetic profiles in offspring is differentially related to parent PD subtypes (i.e.,
      respiratory and non-respiratory panic).

      Study population:

      Approximately 80 offspring between the ages of 9 and 20 years of age who have a parent with a
      current or past history of PD will be recruited. Approximately 40 offspring will be enrolled
      at NIH/NIMH and the remainder at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA.

      Design:

      Offspring(s) between the ages of 9 to 20 who have a parent with a history of PD will be
      recruited. A complete psychiatric history will be obtained on all child participants. Child
      participants also will complete questionnaire measures, provide a sample of DNA, and
      participate in a carbon dioxide CO(2) lab challenge. The CO(2) lab challenge is the primary
      outcome measure.

      Outcome measures:

      Our primary outcome measures include physiological recordings of respiratory, cardiac, and
      electrodermal responding during a 10 minute baseline followed by 15 minutes of 5% carbon
      dioxide enriched air (CO(2). Research participants also will complete parent and child
      self-report measures and provide a DNA sample using a saliva protocol. A full listing of
      self-reports is provided in the Outcome Measures Section.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Children age 9-18, and young adults 18-20 who have a parent with a past or current
             history of PD.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA (ALL PARTICIPANTS):

          -  Serious, unstable illnesses including hepatic, renal, gastroenterologic, respiratory,
             cardiovascular, endocrinologic, neurologic, immunologic, or hematologic disease, one
             or more past seizures without a clear and resolved etiology,

          -  Subjects who are currently at high risk for homicide or suicide,

          -  Subjects with symptoms of psychosis

          -  Subjects with current DSM-IV substance abuse or dependence within the past year.

          -  Subjects with IQ&lt;70,

        ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR CHILDREN:

          -  mania,

          -  pervasive developmental disorder,

          -  use of psychotropic medication,

          -  Child participants must be psychotropic free for at least 14 days prior to the CO(2)
             challenge session.

          -  For children taking fluoxetine, they must be free of this medication for at least 4
             weeks.

          -  The proband parent must be a legal guardian of the child to qualify for the study.

        Offspring passing screening criteria will be scheduled for an intake to complete a clinical
        interview, questionnaires, and CO(2) challenge task with assessment of respiratory
        physiology.
