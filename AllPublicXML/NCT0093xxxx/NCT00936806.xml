        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult â‰¥ 18 - 80 years old

          -  Able to comprehend, sign, and date the written informed consent document to
             participate in the clinical trial

          -  Scheduled for &quot;procedure&quot;

          -  ASA Class I, II or III as assigned by the anaesthesiologist

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Allergy or inability to tolerate &quot;product&quot;

          -  Body weight less than 70% or more than 130% of ideal body weight

          -  Pregnant or nursing females

          -  Participation in a clinical trial within the past 30 days

          -  Congenital mental disability or congenital anatomical brain abnormality

          -  A medical history of cerebrovascular accident or thrombosis

          -  A medical history of carotic artery occlusive pathology

          -  A medical history of degenerative cerebral pathology (MS, Dementia, ALS, para-or
             tetraplegia due to a traumatic disruption of the spinal cord)

          -  A medical history of severe psychiatric pathology (Schizophrenia, severe depression,
             alcoholism, drug abuse) Mild depression evoked by coping with the diagnosis of cancer
             is not excluded

          -  Patients with a history of epileptic insults. Patients receiving preventive
             anti-epileptic treatment due to the tumoral process are not excluded.

          -  Patients with low cardiac output conditions due to pre-existing cardiac pathology
             (Cardiac insufficiency, valve pathology, dysrhythmia, myocardial infarction). Patients
             presenting with stable coronary artery disease with a normal myocardial function are
             not excluded)

          -  Arterial hypertension is not an exclusion criteria, nor is the use of antihypertensive
             medication, except beta blockers for their potential interfering effects on
             spontaneous EEG.
