    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and pharmacokinetic properties (the
      absorption, distribution and excretion) of two preparations of aminopterin (0.25 mg tablets
      and 1.0 mg tablets) following oral administration by subjects with moderate to severe
      psoriasis.
