    <textblock>
      This study will examine the ability of an Internet-based program to prevent college-aged
      women from developing eating disorders.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 2% to 4% of college-aged women suffer from eating disorders (EDs), and many
      more are at risk of developing them. A previous Internet-based intervention called Student
      Bodies (SB), which focused on body image concerns, was effective in reducing risk factors for
      EDs among college-aged women. However, the original SB program did not account for certain
      other risk factors, such as depression and compensatory behaviors like self-induced vomiting,
      over-exercising, or use of diuretics. Image and Mood (IaM) is an enhanced version of the SB
      program and takes into account depressive symptoms and the use of compensatory behaviors.
      This study will examine whether IaM will reduce ED risk factors in a large population of
      college women who are at high risk of developing EDs.

      Participation in this study will last 10 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      either receive the IaM program or be placed on a wait list. The IaM program, which will be
      delivered through the Internet, will provide information about nutrition, exercise, body
      image, and coping skillsâ€”including examples and exercises. It will also include an online
      message board monitored by a study psychologist. Each week the IaM participants will monitor
      their behavior, keep a journal about their experiences, and answer self-report
      questionnaires. Assessments of eating disorder symptoms; weight and shape concerns;
      depressive symptoms; and incidence of substance abuse, anxiety, or depressive disorders will
      be completed post-treatment and at 1- and 1.5-month follow-ups. Those assigned to the wait
      list will complete these assessments and then receive the IaM program after the last
      follow-up.
