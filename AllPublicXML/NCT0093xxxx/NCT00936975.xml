  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride positron emission
      tomography (PET) works in evaluating response to dasatinib in patients with prostate cancer
      and bone metastases. Diagnostic procedures, such as fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET, may
      help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if changes in regional fluoride incorporation, measured by 18F-fluoride PET (SUV
      and Ki), occur in both castration-resistant prostate cancer bone metastases and normal bone
      as a response to treatment with dasatinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if changes in 18F-fluoride transport (K1), an indicator of blood flow, and
      therefore, an indirect marker of angiogenesis, occur in both castration-resistant prostate
      cancer bone metastases and normal bone as a response to treatment with dasatinib.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET scan at baseline and then at 12 weeks
      after initiation of treatment with dasatinib. PET parameters (SUV, Ki, and Kl) are also
      analyzed.
