  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Certain parts of the body, such as the chest, back, and shoulders, are notorious for
      producing cosmetically poor scars after cutaneous surgery. While very little research has
      been done to understand these poor outcomes, it is generally thought that increased tension
      across the skin inherent to these body areas leads to significant widening of the final scar.
      Historically, the only way to combat this tension was to support the deeper portion of the
      wound with sutures that dissolve over several weeks. However, scars take many months to fully
      develop their greatest strength. So even with the standard technique, wounds in areas of high
      tension still show spreading of the scar with time. The investigators believe that these
      wounds require an extended duration of support throughout the scar's maturation period. Until
      recently, there did not exist a suture that could provide this long duration of support
      without also carrying the risk of the body rejecting it. Recently, a new extremely long
      acting absorbable biomaterial has been FDA approved for use as a suture. The investigators
      plan to use this suture to test the theory that alleviating stress on high tension wounds
      throughout the period which they gain their maximal integrity produces less scar spread and
      ultimately better cosmetic outcomes.
