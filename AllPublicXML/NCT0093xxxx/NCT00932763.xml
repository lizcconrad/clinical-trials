      -  Objective:

             -  The objective of this study was to assess the relative bioavailability of two
                formulations of immediate release amlodipine 10 mg under fasted conditions, in
                healthy subjects.

        -  Study Design:

             -  This was an open-label, single-dose, 2-treatment, 2-period, randomized, crossover
                study.Twenty-two healthy subjects were enrolled. Subjects who successfully
                completed the screening process checked into the research center the night before
                first dose. Subjects who continued to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria the morning
                of dose were assigned a subject number, based on the order in which they
                successfully completed the screening process and procedures as outlined in the
                study protocol. Subjects were randomly assigned to a treatment sequence and
                received two separate single-dose administrations of study medication, one
                treatment per period,according to the randomization schedule. Dosing days were
                separated by a washout period of at least 14 days. Subjects received each of the
                treatments listed below during the two treatment periods following an overnight
                fast of at least 10 hours: amlodipine by Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and Norvasc
                by Pfizer, Inc.
