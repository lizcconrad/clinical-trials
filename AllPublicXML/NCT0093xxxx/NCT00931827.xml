    <textblock>
      The study examines the use of Mirena or Implanon for long-term contraception in women. The
      duration of therapy use is the key focus of the study. Also, any reasons for discontinuation
      and the safety profile will be examined. In addition, patients are asked to fill out a short
      questionnaire about their menstrual bleeding before and during therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women aged 20-35 in good general health requesting contraception

          -  Women who have used short-acting hormonal contraception (combined or progestogen-only
             pills, vaginal ring or contraceptive patch) for at least 3 cycles immediately before
             entering the study and opting to change to either Mirena or Implanon for contraception

          -  Women who have given a written informed consent to participate in the study (if
             applicable)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The contraindications and warnings of the respective Summary of Product
             Characteristics (Mirena or Implanon) must be followed. The decision to start Mirena or
             Implanon has to be made clearly before the decision to include patients in the study

          -  Patients who are breast-feeding at time of inclusion for the study will also be
             excluded since breast-feeding affects the bleeding pattern
