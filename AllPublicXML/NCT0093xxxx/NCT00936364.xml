    <textblock>
      This partially randomized clinical trial studies short-term fasting in reducing side effects
      in patients receiving gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin for advanced solid tumors.
      Short-term fasting before chemotherapy may reduce the side effects caused by chemotherapy.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of short-term fasting prior to administration of
      combination chemotherapy with platinum in patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies.

      II. To evaluate the toxicity profile of platinum-based chemotherapy in subjects who eat
      normally compared to those who undertake short-term starvation.

      III. To investigate changes in plasma insulin, glucose, IGF1 and IGF binding protein (IGFBP)
      levels, and oxidative stress markers in subjects who undertake short-term fasting compared to
      controls.

      IV. To investigate whether changes in grp78 expression occur after fasting and after
      chemotherapy administration in human subjects.

      OUTLINE:

      STAGE I: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups. GROUP I: Patients fast for 24
      hours on day-1.

      GROUP II: Patients fast for 48 hours on days -2 and -1.

      GROUP III: Patients fast for 72 hours on days -3, -2, and-1.

      GROUP IV: Patients undergo a modified 48-hour fast with minimal caloric intake on days -2 and
      -1.

      STAGE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients fast for 72 hours on days -2, and on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients proceed to chemotherapy without fasting.

      All patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8 and
      cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

               -  Stage II of the trial: Measurable disease by RECIST criteria must be present for
                  all subjects in the randomized component of the trial- if surgery or radiation is
                  planned, the target lesions may not be so treated until after the assessment of
                  the effect of chemotherapy.

          -  Prior chemotherapy

               -  Stage I: subjects may have already received no more than 2 cycle of
                  platinum-based chemotherapy, but should not have received other prior
                  chemotherapy regimens with the exception of patients with metastatic disease who
                  received neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and that chemotherapy was completed
                  &gt; 6 months prior to enrollment.

               -  Stage II: subjects must have received no prior chemotherapy regimens for
                  metastatic disease, and no more than 2 cycles of their current platinum
                  chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease. They may have received prior
                  neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, provided such therapy was completed &gt;6
                  months prior to enrollment.

          -  Prior Radiotherapy is allowed, provided at least 2 weeks have elapsed from completion
             of radiotherapy to initiation of protocol treatment.

          -  BMI &gt; 18.5

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1

          -  Adequate renal function (Creatinine &lt;1.25 ULIN or calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 50
             ml/min)

          -  Premenopausal women must have a negative pregnancy test and must agree to use barrier
             contraception throughout the study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diabetes Mellitus

          -  Recent significant or unexplained weight loss that the investigator feels may pose an
             unacceptable risk for enrollment. Candidates who are overweight and have lost weight
             intentionally via diet or exercise should not be excluded.

          -  Peripheral Neuropathy &gt; grade 1

             failure NYHA grade 2 or more or LVEF &lt; 40% on any prior assessment. (Assessment of
             LVEF prior to therapy is not required in the absence of other clinical indicators of
             heart disease). Patients with a prior LVEF &lt;40% will require re-evaluation prior to
             study entry.

          -  Subjects on medications that may not be safely stopped during the fasting portion of
             the study, or which may not be safely consumed without food.
