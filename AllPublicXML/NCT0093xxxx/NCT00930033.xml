      The study compare the standard treatment with nephrectomy + sunitinib to treatment with
      sunitinib alone without nephrectomy. This study will be the first trial on this competitive
      context

    <textblock>
      The 2 previous studies on the impact of nephrectomy (EORTC, SWOG) in metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma have justified recommendation to initial nephrectomy for patients presenting with
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma. But these studies were performed at the time of
      immunotherapy.

      The objective is Evaluation of the importance of nephrectomy in patients with metastatic
      renal cell carcinoma treated with sunitinib (AA) Arm A : Nephrectomy followed by Sunitinib
      Arm B : Sunitinib alone Sunitinib will be administrated orally daily for 4 weeks followed by
      a 2 week rest( schedule 4/2), 6 weeks are considered as a cycle The starting dose will be 50
      mg daily with provision for dose reduction based on tolerability Patient will be treated
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurrence or withdraw.
