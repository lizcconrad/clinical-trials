      Objective: To study the relative balance of GABA (A) binding potential and glutamate
      utilization in subjects with localization-related epilepsy with and without depression,
      subjects with major depressive disorder alone, and in subjects with generalized epilepsy
      (expected not to have significant comorbid depression). Pilot data shows that GABA(A) binding
      potential and glutamate utilization are tightly coupled in healthy subjects particularly in
      the mesial temporal lobe. We hypothesize that subjects with epilepsy will not exhibit the
      same degree of coupling, and that subjects with both epilepsy and depression will exhibit an
      even more pronounced decoupling.

      Study Population: Subjects aged 18-55 with localization-related epilepsy with and without
      depression, subjects with generalized epilepsy, subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD)
      alone, and healthy controls.

      Design: This is a neuroimaging study, using positron emission tomography (PET) with
      [11C]flumazenil, to measure GABA(A) binding potential, and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose, to
      measure glucose utilization (reflective of neuronal glutamate release) Magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy (MRS), will be used to measure GABA and glutamate in the mesial temporal cortex,
      and corroborate the PET results. Structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) will be obtained
      for MRS localization and partial volume correction of PET images.

      Outcome measures: The binding potential of GABA(A), the regional rate of glucose metabolism,
      and the levels of GABA and glutamate as measured by MRS. Patients will be stratified by
      seizure type and depression ratings.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Male and female subjects aged between 18 and 55 years

          -  Epileptic patients must have clinically documented partial seizures, in either the
             left or right temporal lobe, or generalized seizures with consistent EEG evidence as
             defined by the 1981 International Classification of Epileptic Seizures, refractory to
             standard antiepileptic treatment for at least one year. This criterion will be
             established by preliminary screening in the NINDS CES outpatient clinic, and, where
             previous studies are not adequate, by inpatient video-EEG monitoring.

          -  All subjects with epilepsy must exhibit seizures not adequately controlled by
             medication alone, despite adequate trials of multiple agents.

        Subjects with epilepsy must currently be taking an AED which exerts its primary method of
        action on a system other than GABA. Examples include sodium or calcium channel blockers
        (phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, zonisamide, and ethosuximide), drugs
        that bind to SV2A sites (levetiracetam), or drugs which bind to the alpha2delta subunit of
        calcium channels (gabapentin and pregbalin). Patients on AEDs that have direct effects on
        GABA and glutamate (vigabatrin, phenobarbital, benzodiazepines, tiagabine) will be
        excluded. No subject s medication will be changed for the purpose of inclusion in this
        study.

          -  Patients with TLE and depression must currently meet DSM-IV criteria for the category
             &quot;Mood disorder due to epilepsy&quot; (293.83), and the subtype &quot;with Major Depressive-Like
             Episode&quot;, 296.2 Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, or 296.3 Major Depressive
             Disorder, Recurrent, indicating that subjects meet diagnostic criteria for a major
             depressive episode.

          -  Patients with MDD alone must currently meet DSM-IV criteria for Major Depressive
             Disorder, and also have either a family history of mood disorders, or a history of
             multiple major depressive episodes.

          -  Healthy control subjects who do not meet criteria for any DSM-IV axis I psychiatric
             disorder, and have no family history (in first degree relatives) of a mood or anxiety
             disorder will also be recruited.

          -  Subjects must be able to give written informed consent prior to participation in this
             study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Subjects with major medical or neurological disorders (besides TLE or generalized
             epileptiform disorder) expected to influence cerebral blood flow or morphology

          -  Subjects with epilepsy taking any medications (other than antiepileptic drugs) that
             may affect cerebral blood flow, GABA or glutamate neurotransmission, or metabolism.

          -  Subjects with epilepsy taking AED s known to exert direct effects on GABA or
             glutamate.

          -  Subjects with epilepsy with depression who have taken anti-depressant drugs within 2
             weeks of the study (4 weeks for fluoxetine)

          -  Medically healthy depressed subjects who have taken any drugs, including
             anti-depressants, expected to influence cerebral blood flow, metabolism, or morphology
             within 2 weeks of the study (4 weeks for fluoxetine)

          -  Healthy subjects who are taking any medications expected to influence cerebral blood
             flow, metabolism, or morphology.

          -  Healthy subjects must be free from a personal history of seizure disorders

          -  In order to exclude subjects at-risk for the development of a mood disorder, healthy
             control subjects must be free from either a personal or family history (first-degree
             relatives) of Axis I psychiatric disorders

          -  Subjects with a history of drug or alcohol abuse within one year, or a lifetime
             history of alcohol or drug dependence (DSM-IV criteria). Subjects who consume an
             excessive amount of alcohol (more than 7 drinks per week for women, more than 14
             drinks per week for men) will also be excluded.

          -  Subjects with structural lesions visible on MRI, excluding mesial temporal sclerosis

          -  Subjects with suicidal ideation, or a past history of suicide attempts

          -  Subjects with psychotic symptoms

          -  Subjects in whom MRI is contraindicated

          -  Female subjects who are lactating or pregnant

          -  Subjects with an IQ of less than 80 will be excluded from the study.
