      This research, aimed to verify whether the use of vascular ultrasonography (VUS) could lead
      to better results in the peripheral venous access implementation in children.

      Objectives: To compare, regardless of the number of venous puncture attempts, peripheral
      venous access obtained in children, according to VUS use or traditional method for peripheral
      intravenous catheter (PIC) insertion; assertiveness in the use of PIC in children, defined as
      success in the first attempt of puncture and PIC withdrawal according to release of
      treatment, related to VUS or traditional method and to describe the influence of VUS on PIC
      dwell time and development of local complications related to the use of intravenous therapy
      in children.

      Clinical, randomized and controlled trial, conducted in a pediatric surgery ward of a
      university hospital in São Paulo. Data collection occurred from February 26th, 2007 to July
      07th, 2008, after ethical merits of research approval. The sample comprised 382 venous
      puncture randomly allocated in the experimental group (EG), venous puncture guided by VUS, or
      in the control group (CG), traditional method of venous puncture. Variables related to
      children, intravenous therapy and professional characterization were collected. The dependent
      variables included the obtainment of peripheral venous access, the assertiveness, the
      catheter dwell time and the occurrence of local complications. For the statistical analysis
      were applied the Pearson Chi-square, Fisher's Exact, Generalization of Fisher's exact,
      Mann-Whitney, Likelihood Ratio and Prevalence Ratio (significance level of 5%).
