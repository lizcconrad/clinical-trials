  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ARTEMIS is a study to assess how educational material affects overall adherence to
      anastrozole by evaluation of patients' electronically compiled dosing histories. Patients'
      dosing times are compiled electronically using Medication Event Monitoring System&quot; (MEMS®) in
      order to be able to gather accurate, objective and up-to-date patients' dosing histories. For
      subjects in Group A, the control group, the adherence to anastrozole in the standard clinical
      practice will be evaluated. For subjects in Group B, on top of the standard clinical
      practice, they will also receive educational material by mail at week 0 (study registration),
      week 2, week 4, week 6, week 8, week 12, month 5, month 7, and at month 10. This procedure is
      the same as in the ongoing CARIATIDE study. One of the reasons of poor adherence (either
      early discontinuation of the treatment or missing doses while still engaged to the therapy)
      can be some side effects experienced by the patients during the anastrozole treatment.
      Recording the reasons at discontinuation allows us to identify reasons for treatment
      discontinuation. Recording reasons of anastrozole interruptions during the study period
      allows us to relate these events to patients' adherence to anastrozole. During the study, no
      pro-active safety data collection will take place. Spontaneous reported adverse drug
      reactions (ADRs) will be reported according to local post-marketing pharmacovigilance
      regulations.
