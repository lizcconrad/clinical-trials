      Objective: The investigators studied the effects of respiratory muscle stretching in an
      8-week pulmonary rehabilitation program. Methods: This was a simple-blind parallel controlled
      trial, conducted an out-patient clinic. Twenty six patients with COPD (mean age 68 ± 6 y,
      percent of predicted FEV1 47 ± 16) were randomized to either respiratory muscle stretching
      group plus exercise training (RMS), and exercise training group (Sham), in an 8-week exercise
      program that had 3 sessions per week. The investigators measured inspiratory and expiratory
      muscle strength (by maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure - PIM and PEM), exercise
      capacity (by 6-minute walk distance), dyspnea and quality of life.

    <description>The exercise training program consisted of three 90-minute sessions per week for eight weeks. Each session consisted of a stretching exercise, resistance that patients started at 70% of the initial one-repetition maximum (1RM: the maximum load which can be moved only once over the full range of motion without compensatory movements) in the first week (3x8 repetitions). Every week the load was increased by 5% of the 1RM, and endurance training (treadmill walking speed was set at 60% of the average speed obtained from the 6MWT (6MWTpeak) for 10 mins in the first week and was increased to 20 mins in week 8</description>
