      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise training on exercise
      capacity, physical activity (PA), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and the
      psychosocial factors affecting PA in sedentary congenital heart defect (CHD) children and
      healthy sedentary children. The degree of improvement after exercise training were compared
      between CHD children and healthy sedentary children.

      Exercise groups took 12-week exercise training, twice in hospital and once at home, using a
      video game so-called Dance Dance Revolution (DDR), while the control group kept their daily
      routines.
