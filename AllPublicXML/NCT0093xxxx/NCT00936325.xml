      Background:

        -  Systemic Capillary Leak Syndrome (SCLS) is a disorder of unknown cause characterized by
           episodes of life-threatening drop in blood pressure and leakage of fluids into tissues.
           The outcome from an episode of SCLS may be mild and resolve on its own, or may be severe
           and result in death. Although SCLS likely involves abnormalities in the cells lining
           blood vessels, the specific cause(s) of this disorder are not known.

        -  The treatment of choice for an acute SCLS episode is intravenous fluids and drugs such
           as norepinephrine (adrenaline), which are given to keep blood pressure at a level that
           will maintain vital organ function. This may be followed by a course of intravenous
           steroids and IVIG. Currently, there is no cure, but IVIG has been effective in
           diminishing the frequency and/or intensity of SCLS episodes when given regularly, as
           long-term effective preventive therapy for many patients who experience recurrent
           episodes of SCLS.

        -  This protocol is focused on understanding what causes SCLS with the hope that research
           findings will lead to the design of safe and more effective treatments.

      Objectives:

      - To investigate mechanisms that may cause Systemic Capillary Leak Syndrome.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients between 16 and older who have been diagnosed with SCLS. Patients who have been
           diagnosed with SCLS and are between the ages of 7 and 16 may participate off-site, by
           sending specimens to the NIH. Patients 16 and older who have been diagnosed with SCLS
           and cannot travel to the NIH may also participate off-site.

        -  Patients must have a documented history of at least one episode of SCLS with all three
           of the following documented on at least one occasion: low blood volume, low blood
           pressure without cause, and evidence of protein leakage during the episode. A letter of
           a referral from a treating physician is also required.

      Design:

        -  Patients seen on site will be evaluated at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for
           approximately 4 to 5 days on an inpatient basis, and will undergo the following
           procedures:

             -  Medical history and physical examination.

             -  Blood samples for evaluation and research purposes, as well as possible genetic
                testing.

             -  Apheresis procedure, if needed, to obtain a larger volume of blood cells for
                research.

             -  Bone marrow biopsy, if medically indicated.

             -  Other medically indicated tests, such as skin tests to check for possible allergic
                reactions.

        -  Patients who have a capillary leak episode while at NIH will be treated with the
           standard of care for treating SCLS.

        -  Patients will be discharged from the protocol 1 year after the NIH visit.

        -  Patients participating off-site will be asked to collect and send specimens (such as
           blood) to the NIH for research purposes and evaluation.

        -  Unaffected Biological relatives of SCLS patients and Unrelated Normal Volunteers may
           also enroll on the study. Relatives and Normal Volunteers may be asked to provide
           research samples for the study, such as skin biopsy and research blood specimens.

      The systemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS, Clarkson syndrome) is an exceedingly rare
      disorder of unknown cause characterized by chronic edema or acute transient, severe episodes
      of hypotension, hypovolemia, and oliguria. Severe edema results from leakage of fluid and
      macromolecules (200-900 kDa) into tissues. Acute SCLS episodes carry a high morbidity and
      mortality (25-30%). Only 150 cases have been reported worldwide since 1960, although the
      disease may be underdiagnosed due to the nonspecific nature of the presenting signs and
      symptoms and the considerable overlap with other shock syndromes including sepsis,
      anaphylaxis, and angioedema. Approximately 85% of such individuals have a monoclonal
      gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS), but the relationship of this finding to disease
      pathogenesis is unclear. This protocol will focus on the pathogenesis of SCLS. Subjects with
      documented episodes of capillary leak will be evaluated in order to correlate both clinical
      and laboratory features that are typical of SCLS. The goal is to identify biological factors
      and/or genetic and molecular events that may predispose to SCLS episodes. We plan to enroll
      up to 210 subjects, family members and healthy volunteers in this study. We anticipate that
      our findings may be a first step toward the development of new targeted therapies.

        -  PARTICIPANT INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects with SCLS UNDER16 years of age are only eligible for components of this protocol
        that can occur Off Site and can be sent in to the NIH.

        All subjects must be at least 16 years old to participate in any other aspects of this
        protocol.

        Diagnosis or suspected diagnosis of Systemic Capillary Leak Syndrome by a physician or
        documented history of capillary leak as characterized by one or more of the following:

          1. Hypotension (systolic blood pressure typically less than 90 mm Hg or diastolic blood
             pressure less than 60 mm Hg) or associated symptoms of hypotension (e.g., hypotonia
             [collapse], lightheadedness or syncope, incontinence, increased thirst)

          2. Laboratory evidence of hemoconcentration (e.g., hemoglobin levels above the normal
             range [typically greater than17 g/dL], elevated leukocyte counts).

          3. Clinical evidence of fluid extravasation (e.g. edema) and/or laboratory evidence of
             protein extravasation such as serum hypoalbuminemia (less than 3.5 g/dL) either
             chronically or during an acute hypotensive episode.

             Letter of referral, with copies of pertinent medical history and laboratory studies,
             from prospective study subject s referring physician. Patients may self-refer, but a
             letter of referral from primary physician is still required.

             Ability to give informed consent, or parent or guardian able to give informed consent.
             A Medical/Legal Guardian or Legally Authorized Representative may give consent for an
             incapacitated adult SCLS subject.

             Willing to donate blood for sample storage to be used for future research.

             PARTICIPANT INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THE SUBJECT'S RELATIVES/HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS:

             Willing to donate blood for sample storage to be used for future research.

             Subjects must be at least 16 years old.

             Able to give informed consent.

             PARTICIPANT EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

             Presence of conditions which in the judgment of the investigator or the referring
             physician may put the subject at undue risk for travel (including frequent episodes of
             severe capillary leak, symptoms not preventable by pre-medication, acute infection,
             severe thrombocytopenia [minimum platelet count of 30,000/microL], or significant
             cardiovascular disease)

             Any condition that in the view of the principal investigator would make the subject
             unsuitable for enrollment in this study

             There is an identified cause for your hypotensive episodes and/or tissue swelling.

             Subjects under the age of 16 are only eligible for components of this protocol that
             can occur Off Site and can be mailed in to the NIH, such as collection of research
             samples. Subjects under the age of 16 are otherwise excluded from other components of
             this protocol.

             PARTICIPANT EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THE SUBJECT'S RELATIVES/HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS:

             Presence of conditions which in the judgment of the investigator may put the subject
             at undue risk

             Any condition that in the view of the principal investigator would make the subject
             unsuitable for enrollment in this study

             PARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN:

             No relatives or healthy volunteers below the age of 16 will be enrolled. However,
             children (age &lt;16 years) with SCLS may participate in components of this protocol that
             can occur Off Site and can be mailed in to the NIH, such as collecting research
             specimens through the local care provider and sending the samples to the NIH. Due to
             the life-threatening nature of SCLS episodes, intensive care management may be
             required. The NIH clinical center does not have pediatric intensive care unit
             facilities. In addition, the prevalence of SCLS in children is extremely low.

             PARTICIPATION OF ADULT SUBJECTS UNABLE TO CONSENT:

             Adult subjects unable to provide consent during an acute episode of SCLS may be
             included in this study. Specimens from an acute phase of an SCLS episode are
             time-sensitive, and may yield critical information regarding potential causative
             factors or acute cellular abnormalities that correlate with clinical features of SCLS.
             Due to the life-threatening nature of SCLS episodes, a subject may suddenly require
             intensive care management at the subject s local institution, rendering the subject
             unable to provide his/her own consent. While incapacitated, a Medical/Legal Guardian
             or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) may provide Off Site consent for the
             collection of time-sensitive, critical specimens. An NIAID staff member who is able to
             obtain consent for this protocol may obtain consent from the Medical/Legal Guardian or
             LAR. Although there may be no direct benefit to the subject, research blood specimens
             may be obtained with minimal risk, and tissue samples will only be obtained as
             described in section 4.1.6. Once the acute phase resolves, and the subject is able to
             give his/her own consent, a previously incapacitated adult may be re-consented.
