    <textblock>
      Recommendations of lifestyle and dietary content changes are often made for primary
      prevention and improvement of many health conditions, including cardiovascular disease. For
      centuries, green tea (Camellia sinensis) has been linked to good health. Nowadays, it is
      considered a functional food because of its physiological benefits, mainly in terms of
      cardiovascular prevention. Green tea is considered one of the best sources of phenolic
      compounds, which possess antioxidant properties that may contribute to a reduction in the
      risk of cardiovascular disease. Lesser-known worldwide, but widely consumed in southern Latin
      America countries, yerba mate tea (Ilex paraguariensis) is also a good source of phenolic
      compounds. The antioxidant capacity of green tea has been extensively studied; however, few
      studies have reported that the antioxidant properties of maté tea is even greater than green
      tea. For this reason, the present study aims to compare the possible effects of the oral
      ingestion of maté and green tea on the lipid and inflammatory profiles in a southern
      Brazilian population.
