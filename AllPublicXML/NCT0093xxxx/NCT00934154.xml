  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre Phase III randomized controlled study of patients with multiple
      myeloma (MM). Eligible patients who are not candidates for transplantation will be randomized
      to receive eight courses of Melphalan/Prednisolone with or without Thalidomide treatment.
      Thalidomide will be initiated at the dose of 100 mg/day and maintained at 100 mg/day. The
      patients will be assessed for any responses at the end of 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th cycles of
      treatment. The toxicities will be assessed at monthly intervals. Patients will be assessed
      for the:

        1. Incidence and grade of any toxicity

        2. Level of maximum disease response

        3. Time to disease progression

        4. Time to death

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will include patients who are not candidates for transplantation and above the age
      of 55. Treatment cycles will include (MP)melphalan (9 mg /sq.m/day d1-4), prednisolone (60
      mg/sq.m/d,d1-4) every six weeks for maximum 8 cycles. Patients will be randomised to (MPT)
      Thalidomide (1:1) 100 mg/day continuously. Cross-over to MPT is allowed if insufficient
      response is obtained in the MP arm. response will be evaluated every other cycle. At the end
      of 12 months of treatment patients will be followed until progress and death. Second line
      treatment is not defined.
