    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if lithium 600-1800 mg/day is effective when added
      to quetiapine fumarate extended release (quetiapine XR or SEROQUEL® XR) 400-800 mg/day in
      treating acute mania and if so, how it compares with placebo (a non-active capsule, like a
      sugar pill, that looks like lithium).

    <measure>Change in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) Total Score From Baseline to Final Assessment (Day 43)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in YMRS total score from baseline to Day 43.</time_frame>
    <description>The YMRS total score ranges from 0 to 60 where higher scores indicate more severe mania, thus, a negative change (or decrease) from baseline indicates a reduction (or improvement) in manic symptoms. Total score ≤12 indicates remission (13-19=minimal symptoms; 20-25=mild mania, 26-37=moderate mania, 38-60=severe mania).</description>

    <description>The number of patients with a CGI-BP-C of &quot;Much&quot; or &quot;Very much&quot; improved in overall bipolar illness assessment at Day 43 was calculated.
The CGI-BP-C scale rates how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened compared to the phase immediately preceding treatment and is scored on a scale from 1 to 8 (1=very much improved to 7=very much worse; 8=not applicable). A missing score will be used when a scale scored as 8 (not applicable). CGI-BP-C scores &gt;4 indicate worsening, while scores &lt;4 indicate improvement.</description>

        <title>Improvement of Overall Bipolar Illness</title>
        <description>The number of patients with a CGI-BP-C of “Much” or “Very much” improved in overall bipolar illness assessment at Day 43 was calculated.
The CGI-BP-C scale rates how much the patient’s illness has improved or worsened compared to the phase immediately preceding treatment and is scored on a scale from 1 to 8 (1=very much improved to 7=very much worse; 8=not applicable). A missing score will be used when a scale scored as 8 (not applicable). CGI-BP-C scores &gt;4 indicate worsening, while scores &lt;4 indicate improvement.</description>
