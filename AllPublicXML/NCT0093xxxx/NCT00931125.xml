    <textblock>
      This study investigates the hypothesis that ranibizumab injection given into the eye is a
      safe, efficacious and helping treatment option applied before surgical intervention of the
      proliferative diabetic retinal eye disorder.

      This is a randomized, double blinded , controlled, two-center study assessing the
      feasibility, efficacy and safety of intravitreal ranibizumab injection applied as a
      preoperative adjunct treatment before vitrectomy surgery in severe proliferative diabetic
      retinopathy (PDR). Comparator arm consists of patients receiving standard vitrectomy alone
      with sham intravitreal injection preoperatively.
