      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine
      hydrochloride tablets in Chinese Han Healthy Subjects. The single oral dose and multiple oral
      dose of the drug in the body and the effects of different dosages of the drug will also be
      evaluated.

      This is an open, parallel assignment (low-dose, moderate-dose and high-dose), inpatient,
      sequential-group pharmacokinetics study of single oral administered and multiple oral
      administered to healthy Chinese male and female subjects at a single investigational site.
      All subjects are from the Chinese Han race.

      Approximately 36 healthy male and female Chinese subjects will participate in this study. One
      half of the subjects enrolled in each dose group will be female. Twelve subjects will be
      enrolled in each of 3 dose level groups.

      Safety will be evaluated from self-reported adverse events, scheduled physical examination,
      vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, and clinical laboratory test results.

      Single-dose blood samples (5 mL) will be obtained within 2 hours before test article
      administration and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 15, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours after test
      article administration.

      Multiple-dose (subjects of moderate dose group finished first step single-dose 30mg trial,
      one week later, will be repeatedly administered duloxetine 30 mg 7days) blood samples (5 mL)
      will be obtained at 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th day before test article administration (to test the
      valley concentration)and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 15, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours after last
      test article administration (7th day).

      Cross-over (subjects of high dose group finished first step single-dose 60 mg generic
      duloxetine trial, one week later, will be administered single-dose innovator duloxetine 60
      mg) blood samples will be obtained as same as first step.
