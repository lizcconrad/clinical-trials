  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since subjective well-being and quality of life (QoL) are increasingly being recognized as
      important treatment outcomes in patients with schizophrenia (Hofer et al., 2004; Becker et
      al., 2005), the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of treatment with quetiapine
      XR on these parameters in the acute hospital and the subsequent ambulant care setting. The
      study is planned to be conducted in 15 centers all over Austria and, overall, about 150
      inpatients with a ICD-10 diagnosis of acute schizophrenia are planning to be enrolled. The
      duration of the whole trial will be approximately 4 months, whereas 2 visits during
      hospitalization and two further visits after discharge will be scheduled. At each visit,
      adverse events and safety parameters, patient satisfaction and effectiveness of the current
      treatment, as well as concomitant medication and dosing schedules will be assessed and
      documented.In addition to that, the patients' overall satisfaction with antipsychotic therapy
      and their current quality of life will be determined using a QoL questionnaire, focussing on
      the subjective experience with quetiapine XR.
