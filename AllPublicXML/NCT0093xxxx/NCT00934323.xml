  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetics of glimepiride and metformin will be compared after single dose intake
      of both combinations in order to answer to the following questions:

        -  Is there a dose proportionality effect between Amaryl M SR 1/500 mg and Amaryl M SR
           2/500 mg?

        -  What is the safety profile of Amaryl M SR 1/500 mg and Amaryl M SR 2/500 mg?
