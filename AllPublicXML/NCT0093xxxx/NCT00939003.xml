  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate how well adalimumab works in the short and long term in patients
      with axial spondyloarthritis who are not diagnosed as having either ankylosing spondylitis or
      psoriatic arthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized study with an open-label phase
      designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab 40 mg administered every other
      week in adult patients with active axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) who are not diagnosed with
      ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, or psoriatic arthritis and who have had an inadequate
      response or intolerance to one or more nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or had a
      contraindication to NSAIDs. Participants receive adalimumab or placebo for 12 weeks during
      the double-blind phase of the study. Following the double-blind phase, all remaining
      participants enter the open-label phase of the study in which they receive open-label
      adalimumab for up to 144 weeks. Efficacy endpoints include the Assessment of
      Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS) response criteria for patients with SpA. These
      response criteria were used to determine participants who were responders. ASAS response
      involves evaluations in the following 4 domains: participant's global assessment of disease
      activity, pain, function, and inflammation. The patient's global assessment of disease
      activity score is assessed using a 100 millimeter (mm) visual analog scale (VAS; 0 for no
      disease activity to 100 for severe disease activity). Pain is represented as a total back
      pain score and is assessed using a 100 mm VAS (0 for no pain to 100 for most severe pain).
      Function score is represented as the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) Functional Index
      (BASFI) 100 mm VAS score (average of the ability to perform 10 activities, each scored as 0
      for easy to 100 for impossible). Inflammation is determined using the morning stiffness
      overall level score (0 for none to 10 for very severe) and duration score (0 for 0 hours to
      10 for ≥ 2 hours) of the Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) (mean of these items #5 and
      #6 scores). In addition, the BASDAI is used as an efficacy endpoint. The BASDAI is used by
      the participant to assess his/her disease activity. Using VAS scales, the participant answers
      6 questions pertaining to symptoms experienced over the past week. For 5 questions (levels
      of: fatigue/tiredness; AS neck, back, or hip pain; pain/swelling; discomfort at areas tender
      to touch or pressure; and morning stiffness), the response scale is 0 (none) to 10 (very
      severe). For 1 question (duration of morning stiffness), the response scale is 0 (0 hours) to
      10 (≥ 2 or more hours).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disability Index of Health Assessment Questionnaire Modified for the Spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Health Assessment Questionnaire modified for spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S) is a self-reported measure to assess the physical function and health-related quality of life. The Disability Index (DI) of HAQ-S is calculated as the mean of the following 8 category scores (range: 0 [without any difficulty] to 3 [unable to do]): Dressing and Grooming, Rising, Eating, Walking, Hygiene, Reach, Grip, and Activities. Five additional items in the functional status measure were included in the HAQ-S, including carrying heavy packages, sitting for long periods, able to work at a flat topped table, and (if the participant had a driver's license or a car) able to look in the rear view mirror and able to turn head to drive in reverse. The overall score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (three very severe, high-dependency disability). Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Score for Sacroiliac Joints</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Six consecutive sacroiliac (SI) joint image coronal slices representing the largest proportion of the synovial compartment of the SI joints were assessed for edema, intensity and depth of edema using SPARCC scoring.
Each SI joint (left and right) was divided into quadrants for a total of 8 SI scoring locations. Each quadrant was scored for the presence (1) or absence (0) of edema; the maximum score is 8 per slice and maximum score for 6 SI joint slices is 48.
Intensity of edema: A score of 1 was assigned for each SI joint (left and right) if an intense signal was seen in any quadrant of that joint for each slice. The maximum score is 2 per slice and 12 for 6 slices.
A lesion was graded as deep (score of 1) if there was homogeneous and unequivocal increase in signal extending over a depth of at least 1 cm from the articular surface of the SI joint in any quadrant. The maximum score per slice is 2 and for 6 slices 12.
The total maximum score for all SI joints across 6 slices is 72.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in SPARCC MRI Score for the Spine</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Six discovertebral units (DVU) representing the 6 most abnormal DVUs, and 3 consecutive sagittal slices at each DVU representing the most abnormal slices for that DVU were selected for scoring. Each DVU was divided into 4 quadrants and scored for the presence (1) or absence (0) of edema. The maximum score is 12 per DVU. The maximum score is 72 for 6 DVUs.
If edema was present in at least 1 quadrant of a DVU slice, it was scored for intensity and depth of the edema representing that slice:
A score of 1 was assigned if an intense signal was seen in any quadrant on a DVU slice. The maximum score for intensity per slice is 1, per DVU is 3 and for 6 DVUs is 18.
A lesion was graded as deep (score of 1) if there was homogeneous and unequivocal increase in signal extending over a depth of at least 1 cm from the surface of the endplate in any quadrant. The maximum score per slice is 1, for a DVU is 3 and for 6 DVUs is 18.
The total maximum SPARCC score for all 6 DVUs is 108.</description>

        <description>ASAS40 response was defined as improvement of ≥ 40% relative to Baseline and absolute improvement of ≥ 20 units (on a scale from 0 to 100) in ≥ 3 of the following 4 domains with no deterioration (defined as a net worsening of &gt; 0 units on a scale from 0 to 100) in the potential remaining domain:
Patient's Global Assessment of disease activity, measured on a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 (none) to 100 (severe);
Pain, measured by the total back pain VAS from 0 (no pain) to 100 (most severe);
Function, measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) which consists of 10 items assessing participants’ ability to perform activities on a VAS ranging from 0 (easy) to 100 (impossible);
Inflammation, measured by the mean of the 2 morning stiffness-related Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) VAS scores (items 5 [level of stiffness] and 6 [duration of stiffness]) each on a scale from 0 (none/0 hours) to 10 (very severe/2 hours or more duration).</description>

        <description>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) Disease Activity Index assesses disease activity by asking the participant to answer 6 questions (each on a 10 cm VAS) pertaining to symptoms experienced for the past week. For 5 questions (level of fatigue/tiredness, level of AS neck, back or hip pain, level of pain/swelling in joints, other than neck, back or hips, level of discomfort from any areas tender to touch or pressure, and level of morning stiffness), the response is from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe); for Question 6 (duration of morning stiffness), the response is from 0 (0 hours) to 10 (≥ 2 hours). The overall BASDAI score ranges from 0 to 10 cm. Lower scores indicate less disease activity. BASDAI50 is a 50% improvement from Baseline in BASDAI score.</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life. The SF-36 consists of 36 questions in 8 domains (limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; limitations in usual role because of physical health problems; bodily pain; general health perceptions; vitality; limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems; limitations in usual role due to emotional problems; and general mental health). Two component scores can be summarized: physical and mental; domains 1-4 comprise the physical component summary of the SF-36. A transformed summary score is calculated ranging from 0 to 100 where higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Achieving ASAS Partial Remission</title>
        <description>ASAS partial remission is an absolute score of &lt; 20 units on a 0 to 100 scale for each of the four following domains:
Patient's Global Assessment of disease activity, measured on a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 (none) to 100 (severe);
Pain, measured by the total back pain VAS from 0 (no pain) to 100 (most severe);
Function, measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) which consists of 10 items assessing participants' ability to perform activities on a VAS ranging from 0 (easy) to 100 (impossible);
Inflammation, measured by the mean of the 2 morning stiffness-related Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) VAS scores (items 5 [level of stiffness] and 6 [duration of stiffness]) each on a scale from 0 (none/0 hours) to 10 (very severe/2 hours or more duration).</description>

        <description>Health Assessment Questionnaire modified for spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S) is a self-reported measure to assess the physical function and health-related quality of life. The Disability Index (DI) of HAQ-S is calculated as the mean of the following 8 category scores (range: 0 [without any difficulty] to 3 [unable to do]): Dressing and Grooming, Rising, Eating, Walking, Hygiene, Reach, Grip, and Activities. Five additional items in the functional status measure were included in the HAQ-S, including carrying heavy packages, sitting for long periods, able to work at a flat topped table, and (if the participant had a driver's license or a car) able to look in the rear view mirror and able to turn head to drive in reverse. The overall score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (three very severe, high-dependency disability). Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Score for Sacroiliac Joints</title>
        <description>Six consecutive sacroiliac (SI) joint image coronal slices representing the largest proportion of the synovial compartment of the SI joints were assessed for edema, intensity and depth of edema using SPARCC scoring.
Each SI joint (left and right) was divided into quadrants for a total of 8 SI scoring locations. Each quadrant was scored for the presence (1) or absence (0) of edema; the maximum score is 8 per slice and maximum score for 6 SI joint slices is 48.
Intensity of edema: A score of 1 was assigned for each SI joint (left and right) if an intense signal was seen in any quadrant of that joint for each slice. The maximum score is 2 per slice and 12 for 6 slices.
A lesion was graded as deep (score of 1) if there was homogeneous and unequivocal increase in signal extending over a depth of at least 1 cm from the articular surface of the SI joint in any quadrant. The maximum score per slice is 2 and for 6 slices 12.
The total maximum score for all SI joints across 6 slices is 72.</description>

        <description>Six discovertebral units (DVU) representing the 6 most abnormal DVUs, and 3 consecutive sagittal slices at each DVU representing the most abnormal slices for that DVU were selected for scoring. Each DVU was divided into 4 quadrants and scored for the presence (1) or absence (0) of edema. The maximum score is 12 per DVU. The maximum score is 72 for 6 DVUs.
If edema was present in at least 1 quadrant of a DVU slice, it was scored for intensity and depth of the edema representing that slice:
A score of 1 was assigned if an intense signal was seen in any quadrant on a DVU slice. The maximum score for intensity per slice is 1, per DVU is 3 and for 6 DVUs is 18.
A lesion was graded as deep (score of 1) if there was homogeneous and unequivocal increase in signal extending over a depth of at least 1 cm from the surface of the endplate in any quadrant. The maximum score per slice is 1, for a DVU is 3 and for 6 DVUs is 18.

        <title>Number of Participants Achieving a BASDAI50 Response During the Open-label Period</title>
        <description>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) Disease Activity Index assesses disease activity by asking the participant to answer 6 questions (each on a 10 cm VAS) pertaining to symptoms experienced for the past week. For 5 questions (level of fatigue/tiredness, level of AS neck, back or hip pain, level of pain/swelling in joints, other than neck, back or hips, level of discomfort from any areas tender to touch or pressure, and level of morning stiffness), the response is from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe); for Question 6 (duration of morning stiffness), the response is from 0 (0 hours) to 10 (≥ 2 hours). The overall BASDAI score ranges from 0 to 10 cm. Lower scores indicate less disease activity. BASDAI50 is a 50% improvement from Baseline in BASDAI score.</description>
