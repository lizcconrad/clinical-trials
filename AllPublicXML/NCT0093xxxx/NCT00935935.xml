  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look to see if there are changes in the blood cells that are associated with
      bone disease and sort out effects that are due to the HIV virus itself, the medications and
      see if faster aging occurs in the cells of HIV infected persons. Bone disease will be
      measured by a special X-ray called a DEXA scan. A DEXA scan is used by doctors to see if
      someone has normal bone mass for their age or if there is thinning of the bones.

      The purposes of this study are:

        -  to learn how common bone disease is in HIV infected patients over the age of 50 years
           that receive their care at the CORE Center

        -  to see what are the common causes of bone disease in older HIV infected persons

        -  to see if there are differences in blood cells and levels of cytokines in patients who
           do or do not have bone disease, as this may help researchers determine the cause of bone
           disease.
