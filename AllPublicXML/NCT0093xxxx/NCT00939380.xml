  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a parent social-cognitive processing intervention (P-SCIP)
      to help decrease distress among parent caregivers of children undergoing hematopoietic stem
      cell transplant (HSCT). The investigators will evaluate the efficacy of P-SCIP in reducing
      short- and long-term distress and parenting stress among 300 parents of children undergoing
      HSCT. P-SCIP will be delivered during the child's inpatient HSCT hospitalization and is
      specifically designed to improve parent social (e.g., sharing concerns) and cognitive (e.g.,
      acceptance) processing of the transplant experience. The intervention includes five in-person
      sessions that are accompanied by an interactive CD-ROM. The CD-ROM complements the materials
      in the in-person sessions and provides parents with the opportunity to enhance and deepen
      their cognitive and social processing of the HSCT experience. The intervention will be tested
      against best-practices psychosocial care (BPC) available in four enriched pediatric HSCT
      settings across the United States. P-SCIP will be provided to both Spanish- and
      English-speaking parents. Participants will complete measures of psychological distress,
      well-being, and social and cognitive processing at the time of HSCT, two, six and twelve
      months after HSCT. Research questions will address the effects of P-SCIP versus BPC on parent
      psychological adaptation and social and cognitive processing, as well as evaluate parent
      personal resources as well as child medical course variables that contribute to intervention
      response. The investigators will also examine barriers to participation in the intervention
      by comparing barriers to participation among parents who refuse participation in the trial
      and parents who accept.
