      ECP will be given to the patients [UVAR®XTS TM Therakos system, Johnson &amp; Johnson] according
      to the following schedule:

      Starting at day 21 after transplant, if hematologic recovery allowed it: 2 ECP per week the
      first 2 weeks, and 1 ECP per week during 1 month.

      Total = 8 ECP after transplantation.

    <description>UVADEX® is supplied in a 10 mL single-use vial. Each mL of solution contains 20 mcg of UVADEX®.
In the ECP process, UVADEX® will be injected directly into the Recirculation Bag of the extracorporal circuit after completion of the buffy coat collection, just prior to pressing the photoactivation button. The dose of UVADEX used to inoculate these cells will be calculated based on the treatment volume collected during the plasma/buffy coat collection process, usinge the following formula :
Treatment Volume in mL x 0.017 = Dose of UVADEX® (in mLs) required for administration into the recirculation bag.
After the cells are inoculated with UVADEX, the buffy coat/plasma suspension is irradiated with ultraviolet-A light and then reinfused back into the patient.</description>
