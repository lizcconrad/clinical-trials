    <description>OPAL A will be supplied in two formulations: as a Filtrate (0.5 mL per cm2 of ulcer area, applied into the ulcer cavity) and as a Cream (about 1 to 5 g applied as a thin smear on surrounding skin). Both formulations will be applied daily. However, if the ulcer begins to hypergranulate, the OPAL A Filtrate will only be administered once every 72 hours.</description>

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent

          -  Additional inclusion criterion after four-week standard care run-in period:

               -  a less than or equal to 25% reduction in wound surface area compared with wound
                  surface area at the screening visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Another ulcer within 10 cm of the ulcer to be treated

          -  Patients with diabetes (fasting blood glucose value ≥ 7 mmol/L or random blood glucose

             with venous stasis) that may interfere with the appropriate assessment and treatment
             of the participant's ulcer

          -  Clinical signs of ulcer infection.

          -  Current or recent (within the past two weeks) daily treatment with immunosuppressive
             medications (including oral corticosteroids; inhaled and topical corticosteroids are
             permitted; topical agents must not be applied within 10 cm of ulcer wound), cytotoxins
             or anti-inflammatory agents (intermittent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent use is

          -  Participant previously screened or randomized in this study

          -  Cognitive impairment that in the opinion of the investigator leaves the participant
             incapable of providing informed consent
