  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on previous published research in animals, the investigators hypothesize that
      electroacupuncture (EA) will have a positive effect on hypertension.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prove: (1) Myocardial ischemia, cardiac arrhythmias and
      hypertensive response at rest and provoked by stress are decreased by EA; (2) The mechanism
      of the ischemic response is an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand
      originating as an increase in autonomic nervous system sympathetic activity causing increased
      oxygen demand. EA inhibits the sympathetic nervous system, decreases blood pressure and
      reduces the oxygen demand. Our prior data in animals shows that improvements in
      cardiovascular function during myocardial ischemia are mediated by an EA-induced sensory
      neural reflex originating in somatic nerves to reduce sympathetic nerve activity. The
      specific aims of the present study will allow us to better understand and modulate the
      sympathetic nervous discharge activity that can precipitate coronary ischemia, arrhythmias
      and hypertension in exercise stress in humans. The potential clinical application is the
      therapeutic value of EA in patients with hypertension.

      Furthermore, the study will also investigate gender differences in the blood pressure
      lowering effect of EA. In particular in middle-aged hypertensive women.
