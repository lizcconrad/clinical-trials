  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect relevant airway data using the GlideScope Cobalt
      Video Baton 1 and 2 for intubation in a large cohort of neonates and infants weighing 10 kg
      or less.

      Neonates and infants requiring endotracheal intubation and in which the attending
      anesthesiologist decided to use the CGS-CVB will be included in this observational study.
      Data will be collected by one of the investigators or the research assistant/coordinator and
      recorded on a data sheet The data from these forms will be then entered by the investigator
      or research assistant/coordinator into a database maintained only for this study.

      The decision of using the GS-CVB is at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist.
      Consequently if consent would be required the anesthesiologist might feel compelled or biased
      to use the device against his will. This will also require that all possible patients's
      should be consented which will put a serious strain on the study personal.
