      This decision to terminate enrollment in this study is based on the company's change in
      prioritization for the portfolio and was not due to any safety concerns, or regulatory
      interactions.

      Patients already enrolled in the study, should continue to complete assessments as described
      in the protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male subjects and surgically sterile or postmenopausal female subjects between the
             ages of 25 and 75 years old with specific full-thickness RCTs identified on closed MRI
             within 3 months before surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have had previous surgical intervention to the shoulder joint under study
             or additional injury requiring surgical repair or a history of shoulder dislocation in
             the affected shoulder or physical examination findings of instability in either
             shoulder

          -  Subjects who are unable to complete functional evaluations because of any other
             concurrent injuries or impairment in either the arm

          -  Subjects identified with specific fatty infiltration of their RC muscles on MRI taken
             within 3 months prior to surgical repair

          -  Subjects with moderate or severe degenerative arthritis of the shoulder under study or
             any bone abnormalities as confirmed on a radiograph

          -  Subjects with rheumatologic conditions affecting the shoulder joints or autoimmune
             disorders, treated with more than 3 corticosteroid injections in the shoulder under
             study within 1 year of planned surgery, any recent corticosteroid injection in the
             shoulder or currently receiving oral corticosteroids

          -  Subjects who are either unwilling or unable to undergo examination with closed MRI.
