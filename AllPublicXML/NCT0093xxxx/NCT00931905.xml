  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Saturnism, or lead poisoning, is defined by clinical symptoms (affecting primarily the
      nervous, hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, renal and
      reproductive systems) compatible with exposure, in the short or long term, to lead or to its
      compounds, and can manifest as acute or chronic symptoms, pursuant to the intensity and
      duration of the signs and symptoms. Measuring serum concentration is the primary method for
      diagnosing and accompanying exposed workers. Presently, elevated lead counts are reversed by
      using drugs whose effectiveness is contested on various fronts. Experimental studies shows
      the efficacy of homeopathic preparations in controlling blood lead levels in laboratory
      animals, creating the need for controlled studies that evaluate the effectiveness and safety
      of these preparations in humans.The objective of this study was evaluate the effectiveness of
      the homeopathic preparation Plumbum metallicum in reducing the blood lead level of workers
      exposed to this metal.

    <description>The homeopathic medication Plumbum metallicum 15CH was used, and was diluted and dynamized using the Hahnemann centesimal scale, whose matrix was obtained from the Schraiber laboratory in 4CH in 70% ethanol. From this solution, the matrix was elevated to 14CH in 70% ethanol. The 15CH dynamization was prepared in 30% ethanol, which was the recommended solution for administration.</description>
