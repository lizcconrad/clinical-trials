      This study evaluates the clinical effect of foot injection of the bacteria protein Botulinum
      toxin A on plantar pain in patients with EBS (epidermolysis bullosa simplex) or PC
      (pachyonychia congenita).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is the most common subtype of epidermolysis bullosa and
      mutations in keratin genes (KRT 5/14) are responsible for this condition. Painful blisters
      and keratoderma of the feet are common and the blisters in EBS typically get worse in the
      summer due to sweating and increased environmental heat. Since 2010, also the related
      condition pachyonychia congenita (PC) is included in the study. The primary objective of the
      study is to evaluate the clinical effect of Botulinum toxin A (Dysport®), injected in the
      foot, on plantar pain in patients with EBS or PC. Quality of life, pain in feet, effect
      duration, plantar sweating and safety of the treatment will also be studied.

    <description>Single injection in patients´ soles with Btx A in one foot and sodium chloride in the other, with the possibility of a second injection after 12 weeks. The drug will be given in general anaesthesia after curettage of the focal hyperkeratoses. Only the areas with focal hyperkeratoses will be injected with 50 ul per injection.The active drug Btx A (Dysport®, solution for injection) has a concentration of 100 U/ml, and the maximum dose is 300 U per foot.</description>
