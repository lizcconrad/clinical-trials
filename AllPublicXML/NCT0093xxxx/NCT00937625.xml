  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the toxicity and clinical response of therapy with
      tumor infiltrating lymphocytes as treatment for advanced melanoma.

      Patient will receive a single treatment consisting of conditioning chemotherapy for seven
      days (cyclophosphamide for two days and fludarabine for five days), intravenous infusion of
      high number of in vitro expanded tumor infiltrating lymphocytes followed by two weeks with
      daily low-dose interleukine-2. Patients will be evaluated for toxicity, tumor response, and
      immune response.

      After the first 6 patients the treatment with IL-2 has been changed to include higher doses
      of IL-2 (see intervention)

    <description>Two days of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg i.v.) and five days of fludarabine (25 mg/m2 i.v.). Infusion of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (10e9-10e10 cells). Followed by daily sc injections of 2 MIE Interleukin-2 for two weeks. After the first 6 patients the dose of IL-2 has been changed to an i.v. decrescendo regimen using 18 MIU/m2 infused over 6, 12 and 24 hours and then 4.5 MIU/m2 infused over 24 hours for three days.</description>
