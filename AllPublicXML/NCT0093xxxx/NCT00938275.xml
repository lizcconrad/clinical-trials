      The primary objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of a single 500
      mg dose of SRT2104 administered as an oral suspension and a capsule formulation to normal
      healthy male and female volunteers in both the fed and fasted state.

      The secondary objective is to assess the safety and tolerance of SRT2104 administered as an
      oral suspension and as a capsule formulation to healthy male and female volunteers in both
      the fed and fasted state.

    <description>Cohort 1 (10 males) &amp; Cohort 2 (10 females) must attend the clinic on 4 separate treatment visits during the study; each treatment visit will be one week apart. At each treatment visit, subjects will receive one of the following 4 treatments:
A) 0.5g SRT2104 administered as an oral suspension in the fasted state B) 0.5g SRT2104 administered as an oral suspension following consumption of a standard meal C) 0.5g SRT2104 administered as two 0.25g capsules in the fasted state D) 0.5g SRT2104 administered as two 0.25g capsules following consumption of a standard meal.
For treatments A and C, subjects will have fasted for at least 10 hours overnight. Water will be restricted from 1h prior to dosing until 1h post dose. A light lunch will be provided 4h post dose. For treatments B and D, subjects will receive SRT2104 within 30 min following the start of consumption of a standardized non high-fat meal (approximately 650 kcal with approximately 30% of calories derived from fat).</description>

    <description>SRT2104 will be supplied in two forms: as 0.5g powder which will be prepared by the pharmacist/designee into a liquid suspension and as two hard gelatin capsules, each containing 0.25g SRT2104. The dosing vehicle for the liquid suspension is 1% (by weight) hypromellose acetate succinate in water, which is used as a suspension aid and a dispersant for the SRT2104.
Each formulation of test material will be administered orally, in a single dose to the subjects in the fasted state and following consumption of a standard meal. Neither the investigator nor the subjects enrolled will be blinded to treatment assignment.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be a healthy male or female within the age range of 18 to 55 years.

          -  Voluntarily sign a Research Ethics Committee (REC)-approved informed consent form to
             participate in the study after all relevant aspects of the study have been explained
             and discussed with the subject.

          -  Have Hematology, Coagulation, Clinical Chemistry and Urinalysis test results that are
             within normal, allowable limits (if out-of-range, must be considered clinically
             significant to be exclusionary) and performed within 21 days of receiving first dose
             of test material.

          -  Have a BMI (Body Mass Index) between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m^2.

          -  Be clear of any history of HIV and hepatitis B and C.

          -  Have no significant disease or clinically significant abnormal laboratory value as
             deemed by the investigator on the laboratory evaluations, medical history, or physical
             exam.

          -  Have a normal 12-lead ECG or an ECG with abnormality considered to be clinically
             insignificant.

          -  Have the ability to communicate with the investigative site staff in a manner
             sufficient to carry out all protocol procedures as described.

          -  All subjects and their partner must agree to use an acceptable double barrier method
             for birth control from the Screening visit through 3 months after the last dose of
             test material.

          -  All female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential. For the purposes of this
             study, this is defined as the subject being amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive
             months or at least 6 weeks post-surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
             hysterectomy. (Menopausal status will be confirmed by demonstrating levels of follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) of 20 - 138 mIU/ml and oestradiol &lt; 20 pg/ml at entry. In
             the event a subject's menopause status has been clearly established (for example, the
             subject indicates she has been amenorrheic for 10 years), but FSH and/or oestradiol
             levels are not consistent with a post-menopausal condition, determination of subject
             eligibility will be at the discretion of the principal investigator following
             consultation with the sponsor.

          -  Subject agrees to refrain from consumption of grapefruits and/or grapefruit juice from
             7 days prior to day -1 of treatment visit 1 through to the end of subject's final
             study visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has had a major illness in the past three months or any significant ongoing
             chronic medical illness that the Investigator would deem unfavorable for enrollment.

          -  Subject has renal or liver impairment.

          -  Subject has a history of gastro-intestinal surgery or has a current gastrointestinal
             disease which may influence drug absorption.

          -  Subject has a history, within 3 years, of drug abuse (including Benzodiazepines,
             opioids, amphetamine, cocaine, and THC) or a positive drug result at Screening.

          -  Subject smokes more than 5 cigarettes a day.

          -  Subject has a history of alcoholism, and/or is currently drinking more than three
             drinks per day [one drink is equal to one unit of alcohol (one glass of wine, half a
             pint of beer, one measure of a spirit)].

          -  Subject has participated in a clinical trial within the past three months (defined as
             three months from the date of last dose of an investigational medicinal product).

          -  Subject has a history of difficulty in donating blood or accessibility of veins in
             left or right arm.

          -  Subject has donated blood (one unit or 350 mL) within three months prior to receiving
             test material.

          -  Subject is taking herbal products, over-the-counter medication or prescription drug
             therapy (with the exception of hormone replacement therapy for female subjects) for
             which 5 times the half-life is longer than 21 days (i.e., the Screening period) prior
             to enrollment into the study.
