    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to identify pediatric patients with Hunter syndrome who have
      neurodevelopmental disease characteristics, who are currently receiving treatment with
      Elaprase, and who may be suitable to participate in a clinical study with an investigational
      agent.

    <description>Standardized tests were used to identify patients who were receiving treatment with Elaprase, had cognitive impairment, and were suitable to participate in the follow-on clinical study (HGT-HIT-045). Assessments included:
Cognition: The Differential Ability Scale, Second Edition (DAS-II) or the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition (BSID-III);
Adaptive Behavior: The Scale of Independent Behavior-Revised (SIB-R);
Executive Function: The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool version (BRIEF-P) for children or the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) for children less than or ≥6 years of age, respectively;
Motor: The Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2 (PDMS-2) or the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition (BOT-2) for children less than or ≥6 years of age, respectively.</description>

    <description>The GCA sub-scale of the DAS, Second Edition (DAS-II) was used to obtain a general measure of cognitive ability.The maximum score is 120, with a higher score indicating greater cognitive ability. A score of 100 is considered an average score.</description>
