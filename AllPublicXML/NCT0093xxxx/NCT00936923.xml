  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, open-label, stratified, controlled clinical trial to evaluate
      whether long term furosemide therapy (1 year) would preserve urine volume and/or residual
      renal function (RRF) and improve fluid state in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis
      (CAPD) patients.

      There are 3 phases in this study. Phase 1 is screening phase. Each subject will be evaluated
      to determine if he/she is eligible for the study. Phase 2 is the intervention phage. Patients
      are divided arbitrarily into two groups according to baseline RRF (residual glomerular
      filtration rate [rGFR] &lt;5or &gt; 5 ml/min), then randomly received 12 months treatment with the
      study drugs( furosemide 120mg daily, 60mg daily, or no diuretic). Phase 3 is following-up
      phase, which lasts 1 year. Dialytic prescription is adjusted independent of the study and is
      guided by clinical parameters and calculated clearances (target creatinine clearance
      65L/week, urea clearance Kt/V &gt; 1.7 per week). Blood pressure is measured using an automated
      blood pressure device, and the target level is 135/85mmHg. The antihypertensive medication is
      introduced after the body weigh reduced into target level, and the ACEI and /or ARB selection
      is needed to the cross-sectional design. The hydration state is measured by bioelectrical
      impedance analysis (BIA).
