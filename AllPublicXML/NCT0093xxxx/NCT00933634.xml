    <textblock>
      The optimal strategy to restore sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) of
      less than 48 hours' duration is still controversial. The investigators performed a controlled
      single-center trial to compare electrical and pharmacological (propafenone) cardioversion to
      restore the sinus rhythm in selected patients with acute atrial fibrillation.
