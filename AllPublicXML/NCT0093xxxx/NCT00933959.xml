      The aim of the proposed pilot study is to scientifically evaluate the use of Mind-Body
      Bridging Program (MBBP) as an effective intervention for improving health outcomes in
      veterans exhibiting sleep disturbance in the Primary Care Clinic at the Veterans
      Administration Salt Lake City Health Care System (VASLCHCS).

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either MBBP or a treatment as usual sleep hygiene
      (SH) group. The interventions will last two weeks in which participants will attend 2 classes
      1-1.5 hr each over two consecutive weeks. Assessment of the effects of the treatments will be
      based on self-report outcome measures; participants will complete five questionnaires
      approximately one week prior to the start of the interventions (pre-treatment) and one week
      after the second session (post-treatment). The sleep quality assessment questionnaire will be
      additionally completed after the first session (Week 1).

    <description>Subjects will undergo two approximately 1.5 hr training sessions using MBBP spaced one week apart at the VASLCHCS. Each training session will comprise a number of objectives:
Session 1:
The patient will discover the underlying cause of the insomnia.
The patient will learn how to use easy to apply tools to quieten the mind to sleep soundly.
Session 2:
The patient will learn how to reduce daytime stress.
The patient will experience a greater sense of self.
To be maximally effective, the participant should master these objectives and practice MBBP on a daily basis. Bridging and all the other MBBP techniques can be implemented at any time throughout the day and right up to the onset of sleep.</description>

    <description>Participants in the sleep hygiene arm will receive a 1 hr class directing them to the importance of following a list of up to 15 points (tips) for getting to sleep. These points include: limiting alcohol and caffeine intake before bed, using the bed only for sleeping, and having regular bedtimes. Once the instructor has gone over this list and has described in detail each of the 15 points, the class will have an opportunity to ask questions. The participant will be encouraged to learn and practice the objectives of the sleep hygiene class on a daily basis.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Selection of subjects will be based on the patients exhibiting sleep disturbance as
             assessed by a standardized sleep questionnaire. Because we are also interested in the
             effects of MBBP on co-morbid illnesses besides insomnia, we will include subjects that
             are being treated for depression, pain, and general medical conditions, except as
             defined as exclusion criteria. Subjects using anti-depressants, sleep and pain
             medications, and other medications for any condition that is not under exclusion
             criteria will be admitted to the study. Thus our inclusion criteria will be broader
             than those based on DSM-IV for primary insomnia.

          2. On the day of the study session, patients must arrive before the session for
             intervention assignment and to turn in their packets, and thereafter on the same day
             they must be able to attend a mind-body bridging program or sleep hygiene class (see
             Study Procedure). In addition, they must also be able to attend the second session the
             following week.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient presents with significant mental health issues, such as severe psychosis
             or major depression (as verified by the primary care provider) or the patient is under
             intensive mental health case management.
