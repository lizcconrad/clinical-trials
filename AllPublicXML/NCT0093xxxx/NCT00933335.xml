  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, single institution, phase II study of fludarabine monophosphate
      followed by Iodine I 131 Tositumomab for patients with previously untreated, advanced-stage
      (stage III or IV) low-grade, transformed low-grade and follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The
      primary objective of the study will be to evaluate the safety of this treatment combination
      and the secondary endpoint will be to evaluate efficacy.

    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship (association) with this treatment. Therefore, an AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not it was considered to be related to the medicinal product. Laboratory abnormalities were recorded as AEs only if they were associated with clinical sequelae and/or required an intervention.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event (AE)</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship (association) with this treatment. Therefore, an AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not it was considered to be related to the medicinal product. Laboratory abnormalities were recorded as AEs only if they were associated with clinical sequelae and/or required an intervention.</description>

        <description>An SAE was defined as any event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life threatening adverse drug experience (at immediate risk of death from the experience as it occurred), inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered to be a serious adverse drug experience when based upon appropriate medical judgment.</description>

        <description>The administration of murine antibodies may form HAMA. A HAMA assay was performed using the ImmunoSTRIP HAMA IgG enzyme-linked immune absorbent assay by a central laboratory (Covance Classic Laboratory Services, Indianapolis, IN). Fludarabine, a known immunosuppressant, might decrease HAMA production in addition to reducing bone marrow involvement. To be &quot;positive,&quot; a participant had to have a positive HAMA assessment at any follow-up visit (Weeks 12 and 25; Months 12, 18, and 24).</description>

            <description>Participants received 3 cycles of IV fludarabine monophosphate (25 mg/m^2/day) for 5 days every 5 to 6 weeks. The DD was administered 6 to 8 weeks after the third cycle of fludarabine. IV administration of unlabeled TST (450 mg) was infused over 1 hr prior to a 30 minute infusion of 35 mg TST trace labeled with 5 mCi iodine I 131. Participants received at least 3 doses (4 drops by mouth, TID) of a saturated solution KI, 3 doses (20 drops by mouth, TID) of Lugol’s solution, or KI tablets (130 mg by mouth, once a day) 24 hrs or more prior to administration of the DD and continued daily for 14 days following the TD. The TD was administered 7 to 14 days after the dosimetric dose. The TD was an IV infusion of 450 mg TST over 1 hour, followed by infusion of 35 mg of TST radio labeled with iodine I 131 to deliver the appropriate total body dose of 75, 65, or 45 cGy over 20 minutes.</description>

        <description>The number of participants with elevated TSH levels is reported. An elevated TSH level indicates that an insufficient amount of the thyroid hormone is being produced. Insufficient thyroid hormone production is known as hypothyroidism. The normal range of TSH is between 0.2 and 6.1 milliunits per liter (mU/L).</description>

        <population>ITT-Exposed Population: baseline TSH levels were determined for 36 participants. Of 35 participants who received the dosimetric and therapeutic doses of TST/I-131 TST, 2 had elevated TSH at baseline, and 33 were assessed for developing elevated TSH.</population>

The DD was administered 6 to 8 weeks after the third cycle of fludarabine. IV administration of unlabeled TST (450 mg) was infused over 1 hr prior to a 30 minute infusion of 35 mg TST trace labeled with 5 mCi iodine I 131. Participants received at least 3 doses (4 drops by mouth, TID) of a saturated solution KI, 3 doses (20 drops by mouth, TID) of Lugol’s solution, or KI tablets (130 mg by mouth, once a day) 24 hrs or more prior to administration of the DD and continued daily for 14 days following the TD. The TD was administered 7 to 14 days after the dosimetric dose. The TD was an IV infusion of 450 mg TST over 1 hour, followed by infusion of 35 mg of TST radio labeled with iodine I 131 to deliver the appropriate total body dose of 75, 65, or 45 cGy over 20 minutes.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Any Infection at Week 16 Post-Fludarabine Treatment and Week 13 Post-TST Treatment Detected by Laboratory Culture of Participant Sample or Investigator Report</title>
        <description>An infection is the colonization of a host organism by a parasite species. Infecting parasites seek to use the host's resources to reproduce, often resulting in disease. Colloquially, infections are usually considered to be caused by microscopic organisms or microparasites like viruses, bacteria, and viroids, although larger organisms such as macroparasites and fungi can also infect.</description>

The DD was administered 6 to 8 weeks after the third cycle of fludarabine. IV administration of unlabeled TST (450 mg) was infused over 1 hr prior to a 30 minute infusion of 35 mg TST trace labeled with 5 mCi iodine I 131. Participants received at least 3 doses (4 drops by mouth, TID) of a saturated solution KI, 3 doses (20 drops by mouth, TID) of Lugol’s solution, or KI tablets (130 mg by mouth, once a day) 24 hrs or more prior to administration of the DD and continued daily for 14 days following the TD. The TD was administered 7 to 14 days after the dosimetric dose. The TD was an IV infusion of 450 mg TST over 1 hour, followed by infusion of 35 mg of TST radio labeled with iodine I 131 to deliver the appropriate total body dose of 75, 65, or 45 cGy over 20 minutes.</description>

IV administration of unlabeled tositumomab (TST) (450 mg) was infused over 1 hour (hr) prior to a 30 minute infusion of 35 mg TST trace labeled with 5 millicurie (mCi) iodine I 131. Participants received at least 3 doses (4 drops by mouth, 3 times a day [TID]) of a saturated solution of potassium iodide (KI), 3 doses (20 drops by mouth, TID) of Lugol's solution, or KI tablets (130 mg by mouth, once a day) 24 hrs or more prior to administration of the DD and continued daily for 14 days following the therapeutic dose (TD). The TD was administered 7 to 14 days after the dosimetric dose. The TD was an IV infusion of 450 mg TST over 1 hour, followed by infusion of 35 mg of TST radiolabeled with iodine I 131 to deliver the appropriate total body dose of 75, 65, or 45 centigray (cGy) over 20 minutes.</description>
