  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis is one of the most frequent skin diseases. The disease is often worst
      during winter months when the skin is drier. Mild to moderate cases of atopic dermatitis are
      often controlled by a moisturizer alone. The use of moisturizers has been shown to have
      beneficial effects on atopic dermatitis. It can break the dry skin cycle by hydrating the
      upper layer of the skin which may prevent the recurrence of the disease and can reduce the
      use of cream or ointment medications such as corticosteroids. Formulation 609580 20 was
      developed to keep the moisturizing efficacy of formulation 609209 but to improve its
      tolerance and cosmetic acceptability (easier to apply, nicer texture, etc.). The new
      formulation contains the same quantity of shea butter and glycerin but in a different
      excipient (inactive substance) than the commercial product. In addition, vitamin B3 was added
      to see if it could help in reducing itching.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of two study products in
      children with atopic dermatitis. One of the study products (formulation 609580 20) is not
      commercially available (outside of clinical trials such as this one). The other study product
      (formulation 609209) has been approved in Canada and is currently available commercially
      under the trade name Lipikar Baume.

      For this study the child will be randomly assigned to one of the following two groups:

        -  Group 1: 50 children will receive formulation 609209, the commercial formula for 42 days
           and will receive formulation 609580 20, the new formula, for 14 days.

        -  Group 2: 50 children will receive formulation 609580 20, the new formula, for 42 days
           and will receive formulation 609209, the commercial formula, for 14 days.

      A randomized clinical trial performed at five (5) centers (Montreal, Laval, Quebec City,
      (Quebec); Markham, London (Ontario), Canada). One hundred (100) patients are enrolled in the
      study. Subjects and parent(s) or guardian are asked to present to the clinic for five (5)
      visits (Screening, D0, D7, D42, D56). Formulation 609580 20 or 609209 is applied twice a day
      (morning and evening) to the whole body for a total of 42 days and then there is a crossover
      between the two formulations.

      Efficacy is evaluated at D0, D7 and D42 measured by SCORAD (scoring atopic dermatitis).
      Tolerance is evaluated by the investigator at D7, D42 and D56. Global efficacy is measured by
      parents and investigator at D7 and D42. Medical photographs (optional) of lesions are taken
      with patients consent at D0 and D42. A crossover between the two products occurs at day 42 so
      that cosmetic acceptability can be compared at D42 and D56. Skin examinations are performed
      at all visits. A quality of life questionnaire is filled out by the parent(s) at D0 and D42.

    <description>The efficacy of formulation 609580 20 to provide relief to children with atopic dermatitis compared to formulation 609209 as measured by the changes in SCORAD at Day 7 and Day 42. It measures intensity of erythema/darkening, edema/papulation, oozing/crust, excoriation, lichenfinication/prurigo and dryness on a scale from 0-3 for a total of 18 points. This score is multiplided by 3.5 and added to 1/5 of the affected percent body surface area. The final score is added to the score from a 10-point pruritus visual analog scale (VAS) and a 10-point loss of sleep VAS. Best score is 0, worst is 103.</description>

          <title>SCORAD - Score Atopic Dermatitis</title>
          <description>SCORAD - Score Atopic Dermatis measures intensity of erythema/darkening, edema/papulation, oosing/crust, excoriation, lichenfinication/prurigo and dryness on a scale from 0-3 for a total of 18 points. This score is multiplided by 3.5 and added to 1/5 of the affected percent body surface area. The final score is added to the score from a 10-point pruritus visual analog scale (VAS) and a 10-point loss of sleep VAS. Best score is 0, worst score is 103.
Example:
18 * 3.5 = 63
63 + 20 = 83
83 + 10 + 10 = 103</description>

          <description>Tolerance of study products assessed by investigator during the 2 weeks following the crossover (Day 56 of the study):
1) Very good tolerance: no objective or subjective intolerance during the study
2) Good tolerance: very occasional symptoms, not resulting in cessation of applications, no objective sign
3) Average tolerance: repeated symptoms of intolerance, no cessation of application and no objective sign
4) Poor tolerance: symptoms requiring cessation of application, no objective sign
5) Very poor tolerance: objective signs of irritative or allergic dermatitis</description>

Missing data were replaced using the last observation carried forward method.
