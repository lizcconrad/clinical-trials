    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess preliminary efficacy and to determine the safety and
      feasibility of ex vivo generated dendritic cell (HDC) infusion with and without donor
      lymphocyte infusion (DLI) after allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT). We also wish to
      establish the feasibility of apheresis shipment as well as vaccine shipment and stability in
      the population.
