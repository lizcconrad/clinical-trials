    <textblock>
      Infections are common causes of morbidity and mortality in pediatric cancer patients. Today,
      there are limited data on the incidence, distribution of specific infections, causative
      agents and risk factors for severe infections in this population. Moreover, little data exist
      on the epidemiology of infections among pediatric patients with solid tumors.

      The objectives of the present study are to define the incidence, categories of infections by
      organ systems, etiologic agents and risk factors for infections in different pediatric
      malignancies. The results of this study will help the investigators to better understand the
      epidemiology of infections in the different types of pediatric malignancies, enable the
      investigators to identify high risk patients, and design a better approach to empiric
      treatment of these patients.

      A prospective, multi-center study, conducted in 5 pediatric hematology-oncology units across
      Israel (Rambam Medical Center, Haemek Medical Center, Schneider Children's Medical Center,
      Hadassah Medical Center, Soroka Medical Center). All children aged 0-18 years of age, newly
      diagnosed with cancer and admitted to day care or inpatient departments with fever of &gt;38.0 C
      will be included in the study. Demographic, clinical and microbiological figures will be
      collected in each center by a research assistant supervised by the infectious disease
      specialist. Data will be collected according to a pre-defined Patient Data Form and entered
      into an electronic data base that will be analyzed accordingly. In each event of febrile
      episode during chemotherapy, the following data will be collected by a research assistant
      using a patient data form and computerized software:

        -  Demographic data: age, gender, ethnicity.

        -  Clinical data: Underlying disease, immunizations, prophylactic antibiotics, presence of
           central venous catheter, intensity of chemotherapy, duration of fever, duration and
           severity of neutropenia, diagnosis of present event.

        -  Imaging data

        -  Microbiological data

        -  Outcome

      The statistical analysis will be performed by an epidemiologist and statistician using the
      SPSS 12.0 software.
