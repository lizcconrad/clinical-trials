  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-interventional, non comparative drug study. The efficacy of
      Quinapril in Asian population has been evaluated, but specifically in Indian patients the
      data is sparse. Data in a real world setting in a large population of Indian patients would
      shed more light on the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of Quinapril in the Indian
      population.

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug was considered an AE, without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE): those which occurred or worsened after baseline. An AE resulting in any of the following outcomes, or deemed to be significant for any other reason, was considered to be a SAE: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; a life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>

    <description>The status of achieving a participant's goal BP at Week 12 was yes (at goal) or no (not at goal). The BP goal also depended on the participant's status of &quot;Diabetes Mellitus (DM) or renal disease&quot;. To be considered at goal, SBP/DBP must be less than 140/90 mmHg for participants without DM or renal disease and SBP/DBP must be less than 130/80 mmHg for participants with DM or renal disease.</description>

    <measure>Mean Daily Dose of Study Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to week 52 or early termination</time_frame>

If the participant did not require any such add-on medication, the first add-on antihypertensive therapy was &quot;None&quot;.</description>

        <description>The status of achieving a participant’s goal BP at Week 12 was yes (at goal) or no (not at goal). The BP goal also depended on the participant’s status of “Diabetes Mellitus (DM) or renal disease”. To be considered at goal, SBP/DBP must be less than 140/90 mmHg for participants without DM or renal disease and SBP/DBP must be less than 130/80 mmHg for participants with DM or renal disease.</description>

        <population>FAS included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication including those who took it before enrolment. Subgroup analysis was performed for each subgroup of participants in the FAS defined by DM or renal disease status. Missing values were imputed by LOCF.</population>
