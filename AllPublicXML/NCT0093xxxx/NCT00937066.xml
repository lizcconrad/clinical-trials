      This study is an economic evaluation of Symbicort (Budesonide/formoterol) as maintenance and
      reliever therapy (SMART) versus its competitive alternatives.

      The aims of this study are:

        -  To estimate the relative effectiveness of each one of the alternatives in the management
           of patients with moderate to severe asthma through a systematic review for the following
           outcomes:

             -  Cumulative incidence of asthma severe exacerbations symptoms

             -  Safety of each alternative (frequency of adverse events and complications due to
                the medications)

        -  To estimate the direct medical costs of treating with each pharmacologic alternative:
           Symbicort as SMART versus increased use of inhaled corticosteroids or Adding long-acting
           inhaled beta 2 agonist plus inhaled corticosteroids.

        -  To create a decision analysis model (decision tree) that allows comparisons between the
           alternatives on expected values and costs.

        -  To calculate the average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.

        -  To carry out a sensitivity analysis to test de robustness of the cost-effectiveness
           results allowing for reasonable changes in expected values and costs.
