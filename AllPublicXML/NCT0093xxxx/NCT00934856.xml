  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, non-randomized study of the safety and tolerability of
      the combination of T-DM1 plus docetaxel for the treatment of participants with metastatic
      breast cancer (MBC) and of T-DM1 plus docetaxel with or without pertuzumab, for the treatment
      of participants with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). The study comprises an initial
      dose finding (feasibility) part to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of T-DM1 and
      docetaxel, followed by an extension part aiming to consolidate the safety and efficacy of the
      recommended docetaxel/T-DM1 combination regimen.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious AEs (SAEs) - MBC and LABC Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 28 days after last dose for MBC participants and for LABC participants who could not undergo surgery, and up to 6 weeks post-surgery for LABC participants who underwent surgery (maximum up to approximately 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires in-patient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, results in development of drug dependency or drug abuse, is an important medical event.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Event - MBC Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until disease progression or death (up to approximately 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time interval between the date of the start of treatment and the date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Response was based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.0 (v1.0). For target lesions (TLs), PD was at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more lesions. For non-target lesions (NTLs), PD was the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing NTLs. Data for participants without PD or death was censored at the time of the last response assessment. Percentage of participants with PFS event was calculated as the (number of participants with PFS event [PD or death]) divided by (total number of participants), and then multiplied by 100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PFS - MBC Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until disease progression or death (up to approximately 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time interval between the date of the start of treatment and the date of first documentation of PD or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Response was based on RECIST v1.0. For TLs, PD was at least a 20 % increase in the sum of LD of TLs, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more lesions. For NTLs, PD was the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing NTLs. Median PFS time was calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Data for participants without PD or death was censored at the time of the last response assessment.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) - MBC Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until disease progression or recurrence (up to approximately 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>BOR was defined as CR or PR recorded from baseline until disease progression/recurrence according to RECIST v1.0 criteria. For TLs, CR was defined as the disappearance of all TLs, and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of LDs of the TLs, taking as a reference the baseline (BL) sum of LDs. For NTLs, CR was defined as the disappearance of all NTLs and normalization of tumor marker levels. Percentage of participants with BOR rate was calculated as the (number of participants with CR or PR) divided by (total number of participants), and then multiplied by 100. The 95% confidence interval (Cl) was determined using the Pearson-Clopper method.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment Failure - MBC Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until end of treatment (up to 39.8 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment failure was defined as the discontinuation of treatment for any reason, including the following qualifying events: PD, death from any cause, withdrawal from study treatment, or initiation of nonprotocol anti-cancer therapy. Percentage of participants with treatment failure was calculated as the (number of participants with treatment failure) divided by (total number of participants), and then multiplied by 100.</description>

    <measure>Time to Treatment Failure (TTF) - MBC Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until end of treatment (up to 39.8 months)</time_frame>
    <description>TTF was defined as the time interval between the date of start of treatment and the date of PD, death from any cause, withdrawal from study treatment, or initiation of non-protocol anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurred first. Participants without an event at the time of the analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up assessment. Median TTF was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With CR or PR or Stable Disease (SD) for at Least 6 Months [Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)] - MBC Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until disease progression, recurrence or death (up to approximately 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>CBR was defined as percentage of participants experiencing SD of at least 6 months from the start of treatment plus CR or PR according to the RECIST v1.0 criteria. For TLs: CR- disappearance of all TLs. PR- at least 30% decrease in the sum of LDs of the TLs, taking as a reference the BL sum of LDs. PD- at least 20% increase in the sum of LD of TLs, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more lesions. SD- neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. For NTLs: CR- disappearance of all NTLs and normalization of tumor marker levels. SD- persistence of one or more NTLs and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. Percentage of participants= number of participants with CR/PR/SD divided by total number of participants, and then multiplied by 100. 95% CI was determined using the Pearson-Clopper method.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response - MBC Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until disease progression, recurrence or death (up to approximately 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was calculated for participants with CR or PR based on the RECIST v1.0 criteria. Duration of response was defined as the time interval between the date the CR or PR was first recorded and the date on which PD was first noted or date of death, whichever occurred first. Participants with no documented PD after CR or PR were censored at the last date at which they were known to have had the CR or PR, respectively. Median duration of response was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <description>PFS was defined as the time interval between the date of the start of treatment and the date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Response was based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.0 (v1.0). For target lesions (TLs), PD was at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more lesions. For non-target lesions (NTLs), PD was the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing NTLs. Data for participants without PD or death was censored at the time of the last response assessment. Percentage of participants with PFS event was calculated as the (number of participants with PFS event [PD or death]) divided by (total number of participants), and then multiplied by 100.</description>

For TLs, CR was defined as the disappearance of all TLs, and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of LDs of the TLs, taking as a reference the baseline (BL) sum of LDs. For NTLs, CR was defined as the disappearance of all NTLs and normalization of tumor marker levels. Percentage of participants with BOR rate was calculated as the (number of participants with CR or PR) divided by (total number of participants), and then multiplied by 100. The 95% confidence interval (Cl) was determined using the Pearson-Clopper method.</description>

        <title>Duration of Response - MBC Population</title>
        <description>Duration of response was calculated for participants with CR or PR based on the RECIST v1.0 criteria. Duration of response was defined as the time interval between the date the CR or PR was first recorded and the date on which PD was first noted or date of death, whichever occurred first. Participants with no documented PD after CR or PR were censored at the last date at which they were known to have had the CR or PR, respectively. Median duration of response was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a BOR of CR or PR - LABC Population</title>
        <description>BOR was defined as CR or PR recorded from baseline until disease progression/recurrence according to RECIST v1.0 criteria. For TLs, CR was defined as the disappearance of all TLs, and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of LDs of the TLs, taking as a reference the baseline (BL) sum of LDs. For NTLs, CR was defined as the disappearance of all NTLs and normalization of tumor marker levels. Percentage of participants with BOR rate was calculated as the (number of participants with CR or PR) divided by (total number of participants), and then multiplied by 100. The 95% Cl was determined using the Pearson-Clopper method.</description>
