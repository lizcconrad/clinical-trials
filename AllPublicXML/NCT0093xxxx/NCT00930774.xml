  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many soldiers returning from their recent service in Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation
      Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) were exposed to blasts during combat. About 60% of blast-injured
      soldiers are diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (TBI), with approximately 18% having a
      mild TBI (mTBI). mTBI is associated with many symptoms, including memory problems, headaches,
      difficulty concentrating, increased anxiety, and, especially relevant here, reports of
      difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments and/or when people speak rapidly. While
      problems understanding rapid speech or speech in noise are associated with hearing loss, many
      of the OIF/OEF veterans with these complaints have clinically normal hearing. Although there
      is no physical damage to their ears, these veterans' hearing problems have a negative impact
      on their quality-of-life and functioning. Thus it is incumbent upon the VA to examine
      intervention approaches for veterans with normal/near-normal auditory sensitivity and
      significant complaints of difficulty hearing. Currently, there is no standard-of-care for
      these veterans other than providing information about hearing, hearing conservation, and the
      use of communication strategies. Two forms of rehabilitation likely to be more effective than
      such an informational-counseling approach are: (1) the use of personal miniaturized Frequency
      modulation (FM) systems, and (2) the provision of auditory training with Posit Science Brain
      Fitness Program (BFP). Personal FM systems increase the loudness of the speech signal
      relative to that of the unwanted noise, while the BFP training improves the ability to listen
      by taking advantage of the brain's ability to change (i.e., neural plasticity). In this study
      veterans will randomly be selected to receive one of four treatments: (1) FM use alone, (2)
      BFP training alone, (3) FM+BFP training combined, and (4) informational-counseling. The
      effectiveness of the interventions will be compared using self-report of hearing functioning
      on standard questionnaires. Results will contribute to the development of evidence-based
      intervention approaches for blast-exposed veterans with reported functional hearing
      difficulties and normal/near-normal auditory sensitivity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this study is to develop evidence-based auditory rehabilitation for
      veterans who have normal/near-normal peripheral auditory function and significant complaints
      of difficulty hearing. Many are veterans of the OIF/OEF conflicts who have been exposed to
      blast - the most common wounding etiology in these conflicts. Approximately 18% of
      blast-injured veterans are diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). mTBI can result
      in post-concussive symptoms such as memory problems, difficulty concentrating, increased
      anxiety, and functional hearing difficulties in the presence of clinically-normal hearing
      sensitivity.

      Currently there is no standard-of-care auditory rehabilitation for veterans with
      normal/near-normal auditory sensitivity and complaints of difficulty hearing. At a minimum,
      the VA recommends provision of information about the auditory system, hearing conservation
      and use of communication strategies. Two interventions likely to be more efficacious are: (1)
      use of personal FM (frequency modulation) systems, and/or (2) auditory training. FM systems
      are effective for managing auditory problems in children with normal/near normal peripheral
      hearing. FM systems substantially improve the signal-to-noise ratio of speech in noisy and
      reverberant environments, theoretically making more resources available for higher level
      processing. Auditory training takes advantage of neural plasticity. The Posit Science Brain
      Fitness Program (BFP) is an auditory training program for adults that can improve temporal
      processing and working memory of older adults. Combining use of FM systems with auditory
      training has been shown to improve speech understanding and to decrease reported hearing
      abilities among adults with sensorineural hearing loss and functional hearing complaints.

      No study has systemically examined the relative efficacy of FM use and/or auditory training
      for veterans with mTBI and normal/almost normal hearing sensitivity. The effectiveness of
      these two intervention strategies will be examined in this study through a between-subjects
      randomized controlled clinical trial comparing the outcomes of: (1) FM use alone, (2) BFP
      alone, and (3) FM+BFP combined. All groups will also receive informational-counseling, as
      will (4) a control group. Outcomes will be measured subjectively through self-report of
      auditory competence.

      The results of the study will help to determine whether or not the use of FM systems or
      auditory training, either alone or combined, are efficacious interventions for blast-exposed
      veterans with reported functional hearing difficulties and normal/near-normal auditory
      sensitivity. Results will contribute to the development of evidence-based auditory
      rehabilitation for these veterans, moving VA closer to fulfilling its goal of providing
      excellence in patient care, veterans' benefits and customer satisfaction.

        <title>Stroop Color and Word Test</title>
        <description>Measure of processing interference that assesses the ability to cope with cognitive stress and process complex input. It consists of a Word Page with color words printed in black ink, a Color Page with 'Xs' printed in color, and a Color-Word Page with words from the first page printed in colors from the second page (the color and the word do not match). The test-taker looks at each sheet and moves down the columns, reading words or naming the ink colors as quickly as possible within a time limit. Interference raw scores were converted into t-scores for analysis. T-score benefit was the analytic metric used. T-score benefit = post-intervention score minus baseline score</description>

        <description>CSRQ assesses self-reported cognitive difficulties in 8 domains: Attention, Executive function, Memory, Language, Vision, Hearing, Energy,and Satisfaction. Participants respond on a 3-point Likert scale whether they perceived they improved, remained the same, or got worse as a result of an intervention. Total score is computed by summing scores on each subscale. Range for total score = -64 to +64, with higher scores indicating fewer reported cognitive difficulties.</description>
