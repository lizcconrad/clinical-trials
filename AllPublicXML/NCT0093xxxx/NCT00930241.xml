      This study is a prospective randomized trial to compare twice daily to once daily
      administration of the basic immunosuppressive regimen in lung transplanted patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence data of non-compliance in solid organ transplantations fluctuate is reported in up
      to 39% of transplant recipients (z. B. for lung transplantations 13 - 22%; Kugler et al.).
      Non-compliance with immunosuppressive therapy is associated with an increased risk of
      late-acute rejections and the development of chronic transplant dysfunction. Chronic
      transplant dysfunction (bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome-BOS) is the second most causing
      for organ failure after the first year following lung transplantation and often leads to
      re-transplantation or death. Preventative procedures for improving the compliance are
      simplification of the dose of the immunosuppressants (a once daily dose instead of a twice
      daily dose), the prescription of an immunosuppressants with less side-effects and to raise
      the patient´s awareness for having the greatest responsibility for the efficacy of his
      therapy. Prospective studies and metaanalysis revealed that the probability for a good
      compliance can be more than doubled at once daily administration in comparison to twice daily
      and the best predictor for a good compliance is an easy therapy. For this reason we want to
      investigate the extent of profit for our lung transplant patients receiving once daily basis
      immunosuppression in comparison to those who receive twice daily dose.

      Hypothesis: Patients of the once daily administration group of the immunosuppressive
      medication will have a better compliance compared to the twice daily group (as measured by
      the endpoints variability and medication abstraction from the electronic devices)
