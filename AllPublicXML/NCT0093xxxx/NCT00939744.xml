  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies show that EET and 20-HETE have important biological effects, particularly in
      the vascular system. The investigators studied the effect of eicosanoids on the gravid rat
      uterus. The results suggest that 20-HETE had an tocolytics effect on gravid uterus. In the
      previous study, we demonstrated that the enzymes of the pathway of EET were present in human
      uterine tissues. Moreover, the addition of an inhibitor of degradation of EET had an
      tocolytic effect on the human myometrium, as the exogenous addition of 8.9, 14,15-EET and
      20-HETE.

      Objectives:

      Primary objective: To compare the balance of different metabolic pathways of arachidonic acid
      (AA) of the pregnant human myometrium in pathological situations (preterm labor, uterine
      atony, prolonged pregnancy).

      Specific objectives: i) To study the effect of derived from the AA on in vitro contractile
      activity of normal and pathological uterine tissues, and ii) detect and quantify the
      different sub-products of metabolism of AA in the uterine tissues (myometrium, fetal
      membranes and placenta).

      The management of uterine contraction is in the heart of modern obstetrics year, yet the
      progress made in other specialties, based on the study of smooth muscle have not yet been
      transposed in obstetrics. A better understanding of systems for regulating the contraction is
      important in terms of 1) new physiological knowledge, but it could also be the source of 2)
      modification of strategies to take care of premature delivery (new Tocolytic), or 3)
      improving the efficiency of uterine muscle during delivery or 4) for treatment of patients
      with prolonged pregnancy.

      It is a clinical study with a slope fundamental aims to examine the metabolic pathways of AA
      of human myometrium and their functional roles according to their clinical profile divided
      into three contractile pathological situations - threat of premature delivery, dynamic
      dystocia, prolonged pregnancy - and two groups of patients at term: a group before work and
      group work.

      The sampling method. After birth, a biopsy will be perform from the lower segment of the
      uterus. After caesarean sections of membrane and placenta are collected.

      The substances studied during isometric tension tests are part of the three degradation
      pathways of the AA.

        1. new eicosanoids in cumulative dose (8,9-EET, 11,12-EET, 14,15-EET, 20-HETE), and in
           combination

        2. enzyme inhibitors of the eicosanoids pathway (AUDA, MS-PPOH, DDMS), and the COX and LOX
           pathways (indomethacin), alone or in combination.
