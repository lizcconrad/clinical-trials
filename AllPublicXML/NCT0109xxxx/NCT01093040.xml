      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects aged 20 through 55 years at the time of screening

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent is obtained prior to any study related
             procedure taking place

          -  No significant abnormality on clinical examination or medical history (excluding
             atopic skin signs, symptoms and history)

          -  A normal 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (no clinically significant abnormalities)

          -  Clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis results within the laboratory reference
             ranges or deemed not clinically significant by the Investigator

          -  A negative screen for drugs of abuse and alcohol

          -  The following reproductive criteria apply:

          -  Females(of child bearing potential) must have a negative pregnancy test prior to the
             dose of investigational product and, unless surgically sterile (ie, bilateral tubal
             ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy), has a sterile male
             partner, or at least 2 years postmenopausal, or practices abstinence; must use 2
             effective methods of avoiding pregnancy (including oral, transdermal, or implanted
             hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device, female condom with spermicide, diaphragm
             with spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, or use of a condom with spermicide by
             the sexual partner) for 21 days prior to randomization, and must agree to continue
             using such precautions until 3 months after dosing with the investigational product;
             cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible
             physician. A negative pregnancy test is required both at screening and prior to
             dosing.

          -  Males, unless surgically sterile, must use two effective methods of birth control with
             a female partner and must agree to continue using such contraceptive precautions from
             21 days prior to randomization until 3 months after dosing with the investigational
             product.

          -  Japanese subjects. To be considered as 'Japanese', both of the subject's parents, and
             both sets of grandparents, must be Japanese. The subject must have been born in Japan,
             have a valid Japanese passport, and must not have lived outside Japan for more than 5
             years.

             evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of subject safety or study
             results

          -  Previously received monoclonal antibody, or a similar related protein, that might
             sensitize subjects to CAT-354 or to any component of the investigational product
             formulation

          -  History of an active infection within 4 weeks prior to screening, or evidence of
             clinically significant active infection, including ongoing chronic infection

          -  Any acute illness in the 14 days before Day 1 (Visit 2)

          -  Use of any medication (prescription or OTC) excluding hormonal contraception within 14
             days (or 5-half lives, whichever is longer) of Day 1 dosing

          -  Involvement in another study of investigational medicinal product; within 2 months of
             the start of this study (Day 1) for small molecules, within 3 months of the start of
             this study for antibodies, or 5 half lives of the previously administered
             investigational product, whichever is the longer

          -  Any blood donation or significant loss of blood within 56 days of study initiation or
             plasma donation within 7 days of study initiation

          -  Subjects with immunodeficiency disorders

          -  Subjects who have a positive test for, or have been treated for hepatitis B, hepatitis
             C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

          -  Any active concomitant disease including psychological disorders

          -  Subject is a participating Investigator, sub-Investigator, study coordinator, or
             employee of a participating Investigator, or is a first-degree relative of the
             aforementioned.

          -  Any factor which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would be associated with poor
