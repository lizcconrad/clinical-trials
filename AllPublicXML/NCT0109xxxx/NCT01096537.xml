  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Occupational exposures are thought to be responsible for 10-15% of new-onset
      asthma cases in adults, with disparities across sectors. Because most of the data are derived
      from registries and cross-sectional studies, little is known about incidence of occupational
      asthma (OA) during the first years after inception of exposure. This study focuses on this
      early asthma onset period among young workers in the bakery, pastry making and hairdressing
      sectors in order to assess early incidence of OA in these &quot;at risk&quot; occupations according to
      exposure duration, and to identify risk factors of OA.

      Methods: This study is a longitudinal retrospective study with a nested case-control to
      identify risk factors of OA. The assessment of incidence evolution is made by exploring a
      series of promotions (or retrospective cohorts) with increasing duration since at work. The
      study population is composed of subjects who graduated between 2001 and 2006 in sectors where
      they experience exposure to organic or inorganic allergenic or irritant compounds (with an
      objective of 150 subjects by year) and 250 young workers with no specific occupational
      exposure.

      This study is a descriptive, monocentric, longitudinal and retrospective study with
      cross-sectional measurements.
