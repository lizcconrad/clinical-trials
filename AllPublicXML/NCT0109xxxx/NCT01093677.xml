  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the effect of LIM-0705 on glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism and renal function in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>approx. 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of glucose metabolism will be based on monitoring of overnight-fasting glucose levels and on performance of an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)
Assessment of lipid metabolism will be based on 12 hour-fasting lipid profiles (including LDL, HDL, total cholesterol, free fatty acids, and triglycerides)
Assessment of renal function will be performed by monitoring serum BUN and creatinine levels</description>

    <measure>Incidence of treatment emergent adverse events and pharmacokinetics of LIM-0705 and its major metabolite</measure>
    <time_frame>approx. 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events; as well as changes in physical examination findings, vital signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, hematology urinalysis, and coagulation)
