      The aim of this study was to assess the relevance of NRI or athletes' NRI (ANRI) utilization
      to detect nutrition-related risks of failure in competition in the particular population of
      rowers.

      In the morning, 60 to 90 minutes before the first race of a national level multi-races
      competition (three races for each subjects), body weight were measured and blood samples were
      collected with subjects at rest and in post-absorptive condition (last meal at least 2.5
      hours before blood collection). Body weight was also recorded in the same conditions six
      weeks before the competition to calculate weight state (actual weight /usual weight ´ 100)
      and subjects were asked to identify the date of diet beginning. Body weight was measured
      using a floor scale (Mettler-Toledo floor scale, France), body mass index (BMI) was
      calculated from the ratio of weight (in kg) by height squared (in meters) and training volume
      (total duration of training in a week) was determined after discussion with athletes and
      coaches.
