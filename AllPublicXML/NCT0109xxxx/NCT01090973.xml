      The purpose of the study is to find out the effects and the safety of an investigational
      study drug called LBH589 when given to people with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL) or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).

      Response Assessment for Mantle Cell Lymphoma

      Based on the International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria to non-hodgkin's
      lymphoma (NHL) (Cheson, JCO 1999) a complete hematologic remission will be defined as the
      following:

        -  Disappearance of all evidence of disease.

        -  Any positron emission tomography (PET)+ mass prior to therapy must be PET negative after
           treatment.

        -  No palpable spleen or liver

        -  If bone marrow involvement prior to therapy, must document clear bone marrow.

      Partial response will be defined as:

        -  No new areas of disease on clinical exam and regression of previous areas of disease

        -  Greater than or equal to 50% decrease in the size of prior disease areas per measurement
           on computed tomography (CT) scan

        -  No new PET+ areas on PET scan

        -  No increase in size of liver or spleen

      Response Assessment for CLL

      Using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria, a complete hematologic remission will be
      defined as having the following present for 2 or more months:

        -  Absence of symptoms attributable to CLL

        -  Normal findings on physical examination

        -  Absolute lymphocyte count &lt;4000/microL

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1500/microL

        -  Platelet count &gt;100,000/microL

        -  Hemoglobin concentration &gt;11 g/dL (untransfused)

        -  Bone marrow lymphocytosis &lt;30 percent

        -  No nodules (lymphoid aggregates) on bone marrow biopsy

      A partial response per the NCI criteria will be defined as having the following for 2 or more
      months:

        -  A reduction in previously enlarged nodes, spleen, and liver by at · least 50 percent and

        -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1500/microL or

        -  Platelet count ≥100,000/microL or

        -  Hemoglobin concentration ≥11 g/dL or

        -  50 percent improvement over pretherapy reductions in hemoglobin concentration and/or
           platelet count

The daily dose of LBH589 should be taken at approximately the same time each day. Patients should avoid eating grapefruit, Seville (sour) orange or drinking grapefruit juice or Seville orange juice during the study.
After 2 cycles of treatment, if patients do not demonstrate a partial response or complete response (all of the tumor is gone) to the therapy they will be removed from the study. If patients do obtain a partial (the tumor(s) have decreased in size or number but there are still tumors present) or complete response then treatment will continue until their disease progresses.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The study was abandoned after only one patient due to low accrual and the sponsor losing interest in the single-agent.
The one patient had disease progression requiring more aggressive treatment and did not complete the study.</limitations_and_caveats>
