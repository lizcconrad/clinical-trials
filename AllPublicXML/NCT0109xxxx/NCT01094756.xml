  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central dopamine is thought to play a significant role in obesity. In support of this idea,
      animal studies and one human positron emission tomography (PET) study have found reduced
      postsynaptic D2-like receptor availability in the striatum in obesity, with lower D2 receptor
      availability associated with higher weight. In addition, reward sensitivity and hedonic
      responses, known to be related to dopamine function, have also been implicated in obesity and
      obesity-related eating behavior. These reports have led to the concept that dopaminergic
      abnormalities (e.g. reduced D2-like receptors) influence reward sensitivity, leading to
      altered eating behaviors and eventually obesity. However, there are several critical
      limitations of the human D2 receptor studies that limit the strength of their conclusions and
      thus the interpretations and speculations embedded in literature that relies on this work.
      First, estimates of D2-like receptors in humans have been confounded by potential differences
      in endogenous dopamine release since the PET ligand (raclopride) used is known to be
      displaceable from receptors by endogenous dopamine. Second, failure to rigorously screen
      obese individuals for diabetes confounds conclusions, since diabetes has been independently
      associated with dopaminergic abnormalities such as reduced D2-like receptors and muted
      dopamine release in diabetic rats. Finally, no human studies have addressed whether reduced
      D2-like receptor levels are a risk factor for obesity, a consequence of engaging in
      obesity-related behaviors or being obese or all of the above.

    <description>After the screening and scan days are completed, obese subjects will begin a lifestyle intervention program that includes dietary (low-calorie diet) and behavioral education topics. Treatment will be provided in individual weekly sessions. Each hour-long session will be led by a behavioral counselor or registered dietitian in the Weight Management Center at Washington University. The behavioral program will use cognitive-behavioral techniques to foster adherence to diet prescriptions and to build a supportive environment for the participant. The program will emphasize strategies of self-monitoring and goal-setting, and will include problem-solving, overcoming high-risk situations for unhealthy eating, relapse prevention, and strategies for long-term weight maintenance. Handouts will be provided for study subjects to allow them to record the setting and reaching of dietary goals, as well as summarize the key points of the educational content.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  41 obese adults (BMI 33 kg - 45 kg.)

          -  24 lean adults (BMI 18.5 kg - 24.9 kg.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

                  exclusions are lifetime psychosis, current mania, substance dependence, major
                  depression, social phobia, tic disorders, eating disorders and panic disorder.
                  Dysthymia will not be excluded, but levels of depression will be measured with
