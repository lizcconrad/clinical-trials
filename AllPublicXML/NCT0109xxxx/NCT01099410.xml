  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the ability of two types of white blood cells to eat
      dead host cells, and how this process affects their ability to protect the body from
      infection. The two cell types are monocytes, a cell in the bloodstream, and alveolar
      macrophages, a cell in the lung that is ultimately derived from monocytes

      Volunteers, who may be Veterans or non-Veterans, will be screened by a series of
      questionnaires, chest X-ray, spirometry, EKG, blood work, and a complete history and
      physician examination by a study physician. Those who qualify for the study and agree via
      informed consent, will undergo a fiberoptic bronchoscopy on a separate day for the initial
      visit. Bronchoscopy is a procedure in which a flexible video instrument is passed via the
      nose or mouth, through the vocal cords and into the lungs. During the procedure, portions of
      the lungs will be washed (&quot;lavaged&quot;) with a salt water solution, to collect the alveolar
      macrophages. This procedure involves conscious sedation, so that a driver is required on the
      day of the bronchoscopy. The entire procedure, including placement of an intravenous line to
      administer medications, local anesthetics, the bronchoscopy itself, and the recovery period,
      takes about 2.5-3 hours. The cells collected by bronchoscopy will be studied in the research
      laboratory, and used entirely in that procedure.
