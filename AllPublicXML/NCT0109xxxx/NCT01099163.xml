  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) comprise a family of linoleic acid (18:2n-6; LA) isomers
      that are formed by biohydrogenation and oxidation processes in nature. The main form of CLA,
      cis-9, trans-11-18:2, can be produced directly by bacterial hydrogenation in the rumen or by
      delta-9 desaturation of the co-product vaccenic acid (trans-11-18:1) in most mammalian
      tissues including man. The second most abundant isomer of CLA is the trans-10, cis-12-18:2
      form. Observations clearly emphasize that differences exist between mammalian species in
      their response to CLAs with mice being the most sensitive. The majority of studies on body
      compositional effects (i.e. fat loss, lean gain), on cancer and cardiovascular disease
      attenuation, on insulin sensitivity and diabetes and on immune function have been conducted
      with a variety of animal models. Recent studies indicate that some but not all of the effects
      observed in animals also pertain to human volunteers. Reports of detrimental effects of CLA
      intake appear to be largely in mice and due mainly to the trans-10, cis-12 isomer.
      Suggestions of possible deleterious effects in man due to an increase in oxidative lipid
      products (isoprostanes) with trans-10, cis-12 CLA ingestion require substantiation.
      Unresponsiveness to antioxidants of these non-enzymatic oxidation products casts some doubt
      on their physiological relevance. We hypothesized that supplementation with CLA + an
      antioxidant (vitamin E) in patients with diabetes mellitus may have beneficial effects on
      glycemic control and insulin sensitivity.
