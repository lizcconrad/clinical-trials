  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Currently, there is no curative therapy for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate
           cancer (CRPC), a leading cause of death in men. However, researchers are exploring new
           treatments that involve drugs that prevent angiogenesis (the process by which new blood
           vessels are formed) and can slow or prevent tumor growth.

        -  TRC105 is an experimental drug that blocks angiogenesis, and has been studied for
           possible use in treating different kinds of cancer. However, it has not been validated
           to treat prostate cancer in general or CRPC in particular.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the effects of TRC105 as a treatment for CRPC

        -  To determine the safety and effectiveness of TRC105 in treating CRPC

      Eligibility:

      - Men at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with castrate-resistant prostate
      cancer for which existing treatments have not been effective.

      Design:

        -  Eligible individuals will have a series of blood and other tests to determine their
           suitability for participating in the study.

        -  Participants will receive intravenous infusions of TRC105 in a 28-day treatment cycle.
           Participants will receive i.v. (intravenous) infusions of TRC105 every two weeks on days
           1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle (cohorts 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6) and every week on days 1, 8,
           15, and 22 of each 28 day cycle (cohort 4).

        -  Participants will receive different doses of TRC105 depending on when they enter the
           study, up to a maximum tolerated dose or optimum treatment dose.

        -  Frequent blood and urine tests will be performed during treatment, as well as other
           tests of cancer progression as directed by the study doctors. Participants will receive
           medicines to help prevent possible adverse side effects of TRC105, such as allergic
           reaction to the drug.

        -  Participants will continue treatment with TRC105 until they or the study team decides
           that the medication is not beneficial. No additional testing will be required unless
           participants discontinue the treatment because of side effects (which the study doctors
           will follow until the side effects are resolved).

    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Inhibition of angiogenesis has demonstrable antitumor efficacy against castrate-resistant
      prostate cancer (CRPC). TRC105 is a human/murine chimeric immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma
      1 (IgG1) kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to human CD105 (endoglin), thus inhibiting
      angiogenesis and tumor growth. Data from an ongoing phase I clinical trial suggest that
      TRC105 is well tolerated with evidence of clinical efficacy in patients with metastatic CRPC.

      Primary Objectives:

      - Define the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of TRC105 given every one to two weeks.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Define the dose-limiting toxicities and toxicity profile of TRC105 given every one to
           two weeks

        -  Evaluate time to disease progression, overall response rate and overall survival.

        -  Describe the prostate specific antigen (PSA) response rate to therapy with TRC105

        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetics of TRC105

        -  Demonstrate a biologic effect of TRC105 in the patient and, when possible, on the tumor
           via laboratory evaluation of the molecular markers of angiogenesis before and after drug
           administration respectively

      Eligibility:

        -  Progressive, castrate-resistant, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate

        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) less than or equal to 2

      Design:

      - An initial single-arm, phase I dose escalation study open to all patients with progressive
      metastatic CRPC. The study will evaluate patients in five cohorts of escalating dose levels.
      A maximum of 30 patients will be needed to complete the phase I evaluation.

    <description>Clinical response was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). Stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

               1. Patients must have histopathological confirmation of prostate cancer by the
                  Laboratory of Pathology of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Pathology
                  Department of the National Naval Medical Center or Pathology Department of Walter
                  Reed Army Medical Center prior to entering this study. Patients whose pathology
                  specimens are no longer available may be enrolled in the trial if the patient has
                  a clinical course consistent with prostate cancer and available documentation
                  from an outside pathology laboratory of the diagnosis. In cases where original
                  tissue blocks or archival biopsy material is available, efforts will be made to
                  contact referring physicians and outside pathology departments to have the

        <title>Clinical Response</title>
        <description>Clinical response was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). Stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>
