    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common disabling illness that disproportionately affects
      women, with prevalence rates two times those of men. In addition to suffering, MDD has been
      shown to have a marked effect on social and vocational functioning, with increased
      disability, lost productivity, and excess mortality. Women with MDD have an increased
      prevalence of comorbid anxiety disorders and medical conditions.

      Our model of care utilizes a social worker as a depression care manager (DCM) to support both
      patients and physicians in optimizing care in the OB-GYN clinical setting. This intervention
      will be compared to usual care for depression.

    <textblock>
      A large number of women receive their routine care in OB-GYN clinics, including a
      disproportionate percentage of low-income and minority women. For many of these women,
      OG-GYNs are the only provider they see on a regular basis. OB-GYNs take care of women across
      their lifespan, addressing gynecologic, health care maintenance, pregnancy and primary care
      concerns in their everyday practices. There are multiple aspects of OG-GYN care that are
      uniquely suited for detection and treatment of depression, but there are also significant
      barriers to such care that must be addressed.

      In this randomized controlled trial, we are testing this depression care management program
      for women attending two OB-GYN clinics in the University of Washington health care system.
      Our research aims to test the hypothesis that a depression care management intervention,
      integrated into the OB-GYN clinic setting, will improve treatment outcomes for depression,
      functional outcomes, and satisfaction with depression care. The results of our research will
      greatly impact clinical care by satisfying an unmet need for effective depression services
      for women seen in OB-GYN clinical settings.

      The study compares a depression care management intervention, delivered by a depression care
      manager, to usual care for depression in the clinics. The primary aims of the study are to
      evaluate, compared to usual care, a depression intervention consisting of enhanced education,
      engagement, and depression care management (with a choice of antidepressant medication
      monitoring and/or provision of brief psychotherapy).

    <description>The intervention is conducted by a social worker who has the role of a Depression Care Manager (DCM). First, a unique engagement session develops rapport with the DCM, providing education and identifying health concerns. DCM meets in-person and/or by phone every 1-2 weeks for 12 weeks, then monthly for the rest of the 12-month intervention. Patients choose either medication or Problem-Solving Treatment-Primary Care therapy. Depressive symptoms are assessed at each visit with the PHQ-9, as well as response to medications or to PST, with a total of 8 PST-PC sessions. Patients with inadequate response after 8 weeks to the first choice will switch or combine treatments. Providers are given extensive feedback about the patient's health care concerns.</description>

Depression Care Management: The intervention is conducted by a social worker who has the role of a Depression Care Manager (DCM). First, a unique engagement session develops rapport with the DCM, providing education and identifying health concerns. DCM meets in-person and/or by phone every 1-2 weeks for 12 weeks, then monthly for the rest of the 12-month intervention. Patients choose either medication or Problem-Solving Treatment-Primary Care therapy. Depressive symptoms are assessed at each visit with the PHQ-9, as well as response to medications or to PST,</description>
