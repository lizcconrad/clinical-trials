      The purpose of this study is to assess the drug concentration of Micafungin amongst healthy
      volunteers having different weight groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center study. A total of 36 adult volunteers will be consented for the
      study. Volunteers will be admitted for an overnight stay. Half will be female and half male.
      Twelve volunteers will have a body mass index (BMI) less than 25 kg/m2, 12 will have a BMI
      25-40 kg/m2, and 12 will have a BMI greater than 40 kg/m2. Volunteers will have height and
      weight measured after they have consented to participate. Exactly half the volunteers in each
      category will received a single dose of intravenous micafungin of 100 mg, while the other
      half will receive 300 mg as determined by a coin flip. The volunteers will have blood drawn
      via an intravenous catheter just prior to the dose, and then at 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24h
      after the drug dose. The intravenous catheter is then removed after the 24h blood draw, and
      the volunteer discharged from the study. Compensation will be provided to the participants
      for their time.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects

          -  18 years or older

          -  All racial and ethnic origins

          -  English or Spanish speaking

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or nursing or unwilling to use a reliable contraception method during the
             study. The effects of micafungin on pregnancy are unknown. In addition, the metabolic
             changes that accompany pregnancy may alter the concentration-time profile of
             micafungin, so that the pregnancy and post-partum state would be a confounding
             variable.

               -  Abnormal liver function tests: transaminases&gt;10 times upper limit of normal,
                  Alkaline phosphatase&gt;5 times upper limit of normal, total bilirubin&gt;5 times upper
                  limit of normal.

          -  Creatinine Clearance &lt; 70 ml/min as estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation

          -  History of allergies to echinocandins

          -  Echinocandins are contraindicated for any reason

          -  Volunteers unwilling to comply with study procedures.

          -  Suspected or documented systemic fungal infection.
