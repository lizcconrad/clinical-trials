  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a follow-on, multi-centre, open-label, clinical trial. The purpose of this trial is
      to investigate the concentrations of serotype-specific antibodies to IgG included in PCV13 in
      children who have received either the PCV7 or PCV13 primary immunisation at 2, 4 and 12
      months of age. We intend to recruit all interested participants who completed the
      Wyeth-sponsored PCV13 infant trial study (6096A1-007) at selected study sites (i.e. those
      that recruited the majority of the children in the original study). The study will start in
      March 2010, at which time the eldest participants in the 6096A1-007 study will be
      approximately 42 months of age. There will be two visits per participant, 1 month apart from
      each other. At visit one, all participants will have a blood test and receive a dose of
      PCV13. At visit 2, all participants will have a blood test and will be offered the remaining
      pre-school booster vaccinations unless they have already received them.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant completed the Wyeth-sponsored PCV13 infant trial study (6096A1-007) at one
             of the study sites participating in this follow-on study.

          2. Aged 39-46 months (inclusive) at time of enrolment.

             telephone.

          4. Healthy children as determined by medical history, physical examination, done by a
             study nurse (and/or study doctor if required, depending on the medical history of the
             participant and physical assessment), and judgment of the investigator.

          5. Parent/legal guardian must be able to complete all relevant study procedures during
             study participation.

          6. History of culture-proven invasive disease caused by S pneumoniae.

          7. Major known congenital malformation or serious chronic disorder.

             significant stable or evolving disorders such as cerebral palsy, encephalopathy,
             hydrocephalus, or other significant disorder.

          9. Receipt of blood products or gamma-globulin (including hepatitis B immunoglobulin and
             monoclonal antibodies; eg, synagisB).

         10. Participation in another investigational study other than the Wyeth-sponsored PCV13
