      The purpose of this investigation is to conduct a 12-week pilot study to examine the effect
      of three different dietary prescriptions that differ on targeting reducing energy density
      (kcal/gram) and energy (kcal) on overall dietary intake, hunger, feelings of deprivation,
      satisfaction with the diet, mood, and weight loss in 45 overweight/obese adults receiving a
      12-week behavioral weight loss intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the current prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults in the United States and
      the projected increase of these conditions in the future, development of effective weight
      loss and weight loss maintenance strategies is imperative. For weight loss to occur, energy
      intake needs to be reduced to incur an energy deficit, and for successful weight loss
      maintenance, energy intake needs to remain lower than energy intake at pre-weight loss levels
      due to an overall reduction in body size which reduces basal metabolic rate. One dietary
      strategy that may facilitate weight loss maintenance is consuming a diet low in dietary
      energy density (ED). This pilot study will test the effects of a dietary prescription focused
      on ED.

      All participants in the investigation will receive a standard 12-week behavioral obesity
      intervention. The intervention will include an activity goal that participants will gradually
      work to achieve over the course of the 12-week intervention along with standard behavioral
      weight loss strategies. One condition will receive a dietary prescription for weight loss
      that focuses solely on lowering the ED of the diet, another condition will receive the
      traditional dietary prescription used in behavioral weight loss interventions that reduces
      energy intake, and the third condition will receive both prescriptions. Pre and post
      intervention measurements will be taken to determine if there are differences between groups.

    <description>Dietary deprivation and satisfaction will be measures using 100mm visual analog scales with the statements &quot;I feel like I ate enough today&quot; and &quot;I feel like I ate what I wanted today&quot;. Both scales are anchored with &quot;strongly disagree&quot; on one end and &quot;strongly agree&quot; on the other end. These will be collected for 7 days at baseline (week 0) and post intervention (week 13).</description>

    <measure>Hunger</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0 and 13</time_frame>
    <description>Hunger will be measured using a 100mm visual analog scale. The scale asks &quot;How hungry did you feel today?&quot; and is anchored with &quot;not at all hungry&quot; on one end and &quot;extremely hungry&quot; on the other. Hunger scales will be collected for 7 days at baseline (week 0) and post intervention (week 13).</description>
