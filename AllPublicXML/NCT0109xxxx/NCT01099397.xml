      The purpose of this study is to determine if, in a subset of patients treated with a
      beta-blocker and diuretic, prediabetes is detectable to a greater extent through a 2-hour
      oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) compared to fasting glucose measurement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beta-blockers and diuretics have a well-established role in treating hypertension and are
      frequently used first-line. However, it is increasingly evident that these medications have
      harmful metabolic effects. The Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses (PEAR
      - NCT00246519) study was a greater than 700 participant, randomized, parallel assignment
      trial, aimed at determining the genetic factors that influence response to both a
      beta-blocker (atenolol) and a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide [HCTZ]). The PEAR trial design
      includes evaluation at baseline, after monotherapy with either medication, and after
      combination therapy with both medications. This pilot, PEAR sub-study aims to characterize
      the ability of two diagnostics tests (fasting glucose versus glucose 2-hours after an OGTT)
      to detect prediabetes development prior to blood pressure medication use, after monotherapy
      (with atenolol or HCTZ) and after combination therapy (with atenolol and HCTZ).

    <time_frame>Baseline, 9 weeks, and 18 weeks after initiation of PEAR intervention(s)</time_frame>
    <description>A single cohort of patients was followed through participation in the parent study, PEAR, and had both fasting and 2-hour OGTT labs evaluated at three time points. At each of these time points the two methods for evaluating prediabetes were compared. Consistent with the definition for prediabetes recommended by the American Diabetes Association, a fasting glucose above 99mg/dL or 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test glucose above 139mg/dL was considered prediabetic for this study.</description>
