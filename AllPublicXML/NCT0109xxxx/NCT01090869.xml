  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to evaluate the health benefits of physical training per se, weight
      loss per se and exercise-induced weight loss in young, overweight men. The investigators
      hypothesized that physical training would have independent effects on various health
      parameters (insulin sensitivity, fasting glucose and insulin, total and abdominal fat mass,
      waist circumference, blood pressure and key muscle proteins), and that a concomitant weight
      loss from physical activity would increase the effect.

      At baseline, during the intervention and in the week following the intervention participants
      underwent a panel of tests:

        -  Cardio respiratory fitness

        -  blood pressure

        -  anthropometric measures

      At baseline and after the intervention a hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp were performed to
      asses insulin sensitivity.

      Tissue and blood samples were also collected for further analysis:

        -  Total-protein analysis of selected proteins

        -  Fasting plasma glucose, insulin and free fatty acids

    <description>Participants were randomly assigned to a 12-week intervention in one of four groups: Training (T), energy-reduced Diet (D), Training and increased- Diet (T-iD) or Control (C). The interventions consisted of: T: increased physical activity through daily endurance training equivalent to 600 kcal/day, unchanged diet; D: sedentary lifestyle, reduced diet by 600 kcal/day primarily through reducing serving sizes and substituting energy dense with less energy dense nutrients; T-iD: increased physical activity through daily endurance training equivalent to 600 kcal/day, increased diet by 600 kcal/day primarily through increasing serving sizes and consuming energy dense nutrients; C: sedentary lifestyle and unchanged diet.</description>
