    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine the effect of enzalutamide on the androgen
      signaling pathway in correlation with the anti-tumor effects of enzalutamide to identify
      potential predictors of response or resistance to therapy.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Bone Marrow Testosterone</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 9</time_frame>
    <description>Bone marrow biopsies were performed at the Day 1 visit prior to initiation of enzalutamide administration. Repeat bone marrow biopsies were performed at the Week 9 visit. If a repeat bone marrow was not performed at the Week 9 visit or if a patient discontinued the study before the Week 9 visit, a bone marrow biopsy was obtained at the Safety Follow-up visit.
Assessment of intratumoral testosterone was assessed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.</description>
