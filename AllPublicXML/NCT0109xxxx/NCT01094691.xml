  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prospectively test whether the detection of three-dimensional, cast-like polyomavirus
      aggregates, termed Haufen, in voided urine samples can serve as an accurate biomarker of
      intra-renal disease, i.e. polyoma-BK-virus nephropathy (PVN). We want to correlate the
      detection of 'Haufen' with histologic findings made in renal biopsies as well as signs of
      polyomavirus activation, i.e. viremia and viruria. The prospective study is designed to
      further validate our retrospective findings (manuscript in press, J Am Soc Nephrology) and
      more specifically to correlate 'Haufen' shedding with the histologically confirmed course of
      PVN.

    <description>Urine left over from clinic visits is analyzed for 'Haufen' by negative staining electron microscopy as a marker of intra-renal polyomavirus nephropathy. Correlate Haufen, urine, and plasma data with the clinical presentation and with renal biopsy findings. Patients with PVN will be approached for study participation in which their routine samples will be monitored until urine is negative for 'Haufen', and a study protocol biopsy will be obtained for confirmation.</description>
