      To demonstrate that RBC saturation of the Omega-3 fatty acids reaching cardioprotective
      levels as proven with the HS-Omega-3 Index test will be achieved most efficiently depending
      on a specific product utilized within this study. The HS-Omega-3 Index is a new test that
      measures blood levels of the cardioprotective omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA. RBS
      saturation is being measured to identify how much Omega 3 is in the blood.
