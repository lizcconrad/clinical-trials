      The aim of our study is to evaluate the utility of Secretin-Stimulated Magnetic Resonance
      Cholangiopancreatography (S-MRCP) in detecting carcinoma and precancerous lesions in patients
      with a significant family history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Our hypothesis is that S-MRCP
      is superior to traditional computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in
      detecting early pancreatic neoplasms, and approaches the accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound
      (EUS).

    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer remains the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United
      States, largely due to the lack of accurate and cost-effective screening methods. Initial
      screening efforts should be directed at patients with known increased genetic risk for
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma. About 10-20% of pancreatic cancers are considered familial or
      syndromic. Since pancreatic adenocarcinoma is known to progress from preneoplastic lesions,
      termed pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), it may eventually be possible to
      identify and cure patients by detecting preneoplastic lesions. Traditional radiological
      methods lack the resolution to detect early lesions. The sensitivity and specificity of
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (92%,96%) and EUS (93-98%)are better,
      but these procedures are invasive and limited in availability. Magnetic resonance
      cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) has emerged as a widely-accepted alternative with comparable
      sensitivity to ERCP. Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) has been further
      augmented by secretin stimulation, which improves visualization of the pancreatic duct as
      well as side branches. We will recruit 25 patients for a prospective pilot study examining
      S-MRCP as a screening technique in high-risk individuals. All recruited patients will undergo
      S-MRCP in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography
      (MRA), as well as secretin-enhanced EUS (S-EUS). Those patients with abnormalities on S-MRCP
      or S-EUS will undergo ERCP. If ERCP also shows abnormalities, these patients will be
      recommended total or subtotal pancreatectomy. The primary outcome that we will be studying
      will be concordance of S-MRCP and EUS. Secondarily, we will be measuring positive predictive
      value of S-MRCP, in comparison with EUS and ERCP in identifying neoplasm in those patients
      who undergo surgical resection during this study.

    <description>The primary outcome studied will be the concordance of S-MRCP and S-EUS. Screening will consist of two diagnostic imaging modalities. First, all patients will have S-MRCP in conjunction with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). All images will be analyzed by a radiologist. Within thirty days, all patients will also undergo EUS with and without secretin enhancement (S-EUS).If the S-EUS shows abnormalities, EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration will be performed. The S-MRCP and EUS image findings will be classified as benign or suspicious/malignant to determine the concordance between imaging techniques.
Due to poor enrollment, inadequate data was collected for data analysis and therefore data analysis was not conducted. There is no data to report.</description>

    <measure>The Positive Predictive Value of S-MRCP</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome endpoints of our study will be positive predictive value of S-MRCP, in comparison with EUS/S-EUS and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), utilizing surgical pathology as the gold standard. In addition, we will also be looking at the utility of Cancer Antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) and oral glucose tolerance tests.

        <title>S-MRCP and S-EUS Concordance</title>
        <description>The primary outcome studied will be the concordance of S-MRCP and S-EUS. Screening will consist of two diagnostic imaging modalities. First, all patients will have S-MRCP in conjunction with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). All images will be analyzed by a radiologist. Within thirty days, all patients will also undergo EUS with and without secretin enhancement (S-EUS).If the S-EUS shows abnormalities, EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration will be performed. The S-MRCP and EUS image findings will be classified as benign or suspicious/malignant to determine the concordance between imaging techniques.
Due to poor enrollment, inadequate data was collected for data analysis and therefore data analysis was not conducted. There is no data to report.</description>

Synthetic Human Secretin: Twenty five patients will each undergo an S-MRCP and an S-EUS evaluation, at a dose of 0.2 ucg/kg per exam. Synthetic Human Secretin, provided by the Repligen Corporation, will be administered by IV bolus injection over 30 seconds followed by a 30 second saline flush. The maximum dose of secretin will be 18.5 ucg.</description>

        <description>The secondary outcome endpoints of our study will be positive predictive value of S-MRCP, in comparison with EUS/S-EUS and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), utilizing surgical pathology as the gold standard. In addition, we will also be looking at the utility of Cancer Antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) and oral glucose tolerance tests.
