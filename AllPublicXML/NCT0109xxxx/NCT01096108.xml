  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard Quit and Win contests, in which smokers typically quit for one month in return for
      the opportunity to win prizes, are simple and easy to implement and may be cost-effective in
      encouraging smokers to quit. By extending contest length and enhancing counseling content,
      Quit and Win contests may be more effective at encouraging smoking abstinence.

      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of extended and content-enhanced Quit and Win
      contests to enhance smoking abstinence at college campuses.

      Participants will be randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups with varying counseling treatments
      and contest lengths. All participants receive a 2 week supply of nicotine replacement therapy
      (NRT) and weekly support emails. Follow-up assessment surveys occur at 1, 3, 4 and 6 months
      post enrollment.

      Participants who have completed the follow-up assessment surveys and self-reported that they
      are tobacco-free will be asked to provide a urine sample in order to verify abstinence.
