    <textblock>
      Impairment of the heart's pumping capacity (heart failure) remains a major clinical problem
      with a poor prognosis and the search for novel treatments remains an important area of
      research.

      Urocortins are proteins that appear to increase blood flow and heart pumping activity. There
      has been particular interest in the role of Urocortins 2 &amp; 3 (subtypes of Urocortins) in
      heart failure.

      In this study, we will examine the effects and mechanisms of Urocortins 2 &amp; 3 and the
      Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone Receptor Type 2 (CRH-R2) receptor (through which urocortins
      act) on forearm blood flow and release of natural blood clot dissolving factors in the
      forearm circulation of healthy volunteers.

      In this study, we will look at the role of the lining of the blood vessel (endothelium) in
      response to urocortin types 2 and 3. We hypothesise that urocortins 2 &amp; 3 act via the
      endothelium to cause dilatation of the blood vessels and release of tissue-plasminogen
      activating factor (blood clot dissolving factor). We also hypothesise that urocortins have a
      role in maintaining the normal baseline level of blood flow in forearm arteries. In addition
      to the above, we will also look at the effect of temporarily blocking the effect of
      urocortins, using a specially designed blocker drug (Astressin 2B).

      Utilising the well-established technique of 'forearm venous occlusion plethysmography', we
      will be able to focus on the local effects of urocortins on arterial blood flow in forearm
      vessels, without affecting this system in the body as a whole.

    <description>After a 20 minute infusion of intra arterial saline, healthy volunteers will receive ascending doses of intra arterial Urocortin 2 (3.4, 34 and 340 pmol/min to achieve estimated end-organ concentrations of 0.06, 0.6 and 6 µg/L, respectively), Urocortin 3 (3.4, 34 and 340 pmol/min to achieve estimated end-organ concentrations of 0.06, 0.6 and 6 µg/L, respectively) and Substance P (a control endothelium-dependent vasodilator that evokes endogenous t-PA release [2, 4 and 8 pmol/min]). This will be co-infused with either Astressin 2B (in one of the two doses determined from Protocol 1) or saline placebo.
Bilateral venous blood sampling will be performed at baseline, immediately before the start and after each dose of Urocortin 2 and 3, to later estimate net release of tPA and PAI-1 and for plasma measurements of Urocortins 2 and 3.</description>

Bilateral venous blood samples will be taken at baseline, immediately before the start of Ucn2/Ucn3 infusion and at the end of each dose of Ucn2/Ucn3 for subsequent calculation of net release of t-PA and PAI-1.</description>
