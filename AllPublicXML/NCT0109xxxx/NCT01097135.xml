  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical skin complications can be costly and could contribute to extended in-patient stay
      following total joint replacement or even the need for re-admission. If efficacy in reducing
      the incidence of post-operative wound drainage and, in turn, surgical wound complications can
      be demonstrated, it may also reduce the length of hospital stay and the need for revision
      surgery or readmission. The aim of this research is to investigate the incidence of
      post-operative wound drainage following elective total joint arthroplasty using two surgical
      skin preparation protocols.
