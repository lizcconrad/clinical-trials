    <textblock>
      Impairment of the heart's pumping capacity (heart failure) remains a major clinical problem
      with a poor prognosis and the search for novel treatments remains an important area of
      research.

      Urocortins are proteins that appear to increase blood flow and heart pumping activity. There
      has been particular interest in the role of Urocortins 2 &amp; 3 (subtypes of Urocortins) in
      heart failure.

      In this study, we will examine the effects and mechanisms of Urocortins 2 &amp; 3 on forearm
      blood flow and release of natural blood clot dissolving factors in the forearm circulation of
      healthy volunteers. In particular, we look at the endothelial mechanisms of vasodilatation of
      Urocortin 2 and 3.

      In this study, we will look at the role of the lining of the blood vessel (endothelium) in
      response to urocortin types 2 and 3. We hypothesise that urocortins 2 &amp; 3 act via the
      endothelium to cause dilatation of the blood vessels and release of tissue-plasminogen
      activating factor (blood clot dissolving factor). We also hypothesise that urocortins have a
      role in maintaining the normal baseline level of blood flow in forearm arteries. In addition
      to the above, we will also look at the effect of temporarily blocking the effect of
      urocortins, using a specially designed blocker drug (Astressin 2B).

      Utilising the well-established technique of 'forearm venous occlusion plethysmography', we
      will be able to focus on the local effects of urocortins on arterial blood flow in forearm
      vessels, without affecting this system in the body as a whole.

    <description>After a 20 minute saline washout period, ascending doses of Urocortin 2, Urocortin 3 and substance P (doses as per Protocol 2) will be infused intra-arterially in the presence or the absence of the 'nitric oxide clamp' that will be commenced prior to the infusion of Urocortin 2, Urocortin 3 and substance P, and will be continued throughout the study.
Baseline blood samples will be taken from both forearms at the start of the study for full blood count, cholesterol, glucose, renal function and t-PA and PAI-1 activity and antigen concentrations. Bilateral venous blood samples will be taken at baseline, immediately before the start of Ucn2/Ucn3 infusion and at the end of each dose of Ucn2/Ucn3 for subsequent calculation of net release of t-PA and PAI-1.</description>
