  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis E is a worldwide disease. It is the leading or second leading cause of acute
      hepatitis in adults in developing countries from sub-Saharan Africa or Southeast Asia, where
      it is hyperendemic and principally water-borne. In industrialised western countries,
      hepatitis E was until recently considered as imported from hyperendemic geographical areas,
      but is currently an emerging autochthonous infectious disease. A growing body of data from
      Europe, America, Australia, and Asia strongly indicate that pigs represent a major Hepatitis
      E Virus (HEV) reservoir and might be a source of zoonotic transmission to humans through
      direct or indirect exposure. Hepatitis E typically causes self-limited acute infection.
      However, the overall death rate is 1-4%, and it can reach 20% in pregnant women and might be
      still higher in patients with underlying chronic liver disease. To date, no preventive or
      curative treatment of hepatitis E is available.

      Therefore, the major goal of the study is to analyse for the first time the host responses in
      kidney-transplant recipients with chronic HEV infection and to compare them to the host
      responses in kidney-transplant recipients without viral infection (controls), to identify a
      specific peripheral signature using blood microarray-based gene expression profiling.

      Other minor goals are :

        1. to assess the incidence of HEV infection in kidney-transplant recipients from
           south-eastern France, to study the risk factors, and to describe the clinical features
           and outcomes of chronic HEV infection in kidney-transplant recipients,

        2. to compare the peripheral signature to a liver signature in the cases where a liver
           biopsy is available. If peripheral and liver signatures are parallel, peripheral
           signature may become a non-invasive tool of exploration of chronic HEV infection in
           kidney-transplant recipients.
