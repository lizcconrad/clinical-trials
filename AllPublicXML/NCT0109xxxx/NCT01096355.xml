  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects, best way to give, and best dose of
      gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable
      solid malignancies. Enzyme inhibitors, such as gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097, may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety profile of 6 different administration schedules of gamma-secretase
      inhibitor RO4929097 in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097
      administered using 6 different administration schedules.

      II. To assess the preliminary antitumor activity of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 in
      these patients.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 on Notch
      signaling pathway in tumor and surrogate tissues, as well as soluble markers of angiogenesis
      in plasma, when administered using 6 different dosing schedules. (Exploratory) II. To
      evaluate the relationship between PK and PD effects in an attempt to define the optimal
      biological dosing schedule (OBDS) that can provide a sustained inhibition of Notch signaling
      pathway over time with a tolerable toxicity profile. (Exploratory) III. To correlate
      inhibition of Notch signaling pathway measured in tumor and surrogate tissues with
      preliminary antitumor activity and assess the potential clinical predictive value of OBDS as
      defined above. (Exploratory) IV. To assess the effect of the various pharmacogenomic
      polymorphisms of the cytochrome P450 pathway on PK and PD parameters. (Exploratory)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 6 dose
      schedules.

      GROUP A: Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3 and
      8-10.

      GROUP B: Patients receive oral RO4929097 once daily on days 1-7.

      GROUP C: Patients receive oral RO4929097 once daily on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17,
      19, and 21.

      GROUP D: Patients receive oral RO4929097 once daily on days 1, 8, and 15.

      GROUP E: Patients receive oral RO4929097 once daily on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, and 18.

      GROUP F: Patients receive oral RO4929097 once daily days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19.

      Treatment in all groups repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo tumor biopsies at baseline and between days 15 and 22
      in the first course of treatment. Plasma samples are collected periodically for
      pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacogenomic analysis and to assess levels of
      adipsin and markers of angiogenesis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
