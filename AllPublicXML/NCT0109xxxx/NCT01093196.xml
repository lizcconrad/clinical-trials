  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, 3 arm parallel group study designed to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of three all-oral combinations: lenalidomide with
      dexamethasone (Rd) in comparison with lenalidomide in association with MP (MPR) and
      lenalidomide in association with cyclophosphamide - prednisone (CPR) in newly diagnosed
      symptomatic MM patients. This protocol also provides a substudy designed to observe
      asymptomatic patients excluded to the protocol that in any case could be inserted in the
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an intergroup multicenter, randomized, open label study designed to compare the
      efficacy and safety of Rd with MPR and CPR in newly diagnosed symptomatic MM patients who are
      65 years of age or older. Potential study subjects will sign an informed consent prior to
      undergoing any study related procedure.

      This study consists of 3 phases for each study subject: Pre-treatment, Treatment and Follow
      up.Pre-treatment period: patients will undergo screening for protocol eligibility within 28
      days (4weeks) prior to randomization.

      Subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria will be randomized based on a computer-generated
      randomization schedule prepared by the Coordinating Centre. The first randomization will
      occur for the induction treatment: Arm A (Rd) or B (MPR) or C (CPR). Within each arm patients
      will be then randomized for the maintenance treatment(lenalidomide or lenalidomide and
      prednisone): Arms A1 (R) and A2 (RP); Arms B1 (R) and B2 (RP); Arms C1 (R) and C2 (RP).
      Randomization will be concealed until the end of the induction period for the maintenance
      treatment. Patients will be stratified at randomization according to the International
      Staging System (5) and age (&lt; 75 years vs &gt; 75 years).Treatment period includes induction and
      maintenance. During the induction and maintenance phases, all patients will attend periodic
      study center visits in order to asses the safety and efficacy of the treatment. This protocol
      also provides a substudy designed to observe asymptomatic patients excluded to the protocol
      that in any case could be inserted in the study . The asymptomatic patient is characterized
      by the absence of end-organ damage or tissue involvement, such as anemia, bone lesions,
      hypercalcemia, and renal failure, or by other relevant clinical conditions, such as
      hyperviscosity, amyloidosis, and recurrent infections (CRAB).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is, in the investigator(s) opinion, willing and able to comply with the
             protocol requirements.

          -  Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study
             related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent
             may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future medical
             care.

          -  Patient is 65 years old or older at the time of signing the informed consent or
             younger patients not candidate to high dose therapy

          -  Female patient is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or, if at
             child-bearing potential†, must:

               -  understand that the study medication could have an expected teratogenic risk

               -  Agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception without
                  interruption, 4 weeks before starting study drug, throughout study drug therapy
                  (including dose interruptions) and for 4 weeks after the end of study drug
                  therapy, even if she has amenorrhea. This applies unless the subject commits to
                  absolute and continued abstinence confirmed on a monthly basis. The following are
                  effective methods of contraception*

          -  Implant**

          -  Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS)**

          -  Ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills (i.e., desogestrel)

        Combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended. If a subject was using combined oral
        contraception, she must switch to one of the methods above. The increased risk of VTE
        continues for 4 to 6 weeks after stopping combined oral contraception.

          -  prophylactic antibiotics should be considered at the time of insertion particularly in
             patients with neutropenia due to risk of infection

               -  Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test with a minimum sensitivity of
                  25 mIU/ml not more than 3 days before the start of study medication once the
                  subject has been on effective contraception for at least 4 weeks. This
                  requirement also applies to women of childbearing potential who practice complete
                  and continued abstinence.

               -  Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test every 4 weeks including 4
                  weeks after the end of study treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal
                  sterilization. These tests should be performed not more than 3 days before the
                  start of next treatment. This requirement also applies to women of childbearing
                  potential who practice complete and continued abstinence

                  - Male subjects must

               -  Agree to use condoms throughout study drug therapy, during any dose interruption
                  and for one week after cessation of study therapy if their partner is of
                  childbearing potential and has no contraception.

               -  Agree not to donate semen during study drug therapy and for one week after end of
                  study drug therapy.

                  - All subjects must

               -  Agree to abstain from donating blood while taking study drug therapy and for one
                  week following discontinuation of study drug therapy.

               -  Agree not to share study medication with another person and to return all unused
                  study drug to the investigator.

                  - Patient was previously diagnosed with symptomatic MM based on standard
                  criteria, and has measurable disease, defined as follows:

               -  Secretory myeloma: any quantifiable serum monoclonal protein value (generally,
                  but not necessarily, greater than 1 g/dL of IgG M-Protein and greater than 0.5
                  g/dL of IgA M-Protein) and, where applicable, urine light-chain excretion of &gt;200
                  mg/24 hours;
