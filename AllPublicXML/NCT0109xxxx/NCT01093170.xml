      This is a non-randomized, open-label, dose-escalating Phase Ia study performed at a single
      center designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of
      intravitreous administration of RNA-144101 in patients with geographic atrophy (GA).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females of all races and ethnicities between the ages of 50-99

          -  Female subjects must be 1-year postmenopausal or surgically sterilized and must have
             negative serum pregnancy test

          -  Subjects must have GA from AMD in one or both eyes:

          -  The study eye will be the eye that meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria

          -  If both eyes meet criteria, then the eye with the smaller GA lesion will be studied

          -  If the GA lesions are equal in size, then the eye with the best-corrected visual
             acuity (BCVA) will chosen as the study eye

          -  If both eyes have the same lesion size and same BCVA, the right eye will be chosen

          -  Subjects must have the following GA criteria for inclusion:

          -  GA lesions with an area &gt; 2.5mm2 and â‰¤ 20mm2 as determine by fluorescein angiography
             and fundus autofluorescence

          -  A clear view to the fundus must be present in order to easily examine the study eye at
             baseline

          -  BCVA In the study eye between 20/20 and 20/100 as measured on Snellen chart or 85-50
             letters by ETDRS

          -  Willing and able to provide signed informed consent prior to any study participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  GA due to a disease other than AMD

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Treatment of any systemic infection

          -  Autofluorescence pattern marked at none, focal or patchy

          -  Ocular surgery in the study eye in the previous 6 months.

          -  Presence or history of choroidal neovascularization (wet AMD) in the study eye

          -  Any inflammatory (autoimmune, uveitis) or neovascular (diabetic retinopathy) disease
             of the retina

          -  Any history of glaucoma or disc cupping in the study eye

          -  Any history of severe dry eye disease

          -  High myopia &gt; - 8D or high hyperopia &gt; +8D in the study eye

          -  Presence of life-threatening disease

          -  Abnormal basal metabolic panel or liver function tests

          -  Current alcohol or other substance abuse

          -  Unwilling or unable to provide signed informed consent for any study procedures
