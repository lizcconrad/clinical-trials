  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality and supposes a sanitary
      problem in Europe and USA. Patients with COPD usually have 1-2 episodes of acute exacerbation
      of COPD (AECOPD) per year, being these the principal causes of of hospitalizations,
      respiratory problems and medical visits. After an episode of AECOPD, the majority of patients
      develop a transitory (or permanent) worsening in their quality of life and 50% of them will
      require a new hospitalization. Globally, a 75%&amp; of the exacerbations might be associated with
      a respiratory tract infection, and among them, 50% might be related to bacteria and in 45% an
      evidence of viral infection could be documented. Even though the antibiotic treatment might
      not be useful for a majority of patients with AECOPD, is generalized its use(almost an 85% in
      some series) in hospitalized patients. The non-controlled use of antibiotics in AECOPD
      results in a very expensive disease and raises the rate of resistance of bacteria. The
      available literature have shown that there's a relation between exacerbations and infections,
      based on sputum samples.

      In summary, is well known that at least a 50% of the episodes of AECOPD might be associated
      with pathogenic bacteria in the lower respiratory tract. Prescription of antibiotics is wide
      and generalized in hospitalized patients. Clinical trials have shown correlation between
      AECOPD with sputum purulence (which correlates with presence of bacteria), however they've
      not included NON-purulent AECOPD, even though they're a significative group of patients
      hospitalized by this cause too. It's necessary to evaluate the efficacy nor the security of
      antibiotic treatment in this group of patients in a well designed trial.
