  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to prevent excessive blood loss during liver surgery, an intermittent Pringle
      manoeuvre (IPM) can be applied. This implies a temporary clamping of the portal vein and
      hepatic artery in the hepatoduodenal ligament in order to occlude hepatic inflow. The optimal
      duration of the IPM is unknown. This randomized controlled trial aimed to analyse differences
      in hepatocellular damage after 15 minutes or 30 minutes IPM during liver surgery for primary
      or secondary liver tumours.

      Surgical procedure Patients were anaesthetized using isoflurane and propofol. They routinely
      had an epidural catheter, urinary catheter, two peripheral venous catheters and indwelling
      catheters in a jugular vein and radial artery. Body temperature was maintained using a Bair
      Hugger system (Arizant Healthcare Inc. Eden Prairie, Minnesota).

      The surgical procedure was performed using a subcostal bilateral incision and Olivier
      retractors to improve exposure. After dissection of the teres hepatis ligament, the liver was
      mobilized. Thereafter, an intra-operative ultrasound was performed to define the position of
      the tumour in relation to vascular and biliary structures. As IPM was not routinely applied,
      a patient was randomized for 15 minted IPM (15IPM) or 30 minutes IPM (30IPM) only after the
      surgeon had decided a complete Pringle manoeuvre would be required. During 15IPM or 30IPM,
      the complete portal triad was clamped using a rubber sling. The time of inflow occlusion was
      adapted to the need according to the randomization protocol. Occasionally, the left or right
      pedicle was ligated after protocolled IPM. Five minutes reperfusion intervals were applied
      during which transection was stopped and cut surfaces were gently compressed to ensure
      hemostasis. A Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA system 200 macrodissector,
      Cavitron Surgical Systems, Stamford, Connecticut) and Argon beam coagulation (Force GSU
      System, Valleylab, Boulder, Colorado) were used for liver transection. A stapler device or
      clamps were used for transection of the hepatic veins. Central venous pressure was maintained
      below 5 centimetre of water (cm H2O) during transection to reduce venous back-bleeding. After
      surgery, the weight of the resection specimen was recorded. Perioperative care was
      protocolled, as described earlier.

    <description>At specific time points before, during and after liver surgery, plasma samples will be obtained to analyse the amount of hepatocellular damage reflected by L-FABP) level. These timepoints include: baseline (before operation), just before intermittent pedicle clamping, just before end of 15 or 30 minutes pedicle clamping, end of 5 minutes reperfusion, end of liver surgery, 8 hours after start liver surgery, postoperative day 1, 2 and 3. This continuous variable with repeated measurements was summarized as area under the curve (AUC) from baseline to postoperative day 3 (as described in Matthews JN, Altman DG, Campbell MJ, Royston P.

In short, any deviation from the postoperative course without the need for pharmacological, radiological or surgical intervention was classified as Clavien-Dindo grade 1; complications requiring pharmacological treatment were graded as grade 2; complications requiring surgical or radiological intervention not under general anesthesia as grade 3a and under general anesthesia as grade 3b; grade 4 complications were life-threatening complications requiring intensive care unit care because of single organ dysfunction (grade 4a) or multiple organ dysfunction (grade 4b); mortality was classed as grade 5.</description>
