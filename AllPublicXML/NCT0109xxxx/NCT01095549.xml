  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) defined as ankle-brachial index (ABI) less
      than 0.9 was about 15~30% in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD), which was higher
      than those with normal renal function. A lower ABI and a higher brachial-ankle pulse wave
      velocity (baPWV) are good markers to predict the risk of PAD and atherosclerosis
      respectively. In addition, baPWV&gt;2,100 cm/s was shown to be related to potential PAD. ABI
      &lt;0.9 was positively associated with vascular access failure in hemodialysis (HD) patients and
      our previous study has demonstrated that far infrared (FIR) therapy can improve access flow
      and unassisted patency of atrioventricular (AV) fistula.

      The aims of this study are to evaluate (1) the frequency of and (2) risk factors associated
      with abnormal ABI and PWV as well as (3) the effect of FIR on ABI and PWV and markers related
      to endothelial dysfunction in HD patients.

      In this study, 300 HD patients will be enrolled to receive ABI and baPWV and about 90
      patients (30% according to the literature review) who have abnormal ABI (&lt;0.9) or baPWV
      (&gt;2100 cm/sec) will be randomly allocated to FIR group (receiving FIR therapy for 40 minutes
      thrice weekly) and control group (without FIR therapy). In patients with abnormal ABI or
      baPWV, the effect of single or one-year treatment of FIR on the following items will be
      studied: (1) ABI, (2) baPWV and (3) markers related to endothelial dysfunction [including low
      and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL and HDL), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA),
      hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)]. The effect of
      FIR on PAD or cardiovascular events during one year of follow-up will also be studied.

      This study will allow us to identify the frequency of and the risk factors associated with
      abnormal ABI &amp; PWV as well as the effect of single or one-year FIR therapy on ABI &amp; PWV in HD
      patients.

    <description>The values of the ABI were measured 10 to 30 min before HD. The ABIs will be measured by using an ABI-form device (VP1000,Colin, Komaki, Japan). The ABI will be calculated by the ratio of the ankle systolic BP divided by the arm systolic BP. The systolic BP of the arm without dialysis access and the value of the ankle systolic BP will be used for the calculation. All of the ABI and PWV will be measured twice. If the difference between them was more than 10%, a third measurement was done. The mean of the two closest values was recorded into our data base.</description>

    <description>In this study, a WSTM TY101 FIR emitter (WS Far Infrared Medical Technology Co., Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan) will be used for FIR therapy. The electrified ceramic plates of this emitter generate electromagnetic waves with wavelengths in the range between 3 and 25 μm (a peak between 5 to 6 μm). The irradiating power density is 10 and 20 mili watt〈mw〉/cm2 when the top radiator is set at a distance between 30 and 20 cm above the skin surface respectively. In this study, the top radiator will be set at a height of 25 cm above the surface of bilateral lower legs and the treatment time will be set at 40 minutes for patients on maintenance HD.</description>
