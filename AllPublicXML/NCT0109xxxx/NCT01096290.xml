  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation from medications is a serious and common condition. Lubiprostone has properties
      that make it a candidate drug. One hundred volunteers with constipation who are taking
      medications known to cause constipation will be randomized to take lubiprostone or placebo
      for 28 days. Therapeutic outcome will be evaluated by investigator and study subject
      assessment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lubiprostone is a novel chloride channel activator that increases intestinal fluid secretion
      and motility. It is FDA approved and indicated for treatment of chronic idiopathic
      constipation and recently, constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.

      The Physicians Desk Reference lists over 90 Brand medications with reported incidence
      associated with constipation over 3%. Little data are available about treatment responses. A
      recent publication by our group reported treatment success for medication constipation using
      polyethylene glycol. Since ongoing studies are addressing the role of lubiprostone in opioid
      constipation, this work will be enrolling medication constipation study subjects not using
      opioids.

      In this study, patients who meet diagnostic criteria for constipation will be randomized to
      receive 28 days of treatment with lubiprostone 24mcg twice a day. Data will be collected to
      evaluate therapeutic outcome.
