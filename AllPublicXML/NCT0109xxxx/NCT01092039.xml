  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study will be to assess the efficacy and safety of XIGO administered
      orally, three times a day, compared with placebo in patients with the common cold.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The common cold is one of the most frequent human illnesses and has been shown to result in
      significant morbidity and economic loss. At the present time no truly effective therapy is
      available. Therapeutic interventions with compounds such as zinc have been found to be
      helpful however well reported side-effects have prevented its extensive use.

      Based on several years of anecdotal clinical evidence which has shown that XIGO is effective
      in alleviating the symptoms of the common cold-the findings of which are supported by
      competent and reliable evidence from in vivo and in vitro and clinical trials studies on each
      of the individual active ingredients of the formulation, it has been proposed that XIGO, when
      administered orally, has a direct stimulatory effect on multiple components of the immune
      system. It is proposed that this stimulation increases both the immune cell population as
      well as its functionality and this will be observed in cells and molecules from both the
      innate and adaptive responses.

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be to assess the severity of the typical interrelated common cold symptoms, over the first seven days of observation period, with the first day being the 24 hour period after first dose of treatment, using the patient/subject completion of the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey-21 (WURSS-21).</description>

    <description>The secondary outcome measures will be to assess the severity of the typical interrelated common cold symptoms, over the fourteen days of observation period, with the first day being 24 hours after first dose of treatment, using the patient/subject completion of the WURSS-21.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess time to resolution</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days post dose</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary outcome is to assess the time to resolution of the typical interrelated common cold symptoms, with resolution deemed to occur when participant reports being &quot;not sick&quot; for two days in a row</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of patients with unresolved symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days post dose</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary outcome is to assess the % of patients with clinically unresolved symptoms at day 14, as accessed by the attending investigator. This will include secondary complications such as rhinitis, sinusitis, lower respiratory tract infections and asthma exacerbations.</description>
