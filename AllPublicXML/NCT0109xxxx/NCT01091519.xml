    <textblock>
      Collect information on treatment with Toviaz (fesoterodine) under ordinary prescribing
      conditions, and to investigate whether additional educational information affects
      satisfaction with treatment as perceived by the patient.

    <textblock>
      Patients will be identified and monitored during routine clinical practice visits, and will
      not be specifically selected as this would interfere with the representativeness of the
      results. The study will be conducted with office-based urologists and office-based general
      physicians, practitioners and internists (GPs) in Germany, thus representing a wide range of
      practices and populations. Each urologist or GP may invite patients to participate who have
      already been diagnosed with overactive bladder and prescribed Toviaz according to their usual
      standard of care. Study enrollment stopped on December 31, 2011 due to difficulty in
      recruiting patients. No safety issues were related to the decision to stop patient
      enrollment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Satisfied With Treatment at Month 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's response to treatment was based on treatment satisfaction questionnaires (TSQ). Participants answered: &quot;overall, how satisfied are you with your OAB medication?&quot; and were asked to rate this question on 5 point scale as 1=very satisfied, 2=somewhat satisfied, 3= neither dissatisfied nor satisfied, 4=somewhat dissatisfied and 5=very dissatisfied. Five categorical responses were grouped to satisfied (including &quot;very satisfied&quot; and &quot;somewhat satisfied&quot;) and dissatisfied (including &quot;very dissatisfied&quot;, &quot;somewhat dissatisfied&quot;, and &quot;neither dissatisfied nor satisfied&quot;).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) at Week 4 and Month 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Month 4</time_frame>
    <description>PPBC: single-item, self-administered validated questionnaire. Rated on a 6-point scale: participant was asked: &quot;Which of the following statements describes your bladder condition best at the moment?&quot; 1=no problems at all; 2=some very minor problems; 3=some minor problems; 4=some moderate problems; 5=severe problems; 6=many severe problems. Change from baseline results categorized as deterioration (Positive change from baseline); no Change (scores change=0); minor Improvement (negative score change in magnitude of 1); major improvement (negative score change in magnitude of &gt;=2).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Patient Perception of Urgency Scale (PPUS) at Week 4 and Month 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Month 4</time_frame>
    <description>PPUS: single-item, self-administered validated questionnaire. Rated on a 3-point scale: participant was asked: &quot;Which of the following would typically describe your experience when you have a desire to urinate?&quot; 1=usually not able to hold urine; 2=usually able to hold urine (without leaking) until I reach a toilet if I go to the toilet immediately; 3= usually able to finish what I am doing before going to the toilet (without leaking). Change from baseline results categorized as deterioration (Negative change); no change (Score change=0); improvement (Positive change).</description>

    <description>Participant's response to the treatment was based on treatment satisfaction questionnaires (TSQ). TSQ was rated on a 5-point scale, participant was asked: &quot;overall how satisfied are you with your over active bladder (OAB) medication?&quot; 1=very satisfied, 2=somewhat satisfied, 3=neither dissatisfied nor satisfied, 4=somewhat dissatisfied, 5=very dissatisfied.

        <description>Participant’s response to treatment was based on treatment satisfaction questionnaires (TSQ). Participants answered: “overall, how satisfied are you with your OAB medication?” and were asked to rate this question on 5 point scale as 1=very satisfied, 2=somewhat satisfied, 3= neither dissatisfied nor satisfied, 4=somewhat dissatisfied and 5=very dissatisfied. Five categorical responses were grouped to satisfied (including “very satisfied” and “somewhat satisfied”) and dissatisfied (including “very dissatisfied”, “somewhat dissatisfied”, and “neither dissatisfied nor satisfied”).</description>
