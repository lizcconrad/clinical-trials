    <textblock>
      PLX3397 is a selective inhibitor of Fms and Kit activity. The objective of this study is to
      evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and drug-drug interaction
      (DDI) of orally administered PLX3397 during 2 weeks of dosing in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) who are on maintenance methotrexate. This study is planned to provide data to
      inform dose selection for a subsequent 12 week dose ranging study in RA.

    <measure>To assess the drug-drug interaction of PLX3397 and Methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks + 2 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples will be taken at multiple time points during the 2 week time frame plus a 2 week follow up time frame to study the pharmacokinetics of PLX3397 and Methotrexate in patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the safety and tolerability of PLX3397 when taken once daily with concomitant methotrexate administration</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events and safety lab tests (including a hematology panel, blood chemistry panel, coagulation and urinalysis) will be monitored throughout the study time frame.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the pharmacokinetics of PLX3397 when taken once daily for 2 weeks at either a 25, 50, 100, 200 or 300 mg dose.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The pharmacokinetic profile of plasma PLX3397 will be analyzed by measurement of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-t, AUC0-inf), peak concentration (Cmax), time to peak concentration (Tmax), half-life (t1/2), and terminal elimination rate constant (Kel).</description>

    <measure>To assess the pharmacodynamics of PLX3397 when taken once daily for 2 weeks at either a 25, 50, 100, 200 or 300 mg dose.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by looking at the factors in the blood that may include, but are not limited to pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and mediators of the inflammatory process that may correlate with the activity of the disease and the response to PLX3397 in combination with methotrexate</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients ≥ 18 years old with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis by ACR
             criteria for ≥ 3 months.

          -  Prior to Baseline, patients must be on oral or subcutaneous methotrexate (≥ 10 mg/week
             and ≤ 25 mg/week) for at least 12 weeks (with a stable dose for at least 4 weeks) and
             folate (≥ 5 mg/week) for at least 6 weeks, and willing to continue on this regimen for
             the duration of the study.

          -  Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function (absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 X
             109/L, Hgb &gt; 9 g/dL, platelet count ≥ 100 X 109/L, AST/ALT WNL, albumin ≥ 3 g/dL,
             calculated CrCl&gt;60 mL/min using Cockcroft-Gault formula).

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days
             prior to initiation of dosing and must agree to use a double barrier method of birth
             control from the time of the negative pregnancy test up to 30 days after the last dose

             immunosuppressive agents other then hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine within 4 weeks
             of Day 1 Baseline.

          -  Investigational drug use within 4 weeks of Day 1 Baseline.

          -  Concomitant use of DMARDs (other than methotrexate), biological response modifiers, or
             known strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4.

          -  Positive HepBsAg or HCV, or presence of clinically significant hepatic or biliary
             disease.

          -  Refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, external biliary shunt, or significant
             bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption.

          -  QTc ≥ 450 msec at Screening.

          -  The presence of a medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the
