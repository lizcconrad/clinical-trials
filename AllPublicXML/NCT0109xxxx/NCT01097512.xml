  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In clinical practice and research, combination of anticancer agents is often used to improve
      efficacy of treatment. In vitro and in vivo experiments have shown additive-synergistic
      anti-tumour effects of AS703569 treatment when combined with gemcitabine. Specifically,
      additive-synergistic anti-tumour effects were noticed when the two agents were given
      sequentially and not concomitantly i.e. AS703569 given the day before or the day after
      gemcitabine. This trial was designed to investigate in parallel two regimens testing
      sequential administration of AS703569 either the day after gemcitabine infusion, (Regimen 1)
      or the day before (Regimen 2).

    <description>Gemcitabine on Days 1 and 8, AS703569 on Days 2 and 9, of a 21-day cycle. The starting dose (DL1) for AS703569 will be 10mg/m2/day. The subsequent dose levels of AS703569 will follow the dose-escalation scheme with an approximate 50% increase from DL1 to DL2, 40% from DL2 to DL3, and thereafter an approximate increase of 33% from one dose level to the next.
Gemcitabine will be administered at the dose of 1000mg/m2 once weekly during the first two weeks of each 21-day cycle.</description>
