      Background: Body weight supported (BWS) locomotor training improves overground walking
      ability in individuals with motor-incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). While there are
      various approaches available for locomotor training, there is no consensus regarding which of
      these is optimal. The purpose of this ongoing investigation is to compare outcomes associated
      with these different training approaches.

      Subjects and Methods: Subjects with chronic motor-incomplete SCI have completed training and
      initial and final testing. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 different BWS
      assisted-stepping groups, including: 1) treadmill training with manual assistance (TM), 2)
      treadmill training with stimulation (TS), 3) overground training with stimulation (OG), or 4)
      treadmill training with robotic assistance (LR). Prior to and following participation the
      investigators assessed:

        -  Walking-related outcome measures: overground walking speed, training speed, step length
           and step symmetry.

        -  Spinal cord reflex activity

        -  Electromyographic (EMG) associated with walking

      Hypotheses:

      In individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI):

        1. A 12-week period of body weight supported treadmill training with TS will produce
           improvements in walking function that are significantly greater than those produced by
           training with TM, OG, LR.

        2. TS training will be associated with greater changes to spinal reflex activity than will
           be observed in subjects trained with manual assistance or non-assisted stepping. Changes
           to spinal reflex activation will be such that this activity more closely resembles that
           observed in non-disabled (ND) individuals.

        3. Following participation in this walking regimen, EMG activity observed during walking in
           all groups will be more robust, more consistent and better coordinated than EMG measures
           obtained prior to training.
