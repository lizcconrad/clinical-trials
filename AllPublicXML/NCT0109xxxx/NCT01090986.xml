  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non invasive ventilation (NIV) usually presents air leaks that may determine the result of
      this treatment. The clinical usefulness of analyzing (and quantifying) these leaks during the
      adaptation period to NIV has not been evaluated in prospective clinical studies as a
      predictive data of treatment effectiveness. Our hypothesis is that air leaks are correlated
      to a successful adaptation to NIV. And air leak magnitude may predict early failures of this
      treatment. And also, as we do not know if air leaks change during the adaptation period to
      NIV, we do not know whether early detection of air leaks plays a role in the therapeutic
      outcome. Our objective is to evaluate the clinical usefulness of quantifying air leaks during
      the adaptation period to NIV as a predictor of effectiveness of this treatment. We also want
      to evaluate the correlation between air leaks and clinical-functional patients' profile, and
      the ventilatory parameters selected and to evaluate air leaks variability during the
      adaptation period to NIV. Method: We will determine the air leak magnitude in twenty patients
      during adaptation to NIV. We will use VPAP III ventilators (ResMed, Australia), commercial
      nasal masks (Mirage o Ultra Mirage) and VPAP III/ResLinkTM (ResMed, North Ryde, Australia), a
      device that includes a monitoring system coupled with the VPAP III ventilator. This device
      allows to record air leaks and other ventilation parameters. We will perform four VPAP
      III/ResLinkTM recordings in each patient (the last night in hospital during the adaptation
      period, the first night at home, and one and two months later, after the initiation of NIV
      treatment). We will also perform a complete pulmonary function test, quality-of-life
      questionnaire (SF36), and a tolerance to NIV questionnaire in all patients at the onset of
      NIV treatment and two months later. We will evaluate which patients will need to change
      treatment at the end of the adaptation period to NIV. We also will analyze and compare air
      leaks magnitude in each of the four recordings stated above.
