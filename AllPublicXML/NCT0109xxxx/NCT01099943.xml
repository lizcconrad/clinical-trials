      Hypotheses and Specific Aims:

      The continued emergence of antibiotic-resistance in the outpatient setting underlines the
      need to responsibly manage antimicrobial prescribing. It is in this context that we seek to
      test an effective strategy for reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics in primary care
      office practices. Our overall objective is to identify an effective and efficient strategy
      for decreasing the contribution of primary care clinicians to the emergence of
      antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in the community and to disseminate widely those strategies
      found to be effective and sustainable.

      We hypothesize that implementation of a clinician decision support system, with an active
      education component, will reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics in primary care office
      practices. Our hypothesis is based on the premise that most inappropriate prescribing is the
      result of multiple factors that include difficulty in distinguishing a benign, self-limited
      viral infection from a more serious bacterial infection; overdiagnosis of a bacterial
      infection in cases where there is clinical uncertainty as to the true nature of the illness;
      and constraints on the time available for clinicians to explain to patients the nature of the
      illness and the reasons an antibiotic is not indicated.

      The focus of this proposal will be to compare the impact of clinical decision support and
      active education to no intervention for enhancing the appropriate use of antimicrobials for
      common outpatient infections. In this randomized control trial, primary care providers
      participating in the intervention arm will receive active education coupled with the
      implementation of a clinical decision support tool, while providers in the control arm will
      have no intervention. At the end of the study, providers in the control arm will receive a
      thorough analysis of their antibiotic prescribing patterns and suggested opportunities for
      improvement, as well as access to the intervention tools once the study has ended.

      Our interdisciplinary team will integrate novel methods in implementation science with
      clinical and laboratory expertise in infectious diseases, antimicrobial stewardship, primary
      care, information technology, performance improvement, health services research, and
      biostatistics. The Specific Aims are constructed to validate our hypothesis in the primary
      care setting by demonstrating two results of our intervention strategy:

        1. Reduced use of antibiotics to treat conditions for which those drugs are known not to be
           effective

        2. Decreased prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat common bacterial
           infections.

      The degree of impact in terms of prescriptions per 100 visits for each targeted outpatient
      infection will be compared with active education and clinical decision support versus no
      intervention. The study will be able to measure the value of clinical decision support with
      active education that will inform future efforts in disseminating outpatient antibiotic
      stewardship interventions.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinic practices within Denver Health's Webb Center for Primary Care,

          2. Clinic practices within the University of Colorado - Anschutz Campus: General Internal
             Medicine Clinic,

          3. Clinic practices within the High Plains Network, and

          4. Clinical practices within the Wilmington Health Associates System

        The antibiotic prescribing patterns of primary care clinicians in these practices will be
        monitored over a 2 year period. Practices must be willing to assist in tracking:

          1. Patient records (pediatric and adult) for conditions related to the International
             Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes associated with common infectious conditions
             (Upper Respiratory Infection, Acute Bronchitis, Pharyngitis, Acute Sinusitis, Otitis
             Media, Acute Cystitis, Cellulitis or soft tissue abscess, and Community-acquired
             Pneumonia) will be assessed for antibiotic prescribing,

          2. 30-day events (hospitalizations,

          3. Note: Emergency Department (ED) visits, or grade 3 or grade 4 abnormalities), will
             also be included in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Ob/Gyn related clinic visits will not be included in this study as these visits are not
        typically associated with high volumes of antibiotic prescribing for the infectious
        conditions of interest.
