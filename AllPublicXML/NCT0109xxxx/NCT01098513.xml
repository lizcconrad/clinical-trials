  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, two part, open-label, crossover study in healthy adult
      subjects. Part A will evaluate the relative bioavailability of two new tablet formulations
      compared to the current tablet formulation of GSK1349572 at 50 mg administered as single
      doses each comprising of two 25 mg tablets. Pharmacokinetic samples from Part A will be
      analyzed and, if at least one of the new formulations meets appropriate criteria and is
      selected, Part B will be a single-sequence design conducted to evaluate food effect of the
      selected new tablet formulation at one dose level. A subset of subjects enrolled in Part A
      will continue in Part B. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples will be collected during
      each treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 7-28 days after the last dose of study
      drug.

    <description>A total of 18 subjects who complete Part A will return for Part B. Subjects from Part A will be asked to participate on a first come first served basis until there are 18 subjects, at which time enrolment to Part B will be closed. Part B will be a three way crossover design using either formulation AW or AX depending upon the results from Part A. Subjects will receive a single dose of 50 mg GSK1349572 with either a low fat, moderate fat or high fat meal in each period.</description>
