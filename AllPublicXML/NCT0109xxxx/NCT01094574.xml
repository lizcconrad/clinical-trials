  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that the beta-adrenergic system plays a role in processing pain
      and the expression of hyperalgesia. Recent studies have investigated the analgesic effects,
      and potential anti-hyperalgesic effects (using a model of opioid induced (OIH) hyperalgesia)
      of propranolol, a beta adrenergic antagonist. We plan to further investigate the analgesic
      effects, and the potential anti inflammatory effects, of propranolol and compare those
      effects to alfentanil, an opioid of known effect, and placebo
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double blind-placebo controlled study in which subjects will be exposed to
      propranolol infusion during one study day, the opioid alfentanil on another day, and placebo
      infusion during a third study day. The infusion order will be randomized, and the participant
      and individual conducting the pain testing will both be blinded to the treatment.

      Propranolol, alfentanil, and placebo infusions will be administered intravenously using a
      computer-controlled infusion pump that can be set to accurately administer a target plasma
      concentration of drug.

      On one study day subjects will receive propranolol at a target concentration of 30ng/ml over
      3 hours time. On another study day subjects will receive 100ng/ml alfentanil over 3 hours,
      and on a third study day subjects will receive placebo (normal saline) using a
      computer-controlled infusion paradigm.

      Sites to be evaluated for response to propranolol and placebo will be established in 2 ways.
      One will use ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure to create a &quot;sunburn&quot; causing inflammation and
      pain. The other will be a model of acute injury using an array of micro-needles.

      Means of evaluation of injured, and non-injured sites will be pain testing (heat and
      mechanical pain thresholds will be established), interstitial fluid sampling for detection of
      pro-inflammatory, and pro-nociceptive cytokines, and laser doppler evaluation of tissue
      perfusion.

      Subjects will be recruited using flyers. Interested participants will contact the study team,
      their questions will be answered, and an appointment for screening will be made.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Heat Pain Threshold During Infusion in Non-Inflamed Skin</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants underwent the pain testing measures at baseline and at 1 and 2 hours after startingthe drug infusion.</time_frame>
    <description>Degrees Centigrade Heat pain was induced with a thermal sensory analyzer (TSA-II, Medoc Advanced Medical Systems, Durham, North Carolina). A thermode was placed in contact with skin on the upper thigh. Starting at a comfortable temperature, the thermode temperature was increased at a measured rate. Study participants pushed a button of a hand-held device at the onset of pain at which point the thermode immediately reduced the temperature. Measurements for analgesia were taken at the sites of non-injured skin. Change form baseline was calculated by subtracting baseline values from the average values obtained 1 and 2 hours after starting the drug infusion.</description>

          <description>Day 1: Experimental inflammation and tissue injury sites were created, an infusion of propranolol 30ng/ml was administered over 3 hours.
Day 2: Experimental inflammation, and tissue injury sites were created an infusion of alfentanil 100ng/ml was administered over 3 hours.
Day 3: Experimental inflammation and tissue injury sites were created, an infusion of normal saline was administered over 3 hours using a programmable infusion pump.
On all study days data were collected to measure inflammation, pain response, and cytokine levels locally.
Experimental inflammation and tissue injury sites were used for pain testing to determine heat and mechanical pain threshold.
Interstitial fluid sampling was accomplished with microdialysis. Samples were collected hourly throughout the study day.
Laser doppler evaluation of tissue perfusion was made at baseline and again at hours 1, 2 and 3 following initiation of the infusions.</description>

        <description>Degrees Centigrade Heat pain was induced with a thermal sensory analyzer (TSA-II, Medoc Advanced Medical Systems, Durham, North Carolina). A thermode was placed in contact with skin on the upper thigh. Starting at a comfortable temperature, the thermode temperature was increased at a measured rate. Study participants pushed a button of a hand-held device at the onset of pain at which point the thermode immediately reduced the temperature. Measurements for analgesia were taken at the sites of non-injured skin. Change form baseline was calculated by subtracting baseline values from the average values obtained 1 and 2 hours after starting the drug infusion.</description>

        <description>A metal rod of 0.24 mm diameter mounted onto 10 different weights (1.0, 2.0, 4.1, 8.2,16.3, 20, 32.7,49.0, 65.3, and 81.3g) will be placed perpendicularly onto the skin. Starting with the lightest probe, consecutively heavier probes will be used until a subject reports pain. Subsequently, the same or the next lighter probe will be used if pain is reported for the preceding stimulus, or the same or the next heavier probe will be used if no pain is reported for the preceding stimulus.The procedure will be repeated until seven perceptional changes (painful/non-painful) are registered. Measurements for analgesia were taken at the sites of non-injured skin. Change form baseline was calculated by subtracting baseline values from the average values obtained 1 and 2 hours after starting the drug infusion.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Mechanical Pain Threshold During Infusion in Non-Inflamed Skin</title>
          <description>A metal rod of 0.24 mm diameter mounted onto 10 different weights (1.0, 2.0, 4.1, 8.2,16.3, 20, 32.7,49.0, 65.3, and 81.3g) will be placed perpendicularly onto the skin. Starting with the lightest probe, consecutively heavier probes will be used until a subject reports pain. Subsequently, the same or the next lighter probe will be used if pain is reported for the preceding stimulus, or the same or the next heavier probe will be used if no pain is reported for the preceding stimulus.The procedure will be repeated until seven perceptional changes (painful/non-painful) are registered. Measurements for analgesia were taken at the sites of non-injured skin. Change form baseline was calculated by subtracting baseline values from the average values obtained 1 and 2 hours after starting the drug infusion.</description>

          <description>IL-6 (ng/mL) was measured in interstitial fluid after collecting samples as follows: Microdialysis catheters (very small, custom-made, sterile, semi-permeable, micro-dialysis catheters) were placed after the 1st laser Doppler measurement. Two catheters were placed at an experimentally inflamed skin site on the left leg. A continuous infusion of sterile 1% albumin solution was started using a programmable pump set at a rate of 2.5µl/min. Samples were collected hourly throughout the remainder of the study day. Samples for analysis were collected before, and 2 and 3 hours after starting the drug infusion. Difference form baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline concentration form the average concentration determined in samples collected during drug infusion.</description>
