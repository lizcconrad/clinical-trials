        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able and willing to provide written informed consent;

          -  Male or female subjects, ≥18 years and ≤ 50 years of age;

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum
             b-HCG) at Pre-Screening, and a negative urine pregnancy test immediately before the
             first administration of the study drug for each of the three Treatment Periods.
             Sexually active females must be willing to use adequate contraception.

          -  Male subjects must be willing to use a condom with a spermicide for the duration of
             their participation in the study, plus an additional 30 days following study drug
             administration and ensure that their partner is using a highly effective method of
             birth control such as combined oral contraceptives, implants, injectables or a IUD.
             Male subjects must ensure that their female partner is willing to use adequate
             contraception;

          -  Diagnosis of mild allergic asthma that meets the following criteria:

               -  Stable on inhaled short-acting beta-2-agonists p.r.n. as the only medication for
                  asthma.

               -  Presence of both early asthmatic response (EAR) (at least 20 % fall in FEV1
                  within 3 hours after allergen inhalation) and late asthmatic response (LAR) (at
                  least 15 % fall in FEV1).

               -  Baseline methacholine (PC20) ≤ 16 mg/mL.

          -  FEV1 of at least 70 % of the predicted value at Pre-Screening and Screening /
             Baseline;

          -  BMI ≥ 19 and ≤ 35 kg/m²;

          -  Body weight ≥ 40 kg;

          -  Positive skin prick test to at least one common aeroallergen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any lung disease other than mild allergic asthma;

          -  Pregnant or nursing women or women intending to conceive during the course of the

             bilateral tubal ligation, or post-menopausal for at least two years) not using a
             highly effective method of birth control. Highly effective methods of birth control
             are defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1 % per year)
             when used consistently and correctly such as implants, injectables, combined oral
             contraceptives, intra-uterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence or a partner who has
             undergone a vasectomy;

          -  Respiratory tract infections or worsening of asthma within 6 weeks before
             Screening/Baseline;

          -  Baseline methacholine PC20 &gt; 16 mg/mL at Screening / Baseline;

          -  Current cigarette smokers or former smokers with a smoking history of greater than 10
             pack years or who stopped smoking within the 12 months preceding enrolment in the

          -  Use of any nicotine containing products within 6 months before Pre-Screening;

          -  Any of the following concomitant medications:

               -  Oral or inhaled corticosteroids within 28 days preceding Pre-Screening or
                  systemic corticosteroids within 90 days of Pre-Screening.

               -  Long acting beta-2-agonists within one week preceding Baseline.

               -  Use of inhaled short-acting β2- agonists or anticholinergics within 8 hours
                  before all study visits to the clinic.

          -  Known or suspected allergy or sensitivity to nicotine or cholinergic drugs or any drug
             with similar chemical structure;

          -  Clinically significant ECG abnormalities at Pre-Screening including clinically
             significant or marked baseline prolongation of QT / QTc interval (e.g. repeated
             demonstration of a QTc interval of &gt; 450 ms). Other non clinically significant
             findings such as sinus bradycardia, sinus arrhythmia, borderline first degree AV block
             (up to 205 ms), left ventricular hypertrophy (on voltage criteria for a subject less
             than 40 years old for instance) are permissible if judged to be acceptable by the
             Qualified investigator;

          -  Family history of additional risk factors for TdP (e.g., family history of Long QT
             Syndrome.
