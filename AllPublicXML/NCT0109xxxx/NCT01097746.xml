      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if therapy with bevacizumab,
      carboplatin, and weekly doses of paclitaxel is safe and can be tolerated in patients with
      newly diagnosed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Researchers
      will also study if and how well this study therapy may help to control the disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard chemotherapy for newly diagnosed epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or
      fallopian tube cancer is usually a combination of 2 chemotherapy drugs called carboplatin and
      paclitaxel. This treatment has been found to be effective, but the cancer often comes back,
      requiring additional treatment. For this study, researchers will give carboplatin,
      bevacizumab, and weekly paclitaxel to see if the treatment is effective and safe in treating
      the disease.

      The Study Drugs:

      Bevacizumab is designed to block the growth of blood vessels that supply nutrients necessary
      for tumor growth. This may prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells.

      Carboplatin is designed to interfere with the growth of cancer cells by stopping cell
      division.

      Paclitaxel is designed to block the mechanisms of cell division in cancer cells, causing them
      to die.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you choose to take part in this study, you will receive up to 6 &quot;cycles&quot; of treatment with
      the study drugs. Each cycle is 21 days (3 weeks) long.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will receive paclitaxel and carboplatin by vein. Paclitaxel is given
      first over about 3 hours, followed by carboplatin over about 1 hour.

      On Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1, you will only receive paclitaxel by vein over about 3 hours.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2-6, you will receive paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab by vein.
      Paclitaxel is given first over about 3 hours, followed by carboplatin over about 1 hour, and
      then bevacizumab over about 1 ½ hours.

      If you tolerate your first dose of bevacizumab well, the dose of bevacizumab during Cycle 3
      may be given over 60 minutes. If you tolerate the 60 minute dose well, the bevacizumab doses
      during Cycles 4, 5, and 6 may be given over 30 minutes.

      On Days 8 and 15 of Cycles 2-6, you will only receive paclitaxel by vein over about 3 hours.

      Before you begin each treatment, you will receive the drug dexamethasone by vein to help
      decrease the risk of study drug side effects. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you
      may also receive other drugs (such as cimetidine and diphenhydramine) by vein to help prevent
      side effects such as nausea and allergic reaction.

      Study Visits:

      Before starting each cycle:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded, including a list of any drugs you may be taking.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of weight and vital signs.

        -  A pelvic exam will be performed if the study doctor thinks it is necessary.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be experiencing.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to measure levels of CA125.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is necessary, you will have a CT or MRI scan of the
           abdomen and pelvis.

      Before Cycles 2, 4, and 6 only, urine will be collected for routine tests.

      Length of Study:

      You may remain on study for up to 6 cycles. You will be taken off study early if the disease
      gets worse or you experience any intolerable side effects.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      Within 4 weeks after your last dose of study drugs, you will have an end-of-study visit, at
      which the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded, including a list of any drugs you may be taking.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of weight, vital signs, and a
           pelvic exam.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to measure levels of
           CA125.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have a CT scan or MRI scan of the abdomen and pelvis.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is necessary, you will have a chest x-ray and/or an ECG.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      After your end-of-study visit, you will have long-term follow-up visits every 3 months for 2
      years, at which the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded, including a list of any drugs you may be taking.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of weight, vital signs, and a
           pelvic exam.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to measure levels of
           CA125.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have a CT scan or MRI scan of the abdomen and pelvis.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is necessary, you will have a chest x-ray and/or an ECG.

      If you are unable to come to M. D. Anderson for your long-term follow-up visits, researchers
      will call you on the phone every 3 months for 2 years to ask you questions about how you are
      doing. Your doctor will tell you if any standard tests and procedures need to be performed.
      The phone calls should last about 10 minutes each time.

      This is an investigational study. Bevacizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel are each FDA
      approved and commercially available for the treatment of many types of cancer. The
      combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel is FDA approved and commercially available for the
      treatment of epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. At this time,
      the addition of bevacizumab to the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel is not FDA
      approved and is being used in research only.

      Up to 30 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

             tube cancer treated with surgery only are not eligible. Patients with a prior
             diagnosis of a borderline tumor that was surgically resected and who subsequently
             develop an unrelated, new invasive epithelial ovarian, peritoneal primary or fallopian
             tube cancer are eligible, provided that they have not received prior chemotherapy for
             any ovarian tumor.

          2. Patients who have received prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity
             or pelvis are excluded. Prior radiation for localized cancer of the breast, head and

          5. Patients who are currently participating or planning to participate in an experimental
             drug study other than a Genentech-sponsored bevacizumab cancer study or who are
             receiving other investigational agents.

          6. Patients with synchronous primary endometrial cancer, or a past history of primary
             endometrial cancer, are excluded, unless all of the following conditions are met:
             Stage not greater than IB; no more than superficial myometrial invasion, without

             contraindicates this protocol therapy are excluded.

          8. Patients with acute hepatitis or active infection that requires parenteral
             antibiotics.

          9. Patients with serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or untreated bone fracture. This
             includes a history of abdominal fistula or gastrointestinal perforation within 6
             months prior to Day 1. Patients with granulating incisions healing by secondary
             intention with no evidence of fascial dehiscence or infection are eligible but require
             weekly wound examinations until closure.

         10. Patients with active bleeding or pathologic conditions that carry high risk of
             bleeding, such as known bleeding disorder, coagulopathy (in the absence of therapeutic
             anticoagulation), or tumor involving major vessels.

         11. History of hemoptysis (&gt;/=1/2 teaspoon of bright red blood per episode) within 1 month
             prior to Day 1.

         12. Patients with history or evidence upon physical examination of CNS disease, including
             primary brain tumor, seizures not controlled with standard medical therapy, any brain
             metastases, or history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA, stroke), transient ischemic
             attack (TIA) or subarachnoid hemorrhage within six months of the first date of
             treatment on this study.

         13. Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease. This includes: 1)
             Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as systolic &gt; 140 mm Hg or diastolic &gt; 90 mm Hg; 2)
             Myocardial infarction or unstable angina &lt; 6 months prior to registration; 3) New York
             Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure; 4) Serious
             cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication. This does not include asymptomatic, atrial
             fibrillation with controlled ventricular rate

         14. (continued from no. 13) CTCAE Grade 2 or greater peripheral vascular disease (at least
             brief (&lt;24 hrs) episodes of ischemia managed non-surgically and without permanent
             deficit); Prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy;
             Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, requiring surgical repair or
             recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) within 6 months prior to Day 1

         15. Patients with known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or other
             recombinant human or humanized antibodies

         16. Patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of bevacizumab

         17. Patients with clinically significant proteinuria at screening as demonstrated by urine
             protein:creatinine (UPCR) ratio &gt;/= 1.0 at screening. The UPCR has been found to
             correlate directly with the amount of protein excreted in a 24 hour urine collection.
             Specifically, a UPCR of 1.0 is equivalent to 1.0 gram of protein in a 24 hour urine
             collection. Obtain at least 4 ml of a random urine sample in a sterile container (does
             not have to be a 24 hour urine). Send sample to lab with request for urine protein and
             creatinine levels [separate requests].

         18. (continued from no. 17) The lab will measure protein concentration (mg/dL) and
             creatinine concentration (mg/dL). The UPCR is derived as follows: protein
             concentration (mg/dL)/creatinine (mg/dL).

         19. Patients with or with anticipation of invasive procedures as defined below: Major
             surgical procedure within 28 days of initiating bevacizumab or major procedures
             anticipated during the course of the study. This includes, but is not limited to
             abdominal surgery (laparotomy or laparoscopy) prior to disease progression, such as
             colostomy or enterostomy reversal, interval or secondary cytoreductive surgery, or
             second look surgery.

         20. (continued from no. 19) Core biopsy or other minor surgical procedure, excluding
             placement of a vascular access device, within 7 days prior to the first date of
             bevacizumab therapy

         21. Patients with ECOG Performance Grade of 3 or 4

         22. Patients who are pregnant (positive pregnancy test) or nursing. Use of effective means
             of contraception (men and women) in subjects of child-bearing potential. To date, no
             fetal studies in animals or humans have been performed. The possibility of harm to a
             fetus is likely. Bevacizumab specifically inhibits VEGF, which is responsible for
             formation of new blood vessels during development, and antibodies can cross the
             placenta. Therefore, bevacizumab should not be administered to pregnant women.

         23. (continued from no. 22) Subjects will be apprised of the large potential risk to a
             developing fetus. It is not known whether bevacizumab is excreted in human milk.
             Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, bevacizumab should not be administered
             to nursing women. Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use contraceptive
             measures during study therapy and for at least six months after completion of
             bevacizumab therapy.

         24. Patients under the age of 18.

         25. Patients who have received prior therapy with any anti-VEGF drug, including
             bevacizumab.

         26. Patients with clinical symptoms or signs of gastrointestinal obstruction and who
             require parenteral hydration and/or nutrition.

         27. Patients with medical history or conditions not otherwise previously specified which
             in the opinion of the investigator should exclude participation in this study.

         28. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

         29. Known HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with bevacizumab. In
             addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

         30. Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.
