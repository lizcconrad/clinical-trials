      The purpose of this study is to study samples of rectal mucosa (the moist lining of the
      rectum) using a new light scattering technology, called partial wave spectroscopy (PWS) in
      patients who will undergo a standard of care colonoscopy or a flexible sigmoidoscopy and have
      a history of ulcerative colitis (UC).

      The purpose of this study is to study samples of rectal mucosa (the moist lining of the
      rectum) using a new light scattering technology, called partial wave spectroscopy (PWS)in
      patients who will undergo a colonoscopy or a flexible sigmoidoscopy and have a history of
      ulcerative colitis (UC). PWS has been recently developed to allow scientists to learn about
      any changes to the cells that may indicate a risk of developing colon cancer. We believe that
      the PWS test will more accurately detect the risk of colon cancer.
