    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to: 1) Evaluate the efficacy of CP 601,927 compared
      to placebo in the augmentation of antidepressant therapy (ADT) in patients with Major
      Depressive Disorder (MDD) using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). 2)
      Evaluate the safety and tolerability of CP 601,927 in patients with MDD on ADT.

      The study was stopped at interim analysis in August 2011, as stopping criteria for futility
      were met. There was no statistically significant change on the primary efficacy scale in
      favor of the drug. There was a very small chance that any additional data could change the
      study overall outcome. There were no concerns regarding subject safety.

    <time_frame>Week 8 (double-blind baseline ) and week 14 (week 6 of double-blind phase)</time_frame>
    <description>MADRS measures the overall severity of depressive symptoms. The MADRS had a 10-item checklist. Items are rated on a scale of 0-6, for a total numeric range of scores from 0 (depressive symptoms absent) to 60 (numerically highest level of depressive symptoms).</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 8 (double-blind baseline) through 14</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D25 is the 25-item version of a scale used to assess the range of depressive symptoms including depressed mood, work and activities, sleep, suicidal thinking, psychomotor agitation/retardation, appetite, sexual interest, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and cognitive symptoms.

    <time_frame>Weeks 8 (double-blind baseline) through 14</time_frame>
    <description>The Bech Melancholia is sum of scores on 6 items (items 1, 2, 7, 8, 10 and 13) pertaining to melancholia within HAM-D. The items are rated on a scale of 0-4, higher scores reflecting greater severity. Total possible score is 0-24.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 8 (double-blind baseline) and weeks 9, 10, 12, 14</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S was defined as 7-point clinician rated scale to assess severity of participant's current illness state; range: 1 (normal - not ill at all) to 7 (among the most extremely ill participants). Higher score = more affected.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Double-blind Baseline in Sheehan Irritability Scale (SIS) Total Score at Weeks 11 and 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 8 (double-blind baseline), 11 and 14</time_frame>
    <description>The SIS is to rate suffering with regard to irritability symptoms. The degree to which irritability interferes with work, social and family function is also queried. The total SIS score is the sum of 7 items. Each item is rated on a scale of 0-10, for a total numeric range of scores from 0 (not at all) to 70 (extremely). The SIS also records the number of days impaired by irritability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Double-blind Baseline in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Total Score at Weeks 11 and 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 8 (double-blind baseline), 11 and 14</time_frame>
    <description>SDS is defined as a self-administered tool that measures functional impairment including work/school, social life, and family life/home responsibilities. Items are rated on a scale of 0-10 visual analog scale (0=not at all impaired, 10=extremely impaired), for a total numeric range of scores from 0 (not at all impaired) to 30 (extremely impaired).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Double-blind Baseline in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Subscale Score at Weeks 11 and 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 8 (double-blind baseline), 11 and 14</time_frame>
    <description>SDS subscale is defined as a self-administered tool that measures functional impairment in 3-item including work/school, social life, and family life/home responsibilities. Items are rated on a scale of 0-10 visual analog scale, for a total numeric range of scores from 0 (not at all impaired) to 30 (extremely impaired).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) Total Score at Weeks 9, 10, 12 and 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 8 (double-blind baseline) 9, 10, 12 and 14</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-I was defined as a 7-point clinician rated scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Improvement was defined as a score of 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), or 3 (minimally improved) on the scale. Higher score = more affected.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Population Pharmacokinetics</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 11,12 and 14</time_frame>
    <description>Population pharmacokinetic analysis involved mixed effects modeling using nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM) software. The intent of this analysis was to establish a basic population pharmacokinetic model for CP-601,927 and to determine inter-individual and residual variability in population clearance, and volume of distribution of drug. Relationship of demographic variables (gender, age, body weight, height and ethnicity), concomitant medications and measures of altered hepatic and renal function were examined by fitting measured CP-601,927 concentrations</description>

    <measure>Plasma CP-601,927 Concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 11, 12 and 14</time_frame>

    <measure>The Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale (STS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 (double-blind baseline) and weeks 9 through 14</time_frame>
    <description>The Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale (STS) measures treatment-emergent suicidal ideation as well as behaviors. It can be administered by a clinician or filled in by a participant. Prior to analysis, the STS was mapped to the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment(C-CASA) categories, which has 9-item including completed suicide, suicide attempt, preparatory acts, suicidal ideation, self-injurious behavior, self-injurious no intent, unknown fatal,unknown non-fatal or other not deliberate. Participants who were mapped to C-CASA items were reported.</description>

        <description>The HAM-D25 is the 25-item version of a scale used to assess the range of depressive symptoms including depressed mood, work and activities, sleep, suicidal thinking, psychomotor agitation/retardation, appetite, sexual interest, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and cognitive symptoms. The items on the HAM-D were rated on a scale of 0-2 or 0-4, for a total numeric range of scores from 0 (depressive symptoms absent) to 72 (numerically highest level of depressive symptoms).</description>

        <title>Change From Double-blind Baseline in Sheehan Irritability Scale (SIS) Total Score at Weeks 11 and 14</title>
        <description>The SIS is to rate suffering with regard to irritability symptoms. The degree to which irritability interferes with work, social and family function is also queried. The total SIS score is the sum of 7 items. Each item is rated on a scale of 0-10, for a total numeric range of scores from 0 (not at all) to 70 (extremely). The SIS also records the number of days impaired by irritability.</description>

        <description>Population pharmacokinetic analysis involved mixed effects modeling using nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM) software. The intent of this analysis was to establish a basic population pharmacokinetic model for CP-601,927 and to determine inter-individual and residual variability in population clearance, and volume of distribution of drug. Relationship of demographic variables (gender, age, body weight, height and ethnicity), concomitant medications and measures of altered hepatic and renal function were examined by fitting measured CP-601,927 concentrations</description>

        <title>The Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale (STS)</title>
        <description>The Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale (STS) measures treatment-emergent suicidal ideation as well as behaviors. It can be administered by a clinician or filled in by a participant. Prior to analysis, the STS was mapped to the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment(C-CASA) categories, which has 9-item including completed suicide, suicide attempt, preparatory acts, suicidal ideation, self-injurious behavior, self-injurious no intent, unknown fatal,unknown non-fatal or other not deliberate. Participants who were mapped to C-CASA items were reported.</description>

        <population>The full analysis set, which was defined as the set of all participants who consumed at least one dose of randomized study medication, was applied for the analysis. n = number of participants with evaluable data at each timeframe.</population>
