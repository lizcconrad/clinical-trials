  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the immunologic noninferiority of
      Q/LAIV to FluMist in children 2 to 17 years of age.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The randomized, double-blind study was designed to demonstrate the immunologic noninferiority
      of Q/LAIV compared to FluMist in children 2-17 years by comparing the strain-specific
      post-dose geometric mean titers of hemagglutination inhibition antibodies. Children were
      randomized 3:1:1 to receive Q/LAIV or one of two FluMist vaccines. Subjects 9-17 years of age
      received a single dose, and those 2-8 years of age received two doses one month apart. Serum
      was obtained 1 month after dose 1 except in influenza vaccine-naive subjects 2-8 years old,
      when it was obtained after dose 2. Safety and tolerability were also assessed.

      <recruitment_details>A total of 2,481 participants provided written informed consent and were screened for the study. Of these, 2,312 participants were randomized into the study between 29Mar2010 to 12May2010 at 97 sites in the USA.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible participants were randomized in a 3:1:1 ratio to receive Q/LAIV, FluMist/B/Yamagata, or FluMist/B/Victoria. Randomization was stratified by age (2 to 8 years, 9 to 17 years). For subjects 2 to 8 years of age only, randomization was also stratified by previous seasonal influenza vaccination history.</pre_assignment_details>
