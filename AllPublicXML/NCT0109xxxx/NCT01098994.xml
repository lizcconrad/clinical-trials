  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the function of the good cholesterol (HDL
      cholesterol) as well as its subfractions (via NMR spectroscopy) is altered among people with
      type 1 diabetes and a variation in the Haptoglobin gene and to evaluate whether vitamin E
      supplements may improve this function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persons with type 1 diabetes are at a much greater risk for heart disease compared to the
      general population. Among individuals with diabetes, those with a specific variation in a
      genetic marker called Haptoglobin (approximately 43% of persons with type 1 diabetes) are at
      even greater risk compared to those not carrying this genetic variation. A genetic marker or
      a &quot;gene&quot; is information inherited from parents (a blueprint) about the structure and
      functions of cells in the body that make up the color of our hair and eyes and may influence
      the way our bodies respond to certain stimuli such as an illness, or infection.

      In this project we are seeking to understand what some of the mechanisms may be that put
      persons with type 1 diabetes and this variation in the Haptoglobin gene at greater risk for
      heart disease. Specifically, we will assess whether this gene variant affects the function of
      the good cholesterol (HDL cholesterol) and its subfractions (via NMR spectroscopy), which is
      thought to help against heart disease development. We also seek to evaluate whether vitamin E
      supplements may improve this function. If results indicate that vitamin E is beneficial and
      improves the function of HDL cholesterol, the next question to be answered would be whether
      vitamin E would also help reduce the risk of heart disease itself in these persons. To answer
      the latter, a large clinical trial would have to take place. In this research project we will
      therefore also evaluate whether such a trial would be feasible and whether individuals with
      type 1 diabetes would be interested in participating in a long, 4-5 year, clinical trial.
