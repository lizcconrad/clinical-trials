  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether participation in mind-body skills groups by
      veterans who have experienced a stressful war-related situation and have symptoms of
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), will improve symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety,
      reduce anger, improve quality of life, quality of sleep and result in posttraumatic growth (a
      positive change that people can experience when they have been in a traumatic situation).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized controlled study where participants will be randomly selected
      to either participate in the mind-body skills program and to answer questionnaires before and
      after the program and again 6 months later or, if they are not randomized to the mind-body
      skills group program, they will answer the questionnaires during the same time periods
      without participating in the program. Both groups will also continue their medical treatment
      as usual. The mind-body skills group intervention consists of groups of 8-10 participants.
      Two formats will be offered. (1) A 2 hour group session once a week for 10 weeks or (2)
      Weekend groups which will be run on alternating Saturdays, with a 2 hour session in the
      morning and another 2 hour session in the afternoon. The groups will be run for a total of 5
      Saturday sessions. Additional &quot;reunion&quot; groups will be held at 1 month, 3 months, and 6
      months in order to reinforce skills and to provide continuing social support.
