  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the importance of L-Arginine in the digestive tract.
      L-Arginine is an amino acid and is important in making proteins within the cell.

      The evaluation of colon tissue, blood, urine, diet, health history, and symptoms will help us
      learn more about L-Arginine and ulcerative colitis. The investigators believe these studies
      will provide new insights into the treatment for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (ulcerative
      colitis) and nutritional needs. The investigators plan to enroll 200 participants in this
      study over the next two years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amino acids are being measured in colon tissues and in serum by high performance liquid
      chromotography (HPLC). Cytokines and chemokines are being measured in colon tissues and in
      serum by Luminex assay. Cytokines and chemokines are also being measured in colon tissues by
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of mRNA expression.
