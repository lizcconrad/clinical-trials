  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is, to study the efficacy of the ketogenic diet in delaying or
      preventing recurrence and tumor growth progression of patients who have been previously
      treated by concomitant chemoradiotherapy (6 months) for high-grade glial tumors.

      It will be an open-label trial of nutritional intervention for up to 1 year. An interim
      analysis of the data will be carried out to assess safety, compliance and efficacy of the
      diet. This will be reviewed by both SHS and the Clinical trial team.
