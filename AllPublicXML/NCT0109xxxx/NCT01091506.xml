  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of L-methylfolate 15 mg/d
      supplementation in schizophrenia patients with mild or greater negative symptoms.
      L-methylfolate, a prescription medical food, is the activated form of folate required for
      conversion of homocysteine to methionine and hence is the optimal form of folate for
      supplementation, since it eliminates the need for activation by MTHFR. The purpose of this
      study is to examine the change in plasma L-methylfolate concentrations following a
      three-month trial of L-methylfolate 15 mg/d compared to placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood levels of L-methylfolate and biological activity will be evaluated by examining changes
      in plasma homocysteine concentrations, serum methionine concentrations and changes in brain
      activation as measured by fMRI.
