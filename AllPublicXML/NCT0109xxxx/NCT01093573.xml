      RATIONALE: Midostaurin may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Midostaurin may help azacitidine kill more cancer cells by making the cancer cells
      more sensitive to the drug. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and
      best dose of midostaurin when given together with azacitidine and to see how well it works in
      treating elderly patients with acute myelogenous leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safe and tolerable dose of midostaurin in combination with azacitidine in
      patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. (Phase I) II. To describe the toxicity profile of
      the combination of midostaurin and azacitidine in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia.
      (Phase I/II) III. To determine the complete and partial response rate and rate of hematologic
      improvement of midostaurin and 5-azacitidine in untreated acute myelogenous leukemia. (Phase
      I/II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe pharmacokinetics of oral midostaurin given in combination with azacitidine on
      a day 8-21 schedule. (Phase I/II) II. To correlate treatment response with FLT3 mutational
      status in a descriptive fashion. (Phase I/II) III. To assess overall survival of patients
      from initiation of midostaurin-azacitidine toxicities. (Phase I/II) IV. To determine median
      disease-free survival of the regimen in untreated patients. (Phase II)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe signaling in CD117+ committed myeloid precursors in whole blood and bone
      marrow samples before and during treatment. (Phase I/II) II. To measure in vivo FLT3
      inhibition using plasma inhibition assay (PIA) and Flt ligand (FL) levels in patients
      enrolled on this trial before and during treatment. (Phase I/II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of midostaurin followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive azacitidine intravenously (IV) over 10-20 minutes on days 1-7 and
      midostaurin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 8-21. Courses repeat every 28 days for up
      to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

        medication. They should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used
