  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with both hypertension and diabetes have a higher chance of developing heart and
      arterial problems that could be reduced with anti-coagulant therapy. Valsartan (Diovan), an
      FDA approved angiotensin-II receptor antagonist (blocker) clinically indicated for the
      treatment of essential hypertension is known to inhibit platelet activity in both an in vitro
      and ex vivo setting. Aliskiren (Tekturna) is a recently FDA-approved potent direct renin
      inhibitor which is also an effective anti-hypertensive agent in patients with
      mild-to-moderate hypertension and which, in vitro, modulates antithrombin III in plasma.
      Therefore, in addition to being clinically approved anti-hypertensive medications, combining
      these two agents will potentially target both primary hemostasis (platelets) and
      anticoagulant (antithrombin-III is a cornerstone substrate for heparin) properties to exert
      their anti-thrombotic efficacy simultaneously. This combination strategy may not only improve
      hypertension management, but also improve vascular outcomes in high-risk diabetic population
      via favorable effects on anti-thrombotic activity. Importantly, there have been no
      significant additional safety concerns of using the combination of aliskiren and valsartan.
      The investigators hypothesis is that valsartan 160 mg/daily in combination with aliskiren
      150-300 mg/daily for 4 weeks will favorably affect blood levels of
      platelet/coagulation/fibrinolytic biomarkers (ie, diminish platelet activity, and enhance
      antithrombin III potency) when compared with monotherapy with aliskiren 150mg/daily in
      hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Objectives:

      There are 2 objectives in the index study. • The primary objective is to determine how
      therapy with valsartan (160mg/daily) in combination with aliskiren (150-300mg/daily) over
      four weeks affects platelet/coagulation/fibrinolytic biomarkers in recently diagnosed
      hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, this is an exploratory study,
      our current knowledge is based on in vitro and ex vivo evidence for valsartan, but only on in
      vitro aliskiren data. There are no data on antithrombotic biomarkers currently available for
      the combination therapy.

      The secondary objective is:

      • To define whether combination therapy is superior over monotherapy with aliskiren with
      regard to the improvement of hemostatic biomarkers (platelet aggregation, expression of GP
      IIb/IIIa, and plasma levels of antithrombin-III).

      Study Design:

      This is a randomized 1:1, two arm, single-blind, single-site, parallel group, post-marketing
      comparison study of the effects on antithrombotic biomarkers of aliskiren 150-300mg/day alone
      vs combined treatment with aliskiren 150-300mg/day plus valsartan 160mg/day over a four week
      primary treatment period. An optional four week extension phase may be offered pending
      assessment of the antithrombotic biomarker assays at week four.

      Population:

      Two groups (25 patients each), for a total of 50, recently diagnosed hypertensive patients
      with previously diagnosed mild to moderate type 2 diabetes will constitute the proposed study
      population. The diagnosis of diabetes will be made based on the American Diabetes Association
      criteria, such as random plasma glucose &gt;200 mg/dL with or without symptoms of hyperglycemia
      (polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia) and weight loss, or fasting plasma glucose &gt; 126 mg/dL, to
      be determined at least twice. Patients will qualify if they are insulin-free, treated with an
      oral antiglycemic agent,(metformin only) and/or managed on diet alone for no less than 30
      days and have adequate glucose control at the time of their Screening Visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus will have been determined by the following
             Criteria, as characterized by recurrent or persistent hyperglycemia, and diagnosed by
             demonstrating any one of the following.

               -  Fasting plasma glucose level at or above 126 mg/dL but less than 250 mg/dL on
                  more than one determination.

               -  Plasma glucose at or above 200 mg/dL two hours after a 75 g oral glucose load as
                  in a glucose tolerance test.

               -  Symptoms of hyperglycemia and casual plasma glucose at or above 200 mg/dL.

               -  Glycated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1C) at or above 6.5 but below 8.5%. (This
                  criterion was recommended by the American Diabetes Association in 2010).

          2. Adults between 21 - 65 years old

          3. Have been diagnosed with Type 2 DM according to the criteria listed above, and treated
             with metformin 1-2 g/daily as their only diabetic medication, and/or an approved ADA
             diet for no less than 30 days.

          4. Documented evidence of Stage 1 or Stage 2 essential hypertension as noted below:
             However, the actual treatment threshold will be left to the discretion of the study
             investigators.

             Stage 1: systolic 140-159 mmHg and diastolic 90-99 mmHg Stage 2: systolic &gt;160 mmHg
             and diastolic &gt;100 mmHg However, there is accumulated evidence that patients with
             consistent blood pressures over 130/80 mmHg along with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, or
             kidney disease are at increased risk for progressive morbidity and mortality and

             procedure with stent placement, or other major coronary/cerebrovascular event within
             30 days.

          8. Active participation in other investigational drug or device trial within the last 30
             days.

             during the study, the anti-hypertensive treatment with either or both study
             medications will be discontinued immediately by the treating physician/investigator as
             per FDA warnings regarding potential fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality.
