  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized study aims for determination whether focused simulator based
      laparoscopic camera training in novices can improve camera performance in an actual clinical
      situations in the same manner as traditional training in the OR does, especially considering
      efficient use of training time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical students in their final years without any significant experience in handling an
      angled laparoscopic camera participate in the study and perform a camera guidance test in
      surgery. The participants are then randomized in two groups to receive either a simulator
      based or traditional in theatre training during three weeks. The camera test will be
      repeated, while both tests are going to be recorded. Videos of 14 camera tests carried out by
      laparoscopic experts are taped as well.

    <time_frame>After 3 weeks of individual training</time_frame>
    <description>Students are sent to the OR to do two camera assessment tests involving a standardized set of tasks they had to accomplish operation. They had to center and hold for 5 seconds the following positions/organs and had to maintain the correct horizontal alignment during camera movement: 1. Left abdominal wall, 2. Descending colon, 3. Right lobe of liver, 4. Sigmoid colon 5. Caecum 6. Pelvis 7. Trocar entry site in the upper left quadrant 8. Desc. Colon. This assessment was video-taped. A rating scale quantifying target centring was used.</description>
