    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study in healthy people is to investigate the safety, toleration and time
      course of UK-396,082 concentration in the blood and any changes in relevant markers of drug
      effects, following multiple doses given twice daily by mouth for 14 days.

    <description>100mg given orally twice daily for 14 days
The decision to proceed to the next higher dose will be made jointly by the Pfizer Study Team and the Investigator after careful review of available safety, tolerability and PK information from previous cohorts and dosing periods. The doses will be selected such that the predicted Cmax will not exceed 2.95 mcg/mL and/or the predicted increase in exposure will not exceed 3.5-fold that of the previously studied dose.</description>

    <description>UK-396,082 given orally, once on Days 1 &amp; 14, and twice daily on Days 3-13.
The decision to proceed to the next higher dose will be made jointly by the Study Team and the Investigator after careful review of available safety, tolerability and PK information from previous cohorts. Dependent on the emerging safety, tolerability and PK data, Cohort 4 may be recruited to study a higher (or lower) dose of UK-396,082 in order to characterize further the safety, toleration and PK and/or to define the maximum tolerated dose. The dose in Cohort 4 will be selected such that the predicted Cmax will not exceed 46 mcg/mL and/or the predicted increase in exposure will not exceed 3.5-fold that of the previously studied dose.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy subjects. (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities
             identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood
             pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  A positive urine drug screen.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement, whichever is longer) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of study
             medication.
