  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the spring of 2009, a recently emerged novel influenza A (H1N1) virus was first identified
      in Mexico and USA and it has continued to spread globally. The rapid global spread of a novel
      influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus prompted the World Health Organization (WHO), on 11 June 2009,
      to declare the first influenza pandemic in 41 years. In Taiwan, a clinical study to assess
      the immunogenicity and safety of Influenza Virus Vaccine, AdimFlu-S (A/H1N1), in healthy
      volunteers has already been completed. In the previous study, we found that a single 15 mcg
      HA dose of the AdimFlu-S (A/H1N1) vaccine induces a protective immune response in most
      adults, including those &gt; 60 years of age (&gt;70%). Our current study aims to follow-up
      subjects who received Influenza Virus Vaccine, AdimFlu-S (A/H1N1), six months ago. These
      subjects' serum samples were tested for anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies by
      hemagglutination inhibition (HAI). The seroconversion is defined as the post-vaccination
      serum HAI titer had at least 1:40 for subjects who had seronegative pre-vaccination or a
      four-fold or greater increase in HAI titers for subjects who had seropositive pre-vaccination
      serum. The immunogenicity of Influenza Virus Vaccine, AdimFlu-S (A/H1N1), in adults after
      half a year will be analyzed and discussed among the subjects with serum HAI titer had at
      least 1:40 at least 3 weeks after AdimFlu-S (A/H1N1) injection.
