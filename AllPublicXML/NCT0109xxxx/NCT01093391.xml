      Patients will be treated in compliance with the eligibility criteria, with stent study of
      16-19mm. All patients are clinically followed for 60 months after the procedure and will
      undergo a control angiography 6 months. Can be treated multiple lesions, measuring between
      2.5-3.5mm (by visual estimate). Patients enrolled will be randomized in a 1:2 propose in one
      of the groups with or without stent coating, respectively. And a randomized clinical trial,
      prospective study in 5 centers including 60 patients.

    <time_frame>6 months after the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>For an accurate assessment of the stent conditions 6 months after implantation, a follow-up catheterization will be performed at the 6-month visit in order to measure the diameter of the artery at the stented site. The objective is the lumen loss in-segment (including the portion in-stent and edges of 5 mm proximal and distal) at 6 months.</description>

    <time_frame>30 days, 6, 12 and 60 months after the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical follow-up should be performed during the index procedure at 30 days, 6, 12 and 60 months post-procedure, and should consist of an assessment of the angina status (according to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification and the Braunwald Classification for unstable angina) and major adverse cardiac events and any interventional treatment (e.g.: repeated target lesion revascularization or recurrent ischemia).</description>

    <description>Site preparation and percutaneous access should be performed as per standard hospital procedures.It is recommended to cross the target lesion with 0.014-inch exchange-length guide wire. The involved lesion should be predilated with appropriately sized balloons using standard techniques. It is strongly encouraged that the Investigators use similar materials and techniques throughout the study to maintain consistency and standardization of care.A stent consists of an endovascular prosthesis with a metallic mesh structure that is implanted at the site of the artery blockage via catheterization procedure. The objective of stenting is to obtain an angiographic appearance of the expanded stent only outside the limits of the target vessel filled with contrast medium.</description>
