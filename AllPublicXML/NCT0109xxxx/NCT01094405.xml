      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy (clinical benefit rate) of MVA
      EBNA1/LMP2 vaccine in patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma, and its impact on disease progression.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) (either at
             initial diagnosis or at recurrence).

          -  NPC associated with EBV infection, determined as:

               -  NPC occurred in association with a raised serum titre of IgA to EBV viral capsid
                  antigen (VCA) in a patient living in an area of high incidence of EBV+
                  undifferentiated NPC, or

               -  The presence of EBV has been confirmed in the tumour by immunohistochemistry for
                  EBV antigens or in situ hybridization for EBV early RNA (EBER), or

               -  NPC with persistent or recurrent disease occurs in the context of an elevated
                  circulating EBV genome level

          -  Patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic NPC that have residual EBV DNA
             following completion of conventional therapy (chemotherapy or radiotherapy).

               -  Patients with residual masses at the site(s) of previous disease that are not
                  progressing and for whom no standard therapy is currently appropriate.

               -  Patients with residual or recurrent disease that is low volume, that is causing
                  minimal or no symptoms and for whom no standard therapy is currently appropriate.

          -  Disease must be not amenable to potentially curative radiotherapy or surgery.

          -  Completion of standard therapy for malignancy at least 4 weeks before trial entry.

          -  Written informed consent and the ability of the patient to co-operate with treatment
             and follow up must be ensured and documented.

          -  Age greater than 18 years.

          -  World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Life expectancy of at least 4 months.

          -  Female patients of child-bearing potential are eligible, provided they have a negative
             pregnancy test prior to enrolment and agree to use appropriate medically approved
             contraception during the study up to six months after the last vaccination.

          -  Male patients must agree to use appropriate medically approved contraception during
             the study up to six months after the last vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or major surgery received within 4 weeks of trial entry.

          -  Known chronic active infection with Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or Human Immunodeficiency
             Virus (HIV).

          -  Current active autoimmune disease.

          -  Current active skin diseases requiring therapy (psoriasis, eczema etc).

          -  Ongoing active infection.

          -  History of anaphylaxis or severe allergy to vaccination.

          -  Allergy to eggs or egg products.

          -  Previous myeloablative therapy followed by an autologous or allogeneic haematopoietic
             stem cell transplant.

          -  Patients who have had a splenectomy or splenic irradiation, or with known splenic
             dysfunction.

          -  Receiving current immunosuppressive medication, including corticosteroids (inhaled
             steroids are acceptable).

          -  Pregnant and lactating women.

          -  Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatment. Exceptions to this are alopecia or
             certain Grade 1 toxicities which in the opinion of the Investigator should not exclude
             the patient.

          -  Patients with any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make
             the patient a good candidate for the clinical trial.
