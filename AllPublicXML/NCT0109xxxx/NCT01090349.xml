  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      St. Jude Medical developed the Merlin.net™ Patient Care Network (Merlin.net™ PCN) to augment
      or replace routine scheduled in-clinic visits.

      This investigation is designed with the hypothesis that detection of events (system integrity
      and diagnostic related) through Direct Alerts™ via Remote Monitoring allow clinicians an
      earlier opportunity to address and resolve events and may therefore improve patient care.
