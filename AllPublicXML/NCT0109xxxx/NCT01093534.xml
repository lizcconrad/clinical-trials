    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Improvement and Worsening on the 5 Dimensions of the EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The participants' quality of life was assessed using the EuroQoL 5 Dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D). The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome and is based on the following 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression. For each dimension participants were asked to select the statement which best described their health that day, from level 1 (indicating no problems) to 3 (indicating extreme problems/unable to perform).
Improvement was defined as a change from a state of being unable to perform or extreme problems at Baseline to no problems or to some or moderate problems at Week 12, and from some or moderate problems to no problems.
Worsening was defined as a change from no problems at Baseline to some or moderate problems or to a state of being unable to perform or extreme problems at Week 12, and from some or moderate problems to a state of being unable to perform or extreme problems.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Symptom Bother Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Overactive bladder symptoms were assessed using the symptom bother scale of the Overactive Bladder Symptom and Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (OAB-q). The OAB-q is a patient-administered instrument comprising an 8-item symptom bother scale and 25 health-related quality of life items (see next outcome measure). In the symptom bother scale participants were asked how much they had been bothered by selected bladder symptoms during the past 4 weeks. Each question has a 6-point Likert scale response ranging from 'not at all' (1) to 'a very great deal' (6).
The total symptom bother score was calculated from the 8 answers and then transformed to range from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating worst severity. A negative change from Baseline in symptom bother score indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life was assessed by the Overactive Bladder Symptom and Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (OAB-q). The OAB-q is a patient-administered instrument comprising of an 8-item symptom bother scale (see previous outcome measure) and 25 HRQL items comprising 4 subscales (concern, coping, social interaction and sleep) and a total HRQL score. Participants were asked how their overall bladder symptoms had affected their life in the past 4 weeks. Each of the 25 HRQL questions has a 6-point Likert scale response ranging from 'none of the time' (1) to 'all of the time' (6).
The HRQL subscale scores were calculated by summing the responses of the items within each subscale.The HRQL total score was calculated by adding the 4 HRQL subscale scores,. All scores were transformed to a scale from 0 to 100 where higher scores indicate better quality of life. A positive change from Baseline in HRQL score indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC)</title>
          <description>The PPBC scale is a global assessment tool that asks patients to rate their impression of their current bladder condition on a 6-point scale from 1: 'Does not cause me any problems at all'; 2: 'Causes me some very minor problems'; 3: 'Causes me some minor problems’; 4: 'Causes me (some) moderate problems'; 5: 'Causes me severe problems' and 6: 'Causes me many severe problems'. A negative change from Baseline score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Improvement and Worsening on the 5 Dimensions of the EQ-5D</title>
        <description>The participants’ quality of life was assessed using the EuroQoL 5 Dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D). The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome and is based on the following 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression. For each dimension participants were asked to select the statement which best described their health that day, from level 1 (indicating no problems) to 3 (indicating extreme problems/unable to perform).
Improvement was defined as a change from a state of being unable to perform or extreme problems at Baseline to no problems or to some or moderate problems at Week 12, and from some or moderate problems to no problems.
Worsening was defined as a change from no problems at Baseline to some or moderate problems or to a state of being unable to perform or extreme problems at Week 12, and from some or moderate problems to a state of being unable to perform or extreme problems.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Symptom Bother Score</title>
        <description>Overactive bladder symptoms were assessed using the symptom bother scale of the Overactive Bladder Symptom and Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (OAB-q). The OAB-q is a patient-administered instrument comprising an 8-item symptom bother scale and 25 health-related quality of life items (see next outcome measure). In the symptom bother scale participants were asked how much they had been bothered by selected bladder symptoms during the past 4 weeks. Each question has a 6-point Likert scale response ranging from 'not at all' (1) to 'a very great deal' (6).
The total symptom bother score was calculated from the 8 answers and then transformed to range from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating worst severity. A negative change from Baseline in symptom bother score indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>Health-related quality of life was assessed by the Overactive Bladder Symptom and Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (OAB-q). The OAB-q is a patient-administered instrument comprising of an 8-item symptom bother scale (see previous outcome measure) and 25 HRQL items comprising 4 subscales (concern, coping, social interaction and sleep) and a total HRQL score. Participants were asked how their overall bladder symptoms had affected their life in the past 4 weeks. Each of the 25 HRQL questions has a 6-point Likert scale response ranging from ‘none of the time’ (1) to ‘all of the time’ (6).
The HRQL subscale scores were calculated by summing the responses of the items within each subscale.The HRQL total score was calculated by adding the 4 HRQL subscale scores,. All scores were transformed to a scale from 0 to 100 where higher scores indicate better quality of life. A positive change from Baseline in HRQL score indicates improvement.</description>
