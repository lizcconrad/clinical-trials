    <textblock>
      Intra-sphincteric injection of botulinum toxin seems to be a reliable option causing
      temporary alleviation of sphincter spasm and allowing the fissure to heal. study is to
      compare the outcome of surgical sphincterotomy and botulinum toxin injection treatments in
      patients with uncomplicated chronic anal fissure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      consecutive patients with uncomplicated chronic anal fissure who had failed conservative
      treatment were randomized to receive either intra-sphincteric injection of botulinum toxin
      (BT) or lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS). Postoperative pain relief, healing of fissure,
      continence scores and fissure relapse during 18 weeks of follow up was the outcomes assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The diagnosis of chronic anal fissure was based on evidence of circumscribed ulcer at
             anal canal with indurations at the edges and exposure of the horizontal fibers of the
             internal anal sphincter at its floor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anal fissure that had been operated on before, complicated fissure with cicatricial
             deformation, large sentinel pile, associated hemorrhoids, suspected inflammatory bowel
             disease, or malignancy.
