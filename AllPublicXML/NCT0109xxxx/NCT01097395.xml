      The purpose of this study is to determine if concentration-controlled ribavirin dosing can
      achieve a targeted level of plasma exposures and if it appears safe and effective compared
      with standard weight-based ribavirin dosing. Forty, previously treatment-naive participants
      with genotype 1 disease will be randomized to receive concentration-guided or standard
      weight-based ribavirin. Peginterferon alfa 2a,ribavirin, and telaprevir will be provided
      through the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic HCV-infected men and women

          -  18-70 years

          -  HCV genotype 1

          -  Deemed ready for HCV treatment by hepatology provider and patient

          -  Allowed medications: all those not specifically listed in the exclusion criteria below
             including medications for peginterferon / ribavirin - related adverse effects:
             acetaminophen, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
             darbepoeitin, erythropoietin, GCSF

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  previous treatment with interferon, peginterferon, investigational HCV drugs,
             boceprevir, or ribavirin;

          -  baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1000/mm3,

          -  platelets &lt; 100,000/mm3,

          -  hemoglobin &lt; 12 g/dL for women and &lt; 13 g/dL for men;

          -  HIV positive serostatus;

          -  HBV positive serostatus;

             hepatic encephalopathy);

          -  autoimmune hepatitis

          -  hemoglobinopathy (e.g., sickle cell anemia, thalassemia)

          -  Cockcroft and Gault estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min;

          -  alcohol or illicit drug use that in the opinion of the investigator would interfere
