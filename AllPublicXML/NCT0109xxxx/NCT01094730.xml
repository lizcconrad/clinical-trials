    <measure>Lens Front Surface Deposits at Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluated at Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Deposits on the front surface of each lens were examined by the investigator after 7 days of lens wear, and graded on a 5-point scale; 0 = no deposit, 1 = 1%-5% deposits, 2 = 6%-15% deposits, 3 = 16%-25% deposits, and 4 = 25% or more deposits. The grades were categorized into binary variable: grade 0 or 1 Vs. grade 2 or higher.</description>

    <time_frame>Evaluated at Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Deposits on the front surface of each lens were examined by the investigator after 14 days of lens wear, and graded on a 5-point scale; 0 = 0% deposits, 1 = 1%-5% deposits, 2 = 6%-15% deposits, 3=16%-25% deposits, and 4= 25% or more deposits.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Reported Overall Lens Comfort at Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluated at Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>The overall lens comfort was assessed at Day 7 using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging)in a contact lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable /positive response. 97% of the scores fall within 0 and 120 (mean +/-3*SD).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must be at least 18 years of age and no more than 39 years of age.

          -  The subject is a current spherical soft contact lens wearer (defined as a minimum of 6
             hours of daily wear (DW) for a minimum of 1 month prior to the study) and willing to
             wear the study lenses on a daily wear basis (defined as a minimum of 6 hours of wear
             per day at least five days of the week) for the duration of the study.

          -  The subject's optimal vertexed spherical equivalent distance correction must be
             between -1.00 and - 9.00D.

          -  Any cylinder power must be â‰¤ -0.75D.

          -  The subject must have visual acuity best correctable to 20/25+3 or better for each
             eye.

          -  The subject must read and sign the Statement of Informed Consent.

          -  The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in
             this clinical protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ocular or systemic allergies or disease which might interfere with contact lens wear.

          -  Systemic disease or use of medication which might interfere with contact lens wear.

          -  Clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) corneal edema, corneal vascularization, corneal
             staining, or any other abnormalities of the cornea which would contraindicate contact
             lens wear.

          -  Clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) tarsal abnormalities or bulbar injection which
             might interfere with contact lens wear.

          -  Any ocular infection.

          -  Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact
             lens wear.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Diabetes.

          -  Infectious diseases (e.g. hepatitis, tuberculosis) or an immuno-suppressive disease
             (e.g. HIV).

          -  Habitual contact lens type is toric, multifocal, or is worn as extended wear.

        <title>Subject Reported Overall Lens Comfort at Day 7</title>
        <description>The overall lens comfort was assessed at Day 7 using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging)in a contact lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable /positive response. 97% of the scores fall within 0 and 120 (mean +/-3*SD).</description>
