      Purpose:

      The purpose of this study is to see if TBL 12, which is a blend of Sea Cucumber, Sea Sponge,
      Shark Fin, and Sea Urchin (animals that live in the Pacific Ocean) as well as Sargassum (a
      plant that lives in the Pacific Ocean), will have effects against asymptomatic multiple
      myeloma and to see what the side effects are.

      Eligibility:

      Several criteria must be met to be eligible for this study, including but not limited to the
      following:

        -  a diagnosis of asymptomatic multiple myeloma

        -  adequate cardiac, liver and kidney function

        -  age 18 and older

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is a cancer that evolves from a state known as Monoclonal Gammopathy of
      Undetermined Significance (MGUS), defined by parameters of M spike and bone marrow. After
      evolution to myeloma, patients may be asymptomatic, that is, without any endorgan disease of
      hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia or bone lesions. In asymptomatic myeloma (ASxM),
      there is no standard therapy. Thalidomide has been tried in patients with ASxM but with
      significant toxicity. The patients with ASxM are evaluable in terms of paraprotein
      measurements. TBL12 sea cucumber extract has been shown to have a number of antitumor
      properties preclinically, including antiangiogenesis and direct tumor cytotoxicity. TBL12 has
      been used by a number of patients as a food supplement without any toxicity detected. We thus
      propose to determine the clinical activity of this agent in patients with ASxM. Patients will
      be given TBL12 at the dose of 2 units of 20 mL each twice per day daily for one year and the
      effects on the paraprotein noted. Clinical effects seen will be correlated with any in vitro
      changes in angiogenesis in patient bone marrow samples. The results of this trial may form
      the basis for the use of this nontoxic agent in patients with the prodrome of or with other
      early cancers.

    <description>To determine the time to progression of asymptomatic multiple myeloma patients receiving TBL 12. The time to progression will be measured in units of a cycle (28 day cycles).
Progression is defined using the International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma (Leukemia (2006)20:1467-1473). Which requires one or more of the following: &gt;25% increase in SPEP (must also be an absolute increase of at least 5 g/dL), &gt;25% increase in UPEP (must also be an absolute increase of at least 200 mg/24 hours), &gt;25% increase in bone marrow plasma cells (must also be an absolute increase of at least 10%), new lytic bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas, or development of hypercalcemia (not attributable to any other cause).</description>

Overall response for any participants that has achieved at least a PR or better (PR, VGPR, CR, sCR) is defined using the International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma (Leukemia (2006)20:1467-1473) . Which requires the following: at least &gt;50% reduction in SPEP, at least &gt;90% reduction or &lt;200 mg in UPEP, at least &gt;50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas, no lytic bone lesions or similar definition that is accurate and appropriate.</description>
