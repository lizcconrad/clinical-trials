      The goal of this proposal is to conduct a pilot study to access the antiproteinuric effect of
      aliskiren in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy. Patients will be treated for 3
      months with aliskiren aiming to achieve the maximum tolerated dose and blood pressure (&gt;100
      but &lt;125 mmHg systolic BP &gt;75% of the readings).

      In patients with nephrotic syndrome, including patients with membranous nephropathy (MN),
      conservative therapy consists of restricting dietary protein intake, and controlling blood
      pressure (target blood pressure is ≤ 125/75 mmHg), hyperlipidemia, and edema.
      Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB)
      are effective anti-hypertensive agents that can reduce proteinuria and slow progression of
      renal disease in both diabetic and nondiabetic chronic nephropathy patients and for these
      reasons they are the preferred agents to treat hypertension in proteinuric renal diseases.

      Recent studies suggest that renin inhibition with aliskiren may be renoprotective and reduce
      proteinuria in patients with type 2 diabetes. Similar observations have also been reported in
      patients with membranous nephropathy and proteinuria in the range of 1-3 g/24h. These
      observations suggest that aliskiren may have powerful antiproteinuric. However, it is
      important to emphasize, that none of the patients in these studies had proteinuria greater
      than 3.0 g/24h. Thus, the antiproteinuric effect of aliskiren in patients with heavy
      proteinuria (e.g. &gt;4g/24h) is unknown.
