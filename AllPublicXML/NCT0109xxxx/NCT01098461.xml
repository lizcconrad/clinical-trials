    <measure>Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over a 2- to 3-month period. The Baseline HbA1c value is defined as the last non-missing value before the start of treatment. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at Week 16 minus the value at Baseline. Based on Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA): Change = treatment + Baseline HbA1c + prior therapy. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing post-Baseline on-treatment measurement was used to impute the missing measurement. If a participant had missing observation(s) immediately after Baseline, the Baseline observation was not carried forward and was left as missing.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The FPG test measures blood sugar levels after the participant has not eaten (fasted) for 12 to 14 hours. The Baseline FPG value is the last non-missing value before the start of treatment. The LOCF method was used to impute missing post-Baseline FPG values. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Mean Clearance of Albiglutide</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 12, 13, 16, 20, and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance is defined as the volume of plasma cleared of albiglutide per unit time. Samples were collected prior to the administration of study medication on dosing days (Weeks 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 12, and 13) and on the day of the clinic visit at Weeks 16, 20, and 24. At Weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, and 12, pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were collected immediately prior to dosing if a dose was scheduled for that week. At Weeks 16, 20, and 24, PK samples were collected at any time during the visit. The Week 5 post-dose PK sampling was performed any time between Weeks 4 and 6, within 2 to 5 days after administration of a dose; Week 13 post-dose PK sampling was performed any time between Weeks 12 and 14, within 2 to 5 days after administration of a dose of study medication. Modeled population PK data are presented; data were analyzed using a non-linear mixed effect modeling approach. A one-compartment PK model with first-order absorption and elimination processes was selected to describe GSK716155 PK.</description>

    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the apparent volume in which albiglutide is distributed. Samples were collected prior to the administration of study medication on dosing days (Weeks 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 12, and 13) and on the day of the clinic visit at Weeks 16, 20, and 24. At Weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, and 12, PK samples were collected immediately prior to dosing if a dose was scheduled for that week. At Weeks 16, 20, and 24, PK samples were collected at any time during the visit.

    <description>Absorption rate is defined as the rate at which albiglutide enters the blood circulation. Samples were collected prior to the administration of study medication on dosing days (Weeks 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 12, and 13) and on the day of the clinic visit at Weeks 16, 20, and 24. At Weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, and 12, PK samples were collected immediately prior to dosing if a dose was scheduled for that week.

    <measure>Mean Half-maximal Effective Concentration (EC50) of Albiglutide for HbA1c and FPG</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 12, 13, 16, 20, and 24</time_frame>
    <description>EC50 is defined as the concentration of albiglutide that give a half-maximal HbA1c and FPG response. Samples were collected prior to the administration of study medication on dosing days (Weeks 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 12, and 13) and on the day of the clinic visit at Weeks 16, 20, and 24. At Weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, and 12, PK samples were collected immediately prior to dosing if a dose was scheduled for that week. At Weeks 16, 20, and 24, PK samples were collected at any time during the visit. The Week 5 post-dose PK sampling was performed any time between Weeks 4 and 6, within 2 to 5 days after administration of a dose; Week 13 post-dose PK sampling was performed any time between Weeks 12 and 14, within 2 to 5 days after administration of a dose of study medication. EC50 estimates used PK data as well as HbA1c and FPG efficacy data. EC50 was estimated from an inhibitory Emax (maximal possible effect of albiglutide) model.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 16</title>
        <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over a 2- to 3-month period. The Baseline HbA1c value is defined as the last non-missing value before the start of treatment. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at Week 16 minus the value at Baseline. Based on Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA): Change = treatment + Baseline HbA1c + prior therapy. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing post-Baseline on-treatment measurement was used to impute the missing measurement. If a participant had missing observation(s) immediately after Baseline, the Baseline observation was not carried forward and was left as missing.</description>

        <description>The FPG test measures blood sugar levels after the participant has not eaten (fasted) for 12 to 14 hours. The Baseline FPG value is the last non-missing value before the start of treatment. The LOCF method was used to impute missing post-Baseline FPG values. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Clearance is defined as the volume of plasma cleared of albiglutide per unit time. Samples were collected prior to the administration of study medication on dosing days (Weeks 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 12, and 13) and on the day of the clinic visit at Weeks 16, 20, and 24. At Weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, and 12, pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were collected immediately prior to dosing if a dose was scheduled for that week. At Weeks 16, 20, and 24, PK samples were collected at any time during the visit. The Week 5 post-dose PK sampling was performed any time between Weeks 4 and 6, within 2 to 5 days after administration of a dose; Week 13 post-dose PK sampling was performed any time between Weeks 12 and 14, within 2 to 5 days after administration of a dose of study medication. Modeled population PK data are presented; data were analyzed using a non-linear mixed effect modeling approach. A one-compartment PK model with first-order absorption and elimination processes was selected to describe GSK716155 PK.</description>
