  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized placebo-controlled study to be conducted in two parallel study arms for
      a six month period (three doses). Approximately 10 eligible patients per center will be
      enrolled and will receive afamelanotide (16 mg implants) or placebo according to the
      following dosing regimen:

        -  Group A will be administered afamelanotide implants on Days 0, 60 and 120

        -  Group B will be administered placebo implants on Days 0, 60 and 120

      To determine eligibility for study inclusion, patients will undergo a screening evaluation 7
      to 14 days prior to the administration of the first dose. The number and severity of
      phototoxic reactions will be determined Days 60, 120, and 180. Quality of life will be
      measured every 7 days, beginning at Day 0 until Day 180. Participants will visit the clinic
      on Days 60, 120 and 180 for assessments of adverse events.

      Afamelanotide is a man-made drug being studied for use as a preventative medication for EPP
      sufferers. It is a synthetically produced analogue of human alpha melanocyte stimulating
      hormone (alpha-MSH) and is not yet available on the market.

      The purpose of this study is to look at whether afamelanotide can reduce the number and
      severity of EPP symptoms when patients are exposed to light. This study will also look at how
      the drug is tolerated when taken by people with EPP.

      The study will involve the use of an implant, which comes in the form of a small rod to be
      administered under the skin. The implant may contain the study drug afamelanotide or a
      placebo (inactive medication).

      Over 450 subjects have been treated with afamelanotide to date with no serious safety
      concerns identified. For this study, afamelanotide has been formulated as a controlled
      release depot injection (implant). This means that the afamelanotide will be released slowly
      into the body over a few days. Once inserted, the implant will remain in the body after
      afamelanotide has been released and will slowly dissolve.

      This study will help to provide more information about afamelanotide. This information will
      be used to determine the safety and efficacy (the ability of the drug to produce an effect)
      of this drug in EPP sufferers.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects with characteristic photosensitivity of EPP symptoms and
             positive diagnosis of EPP confirmed by laboratory result of elevated total
             protoporphyrin IX.

          -  Aged 18 years old and above (inclusive).
