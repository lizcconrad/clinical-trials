        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  presence of tinea pedis caused by dermatophytes on one or both feet, characterized by
             physician's global assessment score of 2 (&quot;notable signs and symptoms exist&quot;) or 3
             (&quot;prominent signs and symptoms exist&quot;) at baseline;

          -  the physical examination must be without other disease findings unless the
             investigator considers an abnormality to be irrelevant to the outcome of the study;

          -  female volunteers of childbearing potential must either be surgically sterile
             (hysterectomy or tubal ligation) or agree to use a reliable method of contraception
             with a failure rate of less than 1 % per year when used consistently and correctly
             such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intra uterine
             devices [IUDs], sexual abstinence or vasectomized partner;

          -  patients must be willing and able to comply with the requirements of the trial
             protocol;

          -  written informed consent obtained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with hyperkeratotic chronic plantar tinea pedis (moccasin type);

          -  receiving systemic therapy with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs either
             concurrently or within 12 weeks before the baseline visit;

          -  oral antifungal therapies within three months before study entry (8 months for oral
             terbinafine), systemic antibiotic or corticosteroid treatment, topical corticosteroids
             within 30 days before study entry;

          -  patients with diabetes;

          -  patients with compromised circulation;

          -  evidence of drug or alcohol abuse;

          -  pregnancy or nursing;

          -  symptoms of a clinically significant illness that may influence the outcome of the
             study in the four weeks before the treatment phase and during the study;

          -  participation in the treatment phase of another clinical study within the last four
             weeks prior to the first administration of investigational drug in this study;

          -  known allergic reactions to components of the study preparations, hypersensitivity
             against cetylstearyl alcohol;

          -  treatment with systemic or locally acting medications which might counter or influence
             the study aim within two weeks before the treatment phase of the study (e.g.
