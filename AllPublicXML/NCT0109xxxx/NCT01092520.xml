  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with healing burns often suffer from pruritus that may continue for many months.
      Pruritus can be very distressing to the child and can interfere with sleep, activities of
      daily living, and rehabilitation therapy. Additionally, constant scratching of skin grafts
      may result in damage that requires further surgery, thus putting the patient at additional
      risk and adding to health care costs. Although the size of the burn injury is a risk factor
      for pruritus, almost 50% of patients with small burn injuries reported moderate or severe
      pruritus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gabapentin has been shown to be effective for the treatment of pruritus in adult patients
      with brachioradial pruritus, uraemic pruritus and pruritus of unknown origin. Although the
      specific mechanism is unknown, the end result is the downregulation of excitatory
      neurotransmitter release and decrease in neuronal hyperexcitability.

      The primary objective of this study is evaluating the effectiveness of gabapentin in reducing
      the severity of pruritus in children with burn injuries.
