      Primary objectives: To assess the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of NP001
      compared to placebo in subjects with ALS.

      Secondary objective: To explore the effects of NP001 on biomarkers potentially relevant to
      ALS.

      This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled single ascending dose safety and
      tolerability study. Approximately 32-56 subjects with clinical diagnosis of ALS according to
      modified El Escorial criteria are planned to receive a single dose of study drug, NP001.

             ALS, according to modified El Escorial criteria.

          -  Subjects receiving riluzole must be on a stable dose for at least 30 days prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Women of childbearing age must be non-lactating and surgically sterile or using an
             effective method of birth control and have a negative pregnancy test prior to dosing
             with study medication.

             as evidenced by provision of written informed consent.

          -  Subject must be willing and able to give signed informed consent that has been
             approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB).

          -  Subjects must be willing to have an intravenous infusion.

          -  Subjects must have suitable veins for IV access as determined by examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects should not require nor are expected to require life sustaining interventions
             for the next six months or longer. (e.g. invasive ventilation).

          -  Subjects must not have:

               -  presence of a tracheotomy or invasive ventilation. Nocturnal non-invasive
                  ventilation system (e.g. C-PAP) is allowed.

               -  a diagnosis of neurologic disease known to mimic the muscle atrophy or weakness
                  seen in ALS including MS, muscular dystrophy, spinal stenosis, peripheral
                  neuropathy, inherited neuropathies or neuromuscular diseases, foramen magnum or
                  brainstem tumor, or toxic conditions.

               -  an active pulmonary disease under treatment including uncontrolled asthma,
                  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (pneumonia, bronchitis, etc.), pulmonary
                  fibrosis, pulmonary infection in the last 2 months, or history of aspiration that
                  may expose the subject to increased risk by participating in this trial as
                  determined by the Investigator.

               -  clinical laboratory parameters that are clinically significant in the opinion of
                  the Investigator.

               -  systolic blood pressure in excess of 160 mmHg nor less than 100 mmHG or a
                  diastolic blood pressure above 98 mmHg.

               -  a history of G6PD deficiency (Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency)
                  determined by subject report.

               -  a current history of hepatitis or HIV determined by subject report.

          -  Subjects must not be using systemic immunosuppressants including steroids and
             chemotherapeutic agents. Inhaled steroids, eye drops and local topical use are
             permitted with concurrence of Medical Monitor.

          -  Subjects must not have a hematologic disorder such as autoimmune anemia, or hemolytic
             anemia of any type including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria or myoglobinuria.
