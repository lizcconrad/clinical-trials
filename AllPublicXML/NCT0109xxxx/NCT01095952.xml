  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this multi-center research study is to evaluate the performance (primary purpose)
      and safety of a new algorithm aimed at controlling ventricular rate (VR) during rapidly
      conducted atrial fibrillation (AF) by delivering AV node stimulation (AVNS) from the atrial
      lead placed at a septal position, and designed with the purpose of reducing inappropriate
      shocks. Additional purposes include the assessment of a possible application of AVNS aimed at
      allowing prolonged control of VR during AF and reducing AF symptoms, and evaluation of
      implantation data on selective placement of the atrial lead in postero-septal right atrium.
      About 37 patients will be followed for half a year.
