      The purpose of this study is to study the tolerances of Extremely Low Birthweight Infants who
      are born at less than 750 grams who are started at a higher infusion rate of intravenous
      lipid emulsions (2 gm/kg/day). These infants will be compared with a control group who are at
      the standard lipid emulsion infusion rate (0.5 gm/kg/day).

      hypothesis:

      A. Objectives of this project.

      Null Hypothesis: There will not be a significant difference for Extremely Low Birth Weight
      Infants (ELBW) &lt;750 grams being able to tolerate a higher infusion rate of Intravenous Fat
      Emulsions (IVFE) within the first days of life (days 1-7) as evidenced by maintenance of a
      serum triglyceride level of 200 mg/dl or less.

      Alternative Hypothesis: There will be a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) for Extremely Low
      Birth Weight Infants (ELBW) &lt;750 grams being able to tolerate a higher infusion rate of
      Intravenous Fat Emulsions (IVFE) within the first days of life (days 1-7) as evidenced by
      maintenance of a serum triglyceride level of 200 mg/dl or less.

      ELBW infants will be randomized into either the control group or the experimental group.

      The control group will receive standardized care which consists of receiving TPN within 24 to
      36 hours of life. The control group will be given the standardized dosage of IVFE starting at
      0.5 grams/kg/day in the TPN and have IVFE advanced daily by 0.5 grams/kg/day until a goal
      rate of 3 grams/kg/day is achieved. The experimental group will receive TPN within 24 to 36
      hours of life. For these infants, IVFE will begin at 2 grams/kg/day. For the experimental
      group, Intralipid will be increased by 0.5 grams/kg/day until a goal rate of 3 grams/kg/day
      is achieved.

      An informed consent form (Appendix A), to be signed by the parent or guardian, will be
      obtained for all infants before they are enrolled into this study. Assent waiver is requested
      on the study participants because they are infants.

      All infants enrolled in this study will have their laboratory data monitored at least daily
      during the first week of life. A baseline triglyceride will be drawn prior to beginning TPN
      to verify that their serum triglyceride levels are &lt;200 gm/dl. This will include a daily
      lipid profile panel used to evaluate the serum triglyceride levels and the tolerance of the
      two different IVFE infusion rates. Lipid tolerance will be defined as infants having a serum
      triglyceride levels at &lt; 200 mg/dl. Lipid intolerance will be defined as infants having a
      serum triglyceride of 201 mg/dl or greater. If lipid intolerance occurs, IVFE will be
      decreased by the following standard of care:

      Serum Triglycerides Levels Changes Intralipid in TPN by:

      150-200 mg/dl Keep at current IVFE order 201-249 mg/dl decrease by 1 grams/kg/day 250-299
      mg/dl decrease by 1.5 gram/kg/day 300 mg/dl or greater Reduce Intralipid to 0.5 grams/kg/day
      to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD). If hypertriglyceridemia persists (300
      mg/dlor greater) over 24 hours keep IVFE at 0.5 gm/kg/day to prevent EFAD.

      The total caloric intake will be calculated and collected daily for both groups. The calorie
      intake will be specified as total kilocalories per kilogram (kcal/kg/day). The goal calorie
      intake for both groups will be 90 kcal/kg/day. The kcal/kg index will be calculated by a
      Registered Dietitian, who is assigned to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.

      All collected data will be presented as a mean +/- SD. The statistical significance will be
      defined by a p value &lt; 0.05.
