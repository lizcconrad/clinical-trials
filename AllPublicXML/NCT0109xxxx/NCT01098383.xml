  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose a study which will combine multiple modalities in evaluating the treatment
      response of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) to acetyl-choline esterase (AChE)
      inhibitors and choline supplements. The primary objective of the study is to examine the
      efficacy of this treatment in improving core autistic symptoms. The Secondary objective of
      the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the treatment protocol in ASD
      children. Exploratory objectives include evaluation of the influence of the treatment on
      linguistic performance, comorbid behaviors, adaptive functioning and executive functions.

    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a group of developmental disorders of brain function
      resulting in a distinct phenotype, most probably related to many specific causes. Individuals
      with a disorder in the autism spectrum are a heterogeneous group of patients with early
      childhood onset of deficits in social interaction, communication and language, and repetitive
      and stereotypic behaviors. ASD has become increasingly prevalent during the last few decades
      (Wiznitzer, 2005).

      The neuro-anatomical substrate of ASD has been the subject of intense investigation, but
      current findings are inconclusive, limited and sometimes even contradictory.

      Medical treatment of autism is still a matter of dispute. Medications used are mainly aimed
      to treat the comorbid symptoms, such as epilepsy, tics, obsessive-compulsive or hyperactive
      behaviors (Wiznitzer, 2005). Although many efforts were invested in establishing a model of
      autistic pathophysiology, no such model is currently accepted, and there is no evidence for
      an efficient treatment of the core autistic symptoms (Wiznitzer, 2005).

      Previous studies indicate that many brain systems are involved in the expression of autism.
      Specifically, it has been suggested that autism involves neurotransmitter dysregulations (Lam
      et al, 2006). A recent investigation of the cholinergic system in autism, detailed below, has
      provided promising findings. Our study aims to assess the clinical outcomes associated with
      cholinergic manipulations using pharmacological agents and nutritional supplements. The study
      approved by the Helsinki committee for clinical research.

    <description>Donepezil will be used at initial dose of 2.5 mg/day (during the first two weeks), and an increased dose of 5 mg/day (from the 3rd week and on), according to the treatment protocol listed below. The tablets will be taken during breakfast.
AChE inhibitors are considered as potent agents for clinical use in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's dementias (Wevers &amp; Schroder, 1999) and treatment with these agents was proven to be well-tolerated, safe and effective in these populations. Cholinergic side effects are generally transient, mild and dose-related, and primarily include diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Choline tablets will be taken at daily doses of 250 mg (in children with up to 40 kg body weight) and 500 mg (in children with more than 40 kg body weight), based on half of the adult daily dose.</description>
