  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the TOPAS System effectively treats fecal
      incontinence in women as measured by a 50% reduction in the number of FI episodes in a 14 day
      bowel diary at 12 months.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, open-label, two- stage, adaptive study
      conducted to obtain data to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the TOPAS system for
      the treatment of FI in women who have failed conservative therapy. It was approved by the FDA
      for up to 152 implanted subjects at up to 15 investigational sites in the US. Eight study
      centers are led by a Colorectal Surgeon and seven centers are led by an Urogynecologist.

      This study is being conducted in compliance with Title 21 CFR Parts 11, 50, 54, 56, and 812;
      the principles of GCP as set forth in the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki
      (2008); and the ISO standard 14155:2011 (Clinical investigation of medical devices for human
      subjects - Good clinical practice).

Short forms of two condition-specific quality-of-life questionnaires for women with pelvic floor disorders (PFDI-20 and PFIQ-7. Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2005 Jul;193(1):103-13).
The short-form version of the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory has a total of 20 questions and 3 scales (Urinary Distress Inventory, Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory, and Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory). Total PFDI score measured on a 0-300 scale with higher scores equal to greater pelvic floor distress. As with the Total PFDI Score, higher subscale scores equal greater pelvic floor distress, on a 0-100 scale.</description>

The short-form version of the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire has a total of 7 questions and 3 scales (Urinary Impact, Pelvic Organ Prolapse Impact, and Colorectal-Anal Impact). Total PFIQ score measured on a 0-300 scale with higher scores equal to greater pelvic floor impact. Subscales scored on 0-100 scale and the higher the score the greater pelvic floor impact, exactly like the Total PFIQ score.</description>

Short forms of two condition-specific quality-of-life questionnaires for women with pelvic floor disorders (PFDI-20 and PFIQ-7. Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2005 Jul;193(1):103-13).
The short-form version of the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory has a total of 20 questions and 3 scales (Urinary Distress Inventory, Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory, and Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory). Total PFDI score measured on a 0-300 scale with higher scores equal to greater pelvic floor distress. As with the Total PFDI Score, higher subscale scores equal greater pelvic floor distress, on a 0-100 scale.</description>

        <description>Short-form version of the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ-7) as described by Barber et al., 2005 (Barber MD, Walters MD, Bump RC. Short forms of two condition-specific quality-of-life questionnaires for women with pelvic floor disorders (PFDI-20 and PFIQ-7. Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2005 Jul;193(1):103-13).
The short-form version of the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire has a total of 7 questions and 3 scales (Urinary Impact, Pelvic Organ Prolapse Impact, and Colorectal-Anal Impact). Total PFIQ score measured on a 0-300 scale with higher scores equal to greater pelvic floor impact. Subscales scored on 0-100 scale and the higher the score the greater pelvic floor impact, exactly like the Total PFIQ score.</description>
