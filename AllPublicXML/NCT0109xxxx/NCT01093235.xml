      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, fluorouracil, epirubicin
      hydrochloride, and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one
      drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing
      substances to them. It is not yet known whether giving combination chemotherapy together with
      or without bevacizumab is more effective in treating patients with nonmetastatic breast
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy
      works compared with giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab in treating
      patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To compare the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy comprising docetaxel, fluorouracil,
           epirubicin hydrochloride, and cyclophosphamide with versus without bevacizumab in
           patients with HER2-negative nonmetastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To assess quality of life of female patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (≤ 50 years
      old vs &gt; 50 years old), estrogen receptor status (negative [Allred score 0-2] vs weakly
      positive [Allred score 3-5] vs strongly positive [Allred score 6-8]), total tumor size* (≤ 50
      mm vs &gt; 50 mm), clinical involvement of axillary nodes (yes vs no), and inflammatory/locally
      advanced disease (T4) (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      NOTE: *In cases with multifocal disease in one breast, or bilateral disease, the size to be
      used for the stratification is the sum of the single largest diameter of all measurable
      tumors.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV on day 1; treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3
           courses. Patients then receive fluorouracil IV, epirubicin hydrochloride IV, and
           cyclophosphamide IV on day 1 (FEC). Treatment with fluorouracil, epirubicin
           hydrochloride, and cyclophosphamide repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30 to 90 minutes and docetaxel IV on day 1;
           treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses. Patients then receive FEC as in arm I.
           Treatment with FEC repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses. Patients also receive
           bevacizumab IV over 30 to 90 minutes and docetaxel IV on day 1 in FEC course 1 only.

      Within 3-6 weeks after completion of last dose of study therapy, patients in both arms
      undergo surgery. Within 4-8 weeks after surgery, patients undergo radiotherapy according to
      standard protocol.

      Women complete quality-of-life questionnaires (FACT-B and EuroQoL) at baseline and during and
      after completion of study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and
      then annually for 3 years.
