        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is informed and given ample time and opportunity to think about her/his

          -  Subject either:

               1. is currently taking no more than 3 mg/24 h Rotigotine for Idiopathic Restless

                  disease, 8 mg/24 h Rotigotine for advanced stage Parkinson's disease (ie, treated
                  with concomitant l-dopa) and has tried and failed an adequate course of another
                  dopamine agonist, with failure defined as either suboptimal control of symptoms
                  or the development of intolerable Adverse Events (AEs) (eg, hallucinations), or

               2. is not taking Rotigotine but has previously demonstrated an adequate response
                  following an appropriate course of treatment with another dopamine agonist or
                  l-dopa, based on the investigator's assessment and has tried and failed an
                  adequate course of another dopamine agonist, or

               3. has completed participation in UCB Rotigotine clinical trial SP0934, SP1055, or
