  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this pilot study is to define the role of dedicated cone beam breast
      computed tomography in breast cancer imaging. This research is a prelude of a more
      comprehensive clinical trial that may follow.

    <description>There are two specific aims of this pilot study. One specific aim is to determine if the lesions that are detected by mammography and referred for biopsy, are visible with breast CT. The other specific aim is to determine if there is a correlation between CT numbers and malignancy, in particular for soft tissue (solid masses) abnormalities and to determine if image processing techniques improve correlation between CT numbers and malignancy.</description>
