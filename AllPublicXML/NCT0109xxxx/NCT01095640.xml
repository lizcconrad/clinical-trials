             informed consent. Patients between the ages of 12 to 17 years of age must have
             provided IRB approved written assent; this written assent must be accompanied by an
             IRB approved written informed consent from the patient's legally acceptable
             representative (i.e., parent or guardian). In addition, all patients or their legally
             acceptable representatives (i.e., parent or guardian) must sign a HIPAA authorization,
             if applicable

          3. Patients must have a definite clinical diagnosis of acne vulgaris of mild to moderate
             severity (Grade 2 or Grade 3 on the IGE).

          4. Patients must have a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 60 facial inflammatory lesions at
             baseline. Patients must also have a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 75 facial comedones
             at baseline. Patients may have no more than one (1) nodulo-cystic lesion at baseline.
             For the purposes of study treatment and evaluation, these lesions should be limited to
             the facial treatment area. Lesions involving the eyes, angles of the nose (i.e., the
             lines around your nostrils and under the nostrils) and scalp should be excluded from
             the count. Patients may have acne lesions on other areas of the body (e.g., on the
             back).

          5. Female patients of childbearing potential must have been using and must agree to
             continue to practice abstinence or use accepted methods of birth control, from 30 days
             prior to study entry to 30 days after the last administration of study drug. All
             female patients are considered to be of childbearing potential unless they have been
             surgically sterilized or have been postmenopausal for at least 1 year. Abstinence is
             an acceptable method of birth control. Alternatively, any of the following methods of
             birth control are acceptable: oral contraceptives, contraceptive patches/implants
             (e.g., Norplant®) Depo-Provera®, double barrier methods (e.g., condom and spermicide)
             or IUD. Female patients must have a negative urine pregnancy test at baseline.

          6. All male patients must agree to use accepted methods of birth control with their
             partners, from the day of the first dose administration to 30 days after the last
             administration of study drug. Abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control.
             Alternatively, any of the following methods of birth control are acceptable: oral
             contraceptives, contraceptive patches/implants (e.g., Norplant®), Depo-Provera®,
             double barrier methods (e.g., condom and spermicide) or IUD.

          7. Patients must be willing and able to understand and comply with the requirements of
             the protocol, including attendance at the required study visits.

          8. Patients must be willing to refrain from using any treatments for acne vulgaris, other
             than the investigational product, for acne present on the face. Patients may use other
             topical acne treatments that do not have significant or measurable systemic absorption
             for treatment of acne of the back, shoulders and chest (e.g., benzoyl peroxide,
             salicylic acid).

          9. Patients must be in good health and free from any clinically significant disease,
             including but not limited to, conditions that may interfere with the evaluation of
             acne vulgaris. Such conditions include, but are not limited to the following: rosacea;
             seborrheic dermatitis; perioral dermatitis; corticosteroid-induced acne; carcinoid
             syndrome; mastocytosis; acneiform eruptions caused by make-up, medication, facial
             psoriasis and facial eczema.

             period of 14 days prior to study entry and must agree to not change make-up brand/type
