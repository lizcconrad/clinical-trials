  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, continuous wound infiltration systems have been introduced to treat a
      variety of post-surgical pain. These systems, commonly referred to pain pumps by patients,
      possess a catheter(s) attached to a reservoir of local anesthetic that directly infuses into
      the surgical site to provide local pain control thus avoiding the common and less desirable
      systemic effects of oral narcotic pain medication. Due to its portability, another benefit
      associated with these wound infiltration systems is its use as an outpatient pain control
      modality. Despite the apparent benefits, the verdict on the system's effectiveness in
      treating pain - throughout a variety of surgical fields - varies between very effective in
      reducing post-operative pain and reducing overall narcotic consumption for several days to
      completely ineffective with no reported changes in perceived pain or overall narcotic use.

      Through a randomized trial comparing plain saline to a common local anesthetic, The
      investigators hope to evaluate the effectiveness of these pain pumps as an outpatient
      modality for pain management following hemorrhoidectomy patients. The investigators
      hypothesize that there will be a significant benefit in pain relief with the use of these
      pumps.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients scheduled for hemorrhoidectomies at NMCP

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient with co-existing active purulent infection (i.e. abscess).

          -  Any patient who has had previous surgical intervention for his/her hemorrhoidal
             disease. Previous simple incision to treat a thrombosed hemorrhoid is not considered a
             surgical intervention for the purposes of this study. The minimal scar produced by a
             small incision would not alter post-operative pain following removal of a hemorrhoidal
             column.

          -  Any patient allergic to local anesthetics or oral pain medications

          -  Any patient with a history of chronic pain

          -  Any patient allergic to or has had an adverse reaction (i.e. history of
             gastrointestinal bleed) to a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

          -  Any patient pregnant patient
