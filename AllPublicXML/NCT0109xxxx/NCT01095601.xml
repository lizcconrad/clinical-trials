  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of avanafil (Formulation
      II); determine the relative bioavailability of two avanafil tablet formulations (Formulation
      I versus Formulation II) and will investigate the dose-proportionality of Formulation II
      avanafil tablet.

      In this Phase I, single-centre, open-label, randomized, four-period crossover study, each
      eligible subject will be randomized to receive the 4 treatments in a 4-way crossover fashion.
      The 4 treatments are as follows:

        -  Treatment A: 2x100 mg Formulation II avanafil tablet, fasted

        -  Treatment B: 2x100 mg Formulation II avanafil tablet, fed

        -  Treatment C: 2x100 mg Formulation I avanafil tablet, fasted

        -  Treatment D: 1x50 mg Formulation II avanafil tablet, fasted Subjects will report to the
           study site on the evening before each treatment and will remain at the site until the
           24-hour PK sample has been drawn. A single oral dose of avanafil tablets will be
           administered with 240 mL of water. A washout period of at least 5 days will occur
           between the treatments. Subjects in treatment groups A, C and D will fast at least 10
           hours prior to and for at least 4 hours following dosing. Subjects in treatment group B
           will eat a standardized high fat breakfast 30 prior to dosing. Standard meals will be
           provided uniformly to all subjects at approximately 4 and 9 hours after dosing, and an
           evening snack will be provided approximately 12 - 13 hours after dosing. Blood samples
           for the determination of plasma avanafil and its metabolite concentrations will be
           obtained from each subject at 0 (30 minutes pre-dose), 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2,
           3, 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 hours post-dose in each treatment period.

      Adverse events; laboratory evaluations; color vision testing (Treatment A only),
      electrocardiogram and physical examination, vital signs will be assessed at various times
      during the study.
