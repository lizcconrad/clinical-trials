  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults with schizophrenia are a growing segment of the population yet their physical
      health status is poor. In order to design effective interventions, the contributing factors
      must be understood. Current data suggest the side effects of psychiatric medications,
      sociodemographic factors, and health care disparities are a few of the reasons for the poor
      physical health. There are only limited data on the impact of psychiatric symptomatology and
      neurocognition on the physical health of this population. These limited data indicate that
      worse symptomatology and poorer neurocognition may negatively impact physical functioning, a
      critical component to optimal physical health. The purpose of this pilot study is to begin to
      fill this knowledge gap by: 1. examining the relationship between neurocognitive function and
      physical function and 2. Examining the relationship between schizophrenia symptoms and
      physical function. 3. Examining the relationship between serum Brain Derived Neurotrophic
      Factor (BDNF) and physical function. Using a descriptive correlational design, 50 older
      adults (55+) with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder will be assessed. Bivariate
      associations will be used to examine the relationship between key variables including
      schizophrenia symptoms as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS),
      neurocognitive function as measured with the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB),
      Physical Function as measured objectively by the Timed Get Up and Go (TGUG) test and
      subjectively with the physical component summary subscale of the 12-item short form health
      survey (SF-12), and serum BDNF. These pilot data will lay the foundation for a future health
      promoting intervention.
