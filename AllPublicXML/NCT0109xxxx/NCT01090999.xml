      OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a long-term maintenance program after respiratory
      rehabilitation, in contrast to the usual minimal maintenance therapy, improves the
      cost-effectiveness through: a.- maintaining long term effects in terms of effort capacity,
      HRQL, and reduced exacerbations b.- reducing the total cost of care to patients, largely
      through reduction of exacerbations.

      MATERIAL AND METHODS: multi-center (4 hospitals) prospective randomized controlled study that
      will include 150 patients with moderate-severe COPD (age &lt;75; BODE 4-10) with a 3 years
      follow-up. All patients will receive an initial in-hospital rehabilitation program which
      includes: Education, Physiotherapy, lower and upper extremities training and respiratory
      muscles training. Following completion of this program, patients will undergo concealed
      randomization to one of two maintenance strategies:1.-an intensive maintenance program (GR1)
      2.- a standard, minimal monitoring program (GR2). On the intensive maintenance program (GR1)
      the physiotherapist will call once a week as a reminder and the patient will attend the
      hospital once a week . A physiotherapist will supervise the weekly in-hospital exercise and
      he/she will check if the patient is properly undergoing the rehabilitation treatment.

      OUTCOMES: 1.- Clinical: dyspnea (area of CRQ questionnaire), HRQL (CRQ, SF 36); Effort
      capacity (6minute Walking Test), BODE index; 2.- Economical: direct costs (programs);
      indirect costs (exacerbations, admissions); comparison of GR1 and GR2 costs; EXPECTED
      OUTCOMES: reduction of dyspnea, improvement of HRQL, effort capacity and BODE index, and
      reduction of health expenditures in GR1 compared to GR2.
