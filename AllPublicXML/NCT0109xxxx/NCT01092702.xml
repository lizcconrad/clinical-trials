  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to explore the potential effectiveness of varenicline to treat
      tobacco dependence among recovering alcoholic smokers who, as a group, are at high risk for
      tobacco-caused morbidity and mortality. In this open-label phase II clinical trial, we are
      proposing to enroll 32 recovering alcoholic smokers who are motivated to stop smoking. After
      the initial up titration of varenicline in week 1, all 32 subjects will receive a total of 2
      mg/day of varenicline for 12 weeks. In addition to receiving varenicline, all subjects will
      receive brief behavioral counseling and our standard intervention at each visit during
      participation in the study.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase II clinical trial. All subjects will be screened for study
      eligibility after providing informed consent. During the clinic screen visit the subjects are
      informed of the study, the study informed consent is signed by the subject and staff member,
      a series of screening tests are conducted and screening criteria are reviewed. Once enrolled
      in study, the subject will return for a face to face clinic visit weekly for the first 4
      weeks (visits 3-6) and then biweekly for the last 8 weeks(visits 7-10). Target quit day is
      the day after visit 3 (week 1 visit).

      During the first week varenicline will be started at a dose of 0.5 mg once daily for days
      1-3; then 0.5 mg twice daily for days 4-7. Target quit date is set at day 8. Varenicline is
      then continued for weeks 2-12 at a dose of 1 mg twice daily.

      Subjects will return weekly for 4 weeks then bi-weekly for the remaining 8 weeks. The study
      end-date will be Week 12, which is also the end-of-treatment date.

    <description>The primary endpoint of this trial is biochemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence at the end of the medication phase (week 12). Self-reported abstinence from smoking (not even a puff) over the last 7-days will be considered biochemically confirmed by an expired air CO of &lt;8 ppm. Subjects who discontinue the study or have a missed visit for any reason will be classified as smoking for that visit.</description>

        <description>The primary endpoint of this trial is biochemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence at the end of the medication phase (week 12). Self-reported abstinence from smoking (not even a puff) over the last 7-days will be considered biochemically confirmed by an expired air CO of &lt;8 ppm. Subjects who discontinue the study or have a missed visit for any reason will be classified as smoking for that visit.</description>
