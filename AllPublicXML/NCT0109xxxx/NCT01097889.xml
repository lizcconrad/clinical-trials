  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supplementary feeding programs for children with moderate acute malnutrition have been
      implemented in developing countries using treatment foods with minimal or no evidence of
      their effectiveness. Fortified peanut paste is a popular new treatment food for children with
      severe and moderate malnutrition.

      Objectives: To investigate the relative effectiveness of two non-identical therapeutic foods
      in children with moderate malnutrition by comparing differences in performance indicators
      (i.e. recovery rates), recovery times, and change in weight-for-height z-scores in each
      group.

      This proposed research project will evaluate the relative effectiveness of two non-identical
      treatment foods for the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition in children

      This research protocol will be embedded as a component of the UN World Food Programme (WFP)
      -supported Supplementary Feeding programmes in Ethiopia. The proposed study is a prospective
      cluster-randomized equivalence trial that will compare the relative effectiveness of two
      feeding interventions in four woredas (districts). Research will be implemented in two
      comparable woredas (one with CSB and one with RUSF), in two different areas in Sidama zone
      that represent different livelihood zones, main source of crop income, and level of food
      insecurity

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All children 6 to 60 months of age who are identified as malnourished based on MUAC
             measurements with WFH ≥70 to &lt;80%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with WFH &lt; 70% or presenting with bilateral pitting oedema (they will be
             referred to therapeutic feeding programme).

          -  Children with any illness or clinical condition that prevents them from safely
             ingesting either supplementary foods. A child is medically assessed upon admission for
             any complicated clinical condition (oedema, malaria, vomiting, chronic diarrhea,
             infections, appetite, etc) that would require medical care and those children will be
             referred to the therapeutic feeding programme.

          -  All children transferred from the therapeutic feeding programme directly into the
             supplementary feeding programme - however they will not be included in the research
             study.

          -  Children with WFH &gt; 80% but MUAC 110 to 120 mm- they will be admitted to SFP however
             will not be included in the research study.
