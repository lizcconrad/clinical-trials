      Background and Objectives: Neuraxial administration of morphine is an effective way of
      controlling postoperative pain and reducing analgesic consumption. Several animal models have
      demonstrated that preemptive administration of neuraxial narcotics reduced pain while others
      revealed the induction of post-incisional hypersensitivity. There have been no consistent
      results in clinical setting either. This double blind, randomized study compared the effects
      of PRE- vs. POST-incisional administration of neuraxial morphine on postoperative pain
      perception and analgesic requirements over 48 hours following laparotomy for open colectomy
      under standardized general anesthesia.

      Methods: Twenty patients received epidural morphine (3 mg) pre-incision and saline after
      wound closure (MO1 group), and 20 patients received epidural saline before incision and
      morphine after wound closure (MO2 group). Postoperatively, all patients received boluses of
      morphine (1.5 mg) via intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA), and rescue doses of
      intramuscular diclofenac (75 mg) every 6 hours, as needed.

    <description>On the day of surgery, patients were brought to the operating room (OR) where routine monitors were placed and an epidural catheter was inserted at the level of L3-4 to a distance of 10 cm. All patients received two injections via the catheter: one injection contained 3 mg morphine (MO), and the other contained normal saline (NS) of the same volume. Patients were randomized to receive either NS preoperatively and MO postoperatively or vice versa. The first injection was administered 40 minutes before initiation of surgery, and the second one was given 15 minutes after surgery ended. All epidural catheters were removed before the patients were discharged from the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).</description>
