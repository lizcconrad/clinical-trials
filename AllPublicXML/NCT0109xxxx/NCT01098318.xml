    <textblock>
      Prior research has shown that Rhodiola rosea may be an effective, short-term, anti-depressant
      therapy. This study will examine the anti-depressant effect of Rhodiola rosea vs. a
      conventional, anti-depressant drug in the treatment of major depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will study the antidepressant action of R. rosea in patients with MDD. Depression affects
      more than a billion people world wide, and is now recognized as one of the most disabling
      medical conditions. It accounts for more than 11% of the total disease burden worldwide, and
      can result in devastating consequences and functional impairment exceeded only by that of
      cancer and cardiovascular disease. It results in substantial social, occupational, and
      personal disability and in increased medical co-morbidity and death by suicide. It is
      considered to be a multi-systemic disorder characterized by neurotransmitter, neuroendocrine,
      immunologic, and autonomic, and infectious disturbances. Although the development of
      antidepressant drug therapy has simplified the treatment of MDD, a substantial segment of the
      world's population remains untreated for economic, cultural, or personal reasons. As a
      result, many individuals seek CAM for relief of their symptoms. The identification of
      effective CAM therapies for MDD is of public health relevance. R. rosea belongs to the family
      Crassulaceae, and has a long history as a folk remedy for enhancing physical and emotional
      endurance. Its adaptogen, or preventive, properties have also led to its use in treating
      cancer, infection, depression, and other nervous system disorders. Several animal and human
      studies suggest that R. rosea may have antidepressant properties. For specific aim #1, we
      will ask: Is R. rosea a safe and effective short-term therapy (vs. sertraline and placebo)
      for patients with MDD?&quot; To answer this question, patients meeting DSM IV criteria for mild to
      moderate MDD will be enrolled in a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel group, dose-escalation study of R. rosea extract 340-1,360 mg daily vs. sertraline
      50-200 mg daily. The primary outcome measure will be change over time in the 17-item Hamilton
      Depression Rating score. We hypothesize that R. rosea will have superior efficacy vs. placebo
      and comparable efficacy vs. sertraline. For specific aim #2, we will ask: Does R. rosea
      therapy result in a favorable tolerability and quality of life (QOL) profile vs. sertraline
      and placebo? To answer this question, we will obtain safety and QOL measures across treatment
      conditions that include: (i) frequency, duration, and severity of adverse events, (ii)
      frequency of serious adverse events, (iii) frequency of dosage reduction, (iv) frequency of
      treatment discontinuation, and (v) QOL and sexual performance measures. We hypothesize that
      R. rosea will have a superior tolerability profile vs. sertraline, and similar tolerability
      vs. placebo. We further hypothesize that R. rosea will have superior QOL and sexual
      performance ratings vs. sertraline and placebo. Results from this study will be used to
      inform future research hypotheses and to estimate the effect size necessary to power a
      future, large scale study.

    <measure>Depressive Symptoms as Measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (17-items) at Week 8 and Week 12.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) is a validated, clinician-rated instrument for ascertaining the severity of MDD symptoms. The 28-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was used to determine the primary outcome of 17-item HAM-D score. The HAM-D will serves as the primary outcome measure. HAM-D17 score ranges from 0 to 68. Higher score indicates more depressed symptom.</description>

    <measure>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity and Change</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A clinician-rated measure of global symptom severity (CGI/S) and symptom change (CGI/C) of MDD. Severity was rated as &quot;Not ill&quot;; &quot;Borderline ill&quot;; &quot;Mild&quot;; &quot;Moderate&quot;; &quot;Moderately severe&quot;; &quot;Severe&quot; and &quot;Extremely severe&quot;. Global change was rates as &quot;Very much improved&quot;; &quot;Much improved&quot;; &quot;Minimally improved&quot;; &quot;Unchanged&quot;;&quot;Minimally worse&quot;;&quot;Much worse&quot; and &quot;Very much worse&quot;. Here in severity, we reported the N(%) of subjects who were not ill or borderline ill. In change, we reported N(%) of subjects who were &quot;Very much improved&quot; or &quot;Much imp[roved&quot;.Subjects started the study with mild to moderate MDD (moderate or above rating in the CGI-S). At WK12, the #/% of subjects in each treatment group who were not ill at WK12 (CGI-S) and who had much improved or very much improved at WK12 (CGI-C) was reported.</description>

    <measure>Change in Depressive Symptoms as Measured by the Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>All enrolled subjects were analyzed. Mean change in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) total scores were reported. BDI is a self-reported outcome measuring the severity of depression. A negative # means a reduction in BDI score at the end of treatment compared to baseline which represents an improvement in depression symptoms. BDI total score ranges from 0-63. BDI score of 1-16 represents low level of depression;17-30 represents moderate level of depression; &gt;=31 represents significant level of depression. A reduction in the BDI score represents improvement in the depression symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Sexual Function</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a patient completed rating of sexual function and satisfaction. It is used to assess current sexual health and changes in sexual health over time measured by the overall sexual satisfaction score. The reported score is the overall degree of sexual satisfaction attained. The score ranges from 0 to 100. Higher score indicates more sexual satisfaction.</description>

The 28-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was used to determine the primary outcome of 17-item HAM-D score. The HAM-D will serves as the primary outcome measure. HAM-D17 score ranges from 0 to 68. Higher score indicates more depressed symptom.</description>

        <description>A clinician-rated measure of global symptom severity (CGI/S) and symptom change (CGI/C) of MDD. Severity was rated as &quot;Not ill&quot;; &quot;Borderline ill&quot;; &quot;Mild&quot;; &quot;Moderate&quot;; &quot;Moderately severe&quot;; &quot;Severe&quot; and &quot;Extremely severe&quot;. Global change was rates as &quot;Very much improved&quot;; &quot;Much improved&quot;; &quot;Minimally improved&quot;; &quot;Unchanged&quot;;&quot;Minimally worse&quot;;&quot;Much worse&quot; and &quot;Very much worse&quot;. Here in severity, we reported the N(%) of subjects who were not ill or borderline ill. In change, we reported N(%) of subjects who were &quot;Very much improved&quot; or &quot;Much imp[roved&quot;.Subjects started the study with mild to moderate MDD (moderate or above rating in the CGI-S). At WK12, the #/% of subjects in each treatment group who were not ill at WK12 (CGI-S) and who had much improved or very much improved at WK12 (CGI-C) was reported.</description>

        <description>All enrolled subjects were analyzed. Mean change in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) total scores were reported. BDI is a self-reported outcome measuring the severity of depression. A negative # means a reduction in BDI score at the end of treatment compared to baseline which represents an improvement in depression symptoms. BDI total score ranges from 0-63. BDI score of 1-16 represents low level of depression;17-30 represents moderate level of depression; &gt;=31 represents significant level of depression. A reduction in the BDI score represents improvement in the depression symptoms.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Subjects refuse to answer measures such as the RUSH sexual inventory and the CSSR. Therefore, no statistical analysis was performed on these. In addition, suicidal ideation (measured by CSSR) was captured in the AE form during the study peiod.</limitations_and_caveats>
