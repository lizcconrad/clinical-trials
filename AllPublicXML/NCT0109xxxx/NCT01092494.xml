    <textblock>
      Ovarian endometriotic cyst (endometrioma) is one of the most common endometriotic lesions,
      and conservative laparoscopic surgery is the treatment of choice. However, the recurrence
      after surgery is common.

      As repetitive surgery leads to morbidities and ovarian function decrease, recurrence after
      surgery frustrates both patients and clinicians. In this aspect, medical treatments have been
      offered after surgery to prevent or delay the recurrence. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone
      agonist (GnRHa) is frequently used in women with advanced endometriosis, but the efficacy is
      rather controversial. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that oral contraceptives
      (OCs) could reduce or delay endometrioma recurrence, but data are still limited.
      Consequently, no one type of postoperative medical therapy has been shown to be superior in
      reducing the recurrence of endometrioma.

      The rationale of postoperative medical therapy is that it could eradicate microscopic lesions
      which were not found and not treated sufficiently during surgery. Therefore, the maintenance
      of strongly suppressed condition induced by postoperative GnRHa treatment by addition of OCs
      could be a promising treatment to prevent the recurrence, but it has not been widely
      investigated.

      We performed this retrospective cohort study to evaluate the efficacy of cyclic monophasic
      low-dose OCs as a maintenance therapy after GnRHa treatment for the suppression of
      endometrioma recurrence.
