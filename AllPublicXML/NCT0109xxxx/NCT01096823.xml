  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare a standardized 6 week Iyengar Yoga program (IYP) for
      adolescents and young adults with rheumatoid arthritis to a standard care wait-list
      condition. In addition to effects on function and pain, this study will explore intervention
      effects on disease activity, immune response, HRQOL, functionality, and mood. Results will
      shed light on the feasibility and potential efficacy of a novel intervention (Iyengar yoga)
      for rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.

      The hypotheses are:

        1. The IYP will be safe, acceptable and feasible: at least 80% of subjects will complete
           the IYP.

        2. Following the IYP, participants will show significantly improved disease status, general
           functioning, arthritis-functioning and HRQOL relative to controls. The benefits will be
           apparent post-treatment and at two-month follow-up.

        3. Following the IYP, participants will report significantly improved pain, immune response
           and mood compared to controls. These improvements will be evident at both post-treatment
           and at two-month follow-up.

    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life - Short Form-36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>post intervention (within 2 weeks of completing intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Related Quality of Life - Short Form-36 (SF-36) is a generic core HRQOL measure yielding an 8-scale profile of functional health and well being. The SF-36 performs comparatively better than other HRQOL measures in terms of reliability, validity, lightness of respondent/administrative burden. It can be completed in 5-10 minutes and has been used with children as young as 10 years of age.
Subscales - all ranges 0-100 with higher scores indicating increased quality of life Bodily Pain, 2 items General Health, 5 items Vitality, 4 items Mental Health, 5 items</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Disability Index (PDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>post intervention (within 2 weeks of completing intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The PDI assess the impact of pain on ability to participate in basic life activities, including social activity, sexual behavior, self-care and life-support activity. The PDI has been used with patients as young as 15. Good internal reliability (α = .82) and validity have been reported. It takes less than 5 minutes to complete.
7 items, total measure range: 0-70, higher scores = higher interference/disability</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>post intervention (within 2 weeks of completing intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Items include questions about dressing and grooming, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, grip and making activities. The HAQ is one of the most widely recognized measures of patient functioning, with acceptable reliability and validity. It has been used successfully with adolescents as young as 13 years of age
Range: 0-100, lower scores indicate better health</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Activity Scale (DAS)28</measure>
    <time_frame>post intervention (within 2 weeks of completing intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>is a combined index that measures disease activity in patients with RA and remains a more thorough, established alternative to standard medical exams. This index includes a 28 tender joint count, 28 swollen joint count, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), and general health assessment using a visual analogue scale. The ESR indirectly measures inflammation in the body and involves collecting blood samples, which will be performed by a qualified phlebotomist.
The DAS score is a complicated formula based on many factors so there are no set ranges, but the published standards are as follows:
&quot;A DAS28 score of higher than 5.1 is indicative of high disease activity, whereas a DAS28 below 3.2 indicates low disease activity. A patient is considered to be in remission if they have a DAS28 lower than 2.6.&quot; Source: DAS-Score.nl. Available at http://www.das-score.nl/www.das-score.nl/index.html.

        <title>Pain Disability Index (PDI)</title>
        <description>The PDI assess the impact of pain on ability to participate in basic life activities, including social activity, sexual behavior, self-care and life-support activity. The PDI has been used with patients as young as 15. Good internal reliability (α = .82) and validity have been reported. It takes less than 5 minutes to complete.

        <title>Disease Activity Scale (DAS)28</title>
        <description>is a combined index that measures disease activity in patients with RA and remains a more thorough, established alternative to standard medical exams. This index includes a 28 tender joint count, 28 swollen joint count, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), and general health assessment using a visual analogue scale. The ESR indirectly measures inflammation in the body and involves collecting blood samples, which will be performed by a qualified phlebotomist.
The DAS score is a complicated formula based on many factors so there are no set ranges, but the published standards are as follows:
&quot;A DAS28 score of higher than 5.1 is indicative of high disease activity, whereas a DAS28 below 3.2 indicates low disease activity. A patient is considered to be in remission if they have a DAS28 lower than 2.6.&quot; Source: DAS-Score.nl. Available at http://www.das-score.nl/www.das-score.nl/index.html.
