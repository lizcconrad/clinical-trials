    <description>Solicited local symptoms assessed were pain, redness and swelling. Any was defined as occurrence of any specified solicited local symptoms reported irrespective of intensity grade. Grade 3 pain was defined as considerable pain that prevented normal everyday activities. Grade 3 redness and swelling were defined as redness and swelling greater than (&gt;) 20 millimeters (mm)</description>

    <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed were Drowsiness, Irritability, Loss of appetite and Fever [Axillary temperature greater than or equal to (≥) 37.5 degrees Celsius (°C)]. Any = occurrence of any specified solicited general symptoms reported irrespective of intensity grade or relationship to vaccination. Any fever = oral temperature ≥ 37.5 degrees Celsius (°C). Grade 3 symptoms = symptoms that prevented normal activities. Grade 3 fever = oral temperature &gt; 39.0°C.</description>

    <description>Unsolicited AE covers any AE reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as occurrence of any unsolicited symptom regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Any and Related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs).</measure>
    <time_frame>During the entire study period (Day 0 - Month 4)</time_frame>
    <description>SAEs assessed included medical occurrences that resulted in death, was life threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, resulted in disability/incapacity or was a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject. Any was defined as occurrence of any symptom regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination and related was an event assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccination.</description>
