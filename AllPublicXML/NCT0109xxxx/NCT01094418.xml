      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the distal sensory nerves of the feet, namely, the
      dorsal sural, medial dorsal cutaneous and medial plantar nerves, in patients with impaired
      glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus type 2 and compare these parameters to those from
      healthy participants.

      Diabetic Peripheral polyneuropathy (DPP) presents as a slowly progressive primary sensory
      deficit in length dependent fashion, to result in the classic stocking glove distribution.
      There is recent evidence to indicate that patients with impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT) on
      OGTT, the prediabetic stage, have three times the prevalence of distal peripheral
      polyneuropathy than age matched controls. Patients with IGT, even in their preclinical
      stages, though they have less severe neuropathy than those with diabetes mellitus, have
      predominant sensory fiber involvement. To support this, other studies of skin biopsies of IGT
      patients have shown that microvascular abnormalities and neuropathic changes can occur in the
      prediabetic stage.

      Because DPP is length dependent, it is necessary to evaluate the distal sensory nerves, other
      than the standard sural and superficial peroneal nerves. To support this theory, recent
      electrodiagnostic studies in DM patients have shown that albeit normal conduction parameters
      in the above mentioned two nerves, abnormal parameters can be detected in the more distal
      sensory nerves, such as the dorsal sural nerve, medial plantar nerves and medial dorsal
      cutaneous nerve.

      Although the importance of evaluating the distal sensory nerves has gained much attention, no
      study has addressed the issue whether NCS parameters of these distal sensory nerves in IGT
      patients are significantly different from those of healthy controls with no medical
      condition, and whether these parameters are different to those with patients with diabetes
      mellitus, who have no previous history of peripheral polyneuropathy.

      With this objective in mind, NCS of the distal sensory nerves of the feet were performed to
      three groups; normal healthy control group, IGT group and diabetes mellitus group.
