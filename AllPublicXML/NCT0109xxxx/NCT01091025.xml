  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) has risen significantly as patients'
      survival improves. Early diagnosis of CFRD is crucial to prevent the unnecessary
      deterioration of lung function and nutritional status, both of which affect the patient's
      overall survival. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGGT) is the accepted method for detecting
      CFRD. The Cystic Fibrosis Trust guidelines (2004) recommend that patients with CF over the
      age of twelve years should be screened annually. Most hospitals use an annual OGTT.
      Performing OGTT on all CF patients is inconvenient and may not be cost effective, as patients
      have to starve overnight and need to spend an extra 2 hours in the hospital in addition to
      all the other annual review tests. In our centre, a selective approach is used. If patients
      have an abnormal random blood glucose and /or abnormal glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c)
      and/or symptoms of hyperglycaemia or unexplained weight loss then an OGTT will be performed.

      The aims of this study are

        1. To compare the clinical efficiency in the screening for CFRD in the two different
           methods: i)a selective approach , ii)an unselected annual OGTT for all patients.

        2. To compare the cost effectiveness of the two approaches in the screening for CFRD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CFRD affects 30% of all patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) by the age of twentyâˆ’five. Early
      diagnosis of CFRD is crucial to prevent the unnecessary deterioration of pulmonary function
      and nutritional status, both of which affect the patient's overall survival. The selective
      approach takes less patient time and is less expensive. If it is equally accurate it should
      be used routinely. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the accepted method for
      detecting CFRD and the Cystic Fibrosis Trust guidelines recommend that patients with CF over
      the age of twelve years should be screened annually. Yung et al, questioned this approach and
      argued that performing OGTT on all CF patients is inconvenient and may not be cost effective,
      as patients have to starve overnight and need to spend an extra 2 hours in the hospital in
      addition to all the other annual review tests.

      In this study, a selective approach in performing OGTTs in the screening for CFRD will be
      used; this includes the use of a combination of clinical and biochemical criteria that of
      abnormal random blood glucose and /or abnormal glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and/or
      symptoms of hyperglycaemia, or weight loss.

    <description>Patients identified for OGTT based on the selective approach by the two independent reviewers will be compared.
Patients will form two groups:
i)those identified as needing OGTT, ii)those on whom they considered it unnecessary
The results of the two groups will then be compared with the data obtain from OGTT to which the two reviewers were 'blinded'</description>
