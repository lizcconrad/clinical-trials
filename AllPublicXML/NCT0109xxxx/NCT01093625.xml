  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of an investigational silicone hydrogel
      soft contact lens on new contact lens wearers (neophytes) compared to a control of spectacle
      wearers.

    <measure>Papillary Conjunctivitis</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>Swelling of the papillary (Papillary conjunctivitis) area of the eye was assessed using a slit-lamp. Comparison between the two study arms will be assessed using data generated from a slit-lamp examination, using an Efron scale with 0.1 unit increments. The Efron scale has a range of 0 (normal) to 4 (Severe) and is subjectively assessed for 0.1 increments by the clinician, with the higher the magnitude of the number the worse the score.</description>

    <description>Comparison of the amount of redness in the conjunctival area of the eye, between the two study arms will be assessed using data generated from a slit-lamp examination, using an Efron scale with 0.1 unit increments. The Efron scale has a range of 0 (normal) to 4 (Severe) and is subjectively assessed for 0.1 increments by the clinician, with the higher the magnitude of the number the worse the score.</description>

    <measure>Conjunctival Staining</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>Mild abrasions of the conjunctival area of the eye. Comparison between the two study arms will be assessed using data generated from a slit-lamp examination, using an Efron scale with 0.1 unit increments. The Efron scale has a range of 0 (normal) to 4 (Severe) and is subjectively assessed for 0.1 increments by the clinician, with the higher the magnitude of the number the worse the score.</description>

    <measure>Corneal Neovascularization</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>New vascularization of the Cornea. Comparison between the two study arms will be assessed using data generated from a slit-lamp examination, using an Efron scale with 0.1 unit increments. The Efron scale has a range of 0 (normal) to 4 (Severe) and is subjectively assessed for 0.1 increments by the clinician, with the higher the magnitude of the number the worse the score.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences in Subjective Comfort From the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>The subjective comfort questionnaire CLUE, assesses the overall lens comfort. The CLUE Questionnaire is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response, with a range of 0-120. The differences between: (final visit and first visit) and then (final visit and 6 months) are reported.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to read, comprehend and sign an informed consent (or parental consent/subject
             assent, as appropriate).

          -  Willing to comply with the study visit schedule.

          -  Ages 15 to 39.

          -  Has access to a cellular telephone with text messaging capabilities.

          -  Has a current pair of spectacles.

          -  'Neophyte' - In this work, 'neophyte' will be taken to mean any subject who has never
             been dispensed contact lenses. A subject who has taken part in a non-dispensing
             clinical study or has been fitted with contact lenses in practice but never went on to
             actually wear the lenses, will also be classified as a 'neophyte'.

          -  Spherical contact lens (CL) prescription between -0.75D and -6.00D and spectacle
             cylinder equal to or less than 0.75 DC.

          -  Monocular best-corrected distance visual acuity (VA) â‰¥ 20/30 Snellen in each eye.

          -  Subject agrees to &quot;intent&quot; of wearing the CLs at minimum 6 hours/day for at least 4
             days per week.

          -  They agree not to participate in other clinical research during the duration of this
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active ocular allergy, infection, injury, inflammation, or abnormality (e.g.,
             keratoconus) that might interfere with soft contact lens wear.

          -  Prior corneal refractive surgery or corneal irregularity (e.g., keratoconus).

          -  Systemic disease, which might interfere with contact lens wear.

          -  Medication usage that may be associated with eye dryness.

          -  Use of any topical medication such as eye drops or ointment.

          -  Pregnant or lactating (by self-report).

          -  Aphakia.

          -  Grade 2 or greater of any of the following ocular surface signs: corneal edema,
             corneal vascularization, corneal staining, tarsal conjunctival changes or any other
             abnormality, which would normally contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  Have participated in any other clinical trial or research in the two weeks prior to
             starting this study.

        <title>Differences in Subjective Comfort From the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE) Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The subjective comfort questionnaire CLUE, assesses the overall lens comfort. The CLUE Questionnaire is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response, with a range of 0-120. The differences between: (final visit and first visit) and then (final visit and 6 months) are reported.</description>
