  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many therapeutic trials in DMD exclude non-ambulatory boys and men. Rate of progression in
      these non-ambulatory patients has been studied but consensus has not been reached for what
      measures are most reliable and reproducible. Furthermore, any treatment trial would be
      expected to demonstrate improved function and improvement in quality of life. Therefore,
      function, strength, and quality of life must be understood and standardized. While the goal
      of this proposal is to standardize clinical outcomes for therapeutic trials, careful
      understanding of the progression of DMD in non ambulatory boys may also lead to better
      medical treatment.
