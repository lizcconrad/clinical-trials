  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed as a single-blind, prospective, randomized controlled trial and was
      approved by the Ethics Committee of Ahmadi Hospital, Kuwait. Patients were randomly assigned
      to undergo either hemorrhoidectomy with the LigaSure device or stapled hemorrhoidopexy.
      Patients were blinded as to the type of procedure perform. Candidates for the study were
      consecutive patients with symptomatic grade III or IV hemorrhoids admitted to the Ahmadi
      Hospital (secondary care hospital), Kuwait, from January 2006 through July 2007.
