      This study, based in India, is testing the efficacy of varenicline to help smokeless tobacco
      users with cessation efforts.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of smokeless tobacco use in the United States is low vs. cigarette smoking,
      yet rates have remained constant over the past few years. In contrast, the rate of smokeless
      tobacco use in India is 20%. Smokeless tobacco is a carcinogenic and responsible for ~10,000
      deaths/year from oral cancer in India. Unfortunately, there have been remarkably few
      intervention trials in India for smokeless tobacco users. To date, no trial has evaluated the
      new FDA approved medication, varenicline, for smokeless tobacco use. We will conduct a
      randomized placebo-controlled trial of varenicline for smokeless tobacco dependence at the
      National Drug Dependence Treatment Center (NDDTC) at the All India Institute of Medicine
      (AIIMS) in New Delhi with 237 smokeless tobacco users. The primary aims of this trial are to:
      1) enhance research capacity at the NDDTC (i.e., train AIIMS staff to implement the
      behavioral counseling protocol with pharmacotherapy, data collection and management
      procedures); 2) assess the efficacy of varenicline for increasing biochemically confirmed
      7-day point prevalence smokeless tobacco quit rates at the end-of treatment; and 3) assess
      longitudinal patterns of relapse and recovery following treatment with varenicline. The
      results of this trial may guide future investments to evaluate the efficacy of varenicline
      for smokeless tobacco dependence in the US, which is critical since smokeless tobacco use in
      the US may increase in the coming years and no approved pharmacotherapy for this drug
      dependence exists in the US or around the globe.

            <description>Varenicline: Participants will be randomized to receive varenicline or placebo for 12 weeks. The dosing regimen consistent with FDA guidelines will be used: Day 1-Day 3 (0.5mg once daily); Day 4-Day 7 (0.5mg twice daily); and Day 8-Day 84 (1.0mg twice daily).
Counseling: All participants will be provided with a structured behavioral counseling program, involving 6 counseling sessions by a trained NDDTC counselor. This will be a manual-based intervention and revised as needed for cultural relevance and sensitivity by Dr. Stigler. The intervention is designed to enhance awareness of the harmful effects of smokeless tobacco, assist the person in developing skills to quit and avoid relapse, and instruct the smokeless tobacco user on medication adherence, as recommended by experts in the field.</description>
