      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (Myfortic®) in combination with low-dose corticosteroids
      (Decortin H®) compared to a monotherapy with low-dose corticosteroids (Decortin H®) in
      subjects with chronic intraocular inflammation (non-infectious intermediate uveitis).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), a pro-drug containing mycophenolic acid (MPA) as active agent,
      is approved for the treatment of acute graft rejection after kidney-, heart- and
      liver-transplantation, and was shown in 1995 to be effective in inhibiting the development of
      experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis. Further studies proved it to be a safe and effective
      steroid-sparing immunomodulatory for reducing the recurrence rate of non-infectious
      intermediate uveitis in humans. Although the adverse effect profile of MMF is comparatively
      benign, gastrointestinal adverse effects are a major concern and may limit its clinical
      benefit, because they may necessitate dose reduction, interruption, or even discontinuation
      of MMF.

      An enteric-coated formulation of mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS, Myfortic) has been developed
      especially to reduce MPA-related gastrointestinal adverse events. This clinical trial is a
      prospective controlled study to evaluate whether a Myfortic based regimen will be able to
      reduce the probability of a relapse compared to steroid therapy alone and to test whether a
      Myfortic based therapy provides a superior behaviour compared to a steroid regimen.
