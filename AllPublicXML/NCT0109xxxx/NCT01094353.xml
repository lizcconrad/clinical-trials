    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The participants were randomly allocated to a single-incision mini-sling or a transobturator midurethral tape by a simple randomization procedure using a random number generator computer program. Randomization was performed at the moment of inclusion by a nurse blinded to women's histories. Group assign- ment was concealed in consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes that were opened in the operating room just before the procedure.</masking_description>
