  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing the efficacy of a family-based preventive intervention, which
      began when the children were age 2, with children at risk for developing significant conduct
      problems. Families who were originally recruited from Women, Infants and Children (WIC) were
      randomly assigned to a family-centered intervention developed by Dishion and colleagues
      (Dishion &amp; Kavanagh, 2003; Dishion &amp; Stormshak, 2006) referred to as an 'ecological approach
      to family intervention and treatment' (EcoFIT). The current study expands the Early Steps
      intervention into the elementary school years beyond what is currently available for a WIC
      service delivery venue, in which children are no longer eligible for services at age 6.

      The investigators are testing the hypothesis that periodic, tailored, and adaptive
      interventions delivered to caregivers at school entry will (a) reduce the probability of
      elevated risk associated with early-onset problem behavior, including the eventual use of
      drugs and other health-risking behaviors; (b) reduce the likelihood of mental health problems
      such as childhood depression, anxiety, conduct problems and co-morbidity; and (c) promote
      children's development of self-regulation, which underlies school readiness, early school
      literacy academic achievement, and positive peer relations.

      Aims of the current project are:

        1. Refine the intervention model to address the child's adaptation to school and
           development of self-regulatory skills and underlying multiple dimensions of school
           success.

        2. Examine and test the consistency of developmental models of problem behavior, emotional
           adjustment, and normative self-regulation in childhood.

        3. Evaluate the long-term impact of intervention on risk pathways to later drug abuse and
           health-risking behaviors by examining early risk markers, including children's problem
           behavior, poor emotional adjustment, and lack of school readiness.

        Original Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Parents with children between ages two and three

          -  Currently enrolled with Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)

          -  To qualify for the original study, families needed to meet criteria for child, family,
             and sociodemographic risk. Specifically, families either had to meet &quot;child risk&quot;
             factors or they had to have at least two of the three factors present to qualify for
             the study. To meet criterion for child risk, scores must be at least one SD above the
             normative average on the Eyberg Intensity of Problems factors, the Bates difficulty
             (i.e. negative emotionality) factor, or the conflict factor of the Adult-Child
             Relationship Scale. Family risk was determined by a score of one SD above the
             normative average on maternal depressive symptoms or parenting daily hassles, having
             substance use/abuse problems, or teen parent status. Sociodemographic risk was
             established using educational attainment because all WIC participants met criteria for
             low income. Families in which educational attainment is less than three years of
             college for both parents satisfied the requirement of sociodemographic risk.
