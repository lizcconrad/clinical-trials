  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy subjects will receive NRL001 or placebo once daily for 14 days. The four treatment
      groups, shown below, will each consist of 12 subjects:

      Group 1; Nine subjects will receive a dose of 7.5 mg NRL001 in a 2 g suppository and three
      will receive matching placebo.

      Group 2; Nine subjects will receive a dose of 10 mg NRL001 in a 2 g suppository and three
      will receive matching placebo.

      Group 3; Nine subjects will receive a daily dose of 12.5 mg NRL001 in a 2 g suppository and
      three will receive matching placebo.

      Group 4; Nine subjects will receive a daily dose of 15 mg NRL001 in a 2 g suppository and
      three will receive matching placebo.

      The dosing of each group will be completed prior to the next group being dosed. Dose
      escalation will be dependent on a positive assessment of the safety profile of the preceding
      group by the Safety Monitoring Board.

      The pharmacokinetics of NRL001 will be determined on Days 1, 7 and 14. Pharmacodynamics will
      be examined using a three lead Holter monitor at screening and at intervals throughout the
      study period. Adverse events, vital signs, ECGs and clinical laboratory parameters will be
      collected, tabulated, reviewed and recorded throughout the study.

        Volunteers will be included in the study if they satisfy the following criteria:

          -  Healthy adult male or female volunteers (as determined by medical history, physical
             examination, laboratory test values, vital signs, an exercise stress test and
