    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject will be between ages 18 to 65 years. Both male and female subjects will be
             recruited.

          2. Subject should have had cervical or lumbar radicular pain for at least two months.
             This requirement is to avoid the uncertainty of an unstable pain condition and to
             minimize the study variation.

          3. Subject has a pain score of 4 or above (visual analog scale, VAS: 0 - 10 from no pain
             to worst pain).

          4. Cervical or lumbar radicular pain will include, but is not limited to, such clinical
             conditions as disk herniation, spinal stenosis, and post-laminectomy syndrome.

          5. For controls, healthy subjects without radicular pain for at least three months will
             be recruited. *We are no longer accepting healthy volunteers.*

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has detectable sensory deficits at the site of QST. Sensory deficits refer to
             such conditions resulting from neurological diseases or medical conditions causing
             peripheral polyneuropathy and sensory changes, which include but are not limited to
             diabetic neuropathy, alcoholic neuropathy, AIDS neuropathy, severe thyroid disease,
             and severe liver or kidney disorders.

          2. Subject has scar tissue, infection, or acute injury at the site of QST.

          3. Subject is on anticoagulation therapy.

          4. Subject is pregnant.

          5. Subject is tested positive on illicit drugs.
