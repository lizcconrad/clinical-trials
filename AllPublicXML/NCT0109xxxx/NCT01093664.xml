    <description>Immunological parameters:
- Assessment of the immune response triggered by the vaccine (titre of IgG antibodies specific for the immunizing peptide, N-terminal part of Aβ, (irrelevant peptide serves as specificity control), Aβ itself and KLH as assessed by ELlSA as well as the results of the biacore affinity measurements towards the immunizing peptide and Aβ)

Cognitive and functional tests, behavioural scales
Measurement of quality of life in patients with Alzheimer's disease
