    <textblock>
      The aim of this study will be to determine whether secretin-enhanced MRCP (S-MRCP) as well as
      traditional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pancreas will allow the investigators to
      quantify the pancreas' ability to secrete hormones as well as digestive enzymes, both before
      and after surgery. The investigators hypothesize that S-MRCP will provide a novel
      non-invasive measure of pancreatic function.

    <textblock>
      Surgical resection offers the only hope of cure for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. While
      perioperative mortality rates have declined in recent years, pancreatectomy is still
      associated with significant postoperative malnutrition, maldigestion, and glucose
      intolerance, mostly as a result of pancreatic insufficiency. Quantifying residual pancreatic
      function remains a challenge, but is essential in improving the survival and quality of life
      of pancreatic cancer patients. Secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography
      (S-MRCP)has recently emerged as a widely-accepted noninvasive technique to assess
      morphological changes in the pancreatic ducts, as well as functional secretory capacity of
      the gland. The aim of our study is to evaluate S-MRCP as a means to assess pancreatic reserve
      in patients who will undergoing surgical resection for pancreatic carcinoma. As an adjunct to
      S-MRCP, we will also evaluate the concomitant use of dynamic MRI with contrast enhancement.
      This will be a prospective study of twelve patients who will undergo S-MRCP/MRI within 30
      days of surgery and then at 3, 6, and 12 months post-operatively. Quantitative analysis of
      S-MRCP will include pancreatic duct diameter and volume before and after secretin
      administration. MRI will be analyzed for mean T1 signal intensity, total parenchymal volume,
      and gadolinium enhancement. These radiological parameters will be compared to clinical
      parameters of exocrine function(subjective reporting of steatorrhea and abdominal pain as
      well as levels of fecal elastase1 and fat soluble vitamins in stool samples) as well as
      endocrine function (fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, amylin, glucagon, and somatostatin
      levels, as well as arginine-stimulated levels of islet cell hormones).

    <description>Our primary aim is to compare S-MRCP with either Endoscopic Pancreatic Function Test (ePFT) (in those patients who undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy [EGD] or endoscopic ultrasound [EUS]) or acid steatocrit. The primary outcome will be the correlation between duodenal filling on SMRCP (expressed as percent of duct volume change from baseline and maximal values following secretin administration) with either 1) maximal bicarbonate concentration of duodenal fluid aspirate or 2) acid steatocrit (a measure of steatorrhea, expressed as volumetric percentage).</description>

    <description>In those patients who are undergoing endocrine pancreatic testing, our secondary aim is to investigate the relationship between other radiological parameters, including percentage diameter change on S-MRCP, with other clinical markers of pancreatic insufficiency, including fecal elastase-1 and vitamin levels, patients' grading of abdominal symptoms, quality-of-life questionnaire scores, and body mass index (BMI).</description>

    <description>Another secondary aim will be to evaluate MRI imaging parameters (primarily maximal gadolinium signal enhancement, but also non-enhancement measures such as total volume and mean T1 signal) with arginine-stimulated hormone levels (primarily arginine-stimulated insulin levels, but we will also be examining glucagon, amylin, somatostatin and Cpeptide levels).</description>

    <description>S-MRCP has recently emerged as a widely-accepted noninvasive technique to assess morphological changes in the pancreatic ducts, as well as functional secretory capacity of the gland. Twelve patients will each undergo four Secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (S-MRCP) evaluations, at a dose of 0.2 ucg/kg per exam, each S-MRCP will require 16-32 ucg of secretin (12 vials). Secretin, provided by the Repligen Corporation, will be administered by IV bolus injection over 30 seconds followed by a 30 second saline flush. The maximum dose of secretin will be 18.5 ucg.</description>
