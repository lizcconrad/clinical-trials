    <textblock>
      The Control Study for the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain
      (MAPP) Research Network has been established to focus on a broader approach to the study of
      Interstitial Cystitis (IC)/Painful Bladder Syndrome (PBS) in men and women, and Chronic
      Prostatitis (CP)/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS) in men, than previously undertaken.

      Participants with no Urologic Pelvic Pain Syndromes as well as participants with specific
      conditions (Fibromyalgia (FM), Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
      (CFS)) are being recruited for the Trans-MAPP Control Study. These participants will act as a
      reference/control group for the Trans-MAPP Epidemiology &amp; Phenotyping (EP) Study.

      As with many chronic pain disorders, IC and CP are poorly understood, and treatment is often
      not helpful. The goal of this study is to better understand how pain is felt in people with
      IC or CP. The MAPP Control Study is an observational study that will enroll participants from
      6 Discovery Sites and 3 Satellite Sites across the U.S. The investigators will ask questions
      and gather information about the health and life of the participants for research purposes.
      The investigators hope that this study will lead to improvement in the treatment of IC and
      CP.

    <textblock>
      Trans-MAPP Control participants will only need to complete one study visit to collect
      baseline data and biospecimens. Potential participants will be scheduled for an eligibility
      screening session. Following screening, potentially eligible participants will complete a
      baseline phenotyping session, and biospecimen collections, which together are expected to
      take approximately 2.5 hours to complete. Participants will be provided with breaks as needed
      during the clinic visit.

        The Trans-MAPP Control Study population will include adult participants, at least 18 years
        of age, with no urological chronic pelvic pain syndromes. These participants will fall into
        two categories: Healthy Controls and Positive Controls.

    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        The eligibility criteria for both healthy controls and positive controls are based on the
        same set of criteria for the Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (UCPPS) participants in
        the Trans-MAPP EP Study, with exception of additional criteria to exclude chronic pelvic
        pain symptoms and criteria to identify the co-morbid syndromes for the positive controls.
        All entry criteria are shown below; those specific to either healthy or positive control
        participants are so indicated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participants are eligible for the Trans-MAPP Control Protocol if they meet the following
        general and gender-specific criteria listed below:

          1. Participant has signed and dated the appropriate Informed Consent document.

          2. Agreed to participate in Trans-MAPP Control Study procedures;

        Inclusion Criteria for Healthy Controls only

          1. Participant reports a response of &quot;0&quot; (zero) on the pain, pressure or discomfort
             scale.

          2. Participant reports no chronic pain in the pelvic or bladder region, and reports
             chronic pain in no more than one other body region.

          3. Participant reports no urological symptoms that have been evaluated, but are still
             present.
