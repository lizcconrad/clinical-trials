      The purpose of the study is to determine whether circulating molecular and cellular
      biomarkers are predictive of imatinib effect on pulmonary artery hypertension.

      We hypothesize that bone marrow progenitor cells are mobilized into the circulation in PAH,
      home to the lungs and differentiate into mast cells, which promote vascular remodeling and
      vasoconstriction through release of renin and chymase. As a corollary to this, we hypothesize
      that anti cKit tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), imatinib, provides clinical benefit to
      patients through inhibition of mast cell progenitor proliferation, mobilization and
      differentiation. To test this, we will determine if mast cell progenitors and mast cell
      biomarkers are related to imatinib clinical response. This will be an ancillary study, part
      of a placebo-controlled, double-blind multi center clinical trial of imatinib in pulmonary
      arterial hypertension.
