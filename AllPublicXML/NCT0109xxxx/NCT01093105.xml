      The objective of this study is to evaluate the natural history of disease progression in
      infants with globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to gather prospective data on disease progression in infants
      diagnosed with GLD. This study will be performed using protocol-defined, standardized
      assessments including clinical, developmental, and neurologic measures. All study visits will
      be conducted in the subject's home. No travel to the study site is necessary.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be considered eligible for this study:

          1. The subject has a documented diagnosis of GLD as evidenced by GALC enzyme activity or
             a GALC genotype that is predictive of GLD.

          2. The subject must have clinical signs and symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of
             infantile GLD including at least 2 of the following:

               1. Chronic difficulty with feeding or unexplained irritability or &quot;fisting&quot; or other
                  signs of abnormal increased tone

               2. CT or MRI imaging, if performed during diagnostic evaluation prior to enrollment,
                  consistent with GLD

               3. Failure to meet at least 2 age-specific developmental milestones consistent with
                  GLD

               4. Loss of deep tendon reflexes or abnormal visual fixation or optic atrophy

          3. The subject has documented onset of signs and symptoms consistent with GLD at &lt;12
             months of age and is &lt;21 months of age at time of study entry.

          4. The subject was born at a gestational age of 35-41 weeks.

          5. The subject had a birth weight of â‰¥2 kg.

          6. At study entry, the subject must be able to maintain oral nutrition and hydration
             without the use of supportive measures, defined as use of a feeding tube.

          7. At study entry, the subject must be able to maintain ventilation without the use of
             invasive supportive measures, defined as use of a breathing tube.

          8. The subject must be able, in the opinion of the Investigator, to accommodate the
             protocol requirements, including feasibility of study visits.

          9. The subject's parent(s) or legal guardian must have voluntarily signed an
             Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee-approved informed consent form
             after all relevant aspects of the study have been explained and discussed with the
             subject's parent(s), or legal guardian.

        Exclusion Criteria: Subjects who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible for
        this study:

          1. The subject has neurologic, hearing or vision impairment, difficulty swallowing or
             feeding, respiratory complications, behavioral disturbances, or other medical
             conditions that are not due to GLD and are likely to confound the scientific integrity
             or interpretation of study assessments, as determined by the Investigator.

          2. The subject has received treatment with any investigational drug or a device within
             the 30 days prior to study enrollment through study completion.

          3. The subject has received a cord blood or bone marrow transplant or is planning to
             receive one during the study.

          4. The subject's parent(s) or legal guardian is unable to understand the nature, scope,
             and possible consequences of the study, or does not agree to comply with the protocol
             defined schedule of assessments.
