  <brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of AFQ056 When Combined With Increased Doses of L-dopa in Parkinson's Disease Patients With Moderate-severe L-dopa Induced Dyskinesia</brief_title>
  <official_title>A 6-week, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Randomized, Multicenter Study to Explore the Efficacy and Safety of AFQ056 When Combined With Increased Doses of L-dopa in Parkinson's Disease Patients With OFF Time and Moderate-severe L-dopa Induced Dyskinesia</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase IIb exploratory study is designed to determine whether AFQ056 is safe and
      effective and whether it can increase the therapeutic window of L-dopa in patients whose
      control of their Parkinson's Disease symptoms is limited by the development of dyskinesia
      induced by use of L-dopa.
