      The Effect of Cesarean Operative Technique on the Occurrence of Large Hysterotomy Scar
      Defects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Having a Caesarean leads to a scar in the uterus, which does not always heal properly.
      Defective healing can lead to serious complications in the next pregnancy and delivery.
      Different surgical techniques can be used for a Caesarean section.

      The aim is to compare two surgical techniques (different ways of opening the uterus), to
      investigate whether one or the other technique leads to fewer defective scars in the uterus.
      Both these techniques are in use at the clinic. After the operation, patients are cared for
      in the normal way.

      Six months after the Caesarean, patients are examined using vaginal ultrasound. Vaginal
      ultrasound allows to see if the scar after the Caesarean has healed well, or if there are
      defects in it.

    <intervention_model_description>women aimed for emergency cesarean section were randomized into two groups according to surgery technique of opening the uterus: 1 Group - high level of hysterotomy incision; 2 Group - low level of hysterotomy incision.

    <masking_description>the surgeon who performed the operation knew what technique to use. Participant were not informed in what group they were. Six months postpartum patients came to ultrasound department and underwent ultrasound examination of uterus and uterine cesarean scar.

    <measure>APGAR score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 and 5 minute after delivery</time_frame>
    <description>APGAR score measured at 1 and 5 minute after delivery. The five criteria are summarized using words chosen to form a backronym (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration).The Apgar scale is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five simple criteria on a scale from zero to two, then summing up the five values thus obtained. The resulting Apgar score ranges from zero to 10.</description>
