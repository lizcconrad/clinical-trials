  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to observe the short term effect (3-month) of sleep disordered breathing (SDB)
      on cardiovascular parameters, heart rate variability, endothelial function and surrogate
      markers of atherosclerosis after acute cerebrovascular events (ACE). The long-term effect
      (6-24-month) of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) on clinical vascular outcome,
      cardiovascular parameters, evolution of surrogate of atherosclerosis heart rate variability
      and endothelial function after ACE is observed over 24 months. A preventive effect of CPAP
      therapy on cerebro-vascular events in patients with moderate-severe obstructive SDB without
      sleepiness after ictus or transient ischaemic attack will be evaluated.

      Sleep disordered breathing is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality and is frequent in patients with acute cerebrovascular events. In this study the
      investigators observe the association between sleep disordered breathing, hypertension,
      stroke and the evolution of blood markers for atherosclerosis as well as the efficacy of
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure treatment in patients with acute or subacute
      cerebrovascular events.

      Sleep disordered breathing is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality and is frequent in patients with acute cerebrovascular events. In this study the
      investigators observe the association between sleep disordered breathing, hypertension,
      stroke and the evolution of blood markers for atherosclerosis as well as the efficacy of
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure treatment in patients with acute or subacute
      cerebrovascular events.

      The SAS CARE 1 study is planned to verify whether or not sleep disordered breathing has a
      detrimental 3 months effect on cardiovascular functions and markers after acute
      cerebrovascular events. The SAS CARE 2 study is designed to address whether or not the
      treatment of sleep disordered breathing with CPAP reduces the combined rate of mortality,
      stroke, cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction/revascularisation/instable angina/
      hospitalisation for heart insufficiency) over a 24 months period in patients after acute
      cerebrovascular events.

    <measure>CPAP-Compliance measured by hours of usage</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months after stroke</time_frame>
    <description>Compliance is monitored for the use of the CPAP by the pulmonary specialist at the patients' routine visits 2-3, 4-6 weeks, 3-6 months, 12 and 24 months after randomisation. The hours ofuse are registered by a chip inserted in the device. Good compliance is, if the device was used &gt; 10 hours per day. Satisfactory compliance is defined for a use of the CPAP for at least 4 hours per night during at least 70% of the nights. Insufficient compliance is defined as &lt; 4 hours per night or less than 70% of nights.</description>

    <measure>Blood pressure profile (systolic mean, diastolic mean, max, min: general, day, night) measured in mmHg for every patient by ambulatory 24h-BP-devices in the acute stroke phase, after 3 months and after 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months after stroke</time_frame>
    <description>Mean systolic and diastolic BP values, minimal and maximum values will be calculated for each patient for each period of time [after stroke: whole measuring period, (36 h) first night, second day, and second night after stroke; 3 months after stroke: whole period (24 h), day, night]. In addition same measurements will be made 12 months after stroke The occurrence of dippers will be registered at baseline (after stroke) and at 3 months. A dipper is defined, if the mean pressure at night is diminished more than 10% (compared to day data). An inverse-dipper is defined if more than 10% augmentation of night pressure will be registered. A deep-deeper is defined the mean pressure at night is diminished more than 20% (compared to day data).</description>
