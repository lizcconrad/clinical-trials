    <description>No intervention was given during this extension study which gathered survival information on participants of study NCT00065156 (Celgene study CC-5013-MDS-003). During the CC-5013-MDS-003 study, participants initially took a syncopated dosage regimen in which 10 mg of lenalidomide was taken orally once daily on Days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle. The study was amended to employ a continuous dosage regimen in which 10 mg of lenalidomide was taken without a planned rest period. Participants who initially began therapy on the syncopated regimen and who did not experience dose-limiting adverse events (AEs) were allowed to switch to the continuous regimen.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This extension study was conducted specifically to provide further long-term outcomes as regards overall survival/vital status and the possible occurrence of progression to AML for all participants previously enrolled in study NCT00065156 (Celgene CC-5013-MDS-003). Participants from the original study are included in the Participant Flow.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>When the final MDS-003 clinical study report was written, 76 participants had died; therefore, 72 of all 148 participants who first enrolled in the MDS-003 study could have been included in the extension study. Sixteen did not participate because their investigative sites did not participant. Two withdrew consent during the earlier study.</pre_assignment_details>

During the CC-5013-MDS-003 study, participants initially took a syncopated dosage regimen in which 10 mg of lenalidomide was taken orally once daily on Days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle. The study was amended to employ a continuous dosage regimen in which 10 mg of lenalidomide was taken without a planned rest period. Participants who initially began therapy on the syncopated regimen and who did not experience dose-limiting adverse events (AEs) were allowed to switch to the continuous regimen.</description>

          <description>No intervention was given during this extension study which gathered survival information on participants of study NCT00065156 (Celgene study CC-5013-MDS-003). During the CC-5013-MDS-003 study, participants initially took a syncopated dosage regimen in which 10 mg of lenalidomide was taken orally once daily on Days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle. The study was amended to employ a continuous dosage regimen in which 10 mg of lenalidomide was taken without a planned rest period. Participants who initially began therapy on the syncopated regimen and who did not experience dose-limiting adverse events (AEs) were allowed to switch to the continuous regimen.</description>
