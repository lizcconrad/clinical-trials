    <textblock>
      The overall aim is to determine the mechanism(s) by which common bariatric surgical
      procedures alter carbohydrate metabolism. Understanding these mechanisms may ultimately lead
      to the development of novel interventions for the prevention and treatment of Type 2 diabetes
      and obesity.

    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this application is to determine the mechanism(s) by which common
      bariatric surgical procedures alter carbohydrate metabolism. Very often, resolution of
      diabetes occurs in the early post-operative period prior to the development of significant
      weight loss. It has been suggested that bariatric surgery alters insulin action but few
      studies have examined insulin secretion or postprandial glucose fluxes in such patients. At
      the present time, little is known about how the various bariatric surgical procedures alter
      glucose homeostasis. It is essential that the effect of bariatric surgery and meal size on
      these parameters be understood and accurately measured. Enteroendocrine secretion is affected
      by the rate of intestinal delivery of calories and may also be modulated by the enteric
      nervous system and the rate of direct delivery of nutrients to enteroendocrine cells. Direct
      measurement of intestinal transit is also an important part of understanding how bariatric
      surgery alters intestinal secretion of hormones that may alter glucose metabolism. The Oral
      and C-peptide Minimal Models when applied to C-peptide, glucose and insulin concentrations
      after ingestion of a standard labeled mixed meal can accurately measure insulin secretion and
      action. Subsequently, the disposition index provides a measurement of the appropriateness of
      insulin secretion for the prevailing insulin action. When coupled with established
      triple-tracer methodology, a mixed meal can be used to measure fasting and postprandial
      glucose fluxes. The present experiments will determine the mechanism of glucose lowering
      after adjustable gastric banding (AGB). AGB seems to be superior to medical therapy in type 2
      diabetes. However, bariatric surgery was not compared to intensive efforts at weight
      reduction which itself ameliorates diabetes and cardiovascular risk. It is therefore unknown
      if the beneficial effects of AGB on glucose metabolism are related to weight-loss per se
      rather than a direct effect of AGB.

    <description>Insulin sensitivity which measures the overall ability of insulin to stimulate glucose disposal and inhibit glucose production will be calculated from plasma glucose and insulin concentrations using the &quot;oral&quot; glucose minimal model. Beta-cell responsivity indices will be calculated using plasma glucose and C-peptide concentrations using the oral C-peptide minimal model. The appropriateness of insulin secretion for the prevailing degree of insulin action is assessed by calculating the total disposition index (DItotal), which equals the product of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Individuals aged 30 - 65 years seen in the Nutrition Clinic at the Mayo Clinic, are
             potentially eligible prior to undergoing adjustable gastric banding (AGB).

          -  We will recruit 20 subjects who have a fasting glucose concentration of 126 mg/dl on
             two or more occasions or who have a history of type 2 diabetes treated with one or two
             oral agents other than thiazolidinediones.

          -  Potential participants will attend the Mayo Clinic Clinical Research Unit (CRU) for a
             screening visit.

          -  In addition, the investigators will also recruit 20 subjects with type 2 diabetes,
             from the Nutrition Clinic who are not interested in pursuing surgical intervention.

          -  The 2 groups will be matched for age, gender and BMI and duration and severity (HbA1c
             and no. of oral medications needed to achieve glycemic control) of diabetes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects less than 30 years of age or who are on insulin will not be studied to
             minimize the possibility of type 1 diabetes.

          -  Subjects older than 65 years of age will not be studied to minimize the potential
             confounding effects of age on glucose tolerance.

          -  Healthy status will indicate that the participant has no known active systemic illness
             and no history of microvascular or macrovascular complications of their diabetes.
