      The purpose of this study is to provide proof-of-concept that the test product can perform as
      intended in an intra-operative setting and the responses to the test product are perceivable
      in a person. The study will also compare results of the test product to the
      commercially-available product.

      Hypothesis: the test product will elicit successful test results in over 90% of test product.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is indicated for ActivaÂ® DBS implant for the treatment of Parkinson's disease
             and scheduled for surgery at the study site.

          -  Subject is willing to sign the informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Subject is 18 years of age or older.

          -  Subject is a male or non-pregnant female.

          -  Subject has no factors that would put the subject at an additional risk for
             intra-operative or postoperative bleeding. This includes underlying disorders of the
             coagulation cascade (eg, hemophilia), disorders that affect platelet count or function
             (eg, Von Willebrand's disease), as well as administration of any anti-platelet or
             anti-coagulant medication in the 7 days prior to surgery, or any history of
             anticoagulant or aspirin use, that in the view of the neurosurgeon or neurologist
             would place the subject at an increased risk for intra-operative or postoperative
             bleeding.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is indicated for DBS for treating a disorder other than Parkinson's disease.

          -  Subject has any medical contraindications to undergoing DBS surgery, (eg, infection,
             coagulopathy, or significant cardiac or other medical risk factors for surgery).

          -  Subject has a history of hemorrhagic stroke.

          -  Subject has a history of a neurosurgical ablation procedure.

          -  Subject is currently enrolled in or plans to enroll in any concurrent study that may
             confound the results of this study, as determined by the investigator or Medtronic.

          -  Subject has a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest less than or
             equal to 6 months prior to the screening testing.

          -  Subject has a history of a seizure disorder

          -  Subject requires short surgery time due to general health issues, as determined by the
             investigator.

          -  Subject is a woman who is pregnant or planning to become pregnant, or a woman of
             child-bearing potential, who is not using a medically-acceptable method of birth
             control. Women of child-bearing potential must undergo a pregnancy test, with a clear
             negative result, no more than 7 days prior to the investigational procedure visit.
