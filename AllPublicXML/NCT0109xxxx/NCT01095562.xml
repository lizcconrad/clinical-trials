      This is an efficacy and safety study evaluating an experimental treatment for cognitive
      deficits in adults with schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ABT-126 in
      approximately 210 adults with schizophrenia. Subjects will be randomized to one of three
      treatment groups (ABT-126 Dose 1, ABT-126 Dose 2 or placebo) for a 12-week Treatment Period.
      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether ABT-126 compared to placebo can
      improve cognition and what side effects ABT-126 may cause. Cognition is the way a person
      thinks, and it includes abilities like paying attention, focusing, remembering things, and
      solving problems. Acronyms listed in the Outcomes and/or Eligibility sections for this study
      are defined below: • MCCB: Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in
      Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery • UPSA-2: University of California at San
      Diego (UCSD) Performance-Based Skills Assessment-2 • CANTAB: Cambridge Neuropsychological
      Test Automated Battery • PANSS: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale • NSA-16: Negative
      Symptom Assessment-16 • CGI-S: Clinical Global Impression - Severity
