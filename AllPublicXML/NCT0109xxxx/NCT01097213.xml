  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Forty 18-year-old social drinkers will be selected from the sample tested in specific aim 1
      (&quot;Prospective Assessment of Adolescent Drinking Trajectories With Computer-Assisted
      Self-administration of Ethanol (CASE)&quot;; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01063166). The
      functional magnetic resonance imaging blood-oxygen-level-dependent (fMRI BOLD) activity
      related to disinhibition measured with the Stop Signal task will be assessed during a
      continuous infusion of alcohol, clamping the arterial Breath Alcohol Concentration (aBAC) at
      60 mg% for approximately one hour. It will be examined whether this fMRI BOLD activity is
      associated with the initial drinking trajectories and the alcohol consumption at age 18 and
      at age 20 identified in specific aim 1. Furthermore, fMRI will be used with the Taylor
      Aggression Paradigm to determine which brain areas mediate increased physical aggression
      during the same continuous infusion of alcohol as described above. All participants will
      undergo an alcohol and a placebo fMRI session.

    <description>Intravenous infusion of 6% ethanol in half-normal saline for approximately 1 hour: The dosage is controlled by a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of alcohol distribution and elimination, developed by O'Connor and his associates at the Indiana Alcohol Research Center (IARC) (Ramchandani et al, 1999). PBPK Parameters that determine the dosage and frequency of the infusion for a specific individual are estimated by means of morphometric variables (age, height, weight and gender).</description>
