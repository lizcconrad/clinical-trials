      The overall aim of Healthy Bodies, Healthy Hearts research study is to promote physical
      activity in women aged 45-65 years to promote reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The
      investigators are conducting an intervention for 12 weeks that promotes physical activity
      through support groups, group exercise sessions or through information that is given at the
      baseline appointment. Participants will be randomly assigned to a group.
