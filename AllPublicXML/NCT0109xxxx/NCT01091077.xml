  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus when it leaves the cells in the liver is bound to a type of fat. An
      component of grapefruit could block this fat and thus lower the amount of virus in the blood
      stream. We propose that treatment with this ingredient, called naringenin, could be used to
      block this fat and HCV in persons infected with hepatitis C.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hepatitis C virus is actively secreted by the liver of infected patients while bound to
      very low density lipoprotein (vLDL). The grapefruit flavonoid naringenin could be used to
      block vLDL secretion and lower the circulating viral titer.

      Hypothesis:

      Treatment with naringenin will block vLDL and HCV secretion in persons infected with HCV.

      Primary Objective

      To study the safety and pharmacokinetics of a single-dose of naringenin

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To study the changes in circulating HCV titers during the transition from a fasted to
           fed state.

        2. To study the changes in circulating HCV titers after administration of the grapefruit
           flavonoid naringenin.

        3. To study effects of naringenin on vLDL secretion.

      This is a single-arm, cross over study where placebo is administered during a transition from
      a fasted to a fed state, then the protocol is repeated with a single dose of naringenin plus
      cyclodextrin, using the previous measurements as his/her own control
