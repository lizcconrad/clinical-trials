    <textblock>
      Development of myocardial ischemia, and/or myocarditis would induce different changes in
      myocardial contraction behavior pattern,which maybe very subtle, and may not be detected by
      the 2D and m-mode echocardiography examinations. According to tissue Doppler imaging(TDI),
      they can be depicted by different models of echo with higher frame rates. In addition, many
      studies using TDI have significantly contributed of efforts to evaluate systolic and
      diastolic function and prognosis.

      This study assess the value of the indices of left ventricular function obtained by using TDI
      in patient with coronary artery disease(CAD). We hypothesized that TDI will add incremental
      value for regional wall motion abnormality of CAD and its prognosis.
