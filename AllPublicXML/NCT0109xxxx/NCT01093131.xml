  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increased risk for contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients with chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) has been established. Current and
      historical data on CIN prevention strategies have shown wide variation with respect to the
      optimal type, route and timing of these therapies. We investigate the role for oral hydration
      and/or oral sodium bicarbonate administration compared to intravenous hydration and/or sodium
      bicarbonate in patients with CKD undergoing CAG.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center study randomizing patients with CKD undergoing CAG into 4 groups: 1)
      Intravenous normal saline, 2) Intravenous normal saline and intravenous bicarbonate, 3) oral
      hydration, and 4) oral hydration and oral bicarbonate. The primary endpoint was the
      occurrence of contrast-medium-induced nephropathy defined as greater than 25% increase in
      serum creatinine from baseline or an absolute increase of 0.5 mg/dL from baseline at 72 hours
      following exposure to radiocontrast. Secondary endpoints include the length of
      hospitalization and in-house mortality.
