  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HCV002TV is a Phase I study to ascertain the safety and immunogenicity of a novel vaccine
      against Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in chronically infected patients. The vaccine is based on the
      sequential delivery, by intramuscular route, of two different adenoviral vectors, of
      chimpanzee and human origin respectively, bearing the same genetic information for HCV
      antigens (NS region).

      The two recombinant vaccine vectors, called AdCh3NSmut and Ad6NSmut, are weakened and unable
      to multiply within the body; they are designed to induce an immune response against HCV
      proteins. AdCh3NSmut and Ad6NSmut are being used in the ongoing HCV001 study in healthy
      volunteers with very good safety and immunogenicity results.

      HCV002TV is a dose-escalation study; the AdCh3NSmut is administered as priming vaccination
      and Ad6NSmut as boosting vaccination.

      The trial includes:

        -  Arm A, in which vaccinated patients are into Interferon-ribavirin therapy (the gold
           standard therapy for hepatitis C);

        -  Arm B, in which vaccinated patients are not into therapy.

               -  For women of child bearing potential, willingness to practice continuous
                  effective contraception during the study and a negative pregnancy test on the
                  day(s) of vaccination

               -  For men to use barrier contraception until three months after the last

               -  Seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)

               -  Seropositive for HIV (antibodies to HIV) at screening

                  screening

               -  Seropositive for human adenovirus 6 (antibodies to Ad6) at titres &gt;200, at
                  screening

               -  Any other significant disease, disorder or finding, which, in the opinion of the
                  Investigator, may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the
                  study, or may influence the result of the study, or the patient's ability to
                  participate in the study

               -  Any other finding which in the opinion of the investigators would significantly
                  increase the risk of having an adverse outcome from participating in the protocol
