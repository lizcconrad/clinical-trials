    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study evaluates the efficacy and safety of a
      weekly dose of albiglutide as compared with sitagliptin. Subjects who are renally impaired
      with a historical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and whose glycemia is inadequately
      controlled on their current regimen of diet and exercise or their antidiabetic therapy of
      metformin, thiazolidinedione, sulfonylurea, or any combination of these oral antidiabetic
      medications will be recruited into the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over a 2- to 3-month period. The Baseline HbA1c value is defined as the last non-missing value before the start of treatment. Change from Baseline in HbA1c was calculated as the value at Week 26 minus the value at Baseline. The analysis was performed using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group, region, history of prior myocardial infarction (yes versus no), and age category (&lt;65 years versus &gt;=65 years) as factors and Baseline HbA1c as a continuous covariate. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing post-Baseline on-treatment measurement was used to impute the missing measurement. If a participant had missing observation(s) immediately after Baseline, the Baseline observation was not carried forward and was left as missing.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The FPG test measures blood sugar levels after the participant has not eaten (fasted) for 12 to 14 hours. The Baseline FPG value is define as the last non-missing value before the start of treatment. Change from Baseline in FBG was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. The LOCF method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing post-Baseline on-treatment measurement was used to impute the missing measurement. If a participant had missing observation(s) immediately after Baseline, the Baseline observation was not carried forward and was left as missing. Participants were analyzed in a particular treatment week if they had received at least one dose in that treatment week. Based on ANCOVA: Change = treatment + Baseline FPG + renal impairment + prior myocardial infarction history + age category + region.</description>

    <description>Sparse population pharmacokinetic (PK) data were collected for population PK and PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses. Participants (par.) who received albiglutide were initiated on a 30 mg weekly dosing regimen. Beginning at Week 4, uptitration of albiglutide was allowed based on glycemic parameters. As such, albiglutide plasma conc. achieved at each sampling time represent a mixed population of par. who received either 30 mg or 50 mg weekly for various durations. The PK and PK/PD of albiglutide were characterized using a population modeling approach. Mean albiglutide plasma conc. observed at Weeks 8 and 16 are presented. Par. came to the clinic at Weeks 8 and 16 without taking albiglutide/matching placebo. The pre-dose PK sample was taken immediately prior to dosing. The Week 8 post-dose sample was taken between Weeks 8 and 10, &gt;=2 days after a dose of medication. The Week 16 post-dose PK sample was taken any time between Weeks 16 and 20, &gt;=2 days after the previous dose of albiglutide.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible participants entered into 2 weeks of Pre-screening and Screening; 4 weeks of Run-in/stabilization; 52-week Treatment Period for evaluation of efficacy and safety and 8 weeks of post treatment Follow-up. A total of 771 participants were screened, 507 were randomized and 495 received at least one dose of study treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Albiglutide 30 mg</title>
          <description>Participants received albiglutide 30 milligrams (mg) once weekly subcutaneously from Baseline until Week 52, with optional up-titration to 50 mg if additional glycemic control was required. Albiglutide was injected subcutaneously into the abdomen, on alternating right and left sides of the body. Participants also received sitagliptin matching placebo once daily orally. Participants who qualified for hyperglycemia rescue, on or after Week 2, continued in the study after rescue and continued to receive study treatment until study completion.</description>

        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>Sitagliptin 100 mg</title>
          <description>Participants with normal renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &gt;89 milliliters per minute [mL/min]) received a sitagliptin 100 mg overcoated tablet once daily orally from Baseline until Week 52. The dose of sitagliptin was adjusted in a range of 25-100 mg based on the participant’s severity of renal impairment using the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula. Participants also received albiglutide matching placebo once weekly subcutaneously from Baseline until Week 52. Albiglutide matching placebo was injected subcutaneously into the abdomen, on alternating right and left sides of the body. Participants who qualified for hyperglycemia rescue, on or after Week 2, continued in the study after rescue and continued to receive study treatment until study completion.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 26</title>
        <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over a 2- to 3-month period. The Baseline HbA1c value is defined as the last non-missing value before the start of treatment. Change from Baseline in HbA1c was calculated as the value at Week 26 minus the value at Baseline. The analysis was performed using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group, region, history of prior myocardial infarction (yes versus no), and age category (&lt;65 years versus &gt;=65 years) as factors and Baseline HbA1c as a continuous covariate. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing post-Baseline on-treatment measurement was used to impute the missing measurement. If a participant had missing observation(s) immediately after Baseline, the Baseline observation was not carried forward and was left as missing.</description>

Albiglutide was injected subcutaneously into the abdomen, on alternating right and left sides of the body. Participants also received sitagliptin matching placebo once daily orally. Participants who qualified for hyperglycemia rescue, on or after Week 2, continued in the study after rescue and continued to receive study treatment until study completion.</description>

The dose of sitagliptin was adjusted in a range of 25-100 mg based on the participant’s severity of renal impairment using the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula. Participants also received albiglutide matching placebo once weekly subcutaneously from Baseline until Week 52.

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in HbA1c at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 26, 36, 48, and Week 52: Observed Cases</title>
        <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over a 2- to 3-month period. The Baseline HbA1c value is defined as the last non-missing value before the start of treatment. Change from Baseline in HbA1c was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. The Observed Cases (OC) method (no imputation of missing data) was used. If a participant had missing observation(s) immediately after Baseline, the Baseline observation was not carried forward and was left as missing. Participants were analyzed in a particular treatment week if they had received at least one dose in that treatment week.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) at Week 26</title>
        <description>The FPG test measures blood sugar levels after the participant has not eaten (fasted) for 12 to 14 hours. The Baseline FPG value is define as the last non-missing value before the start of treatment. Change from Baseline in FBG was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. The LOCF method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing post-Baseline on-treatment measurement was used to impute the missing measurement. If a participant had missing observation(s) immediately after Baseline, the Baseline observation was not carried forward and was left as missing. Participants were analyzed in a particular treatment week if they had received at least one dose in that treatment week. Based on ANCOVA: Change = treatment + Baseline FPG + renal impairment + prior myocardial infarction history + age category + region.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 26, 36, 48, and Week 52: OC</title>
        <description>The FPG test measures blood sugar levels after the participant has not eaten (fasted) for 12 to 14 hours. The Baseline FPG value is defined as the last non-missing value prior to treatment. Change from Baseline in FBG was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. The OC method (no imputation of missing data) was used. If a participant had missing observation(s) immediately after Baseline, the Baseline observation was not carried forward and was left as missing. Participants were analyzed in a particular treatment week if they had received at least one dose in that treatment week.</description>

          <description>The number of participants who a clinically meaningful improvement from Baseline in the HbA1c response level of &gt;=1.0%, &gt;=1.5%, and &gt;=2.0% at Week 26 were assessed. The LOCF method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing post-Baseline on-treatment measurement was used to impute the missing measurement. If a participant had missing observation(s) immediately after Baseline, the Baseline observation was not carried forward and was left as missing.</description>

        <title>Time to Hyperglycemic Rescue Through Week 52</title>
        <description>Hyperglycemic rescue was defined as meeting one of the following criteria, confirmed by a second sample drawn within 7 days and analyzed by the central laboratory: for the Week 2 to Week 4 visit, a single FPG value &gt;=280 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL); for the &gt;Week 4 and &lt;Week 12 visits, a single FPG value &gt;=250 mg/dL and previous titration for &gt;=4 weeks; for the &gt;=Week 12 and &lt;Week 26 visits, HbA1c &gt;=8.5% and a &lt;=0.5% reduction from Baseline and previous titration for &gt;=4 weeks; for the &gt;=Week 26 and &lt;Week 48 visits, HbA1c &gt;=8.5% and previous titration for &gt;=4 weeks; for the &gt;=Week 48 and &lt;Week 52 visits, HbA1c &gt;=8.0% and previous titration for &gt;=4 weeks. Time to hyperglycemia rescue is the time between the date of first dose and the date of hyperglycemia rescue plus 1 day, or the time between the date of first dose and the date of last visit during active treatment period plus 1 day for participants not requiring rescue. This time is divided by 7 to express the result in weeks.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Body Weight at Week 26: LOCF</title>
        <description>Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline weight minus the Baseline weight. The Baseline weight value is defined as the last non-missing value prior to treatment. This analysis used the LOCF method for missing post-Baseline weight values. Weight values obtained after hyperglycemia rescue werre treated as missing and were replaced with pre-rescue values. Based on ANCOVA: Change = treatment + Baseline weight + renal impairment + prior myocardial infarction history + age category + region.</description>

This analysis used observed weight values excluding those obtained after hyperglycemia rescue; no missing data imputation was performed.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline; Week 1, Week 2 , Week 3, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, Week 26, Week 36, Week 48, and Week 52</time_frame>
        <population>ITT Population. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles). Different participants may have been analyzed at different time points, so the overall number of participants analyzed reflects everyone in the ITT Population.</population>

        <description>Sparse population pharmacokinetic (PK) data were collected for population PK and PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses. Participants (par.) who received albiglutide were initiated on a 30 mg weekly dosing regimen. Beginning at Week 4, uptitration of albiglutide was allowed based on glycemic parameters. As such, albiglutide plasma conc. achieved at each sampling time represent a mixed population of par. who received either 30 mg or 50 mg weekly for various durations. The PK and PK/PD of albiglutide were characterized using a population modeling approach. Mean albiglutide plasma conc. observed at Weeks 8 and 16 are presented. Par. came to the clinic at Weeks 8 and 16 without taking albiglutide/matching placebo. The pre-dose PK sample was taken immediately prior to dosing. The Week 8 post-dose sample was taken between Weeks 8 and 10, &gt;=2 days after a dose of medication. The Week 16 post-dose PK sample was taken any time between Weeks 16 and 20, &gt;=2 days after the previous dose of albiglutide.</description>
