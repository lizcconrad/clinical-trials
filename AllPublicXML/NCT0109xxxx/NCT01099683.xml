  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 26 healthy elderly male and female subjects will receive both 10 mg NRL001 in a 2
      g rectal suppository and placebo in this double-blind, cross-over study. The order of
      treatment will be randomised, with a minimum washout period of 3 days between doses. An end
      of study assessment will be conducted at least 7 days after administration of the last
      treatment.

      The pharmacokinetics of NRL001 will be determined prior to, and after, dosing.
      Pharmacodynamics will be examined using a three lead Holter monitor during both treatment
      periods. Adverse Events, vital signs, ECGs and clinical laboratory parameters will be
      collected, tabulated, reviewed and recorded throughout the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Volunteers will be included in the study if they satisfy the following criteria:

          -  Healthy adult male or female volunteers (as determined by medical history, physical
             examination, laboratory test values, vital signs and electrocardiograms [ECGs] at
             screening) aged ≥65 years.

          -  Non-smokers from 3 months before receiving the first dose and for the duration of the
             study.
