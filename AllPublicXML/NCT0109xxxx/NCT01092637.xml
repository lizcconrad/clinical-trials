  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia following
      perinatal asphyxia on neurological and neuropsychological outcomes and also to assess
      academic attainment and any additional health, societal or educational costs associated with
      changes in outcome as a result of the intervention. This study will determine whether the
      apparent initial benefits of cooling are maintained in the longer term.

      Perinatal asphyxia (a lack of oxygen occurring around the time of birth) may have long term
      consequences on brain functioning, which may be altered by treatment with hypothermia
      (cooling). Currently, there is no information on the effect of cooling on outcome beyond 18
      months of age. We intend to assess at 6 - 7 years of age, the children that participated in
      the TOBY trial of whole body cooling following perinatal asphyxia and compare between the
      children that had received the cooling treatment soon after birth and those that were not
      treated with cooling, the number that survived with an intelligence quotient (IQ) greater
      than 84, the presence and severity of disabilities, educational attainment and the economic
      impact on families and service providers. If possible, children will be assessed in their
      school, with the option of alternative venues such as home or clinic if required.

      During the assessment a paediatrician will conduct a neurological examination. A psychologist
      will administer psychometric tests to evaluate cognitive, behavioural and motor development.
      Questionnaires completed by parents and teachers will complete the data collection. Economic
      factors will also be assessed in the parent questionnaire.

      Each child will have contact with the assessors during one school day with appropriate
      breaks. Assessments will take place over a period of 3 years.
