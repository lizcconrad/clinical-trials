  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to test the hypothesis that 1) a single dose of zinc cysteine in a
      proprietary gastro-retentive form will produce sustained blood levels of zinc giving a larger
      bioavailable amount of zinc than an FDA approved preparation of inorganic zinc acetate; and
      2) that the zinc cysteine gastro-retentive, sustained-release preparation will be better
      tolerated with significantly less gastrointestinal side effects than the zinc acetate
      capsules. The trial also tests the hypothesis that, after 6 months of once daily
      administration, the zinc cysteine subjects will show reduced serum non-ceruloplasmin copper.
      Additionally, subjects will perform tests of mental function,including the dementia rating
      scale, the Mini Mental Status Examination and the ADAS-cognitive performance test aimed at
      Alzheimer's status assessment. Tests will be administered at baseline, 3 and 6 months, and
      the performance results compared. Care-giver assessments will also be noted.

      This multi-center study aims to determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a
      novel gastro-retentive, sustained-release zinc cysteine preparation on the blood and urine
      measures of copper and zinc balance in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.
      Data expected to be derived include tolerability of the novel preparation in comparison with
      oral inorganic zinc salt, and long-term effects on primarily blood-measured copper-zinc
      balance. The study design is that of a prospective, randomized, double blind
      placebo-controlled clinical trial, with a duration for individual subjects of 6 months. The
      study will be performed at a total of 3 sites, under the direction of a single principal
      investigator, with a sub-investigator. The statistical plan calls for a comparison of data
      from the two long-term parallel groups using ANOVA and other applicable techniques. In
      addition to blood parameters, mental function assessments obtained at baseline, 3 and 6
      months will be evaluated statistically.

    <description>All subjects will perform standard and standardized tests of mental function, ranging from a general dementia rating scale (Mini Mental Status Exam) to more Alzheimer's specific tests (ADAS-cognitive). Daily living and caregiver assessments of overall daily functioning will be noted. Test results will be compared statistically in a two-point fashion, and correlated with biometal ststus.</description>
