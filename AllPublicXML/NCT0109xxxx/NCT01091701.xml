      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous ex vivo cultured adult
      allogenic mesenchymal stem cells in patients with ischemic cerebral stroke. Patient will be
      given single intravenous dose of allogenic mesenchymal stem cells 2 million cells/Kg body
      weight or placebo within 10 days of stroke. Patients will be followed up till 12 months.
      Safety will be evaluated by type, number and proportion of patients with adverse events.
      Efficacy will be evaluated by clinical parameters and MRI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age between 20 and 80 years old

          -  MRS equal to or less than 4.

          -  Full functional independence before present stroke.

          -  Patients will be included within the time frame of 10 days after an acute cerebral
             ischemic episode. This time period refers to the date of dosing.

          -  Neuro-imaging examination showing ischemic cerebral infarct.

          -  CT or MRI brain scanning has reliably excluded both intracranial haemorrhage and
             structural brain lesions which can mimic stroke (e.g. cerebral tumour)

          -  Stroke symptoms are to be present for at least 30 minutes and have not improved before
             treatment. Symptoms must be distinguishable from an episode of generalized ischemia
             (i.e. syncope), seizure, or migraine disorder. Patients should have motor weakness
             following the acute cerebral ischemic episode.

          -  Able to comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Haematological causes of stroke

          -  Evidence of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) on the CT-scan.

          -  Severe stroke as assessed clinically (e.g. MRS&gt;4).

          -  Subjects who are unlikely to complete the infusion of investigational product and/or
             are unlikely to undergo active medical management during that period due to a severe
             clinical condition

          -  Previous intra-cranial hemorrhage, neoplasm, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or arterial
             venous malformation, intra cranial surgery or radiological evidence of previous
             cerebral stroke with clinical manifestation.

          -  History of central nervous system damage (i.e. neoplasm, aneurysm, intracranial or
             spinal surgery)

          -  Size and location of the cerebral infarct cannot be determined.

          -  Comatose / clinically unstable

          -  Serious, pre-existing medical conditions such as bleeding disorders (eg. leukopenia,
             thrombocytopenia) septicemia, TB, hepatic dysfunction (&gt; 2.5 times the ULN of hepatic
             function tests) and renal dysfunction (Serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl).

          -  Disease or impairment that precludes adequate neurological exam

          -  Hypo- or hyperglycaemia sufficient to account for the neurological symptoms; the
             patient should be excluded if their blood glucose is &lt; 3.0 or &gt; 20.0mmol/L.

          -  The patient is female and of childbearing potential (unless it is certain that
             pregnancy is not possible) or breast feeding.

          -  Patient is likely to be unavailable for follow-up e.g. no fixed home address

          -  Patients with evidence of life threatening infection or life threatening illness (e.g.
             advanced cancer) or having tested positive for HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and VDRL

          -  Patient was already dependent in activities of daily living before the present acute
             stroke

          -  Patients who have been included in any other clinical trial within the previous month

          -  History of neoplasia or other comorbidity that could impact patient's short-term
             survival

          -  Previous or concomitant treatment with immune modulators or experimental drugs 60 days
             prior to study enrolment

          -  Any condition that in the judgment of the investigator would place the patient under
             undue risk

          -  Sustained systolic BP &gt;220 mmHg, or &lt;80mmHg, or diastolic BP &gt; 140mmHg or &lt;50 mmHg.

          -  Patients contraindicated for MRI examination.
