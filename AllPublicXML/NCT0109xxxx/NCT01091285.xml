  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled double blinded study to investigate whether a specially designed
      double balloon catheter is more efficient than a foley catheter for cervical ripening and
      induction of birth.

      160 women with singleton term pregnancies with un ripe cervix and no contraindications for
      catheters will be included and randomized to either double og single balloon catheters for
      cervical ripening. Efficacy wil be assessed at removal of the catheter, measured by the
      amount of women where the cervix has become ripe enough for amniotomy.

      Our hypothesis is that double balloon catheters will give a greater amount of women where
      amniotomy upon catheter removal is possible. Secondary outcomes as time from induction till
      birth, vaginal deliveries and complications during or after birth for the mother or child
      will also become recorded.
