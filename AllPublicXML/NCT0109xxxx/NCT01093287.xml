  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a recent multicenter randomized controlled trial, prolonged administration of low-dose
      methylprednisolone (1mg/kg/day) initiated in early acute respiratory distress syndrome was
      associated with earlier resolution of pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction and
      reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay. However,
      glucocorticoids may induce serious adverse events and these adverse events might compensate
      the positive effect of prolonged methylprednisolone infusion and discourage physicians from
      treating acute respiratory distress syndrome patients with glucocorticoids. Early prediction
      of responsiveness to prolonged methylprednisolone infusion would be help to decide whether to
      continue or not prolonged methylprednisolone infusion and this could reduce the drug related
      adverse events. We project to evaluate the predictors of responsiveness to prolonged
      methylprednisolone infusion in early acute respiratory distress syndrome .
