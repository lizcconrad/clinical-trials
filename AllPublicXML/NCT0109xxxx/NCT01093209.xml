      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of the interferential laser therapy in
      the wrist and hand pain and disability reduction and force improvement in the carpal tunnel
      syndrome. Subjects are patients diagnosed of carpal tunnel syndrome who have been prescribed
      laser therapy. Settings: Ramon y Cajal Hospital. Department of Rehabilitation. Physical
      therapy unit. Electrotherapy section. Occupational Therapy. Department of Neurology.

      The spatiotemporal superposition of two independent and opposite beams of laser generates a
      constructive interference pattern that increases the therapeutic effects in the irradiated
      tissue. Patient suffering pain from diagnosed carpal tunnel syndrome will receive
      conventional or interferential laser therapy. This is a comparative randomized and double
      blind clinical study. Two identical lasers in near infrared range will be used. Frequency of
      sessions: daily. Irradiated technique: manual, contact and punctual. Pain will be evaluated
      by visual analog scale at rest and during analytical wrist movement. Disability will be
      evaluated by the DASH and BOSTON questionnaire. Evaluation will take place at pre and
      post-treatment times.
