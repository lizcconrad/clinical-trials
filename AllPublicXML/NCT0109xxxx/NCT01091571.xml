  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During sepsis and septic shock the immune response can be overwhelming leading to excessive
      tissue damage, organ failure and death. Ideally, the inflammatory response is modulated
      leading to both adequate protection to invading pathogens as well as limitation of an
      exuberant immune response. In the last few years adenosine is proposed to have a central role
      in the modulation of inflammation. In unfavorable conditions such as hypoxia, ischemia or
      inflammation adenosine is quickly up-regulated; with concentrations up to tenfold in septic
      patients. Many animal studies have shown that adenosine is able to attenuate the inflammatory
      response and decrease mortality rates. Therefore, pharmacological elevation of the adenosine
      concentration is an potential target to attenuate inflammation and limit organ injury.
      Dipyridamole, an adenosine re-uptake inhibitor is able to increase the adenosine
      concentration and limit ischemia-reperfusion injury. In order to study the effects of
      dipyridamole on the inflammatory response we aim to use the so called human endotoxemia
      model. This model permits elucidation of key players in the immune response to a gram
      negative stimulus in vivo, therefore serving as a useful tool to investigate potential novel
      therapeutic strategies in a standardized setting.
