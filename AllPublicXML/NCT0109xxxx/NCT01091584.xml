    <textblock>
      The use of interventions for cancer-related distress is important to reduce this distress.
      Distress has a negative impact on quality of life, the recovery during and after treatment
      and may even adversely affect survival. There is insufficient attention to the systematic
      approach to psychosocial problems in cancer patients in the Netherlands. A task force
      discussed and studied which instrument measures psychosocial problems best. The distress
      thermometer (&quot;lastmeter&quot;) had the best results. A guideline is written to use the distress
      thermometer for patients with cancer and will be used in hospitals in the Netherlands.
      However, it is not clear what the effects are of the use of the distress thermometer on the
      psychosocial wellbeing of the patient. Furthermore, it is also unknown whether the use of the
      distress thermometer leads to cost-effective care. The study focuses on the use of the
      distress thermometer in breast cancer patients. An efficiency study (RCT) will be conducted
      to evaluate the systematic use of the distress thermometer and its discussion by a nurse as
      compared to the usual care provided to outpatients who are treated with curative intent for
      breast cancer by their treating physicians. The clinical and economic impact of the use of
      the Distress thermometer will be assessed in comparison with usual care.The recruitment of
      patients will take place in the out-patient clinic of a university hospital. Patients will be
      followed from diagnose until two years after finishing their treatment.
