  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to recruit subjects scheduled for pancreatectomy as a treatment for pancreatic
      cancer. These subjects will ingest a very low dose of radiolabeled PhIP, a meat-derived
      carcinogen, and a small amount of resected tissue (waste) will be analyzed with highly
      sensitive technology to determine if this carcinogen binds to DNA in the pancreas.

    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is rapidly fatal in most cases and little is known about its causes.
      Identifying and modifying risk factors can reduce mortality through prevention. Carcinogens
      that form in meat cooked at high temperatures may be modifiable risk factors for pancreatic
      cancer, but direct evidence is needed to demonstrate involvement in pancreas tissue. We
      propose to recruit subjects scheduled for pancreatectomy as a treatment for pancreatic
      cancer. These subjects will ingest a very low dose of radiolabeled PhIP, a meat-derived
      carcinogen, and a small amount of resected tissue (waste) will be analyzed with highly
      sensitive technology to determine if this carcinogen binds to DNA in the pancreas. We
      hypothesize that the meat-derived carcinogen will bind to DNA in the pancreas. The amount of
      PhIP ingested is equivalent to the amount in two very well-done barbecued chicken breasts and
      the dose of radioactivity is comparable to a typical chest x-ray. This research can increase
      understanding of pancreatic carcinogenesis, facilitating the design of prevention strategies.

    <description>Prior to surgery, consented subjects will ingest a capsule containing [14C]PhIP. This amount of [14C]PhIP (84 micrograms PhIP; 15.6 micro-curies) is equivalent to that in 2 very well done grilled/barbecued chicken breasts (Sinha 1995); the amount of radioactivity is equivalent to the dose received in a commercial airline flying at 30,000 ft. for 5 h (HPS 2007) or to the amount received during a typical chest x-ray.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 18 years old.

          -  Adequate hepatic function within 4 weeks of study enrollment defined as bilirubin ≤ 2
             mg/dl and ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Females of childbearing potential or males whose partners are of child bearing
             potential are required to use an effective method of contraception (i.e., a hormonal
             contraceptive. intra-uterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with
             spermicide, or abstinence) during the study and for 4 months after PhIP
             administration.

          -  Voluntary written informed consent (PhIP consent and Caffeine assay consent) before
             performance of any study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the
             understanding that the subject may withdraw consent at any time without prejudice to
             future medical care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  CA-19-9 equal to or above 400.

          -  Tumor size &gt;3.5 cm.

          -  Fluid in the abdomen (ascites).

          -  Conditions present, which, in the opinion of the surgeon, could make resection
             difficult, e.g., extensive vascular involvement.

          -  Pregnant or lactating (for women).

          -  Uncontrolled cardiovascular disease; e.g. hypertension, angina, etc.

          -  Patients who are intolerant of a 200 mg dose of caffeine or who otherwise do not wish
             to participate in the caffeine assay when consent is sought for the primary consent
             will be considered refusers and will not be enrolled in the study.
