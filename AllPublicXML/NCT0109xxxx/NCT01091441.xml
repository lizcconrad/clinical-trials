    <textblock>
      The observatory consists of a row of data collection on a population composed of all patients
      with heart failure cared for in centers participating in the national education program for
      patients (named I-CARE) in the form of two groups. Patients who are undergoing a program of
      therapeutic education track are listed and included in the group of patients educated.
      Patients who receive no education or only a minimal element for any reason whatsoever are
      also listed and included in the group of patients who are not educated.

      The following of patients will be periodic after their entry in the observatory, up to 2
      years of follow up.

      The Center for patients with heart failure cared for in a center practicing therapeutic
      education dedicated to heart failure.

      The definition of heart failure selected for inclusion is that recommended by the European
      Society of Cardiology : presence of at least two signs or symptoms of heart failure (dyspnea,
      edema of the ankles crackles) at rest or during exercise associated with objective evidence
      (preferably by echocardiography) of cardiac dysfunction ( systolic and / or diastolic)
      (resting) and in case of doubt, a response to specific treatment of heart failure.

      All patients who are undergoing a program of therapeutic education track are listed and
      included in the group of patients educated.

      All patients who receive no education or only a minimal element for any reason whatsoever are
      also listed and included in the group of patients who are not educated.

      Follow up is done by CRAs at the French Society of Cardiology, by mailing and phone contacts.
