    <textblock>
      Clopidogrel resistance (CR) or low-responsiveness is associated with increased risk of
      ischemic events and can be detected by laboratory tests. This multicenter, randomized study
      is aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of intensive antiplatelet therapy (i.e. double
      clopidogrel maintenance dose and/or additional cilostazol)for patients with CR after coronary
      stenting.

    <description>Firstly,all patients in this group were received aspirin 300mg/d and clopidogrel 150mg/d for 3 days. Then a platelet aggregation function test was performed. The regimen will lasted for another 27 days if patients were judged as responsive to current clopidogrel dose. Patients still with clopidogrel resistance were then randomly assigned to receive clopidogrel 75mg/d plus cilostazol 100mg, twice per day or clopidogrel 150mg/d plus cilostazol 50mg, twice per day for 27 days. At 30-day, a repeat platelet aggregation function test wil performed for all patients. Then a standard dual antiplatelet regimen with aspirin 100mg/d indefinitely and clopidogrel 75mg/d for at least 1 year will be prescribed for all patients.</description>
