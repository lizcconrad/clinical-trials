  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) is a widely accepted treatment that has led to
      improved clinical outcomes for patients with refractory congestive heart failure (CHF),
      systolic dysfunction, and wide QRS duration. However, it requires implantation of an
      expensive device ($30,000) and about 1/3 of patients do not have clinical improvement.
      Inadequate amounts of LV dyssynchrony or suboptimal lead placement may limit clinical
      response. Dual-Source computed tomography (DSCT) allows for subtle detection during
      myocardial contraction for assessing LV dyssynchrony, and can also assess coronary venous
      anatomy and scar burden. Thus DSCT may be the ideal noninvasive modality to predict response
      to CRT.
