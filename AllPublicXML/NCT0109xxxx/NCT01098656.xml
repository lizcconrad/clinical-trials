      RATIONALE: Observation is watching a patient's condition but not giving treatment unless
      symptoms appear or change. Lenalidomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking blood
      flow to the cancer. It is not yet known whether observation or lenalidomide is more effective
      in treating patients who are in complete or partial response after receiving previous
      gemcitabine hydrochloride or doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
      or mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying observation to see how well it works
      compared with lenalidomide in treating patients who are in complete or partial response after
      receiving previous gemcitabine hydrochloride or doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome for stage
      IIB, stage III, or stage IV cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or stage IIB, stage III, or stage IV
      mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine if observation versus lenalidomide maintenance therapy after debulking with
           gemcitabine hydrochloride or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride with or
           without radiotherapy prolongs progression-free survival of patients with advanced stage
           IIIB or IV T-cell cutaneous lymphoma or mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome not previously
           treated with other intravenous chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to institution,
      response to debulking treatment (complete response vs partial response), and disease (mycosis
      fungoides [MF] vs erythrodermic MF/Sézary syndrome). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Beginning 4-6 weeks after completion of prior debulking therapy, patients undergo
           observation for 560 days.

        -  Arm II: Beginning 4-6 weeks after completion of prior debulking therapy, patients
           receive oral lenalidomide once a day on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
           20 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 12 weeks
      thereafter.
