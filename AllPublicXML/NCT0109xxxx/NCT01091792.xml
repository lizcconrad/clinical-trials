  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood samples will be obtained from newly diagnosed GBM patients treated with combined
      radiotherapy (RT), temozolomide (TMZ) and bevacizumab (BEV) at specific time points. The
      primary outcome is the shift in T reg cell fraction a defined by determining the proportion
      of CD4 cells that are CD4+ CD25.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent malignant brain tumor and it remains a
      lethal disease. Approximately 4 weeks post surgery for tumor resection, patients will proceed
      to standard of care treatment which currently consists of temozolomide (TMZ) with concurrent
      radiation therapy (RT) for 6 weeks. This study will add bevacizumab (BEV) to the standard of
      care regimen in newly diagnosed patients. The Bevacizumab will be added 2 weeks post start of
      RT/TMZ. Administration of bevacizumab will continue concurrently with TMZ every 2 weeks for
      12 months. Blood samples will be obtained from these patients at 3 different time points
      during this study.
