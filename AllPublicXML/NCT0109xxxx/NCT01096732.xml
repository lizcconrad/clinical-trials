  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is looking at the effect of a new drug called GDC-0449 in patients with
      cancer of the pancreas. Laboratory studies have shown that this drug blocks a process in
      pancreatic cells thought to be involved in cancer development and spread. This process is
      called the 'Hedgehog signalling pathway'. As yet, it is unclear whether blocking hedgehog
      signalling will directly affect the tumour cells themselves or the surrounding normal tissue.
      Understanding this distinction will help improve treatment strategies for pancreatic cancer.
      Patients will be offered to participate in this research study if they have localised
      pancreatic cancer that can be removed by surgery. In the period between diagnosis and surgery
      the investigators do not normally treat patients, however in this trial the investigators
      will ask patients to take GDC-0449 during the approximately two weeks until the day of
      surgery. All patients that enter this study will have undergone a diagnostic biopsy of the
      pancreatic tumour and the investigators will collect a second sample of the tumour at
      surgery. The main question of this study is whether the investigators can detect a change in
      hedgehog signalling in the normal tumour surrounding tissue. Furthermore the investigators
      will look very carefully whether this treatment is safe for patients. All problems before and
      after surgery will be carefully documented and the investigators have defined strict rules to
      stop the study if the investigators observe serious problems.
