  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gait disturbances are very common and are a major cause for losing of independency in
      patients with advanced Parkinson's Disease (PD). The medical treatment of gait disturbances
      in advanced PD is very difficult and in many cases the classical dopaminergic treatment has
      no clinical benefit or even can worsen the instability and increase falls. Rasagiline, a new
      MAO-B inhibitor who has recently been approved all over the world for the treatment of early
      and late stages PD has been suggested to have a special effect of gait in patients with
      advanced PD (LARGO sub-study).
