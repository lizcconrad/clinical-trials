  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The working hypothesis is that oral administration of an attenuated strain of Salmonella
      typhimurium is safe and efficacious for patients with unresectable hepatic metastasis from a
      solid tumor cancer. The primary objective of the study is to determine the MTD of Samonella
      typhimurium in the treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase I study will be done to evaluate a dose escalation scheme of oral administration
      of an attenuated strain of Salmonella typhimurium expressing human interleukin-2 (IL-2) in
      patients with unresectable hepatic metastases from a solid tumor cancer. Standard Phase I
      dose escalation scheme will be used to determine the MTD of Samonella typhimurium. Six dose
      levels of Salmonella will be studied with a minimum of 3 patients enrolled in a dose level.

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Samonella typhimurium</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 Weeks After Dose of Samonella typhimurium</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum tolerated dose will be determined by the number of patients with Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at a given dose level. DLT is defined as treatment related: Sepsis (salmonella) syndrome, Grade 4 vomiting or diarrhea, Other grade 3 or greater toxicity. If &gt; or = 2 patients at a dose level has a DLT, this level will be declared the MTD.</description>

    <measure>Efficacy of Salmonella typhimurium in Treating Unresectable Hepatic Metastases</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Weeks After Treatment with Salmonella typhir</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation is performed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories: Complete response (CR) the disappearance of all target lesion; Partial response (PR) at least a 30% decrease; Progressive disease (PD) at least a 20% increase, or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable disease (SD) neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease; early death from malignant disease; unknown (insufficient evaluation to determine response status).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic documentation of malignancy (any solid tumor type) that has spread to the
             liver and deemed unresectable, and for which no effective standard therapies are
             available. Patients with additional disease outside of the liver will be allowed.

          -  Patients may have received any number of other prior therapies; however at least 3
             weeks must have passed since last dose of chemotherapy or radiotherapy (6 weeks for
             Nitrosoureas or Mitomycin C) prior to study entry.

          -  Must have recovered from all acute toxicities (defined per National Cancer Institute's
             Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events 3.0 ≤ grade 1) associated with previous
             treatment.
