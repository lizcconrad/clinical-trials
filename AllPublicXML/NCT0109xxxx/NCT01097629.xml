  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study to test the hypothesis that suvorexant (MK-4305) is superior to
      placebo in improving insomnia as measured by change from baseline in: subjective total sleep
      time and time to sleep onset, wake time after persistent sleep onset, and latency to onset of
      persistent sleep.

    <measure>Suvorexant HD Versus Placebo: Change From Baseline in Mean Subjective Total Sleep Time (sTSTm) at Month 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>sTSTm is the average over a defined day range of the participant's report of the total amount of time spent asleep before waking for the day, as recorded in a daily electronic diary (e-diary). Averages were derived by taking the mean of all available daily measurements (excluding the mornings following any polysomnography [PSG] nights) falling within the day range; Month 1 range is Days 23-30 (Day 1 is day of first double-blind dose). A participant must have at least 3 days of data during the defined day range to calculate an average for the day range; otherwise, the mean value was considered missing for that day range. The baseline value is the mean of the last 7 daily measurements obtained during the placebo Run-in period.</description>

    <measure>Suvorexant HD Versus Placebo: Change From Baseline in Wakefulness After Persistent Sleep Onset (WASO) at Month 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>WASO is measured during overnight sleep laboratory (PSG) assessments at baseline, Night 1, Month 1 and Month 3, and is defined as the duration of wakefulness from the onset of persistent sleep (i.e., 10 consecutive minutes of sleep) to the end of PSG assessment the following morning. Beginning of PSG assessment (&quot;Lights-Off&quot;) is at approximately the participant's habitual bedtime. The participant is awakened, or allowed to get out of bed if already awake, after 8 hours of PSG recording (&quot;Lights-On&quot;). PSG assessments consist of electronic measurement of brain activity and eye and muscle movements. PSG data was scored by a Centralized PSG reading center.</description>

        <title>Suvorexant HD Versus Placebo: Change From Baseline in Mean Subjective Total Sleep Time (sTSTm) at Month 1</title>
        <description>sTSTm is the average over a defined day range of the participant's report of the total amount of time spent asleep before waking for the day, as recorded in a daily electronic diary (e-diary). Averages were derived by taking the mean of all available daily measurements (excluding the mornings following any polysomnography [PSG] nights) falling within the day range; Month 1 range is Days 23-30 (Day 1 is day of first double-blind dose). A participant must have at least 3 days of data during the defined day range to calculate an average for the day range; otherwise, the mean value was considered missing for that day range. The baseline value is the mean of the last 7 daily measurements obtained during the placebo Run-in period.</description>

        <description>WASO is measured during overnight sleep laboratory (PSG) assessments at baseline, Night 1, Month 1 and Month 3, and is defined as the duration of wakefulness from the onset of persistent sleep (i.e., 10 consecutive minutes of sleep) to the end of PSG assessment the following morning. Beginning of PSG assessment (&quot;Lights-Off&quot;) is at approximately the participant's habitual bedtime. The participant is awakened, or allowed to get out of bed if already awake, after 8 hours of PSG recording (&quot;Lights-On&quot;). PSG assessments consist of electronic measurement of brain activity and eye and muscle movements. PSG data was scored by a Centralized PSG reading center.</description>

        <title>Suvorexant HD Versus Placebo: Change From Baseline in WASO at Month 3</title>
        <description>WASO is measured during overnight sleep laboratory (PSG) assessments at baseline, Night 1, Month 1 and Month 3, and is defined as the duration of wakefulness from the onset of persistent sleep (i.e., 10 consecutive minutes of sleep) to the end of PSG assessment the following morning. Beginning of PSG assessment (&quot;Lights-Off&quot;) is at approximately the participant's habitual bedtime. The participant is awakened, or allowed to get out of bed if already awake, after 8 hours of PSG recording (&quot;Lights-On&quot;). PSG assessments consist of electronic measurement of brain activity and eye and muscle movements. PSG data was scored by a Centralized PSG reading center.</description>

        <title>Suvorexant HD Versus Placebo: Change From Baseline in Mean Subjective Time to Sleep Onset (sTSOm) at Month 1</title>
        <description>sTSOm is the average over a defined day range of the participant's report of the duration of time that it took to fall asleep, as recorded in a daily e-diary. Averages were derived by taking the mean of all available daily measurements (excluding the mornings following any PSG nights) falling within the day range; Month 1 range is Days 23-30 (Day 1 is day of first double-blind dose). A participant must have at least 3 days of data during the defined day range to calculate an average for the day range; otherwise, the mean value was considered missing for that day range.

The participant is awakened, or allowed to get out of bed if already awake, after 8 hours of PSG recording (&quot;Lights-On&quot;).

        <title>Suvorexant HD Versus Placebo: Change From Baseline in sTSTm at Week 1</title>
        <description>sTSTm is the average over a defined day range of the participant's report of the total amount of time spent asleep before waking for the day, as recorded in a daily e-diary. Averages were derived by taking the mean of all available daily measurements (excluding the mornings following any PSG nights) falling within the day range; Week 1 range is Days 2-8 (Day 1 is day of first double-blind dose). A participant must have at least 3 days of data during the defined day range to calculate an average for the day range; otherwise, the mean value was considered missing for that day range. The baseline value is the mean of the last 7 daily measurements obtained during the placebo Run-in period.</description>

          <title>Suvorexant HD Versus Placebo: Change From Baseline in sTSOm at Week 1</title>
          <description>sTSOm is the average over a defined day range of the participant's report of the duration of time that it took to fall asleep, as recorded in a daily e-diary. Averages were derived by taking the mean of all available daily measurements (excluding the mornings following any PSG nights) falling within the day range; Week 1 range is Days 2-8 (Day 1 is day of first double-blind dose). A participant must have at least 3 days of data during the defined day range to calculate an average for the day range; otherwise, the mean value was considered missing for that day range. The baseline value is the mean of the last 7 daily measurements obtained during the placebo Run-in period.</description>
          <population>Randomized participants with ≥1 post-randomization e-diary observation after ≥1 dose of study drug, and baseline data were included in this analysis. The hypothesis included only the suvorexant HD-placebo comparison.</population>

        <title>Suvorexant HD Versus Placebo: Change From Baseline in LPS at Night 1</title>
        <description>LPS is measured during overnight sleep laboratory (PSG) assessments at baseline, Night 1, Month 1 and Month 3, and is defined as the duration of time from the beginning of PSG assessment (&quot;Lights-Off&quot;) to the first interval of 10 consecutive minutes of sleep. Beginning of PSG assessment (&quot;Lights-Off&quot;) is at approximately the participant's habitual bedtime. The participant is awakened, or allowed to get out of bed if already awake, after 8 hours of PSG recording (&quot;Lights-On&quot;). PSG assessments consist of electronic measurement of brain activity and eye and muscle movements. PSG data was scored by a Centralized PSG reading center.</description>
