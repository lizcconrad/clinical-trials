      A pilot study to assess the feasibility of unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation
      with coinfusion of third-party mesenchymal stem cells after myeloablative or nonmyeloablative
      conditioning in patients with hematological malignancies.

      This is a multicenter single arm, phase I-II pilot study. The primary objective of this study
      is to determine the feasibility of UCB HSCT with co-infusion of third party mesenchymal stem
      cells as assessed by the treatment-related mortality at d100 after transplant.

      Patient inclusion criteria:

      Age 15-60 yrs Patients for whom allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the preferred
      treatment option, with the following hematological malignancies:acute myeloid leukemia, acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia, high risk myelodysplastic syndrome, advanced lymphoproliferative
      disorders, chronic myeloid leukemia (refractory or intolerant to second-line tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors), multiple myeloma Informed consent given Patient exclusion criteria Previous
      allogeneic transplant Progressive malignant disease Significant organ damage as a
      contraindication to allotransplantation Significant psychiatric or neurological disorder
      Uncontrolled viral, fungal or bacterial infection Pregnancy HIV positive Patients will
      receive either myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning. One or 2 cord blood
      transplants will be transplanted, followed by infusion of a third-party mesenchymal stem cell
      transplant Adverse event reporting BHS transplant committee will establish a protocol review
      committee which will organize a central monitoring of the study. Within the context of
      allogeneic HSCTx many severe events are likely to occur.

      Statistics and stopping rules The trial will be stopped at any time that there is reasonable
      evidence that the true rate of day +100 nonrelapse mortality exceeds 0.40. It is the
      intention to include an initial 20 patients.

      PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS

      Title of the study A pilot study to assess the feasibility of unrelated umbilical cord blood
      transplantation with coinfusion of third-party mesenchymal stem cells after myeloablative or
      nonmyeloablative conditioning in patients with hematological malignancies.

      Design of the study This is a multicenter single arm, phase I-II pilot study.

      Primary objective The primary objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of UCB
      HSCT with co-infusion of third party mesenchymal stem cells as assessed by the
      treatment-related mortality at d100 after transplant.
