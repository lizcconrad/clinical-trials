    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and tolerance of acupuncture treatment
      compared with pharmacologic treatment in patients with chronic migraines.Besides, the
      investigators tested whether the clinical effects of acupuncture in chronic migraine
      prophylaxis are mediated by changes of the plasma CGRP (Calcitonin gene-related peptide).

      Subjects who completed the prospective baseline periods and meet met the prespecified entry
      criteria will be randomized into 2 groups: acupuncture treatment, and topiramate treatment
      group.

      Subjects will be allowed to continue taking acute migraine medications for the treatment of
      breakthrough attacks during the trial, but any migraine preventive medications will be
      prohibited.

      Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before entering the study.

    <description>Each patient had a fixed and classic acupuncture points Ex-HN-3,BL-2,GB-20,EX-HN-5 bilaterally in their 24 sessions.
Acupuncture consisted of 24 sessions of 30 min duration, administrated over 12 weeks (two sessions per week).
Sterile disposable and steel needle (3210) were used .
The needles were manipulated by rotation methods to produce a characteristic sensation know as De Qi.</description>

    <description>The patients were submitted to the topiramate treatment also for 12 consecutive weeks.
The study phase consists of a 4-week titration and a 8-week maintenance period.
All dosages of topiramate will be initiated at 25 mg/d hs and increased by 25 mg/d weekly to a maximum of 100 mg/day (or to the maximal tolerated dose).
Study drug was administered daily in equally divided twice daily doses.</description>
