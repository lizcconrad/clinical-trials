  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurobehavioural disorder
      of childhood. The investigators hypothesized that amantadine would be beneficial for
      treatment of ADHD, and this could be evaluated in a double blind, randomized, parallel group
      comparison of amantadine and ritalin.

      This will be a six-week, parallel group, randomized clinical trial undertaken in an
      outpatient child and adolescent clinic at Roozbeh Psychiatric Hospital in Tehran, Iran during
      April 2010-May 2010.

      50 male and female subjects, ages 6 to 17 years with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of ADHD will be
      study population of this trial. At screening, investigators conduct a psychiatric evaluation
      with the DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD and the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and
      Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime diagnostic interview and perform a complete medical
      history and physical examination.

      The diagnosis of ADHD will be confirmed by a child and adolescent psychiatrist before
      participants will be initiated into the study. All patients will be newly diagnosed. Parents
      were carefully interview and ask to rate the severity of the DSM-IV-TR ADHD symptoms that
      their children display at home. Children will be excluded if they have a history or current
      diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders, schizophrenia or other psychiatric
      disorders(DSM-IV axis I); any current psychiatric comorbidity that required pharmacotherapy;
      any evidence of suicide risk and mental retardation (I.Q. &lt;70). In addition, patients will be
      excluded if they have a clinically significant chronic medical condition, including organic
      brain disorder, seizures and, current abuse or dependence on drugs within 6 months.
      Additional exclusion criteria will be hypertension, hypotension. To participate, parents and
      children have to be willing to comply with all requirements of the study. After a description
      of the procedures and purpose of the study, written informed consent will be obtained from
      each patient's parent or guardian. Informed consent will receive before the administration of
      any study procedure or dispensing of study medication in accordance with the ethical
      standards of the investigative site's institutional review board and with the Helsinki
      declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. The protocol will be approved by the Institutional
      Review Board (IRB) of Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

      Patients will be randomized to receive amantadine or ritalin in a 1: 1 ratio using a
      computer-generated code.

      All study subjects will be randomly assigned to receive treatment using amantadine 100-150 mg
      depending on weight (100 mg/day for &lt;30 Kg and 150 mg/day for &gt;30 Kg) or ritalin at a dose of
      20-30 mg/day depending on weight (20 mg/day for &lt;30 Kg and 30 mg/day for &gt;30 Kg) (group 2)
      for a 6 week double blind, randomized clinical.

      The principal measure of outcome will be the Parent and Teacher ADHD Rating Scale-IV that has
      been used extensively in Iran in school-age children and provides valid measures of
      behavioral abnormality and attention trial.

      Side effects will be systematically recorded throughout the study and will be assessed using
      a checklist that comprises 20 side effects including psychic, neurologic, autonomic and other
      side effects, administered by a child psychiatrist on days 7, 21and 42.
