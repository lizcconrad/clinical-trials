  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multi-center study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and effect of
      bevacizumab (Avastin) in combination with taxane (paclitaxel/ docetaxel) monotherapy on
      disease progression, survival time and Karnofsky performance status in female participants
      with estrogen-, progesterone- and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative
      (triple-negative) breast cancer.

    <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related QoL in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state. Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

        <description>FACT-B is used for assessment of health-related quality of life (QoL) in participants with breast cancer. It consists of 36 items, summarized to 5 subscales: physical (7 items), functional (7 items), social/family (7 items); all 3 ranged from 0 to 28, emotional (6 items) ranging from 0 to 24, and breast cancer subscale (9 items) ranging from 0 to 36; high subscale score represents a better QoL. All single-item measures range from 0=âNot at allâ to 4=âVery muchâ. Total possible score ranged from 0 to 144. High scale score represents a better QoL.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in FACT-B Score At Cycle 9</title>
        <description>FACT-B is used for assessment of health-related QoL in participants with breast cancer. It consists of 36 items, summarized to 5 subscales: physical (7 items), functional (7 items), social/family (7 items); all 3 ranged from 0 to 28, emotional (6 items) ranging from 0 to 24, and breast cancer subscale (9 items) ranging from 0 to 36; high subscale score represents a better QoL. All single-item measures range from 0=âNot at allâ to 4=âVery muchâ. Total possible score ranged from 0 to 144. High scale score represents a better QoL.</description>

        <description>FACT-B is used for assessment of health-related QoL in participants with breast cancer. It consists of 36 items, summarized to 5 subscales: physical (7 items), functional (7 items), social/family (7 items); all 3 ranged from 0 to 28, emotional (6 items) ranging from 0 to 24, and breast cancer subscale (9 items) ranging from 0 to 36; high subscale score represents a better QoL. All single-item measures range from 0=âNot at allâ to 4=âVery muchâ. Total possible score ranged from 0 to 144. High scale score represents a better QoL.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in FACT-B Score at End of Study</title>
          <description>FACT-B is used for assessment of health-related QoL in participants with breast cancer. It consists of 36 items, summarized to 5 subscales: physical (7 items), functional (7 items), social/family (7 items); all 3 ranged from 0 to 28, emotional (6 items) ranging from 0 to 24, and breast cancer subscale (9 items) ranging from 0 to 36; high subscale score represents a better QoL. All single-item measures range from 0=âNot at allâ to 4=âVery muchâ. Total possible score ranged from 0 to 144. High scale score represents a better QoL.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related QoL in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state. Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in EQ-5D- Health State Questionnaire Score at Cycle 6</title>
          <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related QoL in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state. Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state. Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile.

        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related QoL in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state. Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related QoL in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state. Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related QoL in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state. Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>
