  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid abuse is a complex problem, which not only impacts on the affected individuals'
      physical and psychological health, but also threatens public security and the productivity of
      the society. Further, through needle sharing and sexual contacts, injecting drug users (IDUs)
      have become laden with HIV and HIV related health problems, representing a serious public
      health threat all over the world. In Taiwan, since the identification of the first
      HIV-infected IDU in 1987, the incident cases have continued to increase, reaching a height of
      2,461 in 2005. In order to contain the epidemics of HIV among IDUs, and to prevent its spread
      to the population in general, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) collaborated with the
      Department of Justice to initiate and implement a number of harm reduction programs in 2005.
      The fact that opioid addiction is officially treated as a health rather than a legal issue
      itself represents a remarkable milestone in Taiwan. Among these harm reduction programs,
      including needle and syringe exchange for IDUs as well as substitution treatment approaches
      for opioid dependence, methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) perhaps represents the most most
      important and most crucial component. Remarkably, in a relatively short time span, more than
      60 MMT programs were established, which enrolled more than 15,000 heroin addicts. This
      notwithstanding, the overall and differential effectiveness of these MMT service delivery
      systems, as well as the characteristics of these programs and the patients that might
      contribute toward treatment response or failure remain largely unknown. Such knowledge base
      is crucial for establishing standardized and feasible outcome evaluation processes for opioid
      addicts receiving MMT programs, as well as for the further improvement of the efficacy and
      effectiveness of these programs, in Taiwan.

      In order to address some of these issues, this study adopts a multi-site, prospective
      clinical follow-up design. It aims at establishing a research network for examining MMT
      outcome, developing standardized MMT outcome assessment instruments and procedures, and
      identifying predictors of MMT outcome. The findings may contribute to the better
      understanding of the characteristics of opioid addicts, the effectiveness of MMT and
      remaining service needs for opioid addicts in Taiwan.
