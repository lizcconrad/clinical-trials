    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open label study designed to compare the efficacy and
      safety of lenalidomide with low-dose alkylating agents versus high-dose melphalan followed by
      stem cell support in newly diagnosed symptomatic MM patients who are 65 years of age or
      younger.

        requirements.

          -  Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that
             consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future
             medical care.

          -  Patient is 65 years old or younger at the time of signing the informed consent

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use 2 methods of contraception: 1
             effective (for example hormonal or tubal ligation) and 1 barrier (for example latex
             condom, diaphragm) for at least 4 weeks before starting the therapy, during the
             Treatment Period, and for 4 weeks after the last dose of lenalidomide

          -  Male patient agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception (i.e., condom or
             abstinence) during study drug therapy (including dose interruption) and for 4 weeks
             after discontinuation of lenalidomide therapy.

          -  Negative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin ( beta-HCG) pregnancy test both 24
             hours prior to beginning of therapy and then at 4 weeks intervals in women with
             regular menstrual cycles or every 2 weeks in women with irregular menstrual cycles
             during study treatment for subjects of childbearing potential

          -  Patient was diagnosed with symptomatic multiple myeloma based on standard criteria
             (10), and has measurable disease, defined as follows: any quantifiable serum
             monoclonal protein value (generally, but not necessarily, greater than 1 g/dL of IgG
             M-Protein and greater than 0.5 g/dL of IgA M-Protein) and, where applicable, urine
             light-chain excretion of &gt;200 mg/24 hours; measurable plasmacytoma &gt; 2 cm as
             determined by clinical examination or applicable radiographs (i.e. MRI, CT-Scan); bone
             marrow plasma cells &gt;10%.

          -  Patient has a Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60%.

          -  Patient has a life-expectancy &gt; 6 months

          -  Patient has HBV, HCV and HIV negative test.

          -  Patients must have normal ECG and NYHA ≤ 2; an evaluation of ejection fraction by ECHO
             or MUGA is optional

          -  Patients must normal chest X ray; an evaluation of pulmonary function studies on
             mechanical aspects (FEV1, FVC, etc) and diffusion capacity (DLCO) is optional.

          -  Patient has the following laboratory values within 14 days before Baseline (day 1 of
             the Cycle 1):

               -  Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L without transfusion support within 7 days before the
                  test.

               -  Patient has a baseline bone marrow sample available for cytogenetics, that will
                  be processed and eventually centralized.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous treatment with anti-myeloma therapy (does not include radiotherapy,
             bisphosphonates, or a single short course of steroid; &lt; to the equivalent of
             dexamethasone 40 mg/day for 4 days).

          -  Any serious medical condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities,
             which places the subject at an unacceptable risk if he or she participates in this
             study or confounds the experimental ability to interpret data from the study.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women. A serum β-hCG pregnancy test must be performed at the
             Screening visit, for female patients of child-bearing potential. If the test is
             positive, the patient must be excluded from the study. Confirmation that the patient
             is not pregnant must be established by a negative serum or urinary pregnancy test with
             the result obtained 1 day prior to the Baseline visit (or the day of the visit if
             results are available before drug delivery). A pregnancy test is not required for
             naturally post-menopausal women (who have not had menses at any time in the preceding
             24 consecutive months) or surgically sterilised women (hysterectomy, bilateral
             ovariectomy, bilateral salpingectomy);

          -  Prior history of malignancies, other than multiple myeloma, unless the subject has
             been free of the disease for ≥ 3 years. Exceptions include the following: basal cell
             carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the
             cervix, carcinoma in situ of the breast, incidental histologic finding of prostate
             cancer (TNM stage of T1a or T1b)

             thromboembolic event within the latest 12 months.
