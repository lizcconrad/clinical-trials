  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With discovery of KIT (CD117) mutations and the advent of KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor
      imatinib, there has been substantial improvement in overall survival in patients with
      advanced and/or metastatic gastrointestinal tumors (GIST). Recently, sunitinib showed
      activity as second-line therapy in GIST patients after failure with imatinib. However,
      virtually all patients will eventually progress or become intolerable after imatinib and
      sunitinib. In preclinical models, sorafenib inhibits KIT activity and cell growth of
      imatinib-resistant tumors. The objective of this multi-center, non-randomized phase II study
      is to evaluate the safety and activity of sorafenib given as third-line therapy for GIST.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, multi-center, phase II study recruiting patients with
      advanced GIST who are pretreated with both imatinib and sunitinib. The current study will
      provide an estimate of the activity and safety of sorafenib in GIST. The primary study
      endpoint is the disease control rate (DCR), defined as complete or partial response or stable
      disease of at least 24 weeks of sorafenib therapy. Secondary endpoints include PFS, OS and
      safety.

      Patients with advanced (unresectable and/or metastatic) GIST who failed after previous
      therapy involving both imatinib and sunitinib will be eligible. Failure to imatinib and
      sunitinib is defined as disease progression regardless of intervening response during
      therapy, or intolerance. There is no limit to the number of prior therapies a patient may
      have received (e.g., patients may have received therapy with nilotinib, other TKIs, or
      chemotherapy in addition to imatinib or sunitinib).
