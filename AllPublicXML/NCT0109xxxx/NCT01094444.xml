  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to explore the benefit of topical vitamin K3 lotion for the
      reactivation/rephosphorylation of EGF-receptor in the skin and the possible reduction in
      cutaneous side effects of EGFr-inhibition.

      Primary aim: The possible reduction of cutaneous side effects: folliculitis, dryness and
      redness of the skin.

      Secondary aim: To explore any possible side effects of topical vitamin K3 lotion.

      Methods: 36 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer or metastatic head and neck cancer
      allocated to treatment with chemotherapy and biweekly cetuximab. Two equally sized areas of
      at least 10x10 cm on the back or chest of the patient is marked. Patients receive in a double
      blinded procedure placebo lotion on one side and vitamin K3 lotion on the other side. The
      treatment may last for a maximum of two months and the patients are followed biweekly with
      photos, VAS-scores, questionnaires and CTCAE estimations. The patient will be able to take
      weekly photos at home during the weeks they are not seen at the outpatient clinic. During the
      treatment all other skin products or antibiotics is allowed and will be carefully registered
      by the health care professionals in the outpatient clinic.

      The patient may enter the trial in two different ways: 18 patients start treatment with study
      lotions at the time they start treatment with cetuximab. The other 18 patients start
      treatment with study lotions when folliculitis appears.

      Patients are asked for 1.5 mm skin biopsies of both study areas of the skin before start of
      treatment and after 4 weeks of treatment with placebo lotion and vitamin K3 lotion. These
      biopsies will be investigated for EGFr, phosphorylated EGFr and other central downstream
      mechanisms. The biopsy part of the study is optional for the patient.
