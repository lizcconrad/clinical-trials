      The hypothesis of this study is that excimer (308-nm UVB) laser added to either tazarotene
      0.1% gel or acitretin 25 mg daily will lead to improved efficacy of these treatments alone.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the improvement of psoriatic plaques with
      and without excimer laser (308-nm UVB) treatment, applied in a randomized and blinded
      fashion, in subjects on acitretin 25 mg or tazarotene gel 0.1% QD. The primary endpoint will
      be the comparison between the change in NPF score of plaques treated with excimer laser and
      those treated with sham treatment.

      The secondary objectives are to compare the number of excimer light treatments and time
      necessary to achieve an average lesion assessment score of 0 to 1 in subjects treated with
      acitretin 25 mg PO or tazarotene gel 0.1% QD, and to evaluate adverse events related to
      combinations of the study treatments.
