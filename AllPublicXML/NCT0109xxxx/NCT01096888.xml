      in the WIC program, using the internet to deliver weight loss materials.

      Develop recruitment methods and determine feasibility of recruiting WIC postpartum women who
      meet inclusion criteria. We will collect data on number of individuals screened and reasons
      for exclusions. Establish and examine feasibility and effectiveness of protocol for WIC
      counselors reinforcing adherence to web based program. We will assess frequency with which
      WIC counselors adhere to protocol of reinforcing adherence to web-based program and extent to
      which any &quot;treatment contamination&quot; occurs between WIC counselors and Standard Care
      participants.In those randomized to Enhanced WIC + Internet-based postpartum program, examine
      acceptability, burden, ease of use, frequency of technical problems, and adherence to
      web-based program (number of logins, message board postings)Explore whether the Enhanced WIC
      plus Internet postpartum weight loss program will produce significantly greater weight losses
      than Standard WIC at 2 months. Explore whether Enhanced WIC plus Internet postpartum weight
      loss program will result in greater improvements in eating and exercise behaviors (examined
      at 0, and 2 months) and psychosocial parameters (i.e., depression, social support,
      self-efficacy, body image) than standard care.
