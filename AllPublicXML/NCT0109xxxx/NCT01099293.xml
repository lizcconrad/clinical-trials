  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been observed that patients with cirrhosis present a generalized state of
      vasoconstriction as an homeostatic response to splanchnic arteriolar vasodilatation. On
      progression of the disease, vascular regulation is mismatched, causing altered systemic blood
      flow and lose in the cerebrovascular reactivity.

      The investigators hypothesize that the altered cerebrovascular reactivity induces
      neurological disturbances related to hepatic encephalopathy and, therefore, the existence of
      a correlation between cerebrovascular reactivity and the stage of hepatic encephalopathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no bibliography that evidenciates a correlation between cerebrovascular reactivity
      and the stage of hepatic encephalopathy. There are however, papers that reveal generalized
      systemic vasoconstriction in patients with cirrhosis and others that affirm the presence of
      vascular disregulation and altered reactivity in the Middle Cerebral Artery in cirrhotic
      patients. In the other hand, there is published data that correlates the neurological
      manifestations of diseases characterised by altered blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity
      with the degree of the vascular disregulation itself, identified by US Doppler. However,
      there are no studies correlating transcranial US Doppler findings of cerebrovascular
      reactivity and hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis. Giving its importance to
      the chance of revealing a new way of pathophysiology and therefore, early therapeutic
      management.
