  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays the clinical significance of an occult stress urinary incontinence and its optimal
      treatment is not known.Regarding treatment, there are 2 main approaches : either the
      systematic preventive treatment of the occult stress urinary incontinence by means of a
      tension free vaginal tape (TOT) together with the treatment of prolapse or the treatment of
      prolapse in the first place and treatment of stress incontinence in a second time when and if
      it appears.This study is expected to provide objective evidence concerning the efficacy and
      security of TOT implantation for the prevention treatment of occult stress urinary
      incontinence in women with pelvic organ prolapse and occult urinary incontinence.The
      perspective is to improve the management of these patients by providing evidence based
      recommendation for their treatment.

      The study population consists of women with pelvic organ prolapse and occult stress urinary
      incontinence. They are randomised within two groups : one group with pelvic organ prolapse
      surgery alone and one group with implantation of TOT together with prolapse surgery for
      prevention of stress urinary incontinence.TOT implantation is performed as described
      previously, while the pelvic organ prolapse surgery could either be of abdominal (open or
      laparoscopic) or vaginal approach. Eighty eight (88) patients will be enrolled at 3 sites
      centers.

      This study is a prospective, multicenter, randomised, active-control arm trial. The study
      population consists of women with pelvic organ prolapse and occult stress urinary
      incontinence. They are randomised within two groups : one group with pelvic organ prolapse
      surgery alone and one group with implantation of TOT together with prolapse surgery for
      prevention of stress urinary incontinence.TOT implantation is performed as described
      previously, while the pelvic organ prolapse surgery could either be of abdominal (open or
      laparoscopic) or vaginal approach. Eighty eight (88) patients will be enrolled at 3 sites
      centers.

        -  Collection of incontinence, prolapse and sexual history with the following
           questionnaires :

                manually and using a vaginal speculum. The results after both types of reduction
                will be recorded separately

             -  a Vaginal examination establishing the oestrogen status of patient's vagina and

        -  Total number of days of hospitalization

        -  Immediate complications (e.g perioperative hemorrhage requiring transfusion or not,
           urine retention requiring catheterisation)

        -  Postvoid residual volume of urine for all the patients by bladder scan

        -  Clinical examination including :

             -  Stress test in lithotomy position as of visit I

             -  Vaginal examination

             -  In case of prolapse, the modified ICS POP-Q and Baden Walker halfway method for
                quantification

      Visit III (J 6 months +/- 1 month) :

      During this visit the following will be performed :

             -  PFIQ-7 : Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire

             -  PFDI-20 : Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-short version Questionnaire

             -  PISQ-12 : Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire

             -  PGI-I : Patient Global Impression of Improvement

             -  Degree of satisfaction by the operation (visual 0-10 scale)

        -  Clinical examination including :

             -  Stress test in lithotomy position as of visit I
