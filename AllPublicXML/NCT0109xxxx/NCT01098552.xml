    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to collect regular and routine follow-up information
      related to the outcome of treatment for prostate cancer.

      This study is also being done to relate treatment outcome to measurement of substances in the
      blood such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and other markers. Also environmental and
      genetic factors that might be responsible for prostate cancer are being investigated.

        There are six patient cohorts which are being recruited to the Prostate Clinical Follow-up
        Core in support of the Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE). The six groups
        are: 1. High-risk radical prostatectomy patients, 2. Primary external beam radiotherapy
        patients, 3. Primary prostate brachytherapy patients, 4. Hormone refractory prostate cancer
        patients, 5. Active Surveillance. 6. Prostate biopsy patients. The inclusion criterion for
        group 6 is that the patient is scheduled to undergo a prostate biopsy for the purposes of
        definitive prostate cancer diagnosis. There are no exclusion criteria for group 6.
