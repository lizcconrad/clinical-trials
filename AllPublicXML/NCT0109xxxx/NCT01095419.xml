    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Massage Therapy for improving the
      quality of sleep in patients on postoperative period of coronary artery bypass graft surgery
      (CABG).

  <detailed_description>

      Patients We evaluated patients admitted to the ward waiting for elective CABG surgery.

      Preoperative evaluation The preoperative clinical assessment consisted of obtaining
      information regarding demographics and personal characteristics.

      Postoperative protocol and evaluation After discharge from the intensive care unit to the
      ward during the postoperative period, the patients were randomized to 3 nights of sitting for
      10 minutes, with no intervention (Control) or to MT. Briefly, MT consisted of massage of the
      neck, shoulders, and back. The massage was initiated with light manual compression and
      progressed to deep compression. The compression was performed with the inner region of the
      fingers, hand-shaped clamp, and friction (digital compression with the thumb) on trigger
      points, cervical traction, and mobilization in all planes (front, back, and sides). The
      massage was finished with light manual compression. During the study period, all patients
      completed a sleep diary containing the time they went to sleep, woke up, and took daytime
      naps. The patients completed a VAS for pain and fatigue (similar to the preoperative
      evaluation described previously) as well as a VAS for sleep on days 1, 2, and 3,
      corresponding to the morning following the intervention that was performed on the previous
      night.
