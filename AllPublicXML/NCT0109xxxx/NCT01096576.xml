  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, multiple-dose, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of balapiravir in adult male patients with confirmed dengue
      virus infection whose symptoms began within the 48 hours preceding the first administration
      of balapiravir. Patients will be randomized to receive either balapiravir or placebo, orally
      twice daily for 5 days. Anticipated time on treatment as in-patient is 7 days, with an
      out-patient follow-up to week 12. Target sample size is &lt;200
