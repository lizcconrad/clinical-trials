          -  Receipt of live attenuated vaccines within 30 days preceding the blood sampling at
             Visit 1 and the administration of a pandemic influenza vaccine within 21 days

             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a

          -  History of immunosuppressive or immune-mediated disorders including autoimmune
             diseases, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and hepatitis C infection,

          -  Pregnant or lactating female.

          -  History of malignancy (unless there has been surgical excision followed by a
             sufficient observation period, of at least 5 years, to give a reasonable assurance of
             sustained cure and which, in the estimate of the investigator, is not likely to recur
             during the study period).

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs (including chloroquine) within six months prior to the blood
             sampling at Visit 1 (for corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥10 milligram/day
             (10 mg/day), or equivalent). Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.

          -  History of type I or type II diabetes mellitus including cases controlled with diet
             alone (a subject with past gestational diabetes is eligible).
