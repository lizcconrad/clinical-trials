      A white light scanner can more accurately measure body contouring subjects than standard
      anthropomorphic methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A 3-D digital body camera that employs non-intrusive white light phase profilometry and 24
      coordinated charge-coupled cameras scans and produces a &quot;point cloud&quot; image of the subject.
      The result of the two-minute scan process is an accurate three-dimensional body model of the
      subject, consisting of over 1.2 million surface points. The point cloud is compressed to
      provide programmable measurement extraction profiles (MEP's) that automatically extracts
      linear and circumferential measurements. Subjects are scanned and anthropometrically measured
      pre-operatively, and at 3, 6 and 9 months post-op.

    <description>It is anticipated that the participants will undergo body contouring procedures including lipoplasty [internal fat suction removal], abdominoplasty [surgical removal of lower abdominal skin and fat], breast reduction [surgical removal of breast skin, fat, and breast tissue to reduce breast size], breast augmentation [surgical breast enlargement], thigh lift [surgical removal of upper thigh tissue], and brachioplasty [surgical removal of upper arm tissue].
These procedures will be evaluated by pre- and post-operative digital scans, analog measurements, and clinical examinations and photographs.</description>
