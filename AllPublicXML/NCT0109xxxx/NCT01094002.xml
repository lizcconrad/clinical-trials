      Objectives: To compare the benefits of structured occupational therapy intervention by a
      single geriatric therapist with the benefits of the conventional treatment model in the
      functional recovery of patients admitted to an acute geriatric unit.

      Design: Non-pharmacological randomised clinical trial. Setting: Acute Geriatric Unit,
      Albacete, Spain. Participants: The trial included 400 patients admitted consecutively over 6
      months to an acute geriatric unit for acute illness or exacerbation of a chronic medical
      condition. Participants were randomised to the occupational therapy intervention or
      conventional treatment model group; 198 patients received occupational therapy. All patients
      completed the study. The mean age was 83.5, and 56.8% were women.

      Interventions: Needs assessment, iatrogenic prevention, retraining in basic and instrumental
      activities of daily living, assessment of need for technical aids, instruction for primary
      caregiver in patient mobilisation techniques, and structured social and occupational
      motivation as per protocol in three groups of patients (cardiopulmonary disease, stroke, and
      other conditions) 5 days a week, 30 to 45 minutes a day over the entire hospital stay.

    <description>198 subjects. The OTI schedule consisted of a daily 45-minute session, Monday through Friday, for the duration of hospitalisation. Activities were carried out in a structured manner and varied according to need and day of admission. On the first day, the patient's needs were analysed, including the need for iatrogenic prevention, retraining in basic and instrumental activities of daily living, technical aids, instruct the primary caregiver in patient mobilisation techniques, and social and occupational motivation. All OTI participants received an average of 5 sessions during hospitalisation.</description>

    <description>Day 1: Physical, functional, cognitive, social, and emotional assessment. Need analysis for iatrogenic prevention, retraining in BADL and IADL, technical aids, instructions in patient mobilisation techniques, and for social and occupational motivation.
Day 2 until discharge: 45-minute sessions. Cognitive stimulation and confusional syndrome prevention, instructions to the caregivers on how to prevent complications such as immobility, delirium, falls, urinary incontinence, or pressure sores, and patient stimulation, retraining in activities of daily living.
Day of discharge: Instruction for caregivers on managing the patient's residual deficits, assessment for technical aids, recommendations for patient increased independence in ADL, and social and occupational activities.</description>
