      The investigators goal is to improve bowel preparations with an educational video on the
      Center for Digestive Disorders (CDD) website that explains the steps required for bowel
      preparation for those patients undergoing screening colonoscopies. The video will focus on
      explaining the purpose of a screening colonoscopy, the rationale for bowel preparation, the
      pre-colonoscopy diet, and the instructions for completing the laxative. In a randomized
      fashion, patients in the control group will receive the standard written bowel preparation
      instructions, while patients in the intervention group will receive standard written
      instructions plus a link to watch the instructional video. The investigators hypothesize that
      an educational tool that provides visual examples of a good and poor preparation, examples of
      the pre-colonoscopy diet, and an explanation of how to administer the laxative will lead to
      improved patient compliance and a better bowel preparation. In addition, the investigators
      hypothesize that a better quality bowel preparation will improve detection of colonic polyps
      and fewer recommendations for repeat colonoscopy based solely on inadequate bowel
      preparation.
