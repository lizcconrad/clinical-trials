  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to determine effect of coach-led neuromuscular warm-up on
      non-contact, lower extremity (LE) injury rates among female athletes in a predominantly
      non-white public high school system. The investigators hypothesized the warm-up would reduce
      non-contact LE injuries.

      We will recruit basketball and soccer coaches and their athletes from Chicago public high
      schools. We will randomize teams to intervention and control groups. We will train
      intervention coaches to implement a 20-minute neuromuscular warm-up and tracked training
      costs. Control coaches will use their usual warm-up. All coaches will report weekly athlete
      exposures (AEs) and injuries resulting in a missed practice/game. Research assistants will
      interview injured athletes. We will compare injury rates between control and intervention
      groups.
