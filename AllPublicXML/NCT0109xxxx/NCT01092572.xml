  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal genetic condition that affects 30,000 children and adults in
      the United States. Although CF management has improved substantially over the past two
      decades, there is still no cure and most patients with CF die before reaching their 50th
      birthday, largely due to lung failure. There is growing evidence that excess lung and blood
      inflammation that occurs in response to infections in the lungs cause CF patients to be
      sicker. Simvastatin is a drug that is used to lower cholesterol, but many researchers have
      found that this drug may also treat blood and lung inflammation. In this study, we will
      determine whether or not simvastatin can treat blood and lung inflammation in patients with
      CF and most importantly determine whether or not it can make these patients feel better and
      have better lung function.

      Study Objectives

        1. To determine the effect of 12 weeks of 40 mg once daily simvastatin on general
           inflammatory molecules, IL-6 and CRP in the blood of CF patients.

        2. To determine the effect of simvastatin on LPS-related pathway molecules in the blood.

        3. To determine the effect of simvastatin on inflammatory pneumo-proteins in the blood.

        4. To determine exacerbation and safety data on statins in preparation for a large phase
           III trial of statins in CF.

      Study Endpoints

      The primary endpoint will be the quantitative changes in serum levels of CRP.

      Secondary endpoints will include:

        1. blood biomarkers IL6, LPS related proteins, LPS, LBP, sCD14 and EndoCAb, and
           pneumoproteins, SPD and CCL18; and molecules such as TNF-α and IL-1beta;

        2. changes in FEV1 over 12 weeks ; and

        3. exacerbations over 12 weeks
