  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rates of cancer and cardiovascular disease have shown very little improvement over the past
      two decades, and the incidence of Type II diabetes mellitus is increasing at an alarming
      rate. Recent reports estimate that approximately 30% of total cancer deaths are related to
      poor exercise and nutrition, and other reports have suggested that, when taking into
      consideration both cardiovascular disease and cancer, inactivity contributes to as many as
      250,000 premature deaths per year (Booth et al., 2002). Despite the benefit of regular
      physical activity in the prevention of cancer and other debilitating illnesses, 75% of the
      U.S. population do not get the recommended amount of physical activity as defined by 30
      minutes of moderate intensity physical activity 5 or more days per week (CDC, 2001), and 40%
      of the population is completely sedentary (USDHHS, 19960. The objective of the proposed
      research is to understand the mediators and moderators of a well-tested individually
      tailored, print-based intervention to increase exercise behavior among sedentary adults.
      Using a randomized, controlled intervention ton trial, the proposed study will address three
      primary and one secondary hypotheses: 1) A previously tested and validated exercise promotion
      intervention (c.f., Marcus et al., 1998) is successful at helping sedentary individuals
      initiate and maintain a moderate intensity physical activity regimen, as compared to a health
      and wellness control intervention, 2) Increases in positive attitudes, perceived normative
      support, self-efficacy, and intentions to exercise will mediate the effectiveness of the
      intervention, 3) That increased positive mood, and better temperature, stress, and lactate
      regulation immediately after exercise challenge (assessed in the laboratory) will moderate
      the effectiveness of the intervention, and 4) Secondarily, we will test whether gender,
      race/ethnicity, and two recently suggested genetic factors (BDNF and OPRM1) moderate the
      effectiveness of the intervention. The rigorous assessment of how and for whom an exercise
      promotion intervention is effective will provide information for future development of
      intervention strategies and content, as well as allow the targeting of exercise content to
      individuals for whom it is most likely to be effective.
