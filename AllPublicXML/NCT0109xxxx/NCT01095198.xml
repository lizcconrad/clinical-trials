  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 30% of Canadian women do not participate in Pap smear screening for cervical cancer
      prevention despite many being members of family practices and having access to family
      physicians. One reason is reluctance to undergo pelvic examination.

      The investigators purpose is to determine whether the offer of vaginal self sample collection
      for oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) testing increases participation in cervical cancer
      screening compared to repeat reminder for Pap smear testing among female family practice
      members who have not previously responded to invitations for Pap testing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pap smear screening for cervical cancer precursors has substantially reduced the incidence of
      invasive cervical cancer in Canada. While regular Pap screening can give up to 90% protection
      against cervical cancer, about 30% of Canadian women do not participate in regular screening.

      Pap screening in Ontario is opportunistic. There are women who have family doctors and
      regularly present for other medical issues at their physician's office but forego Pap smear
      testing.

      Numerous studies have shown that women are able to self collect vaginal samples, and that
      these samples can be tested for the presence of oncogenic human papillomavirus. A recent
      meta-analysis showed that HPV testing through physician collected samples had a sensitivity
      of 80%-90% for detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or worse, and a
      specificity of 86%-95%. In comparison, a meta-analysis of self collected vaginal samples
      tested for HPV showed a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 88%.

      Studies have reported that women find self collection acceptable. However, we have found that
      many women are more comfortable if a health care professional is available to help if needed,
      and so this option should be provided for self-testing.

      We are proposing a randomized controlled trial to see whether (a) the offer of a vaginal self
      collection kit together with a second reminder for Pap testing will increase cervical
      screening participation amongst &quot;never-screened&quot; and &quot;hard to reach&quot; women, as compared to
      (b) a second reminder letter alone.

    <description>Women assigned to the intervention group will be offered the opportunity to self collect a vaginal specimen for HPV testing. They will be sent a letter explaining that a study of self testing is being performed, and will invite her to participate in this study. The letter will state that, if the patient prefers, she can perform a vaginal self-test in addition to, or instead of Pap smear testing. Patients are told that they have the option of completing the self-test on their own or in their physician's office with the help of their physician or practice staff. The letter will be accompanied by a self collection kit consisting of: a swab and test tube, pamphlet (with written instructions and diagram outlining procedure), instructional DVD and return envelope.</description>
