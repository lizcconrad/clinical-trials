  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a new medicine called antibody 8H9
      injected into the lining of the abdomen or peritoneum, where the tumor is. This medicine is
      an antibody or protein which binds to certain tumors, including DSCRT. There is a small
      number of DSCRT which do not bind with 8H9. If the tumor does not bind with 8H9, you might
      not benefit from this treatment. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or
      bad, it has.

      This antibody is made in mice. Radioactive iodine can be bound to this antibody to deliver
      radiation to the tumor. The investigators wish to determine the safety of radiolabeled 8H9 at
      different dose levels. This is the first study using 131I-8H9 in the peritoneum.

    <description>Patients will be administered therapeutic dose of IP 131I-8H9 per the dose escalation regimen. 131I-8H9 pharmacokinetics will be studied by serial blood draws from indwelling venous lines. 131I-8H9 biodistribution will be studied by a single gamma camera scan about 5 days after IP injection where feasible.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have the diagnosis of (a) DSRCT with peritoneal involvement or (b) other
             Burtomab-positive solid tumors involving the peritoneum (e.g. adrenocortical
             carcinoma, Wilm's tumor).

          -  For tumors other than DSRCT, patients must have a history of tumor progression or
             recurrence or failure to achieve complete response with standard therapy or &lt;20%
             chance of long term disease-free survival.

          -  For tumors other than DSRCT, Burtomab reactivity must be confirmed by
             immunohistochemistry.

          -  Patients with DSCRT are not required to have measurable or evaluable disease.

          -  Patients with tumors other than DSRCT without measurable or evaluable disease will
             only be considered if they have &lt;20% chance of long term disease-free survival.

          -  Prior Therapy: At least 4 weeks should have elapsed since any biologic therapy, or
             immunotherapy. Three weeks should have elapsed since last dose of chemotherapy or
             radiotherapy.

          -  Age &gt;1 year and able to cooperate with radiation safety restrictions during therapy
             period.

          -  Stem cells: Patients must have an autologous hematopoietic stem cell product
             cryopreserved and available for re-infusion after 131 I-Burtomab treatment. The
             minimum dose for hematopoietic stem cells is 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg.

          -  Minimum life expectancy of six weeks as determined by consenting professional.

          -  Signed informed consent indicating awareness of the investigational nature of this
             program.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe major organ toxicity. Renal, cardiac, hepatic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal and
             neurologic toxicity should all be grade 1 or less (per NCI CTC version 3 criteria)
             with the following exceptions: serum AST,ALT and alkaline phosphatase should be ≤5 x
             upper limit of normal (ULN), serum bilirubin ≤ 3 x ULN and nausea and vomiting should
             be ≤ grade 2 Patients with myelosuppression are not excluded if ANC ≥ 500/uL.

          -  Platelet count should be &gt; 50,000/ul and hemoglobin should be &gt; 8gm/dl. Patients may
             receive platelet or red blood cell transfusions to maintain hemoglobin and platelets
             at clinical appropriate levels.

          -  Patients with clinically suspected dense intraperitoneal adhesions preventing adequate
             IP distribution.

          -  History of allergy to mouse proteins.

          -  Patients previously treated with murine monoclonal antibodies will be excluded if they
             have a HAMA level of &gt;1000U/ml.

          -  Active serious infections not controlled by antibiotics.

          -  Pregnant women and women who are breast feeding are excluded for fear of danger to the
             fetus/infant. Therefore negative pregnancy test is required for all women of
             child-bearing age, and appropriate contraception is used during the study period.
             Pregnancy testing will be carried out within two weeks prior to administration of
             radioiodinated Burtomab in females of childbearing age.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to comply with radiation safety procedures or protocol
             requirements.
