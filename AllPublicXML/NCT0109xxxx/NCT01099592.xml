  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is frequently seen in cardiac patients. It has been shown that depression often
      has a negative impact on the course of coronary disease. More recently, research has
      demonstrated that some antidepressants can be used safely to treat depressed coronary
      patients. Although the majority of patients improve substantially with antidepressant
      treatment, a significant proportion do not respond to antidepressants. This project seeks to
      better understand why depression does not improve equally well in all patients. Ultimately,
      the hope is to improve the treatments available to people affected by both cardiac disease
      and depression, and to help select the best type of treatment in advance for each individual
      based on his or her personal history, and biological characteristics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study 140 patients who have had a recent hospitalization for an acute coronary
      syndrome and who have major depression will all receive 12 weeks of treatment with the
      antidepressant citalopram and regular clinical management visits from a mental health
      professional. The objective is to examine the characteristics of depressed cardiac patients
      who do and do not show an improvement in depression with citalopram treatment. There is
      evidence that the causes of depression may be different in some people with cardiac disease
      than in individuals who do not have heart problems, and these differences may be at least
      partially involved in determining response to antidepressant treatment. Inflammation, one of
      the body's responses to the development of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries and
      blockages in the heart) may be particularly important in producing depression in cardiac
      patients. There may also be changes in the body's metabolism of tryptophan, a protein that is
      involved in making serotonin, and levels of serotonin are often low in depression. Other
      factors thought to influence the development of depression include childhood experiences and
      personality factors. Heredity and family history also seem to play a role in some people with
      depression and heart disease. Finally, some patients experience sleep apnea, interruptions in
      breathing while they are asleep, that can contribute to both cardiac disease and depression.
