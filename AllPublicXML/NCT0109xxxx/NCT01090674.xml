  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is very important monitoring respiratory muscle function in patients with amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis (ALS). We have at our disposal Respiratory Functional Tests (forced vital
      capacity (FVC), maximal mouth-inspiratory force (MIF), maximal mouth-expiratory force (MEF),
      Cough Peak expiratory flow (cPEF), maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV), arterial blood gases
      and nocturnal pulsioxymetry) and Thoracic Image Techniques (inspiratory/expiratory Thorax
      x-ray and x-ray scope). But all this explorations present some technique limitations. They
      are two new methods to explore diaphragmatic function: SNIF test and Diaphragm magnetic
      resonance imaging (dMRI). SNIF test is simple and easy to be done and it can avoid some
      problems that have the other respiratory functional test in this kind of patients. dMRI seems
      to correlate with respiratory functional test and it can be useful monitoring diaphragmatic
      mobility. The objective of our study is to compare and to correlate SNIF test and dMRI with
      x-ray techniques and respiratory functional tests that measure diaphragmatic force and
      function. First of all we will study 10 healthy people with a forced spirometry, MIF, MEF and
      dMRI, trying to obtain diaphragmatic mobility reference values with dMRI. Lately, we will
      study patients with ALS. In the first place, we will perform a transversal study with 30
      patients. We will do a forced spirometry, MIF, MEF, MVV, cPEF, SNIF, arterial blood gases and
      nocturnal pulsioxymetry, forced Inspiratory and expiratory Thorax x-ray, diaphragmatic x-ray
      scope and dMRI. Secondly, we will perform a prospective study, where we will analyze these
      variables evolution at 3 and 6 months. We hope we can apply the two new techniques in the
      future because we think they are simpler, more accurate and more objective to evaluate
      diaphragmatic mobility.
