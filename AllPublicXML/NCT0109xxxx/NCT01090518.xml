      This study seeks to examine the efficacy of hydrocortisone administration in the augmentation
      of the therapeutic effects of Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy, an empirically tested
      treatment shown to be effective in the the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
      The augmentation builds on both the translation of neuroscience findings demonstrating the
      effects of glucocorticoids (GCs) on learning, and on empirical clinical findings from other
      investigators demonstrating beneficial effects of GCs in reducing traumatic memories in
      trauma-exposed persons.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A primary diagnosis of chronic PTSD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
             Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria, resulting from a
             deployment-related traumatic event, and a minimum PTSD severity of 50 (CAPS).

          -  The veteran must either be unmedicated or on a stable psychotropic regimen (i.e., 1 or
             more months on the same regimen).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lifetime history of psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, or obsessive compulsive
             disorder.

          -  Moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).

          -  A medical or mental health problem other than PTSD that requires immediate clinical
             attention.

          -  Substance abuse or dependence within the last 3 months.

          -  Suicidal risk (as determined by response of 5 or 6 on the suicidality items of the
             Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)) and/or assessed suicide risk on the
             basis of clinical judgment.

          -  Persons on a psychotropic medication regimen that has not been consistent for one
             month.

          -  Presence of diabetes mellitus or any current unstable medical illness or condition
             that represents a contraindication to taking glucocorticoids (this will be determined
             by history and/or abnormal laboratory findings at medical clearance).

          -  Unwillingness to discontinue other specialized psychotherapy for PTSD during the 10
             weeks of study treatment and the 6 week follow-up. (Self-help (non-trauma focused)
             groups or supportive counseling can be continued but not initiated.)

          -  Pregnant women or those planning to become pregnant within the study period will not
             be enrolled. Female participants must agree to use an effective method of birth
             control (i.e., oral contraceptive, Norplant, diaphragm, condom, or spermicide,
             abstinence) during the course of the study to ensure they do not become pregnant
             during the course of the study.
