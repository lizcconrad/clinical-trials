  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy and process of change that occurs in
      Attention Training in comparison to an established treatment for social phobia, Cognitive
      Therapy. A randomized trial was conducted in which participants were allocated to either six
      weeks of Attention Training or Cognitive Therapy. It was hypothesized that both treatments
      would be effective in reducing social phobia symptoms, but that Attention Training would work
      primarily by reducing levels of self focused attention, while Cognitive Therapy would work
      through changes to probability and threat appraisals.
