    <textblock>
      The major purpose of this study is to examine the anti-tumor activity of the CDX-1307 vaccine
      regimen when it is given before and after bladder cancer surgery. The study will also provide
      information about the safety of the vaccine regimen when given in combination with
      chemotherapy, and how it affects the immune systems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CDX-1307 is an experimental vaccine that is designed to generate an immune response against a
      protein called human chorionic gonadotropin-beta (hCG-β). hCG-β is made by several types of
      cancers, including bladder cancer, and has been shown to be associated with shorter times to
      development of metastases and reduced survival in bladder cancer. In this study, it is hoped
      that administering the CDX-1307 vaccine will cause the body's immune system to attack bladder
      cancer cells in order to kill them or otherwise keep them from spreading or coming back.

      Standard treatment for early stage, muscle invasive bladder cancer includes the
      administration of chemotherapy to shrink the tumor followed by surgical removal of the
      bladder (cystectomy).

      This study will compare the effect of adding CDX-1307 administration to this standard
      treatment. CDX-1307 will be given with 3 different immune stimulants to try to increase the
      immune response against the tumor cells; collectively, this is called the &quot;CDX-1307 vaccine
      regimen.&quot;

      Only patients whose tumors make the hCG-β protein will be included in this study. Eligible
      patients will receive &quot;standard of care&quot; chemotherapy with the CDX-1307 vaccine regimen
      before surgery, and then CDX-1307 vaccine regimen alone (without chemotherapy) after surgery.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Among other criteria, patients must meet all of the following conditions to be eligible to
        be in the study:

          1. 18 years of age or older.

          2. Newly diagnosed muscle-invasive transitional cell (urothelial) bladder cancer where
             neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radical cystectomy with curative intent are indicated
             (i.e., American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage T2-4a, Nany, M0). Patients must
             be entered into the study within eight weeks of their most recent diagnostic
             procedure, which is usually a diagnostic biopsy or transurethral resection of bladder
             tumor (TURBT) procedure.

          3. Histopathologically confirmed, transitional cell (urothelial) carcinoma. Urothelial
             tumors with mixed histology (but with &lt;50% variant) are eligible.

          4. Tumor tissue (obtained during a prior procedure) confirmed to express hCG-β by a
             central laboratory.

          5. Candidate for therapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Among other criteria, patients who meet any of the following conditions are NOT eligible to
        be in the study:

          1. Previous systemic chemotherapy or radiation for bladder cancer. Note: Prior
             immunotherapy or intravesical (administered within the bladder) chemotherapy for
             superficial disease is acceptable.

          2. History of anaphylactic reaction following exposure to humanized or human therapeutic
             monoclonal antibodies, hypersensitivity to GM-CSF or yeast derived products,
             clinically meaningful allergic reactions to imiquimod, resiquimod, or any known
             hypersensitivity or prior reaction to any of the formulation excipients in the study
             drugs.

          3. Concurrent chronic treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents,
             including any systemic steroid (exception: inhaled or topically applied steroids, and
             acute and chronic standard dose NSAIDs, are permitted).

          4. Known infection with HIV, HBV or HCV.

          5. Any underlying medical condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, will make the
             administration of study vaccine hazardous to the patient, would obscure the
             interpretation of adverse events, or would contraindicate receipt of neoadjuvant
             chemotherapy or surgical resection.
