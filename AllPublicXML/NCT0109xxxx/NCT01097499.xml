  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study hypothesis: Low level laser (LED) will reduce initial bone resorption and improve
      primary stability of dental implant. It will also reduces post operative pain compared to
      patient without treatment

      Implant osseointegration depends on many factors including biocompatibility of implant
      materials, design, surface, surgical access, patient conditions, biomechanical status, and
      lack of primary stability.

      Several in vivo and in vitro studies showed the healing effect of low level laser therapy
      (LLLT) on bone by decreasing the initial bone resorption postoperatively and increasing the
      primary stability of the implant. It has also shown to have an analgesic effect intraorally
      when used post intraoral surgical procedures. The exact mechanism is unclear despite the fact
      that many hypothesis has been proposed.

      In our study, our goal is to present, in a randomized standardized clinical trial, the effect
      of LLLT on post operative implant stability assessed by resonance frequency analysis (RFA).
      We will assess the subjective measures of postoperative pain using visual analog scale (VAS).

    <description>Analgesia will be assessed using a combination of VAS and categorical scale. Patient will fill a pre-printed form with the modified VAS every 3 hours at the day of surgery, and every morning and at night for 7 days. Pt. will also reports the time and the dose of analgesics they are taking post operatively to control pain in that form. Patients will submit all the data to the surgeons at the 1-week follow-up appointment</description>
