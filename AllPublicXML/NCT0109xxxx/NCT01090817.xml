  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the advent of newer biologic therapies such as infliximab for Crohn's disease, a form
      of autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease, a proportion of patients are refractory to such
      therapy and require surgery. The hypothesis is that mesenchymal stromal cell therapy using
      third party human cultured cells will be safe and effective

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Colonic or small bowel Crohn's disease based on endoscopic appearances and histology

          -  Refractory to induction with infliximab or adalimumab; or have lost response to these
             agents; or have had side effects precluding their further use

          -  Where there has been loss of response to one of these agents, the other must be tried
             before being eligible

          -  Crohn's disease activity score (CDAI) 250 or more.

          -  C-reactive protein &gt;10mg/L

          -  Surgery must have been offered to the subject (if appropriate) and declined

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active sepsis, perforating disease. Coexistent perianal fistulous disease is
             permitted, providing no co-existent infection within previous 4 weeks

          -  Chronic stricturing disease in isolation

          -  Coexistent CMV disease

          -  Prior history of malignancy

          -  Pregnant or unwilling to practice contraceptive therapy or breast feeding females

          -  Last biologic therapy must be greater than 4 weeks prior, must be on stable
             corticosteroid dose for 14 days prior, during therapy and for 14 days after therapy,
             must be on stable immunomodulator dose (eg, azathioprine) for 14 days prior, during
             therapy and for 14 days after.
