  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a regulatory system that plays an essential role in
      patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Plasma renin activity (PRA) is a strong and
      independent predictor of outcome, also in the presence of ACE inhibitors (ACE-i) and/or
      angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Recently, it has been shown that vitamin D regulates
      renin transcription by activating the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Thus, specific activation of
      the VDR represents a novel target for therapeutic intervention in CHF. Currently, clinical
      data are lacking. The investigators aim to investigate the effect of the administration of
      vitamin D in patients with CHF.

    <description>Patients were randomized by an automated computer system to 2000 IU oral cholecalciferol once daily or control (i.e. no extra medication), in a 1:1 ratio for a period of six weeks. Blood was collected in a sitting position on visits 2-4 and patients were asked to collect 24h urine samples prior to visits 2 and 4. Heart failure medication was maintained unchanged throughout the trial. Changes in diuretic dose were permitted if necessary to treat decompensation or renal dysfunction.</description>
