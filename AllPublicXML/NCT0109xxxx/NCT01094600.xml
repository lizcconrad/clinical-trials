  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to evaluate S-MRCP, in comparison to direct pancreatic function, to
      measure pancreatic exocrine function in patients who have symptoms suspicious for
      insufficiency. We hypothesize that S-MRCP imaging parameters will correlate well with the
      direct pancreatic exocrine functioning.

    <textblock>
      Surgical resection offers the only hope of cure for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. While
      perioperative mortality rates have declined in recent years, pancreatic resection is still
      associated with significant postoperative malnutrition, maldigestion, and glucose
      intolerance, mostly as a result of pancreatic insufficiency. Quantifying individual
      pancreatic function remains a challenge, but is essential in improving the survival and
      quality of life of pancreatic cancer patients. Secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance
      cholangiopancreatography (S-MRCP) has recently emerged as a widely-accepted noninvasive
      technique to assess morphological changes in pancreatic ducts, as well as functional
      secretory capacity of the gland. The aim of our study is to evaluate S-MRCP as a means to
      evaluate for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. This will be a prospective study of twelve
      patients who have undergone pancreatic resection and who have symptoms of abdominal pain,
      steatorrhea or weight loss. We will be comparing quantitative parameters of S-MRCP (maximal
      change in pancreatic duct diameter and volume before and after secretin administration) with
      endoscopic pancreatic function testing (maximal bicarbonate concentration in duodenal
      aspirate after secretin administration).

    <description>Twelve patients will undergo S-MRCP, at a dose of 0.2 ucg/kg per exam. Secretin, provided by the Repligen Corporation, will be administered by IV bolus injection over 30 seconds followed by a 30 second saline flush. The maximum dose of secretin will be 18.5 ucg.</description>
