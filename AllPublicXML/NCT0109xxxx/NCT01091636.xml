    <textblock>
      The current standard treatment for ovarian cancer, tubal cancer, and primary peritoneal
      cancer is maximal cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy. Recent randomized trials of
      Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) revealed the survival gain in intraperitoneal chemotherapy
      compared to the intravenous chemotherapy after the optimal cytoreduction in ovarian cancer
      (GOG#104, GOG#114, GOG#172). Experts attributed such survival gain to the earlier cycles of
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy when adhesion was minimal from extensive cytoreductive
      procedures.

      Hyperthermia has an anti-cancer activity itself. Especially, hyperthermia promotes
      chemotherapy to penetrate deeper into the cancer tissue. Therefore, the combination of
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy with hyperthermia theoretically could lead to higher response
      rate and better survival outcomes.

      *HIPEC: hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy

      There will be an interim analysis when 50% of patients are enrolled.

      At the interim analysis, a statistical test will be performed. The nominal significance
      levels will be determined later. The exact nominal significance level will be determined
      based on the exact number of events at the time of the interim analysis. The Stopping
      boundaries will be calculated using an O'Brien-Fleming error spending function

      If a patient is allocated to operation to remove ovarian cancer and metastatic disease in the
      abdomen, this trial could be considered. Before operation, laboratory test results, image
      result, patient's medical history, and baseline quality of life will be checked and reviewed.

      When optimal cytoreduction (residual tumor&lt;1cm) is attained, this HIPEC (hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy) could be considered. For the primary advanced epithelial
      ovarian cancer, HIPEC will be performed at random. For the recurrent ovarian cancer, HIPEC
      will be performed after completion of cytoreductive procedures. Usually, HIPEC takes one and
      half hours after cytoreductive surgery.

      After cytoreductive surgery followed by HIPEC, adjuvant chemotherapy will be added. The cycle
      of chemotherapy will be determined according to the patients' clinical outcomes. The
      laboratory test results, image result, patient's medical history, and baseline quality of
      life will be checked after the operation, during chemotherapy, and after chemotherapy.
