    <textblock>
      This study devised an experimental focused pharmaceutical care program, allowed a clinical
      pharmacist to work in a physician office to assess and manage patients' metabolic syndrome
      status and its individual components. This study described the clinical benefits of
      physician- clinical pharmacist interaction in achieving improved glycemic control, lipid and
      blood pressure measurements, involving medication, diet, physical activity and patient heath
      care counseling.

      A single blinded prospective randomized controlled trial conducted in family medicine
      outpatients clinics in Jordan. The study enrolled 199 patients met the National Cholesterol
      Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP/ATPIII) criteria for the diagnosis of MS
      upon the time of enrollment. Patients were randomized into: 110 participants into the
      intervention arm (pharmacist-physician collaborative approach) and 89 into the control arm
      (physician only team). Only patients in the intervention arm were provided pharmacist
