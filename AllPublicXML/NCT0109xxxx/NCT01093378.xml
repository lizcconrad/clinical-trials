  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This case-control multicentric study involving fertile and infertile couples aims at
      evaluating the impact on conception rate of nutritional parameters (biologic, clinic,
      anthropometric, and food questionnaire).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infertility affects about 15% of couples. Many factors relating to lifestyle and environment
      are likely to influence fertility. As an adapted nutrition could prevent 30% of cancers, diet
      could be essential, but largely neglected, in the prevention of infertility.

      Some studies tried to explore the impact of diet on male or female fertility, but very few
      focused on both. The aim of our study is to assess the role of nutrition in both fertile and
      infertile couples, taking into account most of factors relating to lifestyle. Clinical,
      anthropometric (BMI, fat mass), biological markers (non specific - glycaemia, lipids,
      inflammation, electrolytes - and specific - vitamins E, A, C, D, B, including folates and
      MTHFR polymorphism) and semen analysis, will be combined with validated questionnaires
      (nutrition, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, physical activity, sleep and stress).

      The statistical analysis of correlations between nutritional and clinical data will provide
      information concerning the impact of nutrition on fertility.
