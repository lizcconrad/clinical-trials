      RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of tumor tissue and ascites fluid from patients to
      test in the laboratory may help the study of cancer.

      PURPOSE: This pre-clinical research study is collecting tissue samples and ascites fluid from
      patients with stage III or stage IV ovarian/primary peritoneal/fallopian tube epithelial
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To generate a translational ovarian cancer model using tumor tissue and cells from
           patients with stage III-IV ovarian/primary peritoneal/fallopian tube epithelial cancer
           for drug response and development.

      OUTLINE: Tissue and fluid samples are collected at the time of surgery or paracentesis and
      used in laboratory experiments and in animal models. Health data is collected from patient
      medical records before, during, and after surgery.

      After surgery, patients are followed up for 5 years.

    <description>Our approach is to establish a &quot;live&quot; library of primary tumors from patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer by transplanting this tissue into a host mouse model. This preclinical model system will allow us to test the response to standard and novel therapeutics and will provide a perpetual tumor archive for future experiments that will probe critical molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer and similar cancer types (primary peritoneal and fallopian tube).</description>
