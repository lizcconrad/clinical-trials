  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been postulated that use of a larger femoral head could reduce the risk of dislocation
      after total hip arthroplasty, but only limited clinical data have been presented in third
      generation alumina bearings.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of femoral head size for total hip
      arthroplasty using third generation alumina bearings on the joint stability and clinical
      results.

      The investigators hypothesized that larger ceramic head group has a similar rate of
      dislocation and clinical results in smaller ceramic head group.
