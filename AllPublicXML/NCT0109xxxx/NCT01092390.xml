      In this application the investigators describe plans for a randomized controlled cross-over
      trial to determine the effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on urine protein
      excretion in 30 adults with diabetes (NIDDM) and kidney disease defined by the presence of
      proteinuria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is the most common cause of end-stage kidney disease in the United States. Half of
      patients with diabetes develop kidney disease. The benefits of omega-3 fatty acids have been
      shown in animal models of kidney injury. Mechanistic studies of omega-3 fatty acid
      supplements support biological plausibility: omega-3 supplements have been shown to improve
      vascular reactivity, lower oxidative stress, reduce inflammation, and have beneficial effects
      on the metabolism of eicosanoids favoring synthesis of vasodilatory prostaglandins and
      thromboxanes. However, in spite of overwhelming evidence for a potential benefit of dietary
      omega-3 fatty acids at preventing or slowing progression of kidney disease for adults with
      NIDDM, clinical trials providing evidence to support recommendations of supplementation are
      lacking.

      The current recommendation for omega-3 intake for adults, one gram/day of DHA+EPA, is based
      on evidence for cardiovascular disease risk (CVD) reduction. Whether omega-3 fatty acid
      prevents or slows progression of diabetic kidney disease, whether the current recommended
      dose is adequate to modify disease, or whether a higher dose should be recommended, needs to
      be determined.

      In this setting, we propose to conduct a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over clinical
      trial to determine the effects of a daily dose of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (4.0
      g/day) compared with placebo on urine protein excretion and biomarkers of kidney injury and
      function in adults with diabetes and proteinuria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants have a diagnosis of diabetes (either oral medication or diet controlled)

          -  Have an average systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;150 and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
             &lt;90 mmHg

          -  Have quantified proteinuria -- urine albumin/creatinine ratio of &gt; 17 mg/g (men) and
             &gt;25 mg/g (women) (i.e. at least microalbuminuria).

          -  Participants must be on stable doses of antihypertensive, hypoglycemic, and lipid
             lowering medications for a minimum of two months prior to randomization. Participants
             must agree to stay on stable doses of diabetes, antihypertensive and lipid medication
             for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major exclusion criteria will be poorly controlled diabetes (Hemoglobin A1c &gt;9%)

          -  Use of insulin

          -  Use of fish oil supplements or are unwilling to stop fish oil supplements one month
             prior to randomization and refrain from the supplements during the study

          -  Stage 4 or stage 5 CKD or a screening urine protein/creatinine ratio of &gt;2.5.
