  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify aspects of the bladder cancer (BlCa) survivorship
      experience that differ by clinical risk at diagnosis. The investigators will collect
      cross-sectional data from persons with BlCa to identify aspects of health-related quality of
      life (HRQOL) and symptom management. The study originally enrolled only nonmuscle-invasive
      bladder cancer survivors but has been expanded to include survivors with any stage disease.
      Information from this study will be used to develop a new patient education and counseling
      intervention.

    <description>Health-related quality of life as measured by the European Organization for Resarch and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) C30 and BLS24 (that is, BLadder cancer Superficial, meaning nonmuscle-invasive) or BLM30 (BLadder cancer muscle-invasive or metastatic).
Data are assessed at one time point only. Survey participants may be assessed at any point between diagnosis and 4 years post-diagnosis. The questions in the survey typically ask about health-related quality of life in the preceding 4 weeks.</description>
