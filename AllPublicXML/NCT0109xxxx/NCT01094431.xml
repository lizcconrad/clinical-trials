      The purpose of this study is to study the most common etiologies of uncomplicated fever
      diseases among children under five years of age in rural Zanzibar.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last 6 years Zanzibar has undergone a dramatic change in malaria epidemiology and
      burden of disease, with a marked decline of Plasmodium falciparum malaria among febrile
      children from approximately 30% to 1% or below and a reduction of crude child mortality of
      50%. Millions of children in Africa die of neonatal disorders, acute respiratory tract
      infections (ARI), diarrhea, malaria, measles, HIV and malnutrition. A majority of these
      illnesses are also a common cause of febrile illness in out-patient departments. However,
      most of the few fever studies made in Africa are hospital based Very few studies on etiology
      of childhood febrile disease have been conducted on first level health facilities in the
      least developed countries in Africa. This study will therefore focus on children between 2
      months to 5 years of age that have been diagnosed with a negative rapid diagnostic test (RDT)
      for malaria and their causes of fever at the first referral level in out-patient clinics in
      Zanzibar.
