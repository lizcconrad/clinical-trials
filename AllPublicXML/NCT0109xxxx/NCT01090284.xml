  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The notable development and diffusion of prosthetic surgery of the abdominal wall over the
      last few years has led to the introduction of light weight meshes. The efficacy of inguinal
      hernia repair with light weight prosthesis, as well as the better or worse biotolerability
      with respect to those of light weight, remains questionable in literature, where a clear
      answer still remains to be given. If there exists a connection between the quantity of
      material implanted, the immunological reaction to the mesh, the induced oxidative stress and
      the degree of cicatrization, and consequently the long-term result of the efficacy of the
      operation, remains to be demonstrated. There are few studies on the immunological reaction to
      polypropylene meshes, and none on the oxidative stress induced by the mesh. Moreover, only
      one study has been published that clearly correlates the immunological reaction to the amount
      of prosthetic material, but was carried out on only a few patients.

      The aim of this research is to show if there is a relationship between the amount of
      prosthetic material used and immunological reactions as well as postoperative oxidative
      stress, and thus to evaluate, if present, the differences in the biological reaction and
      biotolerability between light-weight and heavy-weight meshes on a statistically significant
      number of patients.

      Double blind randomization. The recruitment of patients will take place in the order that
      they are referred to the hernia service of the General Surgery and Week Surgery Unit of the
      University Hospital of Catania. After the examination confirming the diagnosis of inguinal
      hernia and once surgery has be indicated, informed consent will be obtained from the patient
      by means of a standardized form. The assignment to group H or group L will be made following
      a simple criterion of alternation that is completely random: i.e. patient 1 (Group H),
      patient 2 (Group L).A total of 60 patients will be recruited and divided into the two groups.
      For group H inguinal hernioplastic surgery will be carried out with the so called
      &quot;heavy-weight&quot; mesh (about 220 g/m2 of polypropylene), for Group L, on the other hand, the
      mesh will be of the &quot;light-weight&quot; type (about 40 g/m2).

      A preoperative blood test will be carried out to determine the basal levels of IL-6,
      TNF-alpha, nitrites, GSH and isoprostanes) and 3 postoperative tests (at 6 h, 3 days and 12
      days), all samples will be frozen for reference.

      All the data from each patient will be collected in a personal file compiled by the surgeon.
      When all the blood samples are collected a laboratory technician and a biochemist will
      determine the levels of the above mentioned substances, these data will then undergo
      statistical evaluation.
