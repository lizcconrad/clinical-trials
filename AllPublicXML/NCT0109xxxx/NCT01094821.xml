  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pharmacodynamic study in healthy volunteers to determine the effects of a new 5-HT4
      agonist on gastric, small bowel and colonic transit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ATI-7505, is an engineered analog of the 5-HT4 agent, cisapride. The objectives of this study
      are to compare effects of ATI-7505 and placebo on gastric, small bowel and colonic transit in
      healthy human volunteers and evaluate the safety and tolerability of ATI-7505.

      This trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating the
      gastrointestinal transit effects of ATI-7505 and placebo. Three different doses (3, 10, 30mg)
      of ATI-7505 and placebo will be administered in parallel to four independent groups of 12
      subjects each. The maximum duration of drug exposure for any subject is 9 days.

      All participants will undergo a standard 48 hour gastrointestinal transit measurement using
      scintigraphy with standardized meals during the first 12 hours. The response endpoints
      (colonic geometric center at 4 h, colonic geometric center at 24 h, colonic geometric center
      at 48 h, gastric residual at 2 &amp; 4 h, colonic filling at 6 h and ascending colonic emptying
      t1/2) will be based on abdominal scintigraphic images following the technetium-99m egg meal
      and methacrylate-coated, delayed-release capsule containing 111In labeled activated charcoal.

      Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by serial assessment of vital signs, physical
      examination, ECG, adverse events, concomitant medications and blood sample analysis.
