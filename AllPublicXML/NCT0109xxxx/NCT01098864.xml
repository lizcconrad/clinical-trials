  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to examine the effects of magnetic stimulation on the
      prefrontal cortex. We plan to use low frequency, repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (1 Hz rTMS) to temporarily inhibit activity in the prefrontal cortex and measure the
      resulting effect on two decision-making tasks. The prefrontal cortex is thought to mediate or
      control cognitive functions like decision-making, planning, memory, and inhibit impulsive
      behavior.Previous research has indicated that rTMS over the right dorsal lateral prefrontal
      cortex will lead to preferences for riskier alternatives. Our hypothesis is that rTMS over
      the right DLPFC will lead to greater preference for the riskier alternative and greater
      temporal discounting.

    <description>low frequency (1 Hz) repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation will be delivered to the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) area for a period of 15 minutes to test for effect on executive function (e.g., decision choice and subjective value). Four sessions will be conducted per subject; 2 active stimulations,(1 left DLPFC, 1 right DLPFC) and 2 sham stimulations (1 left DLPFC, 1 right DLPFC) with a minimum of 48 hours between every stimulation. Pre and post stimulations measures of cognitive and executive function will be collected and analyzed for significant differences.</description>
