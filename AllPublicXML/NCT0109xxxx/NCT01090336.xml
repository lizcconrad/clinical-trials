      Background: Both prasugrel and clopidogrel are prescribed drugs which compete as platelet
      inhibitors in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Whether rates of drug
      resistance/hyporesponsiveness are lower with prasugrel and whether more consistent and
      earlier onset of platelet inhibition may reduce infarct size in patients with ACS undergoing
      early PCI remains, at present, unknown.

      Study design/study population: This trial is a prospective, open-label, single centre
      observational trial. Patients receive either prasugrel (60mg) or clopidogrel (600mg) at the
      discretion of the attending cardiologist. Patients with exclusion criteria for prasugrel will
      be excluded for clopidogrel as well. The study population includes 80 subjects with moderate
      to high-risk ACS, ie patients with unstable angina (UA) and non-ST-segment elevation MI
      (NSTEMI) and TIMI risk score of 3 or higher, within 72 hours after onset of symptoms. In all
      patients early PCI is planned.

      Study objective/endpoint/methods: The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate whether
      rates of hyporesponsiveness are lower with prasugrel and whether more consistent and earlier
      onset of platelet inhibition may reduce infarct size in ACS in patients undergoing early PCI.

      The primary endpoint is the rate of drug resistance at time of index intervention. Optical
      and impedance aggregometry using ADP (5 and 20 μM) and collagen (1 μg/ml) as platelet
      agonists is used to measure platelet aggregation. Addition of the specific antagonists
      aspirin and mesamp to the probe is used to discriminate between pharmacodynamic and
      pharmacokinetic drug resistance.

      Secondary endpoint is the reduction of myocardial infarct size determined by
      post-interventional increase of high sensitive TnT (TnT hs) during the days following the
      index event reflecting earlier, more effective and more consistent inhibition of platelet
      function.

      Tertiary endpoint is the composite clinical endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or
      stroke and urgent target vessel revascularization during hospitalization and after 6 and 12
      months.

      Safety endpoint is any TIMI major or minor bleeding during hospital stay and after 6 and 12
      months including intracranial and life-threatening bleeding.
