    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the oral bioavailability of flavanols
      (polyphenolic compounds) from apple granules and an apple extract delivered in a water based
      beverage at two different doses. We will also investigate the effects of apple flavanols on
      nitric oxide production.

      This study is a randomized four phase crossover trial investigating the bioavailability of
      apple flavanols and the effects on nitric oxide products, a surrogate marker for changes in
      endothelial function. Each test phase will comprise a 3 day period of intervention which will
      be identical in nature (except for the test product consumed) and separated by a minimum of 1
      week. On days 1-3 of each test phase volunteers will consume a low flavanol diet. After
      consumption of the test product on the morning of day 2, blood and urine samples will be
      collected at regular intervals for the next 24h.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women aged 45-70 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Smokers (or have quit smoking less than 1 year ago)

          -  Regular prescribed medication (excluding some eye and skin medication that is judged
             not to affect study outcome)

          -  Non-prescribed medication that may affect the study data, e.g. aspirin. The use of non
             prescribed medications will be assessed on an individual basis.

          -  Dietary supplements or herbal remedies which may affect the study data unless the
             volunteer is willing to discontinue them for 1 month prior to starting study. (Please
             note that some supplements may not affect the study and this will be assessed on an
             individual basis).

          -  Gastro-intestinal diseases (excluding hiatus hernia unless symptomatic or study
             intervention/procedure is contra-indicated).

          -  Diabetics

          -  Known cardiovascular disease

          -  Asthmatics (unless no medication taken for 1 year)

          -  Lactose Intolerance

          -  Pregnancy or have been pregnant within the last 12 months

          -  Parallel participation in another research project which involves dietary intervention

          -  Participation in another research project which has involved blood sampling within the
             last four months unless the total amount of combined blood from both studies does not
             exceed 470 mls.

          -  Has donated or intends to donate blood within 16 weeks prior to or during the study
             period.

             &gt;160/100)

          -  Any person related to or living with any member of the study team

          -  Results of the clinical screening which indicate or are judged by the HNU Medical
             Advisor to be indicative of a health problem which could compromise the well-being of
             the volunteer if they participated or which could affect the study data.

          -  Alcohol consumption &gt; approximately 20 g alcohol/day (2.5 units/day)

          -  BMI &lt;19.5 or &gt; 35
