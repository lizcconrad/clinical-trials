  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a newly established Observational unit
      at St. Olavs Hospital in terms of readmission rates, compared to the provision of care in
      normal/traditional units for defined diagnosis and medical problems.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Observational units are thought to be more efficient than traditional ward units, but the
      evidence is scarce. The trial will in a randomized fashion evaluate the study hypothesis at
      an organizational level and not confined to specific diagnosis. The hypothesis to be tested
      is to confirm or reject the equal effectiveness of an Observational unit compared to a
      traditional ward for organizing in-hospital care.There are established eligibility and
      exclusion criteria based on clinical experience. Endpoint is length of stay and readmission
      within 30 days. In addition the study will give information on the use of diagnostic and
      treatment resources used and collect some basic demographic variables.
