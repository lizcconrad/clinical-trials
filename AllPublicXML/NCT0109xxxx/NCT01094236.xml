      The goal of the Playground supervision clinical trial is to see if playground management
      skills are improved, after implementing the school-wide behavior management program.

    <textblock>
      The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that over 200,000 children every
      year are admitted to emergency rooms due to playground related injuries sustained at school.
      The National Association for Playground Safety recommends not only improving surface
      materials and equipment, but also improving adult supervision of children while at play. Yet,
      there are limited empirical studies in the literature that have examined the impact of a
      comprehensive training program to improve playground safety by improving supervisor knowledge
      and attitudes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a comprehensive,
      stand-alone interactive multimedia computer-based training program for elementary school
      faculty to implement a school-wide behavior management program for playground environments.
      To do this, a randomized control trial comparing the experiences of playground supervisors,
      students, and staff from schools of a large urban school district was carried out. School was
      both the unit of randomization and the unit of analysis. The comparisons were measured by
      pre, post and follow-up assessments conducted by the investigators. Results suggest
      significant positive differences due to treatment in knowledge, beliefs and attitudes for
      playground supervisors, students, and staff.

    <description>Treatment school playground supervisors were show the CD intervention. Control school playground supervisors were given a video on playground equipment safety. All school staff subjects were assessed before the intervention and 75 days following the supervisor intervention. Students were assessed before the intervention, and then 45 days and 75 days following the supervisor intervention. School Administrators were assessed before the intervention, and then 30 and 60 days after the supervisor intervention - school administrators at treatment schools had access to a treatment binder with CDs and worksheets, while the control school administrators did not.</description>
