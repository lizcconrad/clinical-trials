      Objectives:

      Primary endpoints:

      To achieve low levels of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) ratios of B-cell antigen receptor
      (Bcr-Abl)/Bcr (molecular CR) in a significant proportion of patients after 12 months of
      higher doses (800 mg daily) of Gleevec therapy To increase the proportion of patients
      achieving a complete cytogenetic response in patients with Ph-positive chronic phase CML
      using initial higher dose Gleevec therapy.

      Secondary endpoints:

      To evaluate the durations of PCR negativity, cytogenetic response, hematologic control, and
      survival.

      To analyze differences in response rates and in prognosis within different risk groups and
      patient characteristics

      Treatment: Imatinib mesylate is a new oral medication that blocks a protein that is
      responsible for CML

      Patients on this study will take 400 mg of imatinib twice daily (morning and evening). If you
      have side effects, the dose may be lowered. If you are taking less than 800 mg of imatinib,
      you can take your dose once per day or divided in two doses. Imatinib mesylate should be
      taken with a large glass of water.

      After completing 3 to 12 months of therapy, response to imatinib mesylate will be evaluated.
      Treatment may be continued for up to 20 years, or as long as it is judged best to control the
      leukemia.

      Update June 2010:

      Blood tests are recommended 2 times per year. Your doctor will discuss with you how often you
      should have blood tests. Bone marrow will be done if your doctor thinks it is necessary to
      check your disease. You must return to M. D. Anderson at least once every year. You may not
      need a bone marrow test every visit, but you will have blood drawn to measure the amount of
      disease you have. If the leukemia cannot be found for 2 years or longer on the blood test
      called PCR which is done to measure the amount of disease you have, your doctor may talk to
      you about stopping treatment with imatinib. If you and your doctor decide to stop your
      therapy, you will have a blood test for PCR done every 3 to 6 months. You do not need to
      return to M. D. Anderson to have this blood test done. You may have the blood taken by your
      local doctor and mailed to M. D. Anderson. If the leukemia is found again by the PCR blood
      test, your doctor may recommend that you restart treatment with imatinib. You may decide to
      stay on treatment with imatinib even if your PCR blood test does not show any sign of
      leukemia for 2 years or longer.

      This is an investigational study. The FDA has authorized the use of imatinib mesylate for
      patients with CML. It is the dose of imatinib mesylate being used that is investigational. A
      total of 50 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M.D. Anderson.

    <description>CR Rate = Number participants out of total treated with complete cytogenetic response. Complete Hematologic Remission (CHR) - normalization &gt;4 weeks of bone marrow (less than 5% blasts) &amp; peripheral blood with white blood count (WBC)&lt;10x10^9/L &amp; no peripheral blasts, promyelocytes or myelocytes, disappearance of all signs &amp; symptoms of disease. Partial Hematologic Response (PHR) = CHR except persistence of immature cells (myelocytes, metamyelocytes), or splenomegaly &lt;50% of pretreatment, or thrombocytosis &gt;450x10^9/L but &lt;50% of pretreatment. Complete hematologic remission further classified according to suppression of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) by cytogenetics or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH): a) No cytogenetic response - Ph positive 100% of pretreatment value; b) Minor cytogenetic response - Ph positive 35-90% of pretreatment value; c) Partial cytogenetic response - Ph positive 1-34% of pretreatment value; d) Complete cytogenetic response - Ph positive 0%.</description>
