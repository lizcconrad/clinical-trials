  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal hypotension is a common problem during cesarian section under spinal anesthesia. The
      possible explanation for this is combined aortocaval compression by gravid uterus in
      parturient in addition to reduced systemic vascular resistance by spinal anesthesia. The
      investigators evaluated if the incidence of hypotension would be decreased by delayed supine
      positioning, by maintaining lateral position for 6 min after spinal injection, in patients
      undergoing elective cesarean section.
