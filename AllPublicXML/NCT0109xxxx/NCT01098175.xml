  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the observations in animal models and the available data in the human our hypothesis is
      that peritoneal cavity conditioning (carbon dioxide with 4% of oxygen and 10% of N2O, 100%
      humidification at 32°C,) during open surgery, will result in an important decrease in
      postoperative peritoneal inflammation, postoperative pain, and will restore bowel transit
      faster.

      Aim of the Trial :

      RCT demonstrating that peritoneal cavity conditioning during open surgery will result in a
      less postoperative inflammation, less postoperative pain, and shorter time to flatus and
      transit.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Primary endpoint : decreased pain on day 1 and 2 after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative pain : will be assessed by visual analog scales (cfr Trial by Verguts &amp; Koninckx, addendum I) assessed pain on day 1, 2 and 3 after surgery. Pain medication will be free, but preferentially ibuprofen will be used in order to permit easier comparison of pain killer intake.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>decrease in CRP and inflammatory parameters on day 1 and 2 or longer</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1-4</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative inflammatory reaction : daily assessment of inflammatory parameters as CRP, leucocytosis , and temperature for 4 to 7 days are done routinely today.
In some subsets of patients other more specific inflammatory parameters as Ca125, IL-6 can be investigated</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>lower peritoneal fluid volume on day 2</measure>
    <time_frame>day 2 after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Estimation of peritoneal fluid volume by ultrasound on the second day after surgery will be performed in some subsets of patients. We indeed recently validated a non-invasive and reliable assessment of peritoneal fluid volume by ultrasound. (Verguts et all, 2009) We expect that the postoperative peritoneal fluid volume will increase with the degree of peritoneal inflammation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shorter time to resumption of transit: time to first flatus and time to first stool</measure>
    <time_frame>day1 to 5</time_frame>
    <description>Time to first flatus and time to first stool will be recorded</description>

    <description>Full peritoneum cavity conditioning will be performed as follows. A continuous flow of less than 0.5 l/min of gas will be instilled in the lowest part of the operating wound. As gas premixed bottles with CO2+ 4% of oxygen and 10% of N2O will be used. This gas will be humidified and at 31-32 °C to be achieved by a commercial humidifier (Fisher and Paykel) programmed in order to maintain 100% relative humidity at 31-32°C upon entrance of the peritoneal cavity.</description>
