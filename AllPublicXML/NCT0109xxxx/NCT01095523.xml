    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Survival rates for colorectal cancer depend on a number of factors, including the
           existence of tumors outside the colon and rectum. Patients who had tumors elsewhere in
           the abdomen (such as in the peritoneum or ovaries) when they were diagnosed, as well as
           patients who had bleeding or obstruction when they were diagnosed, have a high risk of
           cancer recurrence even after surgery or other treatment.

        -  If additional tumors are discovered early and removed while they are still small (often
           before they can show up on scans), survival rates may improve. In addition, patients who
           receive a heated chemotherapy solution delivered directly to the abdomen often have
           better treatment outcomes regardless of whether additional tumors were found. Further
           research can help determine the usefulness of both of these treatments in improving the
           outcomes of patients with colorectal cancer.

      Objectives:

      - To determine whether patients who have had surgery for colorectal cancer have improved
      outcomes after receiving additional surgery combined with direct chemotherapy, compared with
      those who receive the current standard of care.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have had surgery for colorectal cancer within the
      past 14 months, who are considered to be at high risk for cancer recurrence, and whose
      current imaging scans show no signs of additional tumors.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be divided into two treatment groups: a surgery group and a standard
           of care group.

        -  Participants who had surgery less than 11 months ago will be enrolled in a 3-month
           lead-in phase to receive standard follow-up care, including labs, scans, and physical
           examinations, before being randomized to a treatment group between 11 and 14 months
           after surgery. Participants who had surgery between 11 and 14 months ago will be
           randomized at the time of enrollment.

        -  Participants in the surgery group will have the following procedures within 2 weeks of
           randomization:

        -  Abdominal surgery where surgeons will look for and remove any tumors and take biopsies
           to check for cancer cells

        -  Heated chemotherapy, with three chemotherapy drugs administered directly to the abdomen

        -  In-patient recovery and follow-up visits beginning 3 to 6 weeks after discharge.

        -  Participants in the standard of care group will have the standard follow-up schedule for
           high-risk colorectal cancer patients:

        -  Clinic evaluations every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years and
           yearly thereafter....

      BACKGROUND:

        -  Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) from colorectal cancer (CRC) treated with chemotherapy
           alone results in median survival of 5 to 13 months.

           .-Approximately, 55% of high risk patients (Patients presenting with synchronous PC,
           ovarian metastases perforated primary, and emergency presentation with bleeding or
           obstructing lesions) will develop PC.

        -  Early PC is undetectable by conventional imaging.

        -  Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) for
           early PC from CRC resulted in median survival of 48-63 months and 5 year survival of 51
           %.

        -  This study is a prospective randomized trial designed to answer the question whether
           mandatory second look surgery (MSLS) with CRS and HIPEC will prolong overall survival
           when compared to the standard of care.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary Objective:

      - To compare the overall survival of patients at high risk for developing PC from CRC who
      undergo M SLS + HIPEC and CRS (if applicable) vs. similar patients who receive standard of
      care.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine recurrence-free survival in both arms.

        -  To investigate selection criteria for patient who might benefit from a strategy of MSLS
           with CRS + HIPEC.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Patients who have undergone curative resection f or CRC who are at high risk for
           recurrence

        -  Patients who shown no evidence of disease at the time of enrollment

        -  Patients with ECOG less than or equal to 0-2 and suitable candidates for laparotomy,
           HIPEC and CRS.

      DESIGN:

        -  High risk CRC patients for developing PC who underwent curative surgery and subsequently
           received standard of care and remained NED for 12 months after primary surgery will be
           randomized into MSLS/CRS/HIPEC or continuing standard of care.

        -  HIPEC will be done using Oxaliplatin/5-FU/Leucovorin.

        -  Up to 100 patients will be enrolled to allow for 35 evaluable patients in each arm;
           accrual is expected to last 5 years.
