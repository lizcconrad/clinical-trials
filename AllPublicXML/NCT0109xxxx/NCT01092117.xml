    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to determine whether the Ovation Abdominal Stent
      Graft System is a safe and effective method of treating abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA's) in
      those patients considered to be suitable candidates for open surgical repair.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II prospective, consecutive enrolling, non-randomized multi-center clinical
      evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft System when
      used in the treatment of patients with AAA (Treatment Group) as compared to a performance
      goal (Control Group).

      150 study patients will be enrolled at up to 40 institutions. An additional 100 study
      patients will be enrolled in the continued access phase.

    <measure>The primary safety endpoint is defined as the proportion of subjects who experience a Major Adverse Event within 30 days of the initial procedure. The primary effectiveness endpoint is proportion of subjects that achieve Treatment Success.</measure>

    <description>The secondary safety endpoints are:
Mortality rates at 30 days and 12 months
AAA related mortality at 30 days and 12 months
Major Adverse Events (MAE) through 12 months

Technical success, defined as successful delivery and deployment of one aortic body and two iliac limbs.
Freedom from Type I &amp; III endoleaks
Freedom from stent graft migration
Freedom from AAA enlargement
Freedom from loss of device integrity
The secondary Clinical Utility endpoints will be evaluated:

        Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria

        enrollment into this study:

          1. Patient is &gt; 18 years of age

          2. Patients who are male or non-pregnant female (females of child bearing potential must
             have a negative pregnancy test prior to enrollment into the study)

          3. Patient has signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved Informed Consent Form

          4. Patient is considered by the treating physician to be a candidate for elective open
             surgical repair of the AAA (i.e., category I, II, or III per American Society of
             Anesthesiology (ASA) classification. ASA category IV patients may be enrolled provided
             their life expectancy is greater than 1 year.

          5. Patient has an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm that meets at least one of the
             following:

               -  Abdominal aortic aneurysm ≥5.0 cm in diameter

               -  Aneurysm has increased in size by 0.5 cm in last 6 months.

               -  Maximum diameter of aneurysm exceeds 1.5 times the transverse dimension of an
                  adjacent non-aneurysmal aortic segment

          6. Patient has patent iliac or femoral arteries that allow endovascular access with the
             TriVascular Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft System.

          7. Patient has a suitable non-aneurysmal proximal aortic neck length of ≥ 7 mm inferior
             to the most distal renal artery ostium.

          8. Patient has a suitable non-aneurysmal distal iliac artery length (seal zone) of ≥10
             mm. The resultant repair should preserve patency in at least one hypogastric artery.

          9. Patient has a suitable non-aneurysmal proximal aortic neck luminal diameter between 16
             and 30 mm.

         10. Patient has suitable non-aneurysmal distal iliac luminal diameters between 8 and 20
             mm.

         11. Patient meets the following anatomic criteria: the distance from the most distal renal
             artery to most superior internal iliac artery measurement is at least 13 cm.

         12. Patient has juxtarenal aortic neck angulation ≤ 60º if proximal neck is ≥10 mm and ≤

          8. Patient has had a myocardial infarction (MI) and/or stroke (CVA) within the past 6
             months.

             contrast media that is not amenable to pre-treatment.

         14. Patient has a known allergy or intolerance to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE),
             PEG-based polymers, fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) or nitinol.

         15. Patient has a body habitus that would inhibit X-ray visualization of the aorta

         16. Patient has a limited life expectancy of less than 1 year

         17. Patient is currently participating in another investigational device or drug clinical
             trial
