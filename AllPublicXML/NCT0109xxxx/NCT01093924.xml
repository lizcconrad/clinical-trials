  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 5-year community-based participatory research intervention study with the goals of
      1) conducting a more definitive study of weight loss maintenance in Native Hawaiians and
      Pacific Peoples and 2) identifying the aspects of the community-academic partnership that
      fosters a co-learning and co-equal environment.

    <textblock>
      Obesity and overweight are well recognized public health concerns in the US and the magnitude
      of excess weight is greater among racial/ethnic minority populations. For NHs and PPs 70 to
      80% of adults are estimated to be overweight or obese. Obesity-related disparities such as
      diabetes and heart disease (CVD) are also increasing among NHs and PPs. To address obesity
      and related disparities, a community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership was
      formed entitled, the Partnership for Improving Lifestyle Interventions (PILI) 'Ohana Program
      (Pili meaning relationship and 'Ohana meaning family). The PILI 'Ohana Program (POP) consists
      of 5 community organizations and the Department of Native Hawaiian Health (DNHH) at the John
      A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM) of the University of Hawai'i (UH). With a 3-year CBPR
      planning grant from the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NCMHD),
      the POP was successful at establishing this community-academic partnership aimed at
      obesity-related disparities in Hawai'i and in implementing a pilot intervention to address
      weight loss maintenance (the PILI 'Ohana Intervention) in NHs and PPs, which serves as
      preliminary data for this application. The specific aims are as follow: 1) To identify the
      aspects of the PILI 'Ohana (family + community focused) Intervention deemed effective by
      former participants and community-peer educators of the pilot intervention. 2) To test
      whether a face-to-face or DVD delivery method of the PILI 'Ohana intervention is effective in
      improving weight loss maintenance versus a control group in NHs and PPs. 3) To identify the
      strengths of the PILI 'Ohana Program that supports a co-learning and co-equal environment.

    <description>All participants will receive a 8 lesson 3-month weight loss intervention. They will then be randomized. Those continuing with the intervention will receive 17 more lessons delivered face-to-face or via DVD over 15 months for a total of 18 months. Each lesson lasts approximately 1 hour and helps participants integrate healthy eating and physical activity into their lifestyles. Participants will also be encouraged to attend 13 community activities during the last 13 months of the intervention.</description>
