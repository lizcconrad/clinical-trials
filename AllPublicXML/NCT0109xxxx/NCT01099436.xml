      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide,
      docetaxel, and zoledronic acid, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug
      (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether combination
      chemotherapy is more effective when given together with zoledronic acid in treating patients
      with breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving doxorubicin hydrochloride
      together with cyclophosphamide and docetaxel to see how well it works with or without
      zoledronic acid in treating patients with large resectable or locally advanced breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the value of neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin hydrochloride,
           cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel with or without zoledronic acid in patients with
           HER2-negative large resectable or locally advanced breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To correlate clinical response with pathological responses in both treatment arms.

        -  To evaluate the disease-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of adding zoledronic acid to neoadjuvant
           chemotherapy.

        -  To evaluate heterogeneity of the ER/PR and HER2 measurement in core biopsy and the
           surgical specimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized between 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, cyclophosphamide IV, and docetaxel
           IV on day 1. Patients also receive zoledronic acid IV over 15 minutes on day 1.
           Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, cyclophosphamide IV, and
           docetaxel IV as in arm I. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
