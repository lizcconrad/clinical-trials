  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase IV post-marketing study to evaluate the effect of Extraneal on the HOMA index in
      non-diabetic CAPD patients over the long-dwell exchange. The purpose of the study is to
      investigate if the use of Extraneal (which is a mixture of high weight glucose polymers),
      instead of glucose-based solutions such as Dianeal is going to lower the HOMA index in
      non-diabetic CAPD patients.

    <description>Measure the changes in the levels of the HOMA index when Extraneal (7.5%) is being administered in the long-dwell exchange and compare these levels to the HOMA index resulting when using Dianeal 2.5% in the long-dwell exchange in non-diabetic CAPD patients. This outcome will be evaluated by measurements taken monthly over a period of 4 months.</description>
