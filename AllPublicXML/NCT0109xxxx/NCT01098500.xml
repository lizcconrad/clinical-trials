    <textblock>
      A retrospective cohort study using the LabRx medical claims database will be performed to
      address these objectives. The primary objective of this project is to examine the background
      rates of liver function test (LFT) abnormalities in cancer patients treated with tyrosine
      kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

      Patients were not recruited for nor enrolled in this study. This study is a retrospective
      observational study. Data from medical records or insurance claims databases are anonymised
      and used to develop a patient cohort. All diagnoses and treatment are recorded in the course
      of routine medical practice.

        Retrospective cohort study using the LabRx medical claims EMR database. This database
        contains medical claims information including diagnoses, treatments, medications, and
        laboratory results for 23.3 million US residents. The study cohort included adult patients
        (age ≥18 years) with any cancer diagnosed between October 1, 2004-June 1, 2009 who were
        treated with 1 one or more of the TKI agents—erlotinib, gefitinib, dasatinib, imatinib,
        nilotinib, or lapatinib. The index date for this cohort was the date of first
        administration or prescription of the TKI agent on or following the date of the first
        cancer diagnosis.

             occurs on or after the first cancer diagnosis code
