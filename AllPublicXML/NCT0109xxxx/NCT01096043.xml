    <textblock>
      Study CXL-1020-02 employs is designed to further define suitable clinical dosages for
      CXL-1020 which will be utilized in a later Phase IIb study. The study is conducted in 3
      different stages called 'strata&quot; and evaluates the potential utility of this drug for the
      treatment of patents who are hospitalized with heart failure.

      Each of the 3 strata are described below:

      Invasive Strata 1: This is a randomized, double-blinded stratum that will enroll up to 65
      patients who are hospitalized with symptomatic heart failure who have indwelling PA catheters
      allowing invasive hemodynamic evaluation. Each patient will receive a six hour intravenous
      infusion of either placebo or CXL-1020.

      Non-Invasive Strata 2: This is a randomized, double-blinded stratum which will enroll up to
      approximately 72 patients (in several cohorts with 12-24 patients each) who neither require,
      nor have in place, an indwelling PA catheter for hemodynamic monitoring, but meet study
      entrance criteria for symptoms of heart failure, (dyspnea at rest)and systolic dysfunction by
      specific echocardiography criteria. Monitoring of drug effects will be performed by
      Echocardiography.

      Invasive-Strata 3: This is a randomized, double-blinded stratum that will begin after an
      evaluation of a substantial number of patients in Strata A and B and will enroll
      approximately 15-30 patients using the same general enrollment criteria as in Invasive Strata
      A.
