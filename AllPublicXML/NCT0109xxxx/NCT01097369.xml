      Primary Objective:

      To determine the incidence, titer and type of anti-rasburicase antibodies in the context of
      hypersensitivity reaction(s) or the loss of uricolytic activity occurring in patients with
      relapsed leukemia/lymphoma who have been re-treated with rasburicase and have experienced a
      hypersensitivity reaction or loss of uricolytic activity.

        Patients are selected as the clinical manifestations for study inclusion (hypersensitivity
        reaction or the loss of uricolytic activity) are recognized during clinically-indicated
        re-challenge with rasburicase.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Previous history of rasburicase exposure and history of administration of a repeat
             (2nd) series of rasburicase injections (in the context of supportive care for
             relapsing leukemia/lymphoma) and subsequent development of either a hypersensitivity
             reaction (HSR) or loss of uricolytic activity (defined as failure to achieve uric acid
             level of &lt; or = 7.5 mg/dl measured 48 hours after the first rasburicase injection).

               1. A severe hypersensitivity reaction (NCI Grade 3, 4 or 5) is defined as:

                  Allergic reaction; allergy; anaphylactic shock; bronchospasm; bullous skin
                  eruption; dermatitis - exfoliative; drug hypersensitivity; dyspnea; hypotension;
                  hypoxia; rash; rash - erythematous; rash - maculopapular, urticaria;
                  pyrexia/fever; edema; chest discomfort; hypersensitivity (NOS); pharynx
                  discomfort; hoarseness; pharyngeal erythema; pruritus; erythema; localized
                  exfoliation; rash - papular; swelling ¿ face/facial; toxic skin eruption; hot
                  flush; flushing; rash - macular; rash - pruritic; pruritus - allergic.

               2. Loss of uricolytic activity can be defined as:

                    -  uric acid levels &gt; 7.5 mg/dl measured 48 hours after the first rasburicase
                       injection¿, which is a time point coincident with administration of the
                       third dose of rasburicase (within that second course of treatment with this
                       agent).

          2. Patients should have received at least 2 doses of rasburicase during the repeat (2nd)
             administration in the event of loss or uricolytic activity. At least 1 dose of
             rasburicase should be administered during the repeat (2nd) administration for
             diagnosis of HSR.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Concomitant treatment with human IV immunoglobulin (IVIG)

          2. Concomitant treatment with TNF-alpha antagonists/inhibitors, i.e. adalimumab,
             infliximab, and etanercept

          3. Concomitant treatment with Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha)

          4. Unwillingness or inability to comply with the requirements of the protocol.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
