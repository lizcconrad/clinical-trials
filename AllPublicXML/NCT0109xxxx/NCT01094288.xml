      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 study that will evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of MLN8237 given orally in combination with docetaxel as a treatment for
      advanced solid tumors to determine tolerable doses and schedules of MLN8237 and docetaxel to
      be evaluated in future Phase 2 studies.
