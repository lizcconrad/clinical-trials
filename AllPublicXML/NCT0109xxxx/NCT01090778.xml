  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory trial with four cross-over arms measuring the pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic profiles of growth hormone using two different modes of growth hormone
      administration (subcutaneous infusion into the abdomen or subcutaneous bolus injection in the
      thigh) in 8 adult male or female patients with growth hormone deficiency during interval
      exercise or in supine rest. The order of dosing regimen within the groups and between the
      groups will be randomised. All patients will go through four different treatment sessions:A/B
      Single subcutaneous bolus injection, supine rest without/with interval exercise, sessions
      C/D: Continuous subcutaneous infusion, supine rest without/with interval exercise.
      Hypotheses: 1) There is day-to-day variation of exogenous growth hormone, 2)Concentration of
      growth hormone decreases due to exercise compared to supine rest, 3)There is a circadian
      variation in pharmacokinetics of exogenous growth hormone infused subcutaneously

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects will attend a screening visit and four treatment sessions. The dosing visits
      will comprise either 2-day hospital stay for the bolus injection group or 3 day hospital stay
      for the infusion group.
