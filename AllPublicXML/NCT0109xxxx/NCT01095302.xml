      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose based on the incidence of dose limiting toxicity
           and the maximum administered dose of ombrabulin in combination with docetaxel and
           cisplatin administered every 3 weeks in patients with advanced solid tumors

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the overall safety profile of the combination therapy

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of ombrabulin, its active metabolite RPR
           258063, docetaxel and cisplatin in combination.

        -  To evaluate anti-tumor activity of the combination therapy

      The duration of the study for each patient will include an up to 4-week screening phase,
      21-day study treatment cycles, an end of treatment visit and a follow-up period 30 days after
      the last infusion of ombrabulin. The patient will continue treatment until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient's refusal of further treatment.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with advanced solid tumor for which docetaxel and cisplatin is approved such
             as lung cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status &gt; or = 2.
