      This is an open-label, active-control, multicentre, parallel group, randomised and
      dose-finding efficacy and safety study.

      Compare the efficacy and safety of BioChaperone PDGF-BB applied at 12.5 µg/cm² every two days
      for up to 20 weeks to becaplermin gel (Regranex® Gel 0.01%) applied daily for up to 20 weeks
      for the treatment of neuropathic diabetic foot ulcer.

      Assess the effect of a double dose of BioChaperone PDGF-BB (25 µg/cm²) applied every two days
      for up to 20 weeks.

      After the screening visit, the eligible patient population randomly receive one of the three
      following topical drugs:

        -  BioChaperone™ PDGF-BB 12.5 µg/cm²/application for 20 weeks,

        -  BioChaperone™ PDGF-BB 25 µg/cm²/application for 20 weeks, or

        -  BioChaperone™ PDGF-BB 4 µg/cm²/application for 20 weeks, or

        -  Beclapermin gel 6.25 µg/cm²/application for 20 weeks.

      The assessment schedule for all the four groups is weekly once (7 day duration) till the 8th
      week (visit 10) and once in two weeks (14 day duration) thereafter till the end of study. The
      maximum number of visits expected is 16. The study data is presented at the end of 20 weeks.

             muscles (grade IA as defined by University of Texas Diabetic Wound Classification).

          -  Chronic ulcer of at least six weeks despite appropriate wound care.

          -  Ulcer area (greatest length by greatest width), following sharp debridement, of 1 to
             10 cm², both inclusive.

          -  Well controlled infection or cellulitis (systemic antibiotherapy).

          -  Peripheral neuropathy as assessed by Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test or by the bio
             esthesimeter (vibration perception threshold).

          -  Adequate arterial blood supply, to be measured by (color) doppler ultrasonography,
             ankle brachial pressure index &gt; 0.60, or ankle systolic pressure &gt; 70 mmHg or toe
             pressure &gt; 30 mmHg. Ankle brachial pressure index should be lower than 1.3 (which is
             frequently related to medial artery calcification.

          -  Women surgically sterile, post-menopausal, or agree to practice adequate contraception
             and have a negative pregnancy test at screening. Non-nursing.

          -  Signed informed consent before any study procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ulcer of other cause or origin: electrical, chemical or radiation insult, bedsores,
             vascular ulcer or Charcot deformities ulcers.

          -  Active ulcer infection assessed by clinical examination and radiographic if necessary.
             Presence of necrosis, purulence or sinus tracts that cannot be removed by debridement.

          -  Active osteomyelitis affecting the area of the target ulcer.

          -  Poorly controlled diabetes (uncontrolled glycemia: HbA1c ≥ 12%), renal failure (serum
             creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dL), poor nutritional status (albumin &lt; 3.0 g/dL or total protein
             &lt; 6.5 g/dL).

          -  Known connective tissue or malignant disease.

          -  Concomitant treatment with corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, radiation
             therapy, or anticancer chemotherapy.

          -  Use of investigational drug/device within 30 days.

          -  Topical application of any advance wound care on this wound (Growth Factor,
             antiseptics, antibiotics or debriders) within 7 days.

          -  Vascular reconstruction within 8 weeks. Patients expected to be noncompliant with the
             protocol (not available for the duration of the trial, treatment or wound care
             compliance), or felt to be unsuitable by the Investigator for any other reason.
