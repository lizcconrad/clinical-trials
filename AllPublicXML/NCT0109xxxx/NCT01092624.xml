  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of pessary therapy, with and without Solifenacin
      (Vesicare), on symptoms of over active bladder and bladder function in women with overactive
      bladder symptoms and pelvic organ prolapse.

      Study Hypotheses:

      Null hypothesis, HO: Reduction of anterior vaginal wall prolapse and treatment with
      solifenacin does not improve overactive bladder symptoms more than reduction of anterior
      vaginal wall prolapse and placebo.

      Alternate hypothesis, HA: Reduction of anterior vaginal wall prolapse and treatment with
      solifenacin does improve overactive bladder symptoms more than reduction of anterior vaginal
      wall prolapse and placebo.

    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) affects approximately half of all women over age 501. The most
      common type of POP is anterior vaginal wall prolapse. Symptoms associated with POP include:
      voiding dysfunction, defecatory dysfunction and vaginal bulge symptoms. Treatments for pelvic
      organ prolapse include among other options, vaginal pessary or surgery. Several studies have
      documented improved vaginal bulge symptoms in women treated with a pessary2,3,4; however,
      data are sparse regarding the effect of pessaries on lower urinary tract symptoms,
      specifically with regard to over active bladder symptoms.

      Overactive bladder, observed in approximately 40% of women 50 years of age or older, is very
      common in women with pelvic organ prolapse. Two retrospective studies have shown improvement
      in women with overactive bladder symptoms following treatment with a vaginal pessary. One
      study (using a non-validated questionnaire) found that, at two month follow-up, patients
      successfully fitted with a pessary experienced a reduction in slightly less than half of
      their urge incontinence symptoms.5 A second study (using the Sheffield pelvic organ prolapse
      symptom questionnaire), revealed that 4 months after insertion of a pessary, 38% of patients
      experienced reduced urinary urgency, and 29% experienced reduced urge urinary incontinence6.
      Despite these data, many women stop using a pessary secondary to complaints of increased
      urine incontinence. More information is needed on pessary therapy impact on bladder function.

      Specific Aim(s):

      This study will prospectively evaluate women with pelvic organ prolapse and overactive
      bladder symptoms treated with either

        1. a pessary and solifenacin, or

        2. a pessary and placebo. We will assess the effects of these therapies on overactive
           bladder symptoms over the course of the 14-week study.

    <description>Using the PFDI and PFIQ and a standardized medication response questionnaire to assess each subject's response to either the placebo or the solinefacin at Week 6 and Week 14, we will evaluate the effect of these therapies on subjects' bladder symptoms over the course of the study.</description>

    <description>There will be a two-week pessary run-in prior to randomization. If the subject completes the run-in period with no adverse reactions to the pessary, she will come in to the office for a randomization visit. She will be randomized to receive either 5 mg/day (one 5 mg tablet QD) of placebo or 5 mg/day (QD) of solifenacin for 12 weeks. At the end of week 6, patients will be assessed in the office. A standardized medication response questionnaire will be used to assess each subject's response to either the placebo or the solifenacin 5 mg. If the response is not adequate, the dose will be increased. Women whose symptoms have not improved since baseline will have their medication or placebo doses increased to 10 mg daily.</description>
