      The aim of the study is to evaluate the utility of secretin-enhanced MRI (S-MRI) in detecting
      and measuring pancreatic lesions in patients with known adenocarcinoma or Intraductal
      papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) lesions. The hypothesis is that S-MRI is superior to MRI
      without secretin enhancement (N-MRI) in increasing tumor conspicuity, allowing for improved
      identification and more accurate measurement of lesions or precursor lesions in the pancreas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer remains the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United
      States and is marked by advanced stage at diagnosis and a high mortality rate. Intraductal
      papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a cystic lesion that can be potentially cancerous,
      leading to pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Currently, there is no existing imaging modality that
      is both sensitive and cost-effective enough in accurately measuring or detecting
      adenocarcinoma and IPMN. Improving the methods used in identification and localization of
      this disease is critical.

      Secretin, a hormone produced by duodenal mucosal cells increases blood-flow to the pancreas.
      The investigators' hypothesis is that as secretin increases blood flow to the pancreas, there
      will be increased conspicuity in areas of dysplasia/cancer where there is minimal blood-flow,
      enhancing tumor detection. The investigators are conducting a prospective, randomized-control
      pilot study of thirty subjects with IPMN or pancreatic cancer who are undergoing surgical
      resection at Columbia University's Pancreas Center. Fifteen subjects will be randomly
      selected to undergo S-MRI prior to surgery and fifteen subjects will be selected as controls,
      undergoing MRI without secretin-enhancement and matched for age, sex, race and tumor-type.
      The investigators will first evaluate if secretin allows for increased tumor conspicuity,
      enhanced visualization of the lesion, by comparing the calculated tumor conspicuity of S-MRI
      to N-MRI groups.

      The investigators will then assess if S-MRI imaging allows for increased accuracy in lesion
      measurements by looking at the concordance in measurements between S-MRI and tumor specimens
      post-resection as compared to the concordance in measurements between N-MRI and tumor
      specimens post-resection.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in lesion conspicuity between S-MRI and N-MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is whether S-MRI allows for better tumor detection secondary to anticipated increased conspicuity of tumor due to secretin's effect on increasing blood flow to the normal pancreas as compared to N-MRI. Determining S-MRI's efficacy versus that of N-MRI will be carried out by comparing tumor conspicuity measurements in S-MRI and N-MRI groups. Tumor conspicuity will be measured by calculating the contrast to noise ratio, placing region of interest (ROI) on tumor and adjacent tissue and dividing by image noise.</description>

    <measure>Concordance of tumor measurements between S-MRI images and tumor specimens post-resection vs. concordance of tumor measurements between N-MRI and tumor specimens post-resection</measure>
    <time_frame>45 days</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome will be the discrepancy in tumor size estimated from MRI and &quot;confirmed&quot; from post-surgical specimens. Tumor size estimated from MRI scans will be determined by measuring the greatest linear dimension (metric) of the lesion. Tumor size estimated by pathology will be directly measured using a linear scale (metric), taking the greatest linear dimension of the resected tumor. The discrepancy in estimated versus &quot;confirmed&quot; tumor size will be compared between S-MRI and N-MRI groups.</description>
