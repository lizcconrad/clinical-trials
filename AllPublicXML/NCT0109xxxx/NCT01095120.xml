    <textblock>
      Tesetaxel is an orally administered chemotherapy agent of the taxane class. This study is
      being undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tesetaxel administered as second-line
      therapy to patients with advanced gastric cancer.

    <description>For subjects in Cohort A, a flat dose of 40 mg will be administered in Cycle 1; the dose will be adjusted based on body weight. In subsequent cycles, depending on tolerability, the Cycle 1 flat dose may be increased by 5 mg in Cycle 2, and the Cycle 2 flat dose may again be increased by 5 mg in Cycle 3.
For subjects in Cohort B, a flat dose of 50 mg will be administered in Cycle 1; the dose will be adjusted based on body weight. In subsequent cycles, depending on tolerability, the dose may be increased by 10 mg in Cycle 2.
For subjects in Cohort C, a dose of 27 mg/m2 will be administered in Cycle 1. In subsequent cycles, depending on tolerability, the dose will be increased to 35 mg/m2 in Cycle 2.</description>
