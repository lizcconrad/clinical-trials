    <textblock>
      This is a research study to see if a new drug called bortezomib is useful to treat multiple
      myeloma in people who are newly diagnosed, and have not yet received treatment for their
      disease. VELCADE® (bortezomib) for Injection is a drug under development by Millennium
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

      This study is a multi-site study which will enroll up to 50 patients with multiple myeloma
      who have not had prior treatment.

      Prior to starting treatment individuals will be evaluated to determine if they are eligible
      to participate in the study. There are certain prestudy test that are required: physical
      exam, blood tests, ECG, chest x-ray, skeletal survey, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy to
      confirm the diagnosis of multiple myeloma and to determine baseline health status.

      Before beginning each treatment cycle and at the end of the study, patients will have protein
      studies (including blood and urine) to see if they are responding to the treatment. Before
      each weekly treatment cycle patients will also have blood tests for red and white blood cells
      and platelets, and blood chemistry tests for electrolytes, kidney and liver function, calcium
      and blood sugar.

      Patients may receive up to 6 cycles of treatment. At the end of the study, individuals who
      have responded to treatment will be seen every two months to check for disease progression.

    <description>Bortezomib is administered at a dose of 1.6mg/m2 IV push over 3 to 5 seconds. Treatment is administered once a week for four weeks followed by one week off. This 5 week period is considered a treatment cycle. Dexamethasone is also administered at a dose of 40mg daily on day of and day after each dose of Bortezomib, with a dose reduction to 20mg on the same schedule if the patient cannot tolerate the higher dose of dexamethasone. The study duration for a given subject will be approximately 30 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of multiple myeloma based on standard criteria.

          2. Measurable disease, defined as a monoclonal immunoglobulin spike on serum
             electrophoresis of &gt; 1Gm/dL and/or urine monoclonal immunoglobulin spike of &gt; 200mg/24
             hours.

          3. Non-secretors must have measurable protein by Freelite or measurable disease such as
             plasmacytoma to be eligible.

          4. Patient must not have been previously treated with chemotherapy. Prior treatment of
             hypercalcemia with corticosteroids, or bisphosphonates does not disqualify the
             patient.
