  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carbon monoxide poisoning still places a burden on the healthcare system worldwide. While
      oxygen therapy is the cornerstone treatment, the role and practical modalities of hyperbaric
      oxygen therapy (HBO) remain controversial. This study aimed at comparing two sessions of HBO
      at 2 absolute atmosphere and one session of HBO at 2 absolute atmosphere followed by 4 hours
      of normobaric oxygen therapy in comatose adult victims of acute domestic carbon monoxide
      poisoning.

    the study was halted after the first interim analysis as there were significantly more patients
