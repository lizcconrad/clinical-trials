      This study is investigating the changes in specific hormone levels in women age 30-45 after a
      12 week weight loss intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In sum, excess body weight and inactivity have emerged as strong avoidable causes of
      postmenopausal breast cancer, with the greatest potential for primary prevention occurring
      during the premenopausal years. However, surprisingly, no study to date has examined the
      effects of a standard behavioral weight loss intervention on breast cancer risk markers in
      premenopausal women. Understanding the effects of weight loss in premenopausal women is a
      critical next step in existing research and will inform the development of future breast
      cancer primary prevention programs. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility
      of recruiting, treating, and retaining 20 overweight/obese women in a 12-week randomized
      control trial examining feasibility and effects of a behavioral weight loss program on breast
      cancer risk markers in premenopausal women. Participants will be randomly assigned to either
      a 12-week comprehensive behavioral weight loss program (n=10) or control condition (n=10).
      All women will be assessed at baseline and after 3 months of treatment.

    <description>One group in this randomized study will be focused on weight loss during a 3 month period. The goal is to acheive a 6% weight loss during this time. Specific blood draws will be conducted pre and post weight loss to measure any hormonal changes due to this weight loss.</description>

    <description>The secondary objective in this study is to increase participant activity level to help reduce the risks of certain cancers. As well as increase the overall health of these participants.</description>

    <description>The group will be implemented to induce a 6% weight loss over 3 months. The lessons will follow protocols from the Look AHEAD trial and Diabetes Prevention Program. This behavioral program has been shown to promote long-term weight loss and a reduction in diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors, and is based on the social cognitive theory.</description>

    <description>Participants in this group will receive support and education about healthy eating and activity with lessons based on the Look AHEAD support and education control condition. Participants will attend monthly closed group meetings and meetings will be designed to promote retention but not weight loss.</description>
