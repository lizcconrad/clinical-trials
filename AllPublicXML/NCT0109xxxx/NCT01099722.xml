      A comparator study to assess safety and efficacy of Flutiform® compared with symbicort
      turbohaler in asthma patients with moderate to severe persistent, reversible asthma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study involving a 2-4 week run-in phase followed by a 12 week double blind
      treatment phase. During the run-in phase, subjects receive Flixotide®. In the treatment phase
      subjects will be randomised to one of the two treatment groups and will receive either
      FlutiForm® and placebo inhaler for symbicort® turbohaler® or symbicort® turbohaler® and
      placebo inhaler for Flutiform ® . Efficacy will be assessed by lung function tests, asthma
      symptoms, sleep disturbance due to asthma and rescue medication use. Safety will be assessed
      by adverse events, lab tests, ECGs and vital signs.

    <description>To show non-inferiority in the efficacy of FlutiForm® pMDI 125/5 µg (2 puffs bid) vs Symbicort® Turbohaler® 200/6 µg (2 puffs bid), based on the mean change in the pre morning dose value of forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) from baseline (end of run-in period) to the end of the 12 week treatment period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Additional efficacy and safety assessments</measure>
    <description>efficacy assessments include patient centered outcome assessments such as asthma quality of life questionnaire, subject's assessment of study medication, amount of rescue medication use, asthma symptom scores, sleep disturbance due to asthma, discontinuations due to lack of efficacy, compliance with study medication use &amp; asthma exacerbations. Post dose FEV1, peak expiratory flow rates &amp; other lung function parameters.
Safety assessments include incidence &amp; type of spontaneously reported adverse events, vital signs, laboratory tests and 12-lead ECGs.</description>

             consistently &amp; correctly such as sterilisation, implants, injectables, combined oral
             contraceptives, some IUDs (Intrauterine Device, hormonal), sexual abstinence or
             vasectomised partner.

             to the Screening Visit characterised by:

             Treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) at a dose of 250 - 1000 µg fluticasone
             or equivalent OR Treatment wth ICS at a dose of 200-500 µg fluticasone or equivalent
             in combination with a Long Acting β2-Agonist (LABA).

          4. Demonstrated a FEV1 of ≥ 50% to ≤ 80% for predicted normal values (Quanjer et al.,
             1993 (adults), &amp; 1995 (adolescents)) during the Screening Period (Visit 1 or Visit 2)
