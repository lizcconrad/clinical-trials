  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic nephropathy is becoming the most common primary renal disease in end stage renal
      disease patients. The prevalence of diabetic patients in dialysis reaches even the 30% of the
      dialysis population (USRDS) with an incidence rate, in some countries, up to 40%. The 5 years
      surviving time of diabetic patients in dialysis is about the 20% and, compared to the
      hypertension and glomerulonephritis complications, still remains the worst. Diabetes is often
      associated to several comorbid factors such as hypertension, autonomic neuropathy,
      vasculopathy, metabolic disorders (ketoacidosis, poor glycaemic control), and electrolyte
      disorders. So, the diabetic patient is fragile, with a rather poor tolerance to dialysis,
      lack of achievement of dry body weight and inadequate dialysis. In order to gain a more
      detailed insight into a possible better tolerance to dialysis, arising from the elimination
      of acetate in dialysate bath (Acetate Free Biofiltration) and from the use of an automatic
      system to control the blood volume (Blood Volume Control),the investigators would like to
      investigate the cardiovascular stability and the frequency of intradialytic symptoms in a
      prospective, randomized, cross-over study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acetate-Free-Biofiltration (AFB) was proved to be a technique suitable to treat critical
      patients, such as elders and diabetics, because of frequency reduction of hypotensive
      episodes and symptoms during the treatment and a better control to metabolic aspects (such as
      metabolic acidosis).

      The Blood Volume Control (BVC) is a tool, that allows to improve the cardiovascular tolerance
      to the treatment, especially in hypotension-prone patients, appearing promising in the
      correction of the arterial hypertension induced by the hydro-saline overload.

      The use of BVC in AFB has been tested to verify the behaviour of the kinetics of electrolyte
      (in particular of bicarbonate) and it has got good results, in terms of a further improvement
      in treatment tolerance, for critical patients However, this therapy (AFB+BVC) was not yet
      evaluated as the dialysis tolerance improvement in diabetics concern, nor the relative
      contribution given by each factor in achieving this result.

      The study, 9 months long, is aimed to verify the treatment tolerance of insulin requiring
      diabetic patients, by using standard bicarbonate dialysis (BD), or Acetate Free Biofiltration
      (AFB) and/or a Blood Volume Control(BVC). The study is divided in three phases: the first
      one, three months long, is the baseline in standard bicarbonate dialysis, then all the
      patients are shifted to AFB with BVC, for other three months, while the last three months
      long phase, after a randomization, has the aim to identify the relative contribution of each
      factor (absence of acetate in the bath or BVC) in the treatment tolerance improvement(if
      any). The treatment tolerance will be evaluated considering the frequency of intradialytic
      hypotensive events.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The treatment tolerance is measured by the number of intradialytic hypotensive events, defined as:
systolic blood pressure less then 90 mmHg;
systolic blood pressure more then 25 mmHg to the predialysis value, with hypotensive events requiring therapies;
systolic blood pressure less then 90 mmHg with hypotensive events requiring therapies for those patients, which predialysis systolic blood pressure value was 100 mmHg.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary outcome measure is to evaluate the relative efficiency of each factor (AFB in the bath and blood volume control) to reach this result.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation will be done on:
frequency of hypotensive events, during dialysis (defined as above);
number of nurse interventions (defined as ultrafiltration rate stop, or saline infusion);
