    <textblock>
      This is an observational, pilot, non-treatment study to evaluate and develop clinical
      variables for distinguishing female OAB subjects that have detrusor overactivity positive
      (DO+) nocturia from female OAB subjects that have detrusor overactivity negative (DO-)
      nocturia utilizing a sleep laboratory setting.
