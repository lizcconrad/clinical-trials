  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe sepsis still carries a high mortality rate despite advantages in intensive care
      medicine and antimicrobial therapy. The inflammatory and procoagulant host response to
      infection are intricately linked and interactions between platelets, leukocytes and the
      endothelium play a central role in the pathogenesis of septic shock and disseminated
      intravascular coagulation (DIC). Interestingly, one key player cell in coagulation, i.e. the
      platelet, has been somewhat neglected as to its position in the pathogenesis of coagulation
      abnormalities in sepsis. However, thienopyridines, irreversible platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor
      antagonists, e.g. prasugrel, could potentially provide beneficial anticoagulatory and
      antiinflammatory effects: P2Y12 ADP-receptor antagonists reduce TF-induced coagulation
      activation in various ex vivo and in vitro models. Moreover, various lines of evidence
      indicate that thienopyridines may block platelet leukocyte interactions and thereby reduce
      the propagation of the coagulation and inflammation process.

      LPS-infusion in healthy volunteers provides a standardized model to safely study non overt
      DIC and to document possible effects of therapeutic and prophylactic interventions.

      The investigators hypothesize that thienopyridines, irreversible platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor
      antagonists, may blunt TF-triggered coagulation activation in humans, which will be studied
      in a TF-dependent coagulation model in humans.
