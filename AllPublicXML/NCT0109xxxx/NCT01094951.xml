      This two-stage research study will

        1. train caseworkers in three participating New York City Neighborhood Houses to screen
           their clients for depression, and

        2. examine the usefulness of training these caseworkers in an intervention that targets
           barriers seniors face in receiving mental health services. In this intervention, called
           ENGAGE, Case Workers will: 1. identify and address seniors' barriers to receiving mental
           health services; 2. include the seniors' preferences in deciding which treatment options
           to choose; and 3. help seniors connect with affordable mental health services of their
           choice.

      In this research study, study investigators are partnering with United Neighborhood Houses of
      New York, the umbrella membership organization of the 34 New York City Neighborhood Houses.
      Due to the limited scope of this feasibility study, we have selected three Houses to serve as
      recruitment sites. These three house approximate the gender and racial characteristics of the
      larger group.

      During Stage 1, investigators will work with the three Houses in implementing systematic
      research assessments to identify level of psychopathology, referral patterns, and connections
      to mental health evaluation among their depressed senior clients. Investigators will train
      caseworkers to screen their clients for depression and will also instruct caseworkers to
      refer any senior scoring endorsing depressive symptoms to their partnering community-based
      mental health or medical clinic. Data on successful connections to mental health evaluation
      will serve as the comparison to that achieved by Stage 2, the ENGAGE intervention.

      During Stage 2 study investigators will train all caseworkers from each Neighborhood House to
      use the ENGAGE intervention. For eligible depressed seniors, the caseworker will:

        1. provide psychoeducation that addresses client-specific barriers to evaluation and care
           (e.g., stigma, transportation);

        2. use shared decision-making strategies to engage seniors and arrive at a decision about
           where and from whom to receive an evaluation and possible care; and

        3. provide connections to preferred mental health services. Mental health service options
           will include referral to the senior's primary care physician or local community mental
           health clinic for further evaluation.

      In two subsequent sessions 2 and 4 weeks later, the caseworker will assess success in
      receiving a mental health evaluation, and in initiating treatment:

        -  If the senior has not yet pursued an evaluation, the caseworker will continue to address
           his/her individual barriers and will re-engage in shared decision-making if necessary.

        -  If the senior did receive an evaluation that confirms a depressive diagnosis, but
           remains undecided about treatment, the case worker will empower and help the senior to
           select an appropriate treatment of his/her choice and will encourage ongoing engagement
           in this treatment.

        -  If an evaluation revealed the absence of a depressive disorder and no treatment
           recommendations, the caseworker will re-assess to ensure that depression did not emerge.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 60 years and older.

          -  Positive screen for major depression (PHQ-9 greater than 10): We chose standard PHQ-9
             screening to correspond to routine procedures within each House that identify seniors
             in need of evaluation for treatment.

          -  Capacity to provide written consent for both research assessment and treatment. This
             criterion is necessary because subjects must be able to participate meaningfully in
             the interventions offered by the study and the assessment procedures.

          -  Working knowledge of English. Fluency in English sufficient for comprehending
             questionnaires of the study and/or for understanding the case worker. English does not
             have to be the subject's first language.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  MMSE score &lt; 24 or clinical diagnosis of dementia. Dementia, or cognitive impairment
             at this level may limit the senior's ability to participate in the intervention.

          -  Psychotic or manic symptoms or alcohol or substance dependence. These symptoms and
             disorders will be determined by the SCID assessment and require alternative
             interventions than those offered by the study. We focus in this project on seniors
             with depressive symptoms given existing Neighborhood House procedures for standard
             depression screening, and given difficulties in training case worker staff on
             screening for other psychiatric disorders. If this project is successful, we may then
             expand our efforts to target other disorders such as psychotic, manic, and alcohol and
             substance abuse and dependence disorders.

          -  Antidepressant medication or psychotherapy in the 4 weeks prior to baseline
             evaluation. The intervention is focused on linking depressed seniors who are in need
             of mental health services rather than those currently receiving treatment.

          -  Acute or severe medical illness: i.e., delirium, metastatic cancer, decompensated
             cardiac, liver or kidney failure, major surgery, stroke or myocardial infarction
             during the three months prior to entry; or drugs often causing depression, e.g.,
             steroids, reserpine, alpha-methyl-dopa, tamoxifen, vincristine.

          -  Antisocial personality by DSM-IV: This disorder will possibly interfere with adherence
             to research procedures and treatment.
