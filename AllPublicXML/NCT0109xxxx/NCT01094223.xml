  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The broad, long-term objective of the current research is to improve treatment for stimulant
      use disorders by augmenting traditional relapse prevention therapy with innovative
      meditation-based strategies to promote affect regulation skills. Based on Mindfulness-Based
      Cognitive Therapy for depression (Segal, Teasdale, &amp; Williams, 2002), Marlatt and colleagues
      recently developed a manualized intervention for the treatment of substance using
      populations: Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP). The specific aims of this research
      are 1) To conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial to assess the feasibility of recruiting
      and retaining individuals for a large scale study and to determine the effect size of MBRP
      relative to a health education (ED) control group in stimulant users receiving contingency
      management (CM). Both MBRP and ED participants will be assessed at baseline, treatment-end,
      and 1 month post-treatment. 2) To test the impact of MBRP compared to ED on negative affect,
      stimulant use, and health care outcomes. 3) To evaluate the differential effects of MBRP
      versus ED on HIV-risk behavior of participants, and 4) To examine potential mechanisms of
      action of MBRP, including reductions in stress reactivity and biological indicators of
      arousal such as blood pressure and heart rate. The investigators hypothesize that MBRP will
      be more efficacious than ED in reducing negative affect and stimulant use. Further, the
      investigators expect that MBRP will produce greater reductions in HIV-risk behaviors, stress
      reactivity, and arousal, and these changes will be associated with substance use outcomes.
      MBRP incorporates specific substance-focused cognitive therapy techniques with an additional
      emphasis on mindfulness skills. By providing coping skills to address affect regulation and
      stress reactivity, two important factors in stimulant relapse, MBRP may provide a promising
      augmenting strategy for the treatment of stimulant users.
