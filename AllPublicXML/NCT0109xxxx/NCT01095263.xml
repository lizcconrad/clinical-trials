  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will investigate in a sham controlled design antidepressant effects and
      safety of DBS to the superolateral branch of the main medial forebrain bundle (slMFB).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The target point for DBS in major depression disorder is located lateral to the ventral
      tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain at the branching point of the superolateral branch
      (slMFB) from the main medial forebrain bundle (MFB).

      The exact stimulation coordinates are:

      MNI152 coordinates:

      left: x(lat.)=-5, y(ap)=-14, z(vert.)=-8 right: x(lat.)=5, y(ap)=-14, z(vert.)=-9

      MCP coordinates:

      eft: x(lat.)=-6, y(ap)=-1, z(vert.)=-6 right: x(lat.)=4, y(ap)=-1, z(vert.)=-7

      All coordinates refer to the MNI152 brain. Legend: slMFB = superolateral branch of medial
      forebrain bundle, MNI152=Montreal Neurologic Institute brain 152 coordinates, MCP =
      mid-commissural point coordinates, lat. = lateral, ap= antero-posterior, vert. = vertical.

      In addition to the described intervention, we will record EEG activity within the implanted
      regions during cognitive paradigms (Fell and Axmacher, Nat Rev Neurosci 2011). Specifically,
      we will investigate the neural mechanisms underlying classification learning, working memory
      and exploration of rewarded spatial locations and explore oscillatory responses following
      stimulation of the target regions. These experimental paradigms will be conducted on the
      first day after electrode implantation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Severity assessed with Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month after DBS stimulation onset</time_frame>
    <description>Change in MADRS after 12 months as compared to mean baseline score. MADRS is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. It is used as an adjunct to the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) and more sensitive to the changes in depression than the Hamilton Scale is.
MADRS will be rated 3 times for baseline assessment, weekly during parameter optimization and monthly during follow-up. Reduction compared to baseline will be assessed after 12 months of DBS.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Severity rated with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS24)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month after DBS stimulation onset</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), also known as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) or abbreviated to HAM-D, is a multiple choice questionnaire that clinicians may use to rate the severity of a patient's major depression. The questionnaire rates the severity of symptoms observed in depression such as low mood, insomnia, agitation, anxiety and weight loss. The questionnaire is presently one of the most commonly used scales for rating depression in medical research.
Measures will be taken at same time points as primary outcome measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Event Schedule</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month after DBS stimulation onset</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be recorded during the study using a structured questionnaire. All possible AEs are assessed in severity, duration and actions taken. 12 months after stimulation onset results will be compiled and rated as being due to the surgical procedure, device, or stimulation. SAEs will be discussed individually if a modification of study protocol is required.</description>
