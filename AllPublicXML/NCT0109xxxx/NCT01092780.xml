  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the safety and efficacy of MK-7288 for the treatment of excessive daytime
      sleepiness (EDS) in participants with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/hypopnea syndrome (HS)
      who are compliant with effective nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) therapy.
      The goal of this study is to determine the effect of MK-7288 after single dose administration
      on promoting wakefulness as measured by sleep latency on Maintenance of Wakefulness Tests,
      and on driving performance as measured by standard deviation of lane position in simulated
      driving (country vigilance driving).

    <measure>Mean Sleep Latency Score on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) for Participants Taking MK-7288 Versus Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 5 and 7 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Study drug was administered at 08:00. MWT, an objective measure of the participant's ability to maintain wakefulness, was administered at 09:00, 11:00, 13:00 and 15:00. A least squares (LS) mean of the 4 MWTs performed at 09:00, 11:00, 13:00 and 15:00 was calculated. Latency for each MWT is defined as the time to onset of the first 16 continuous seconds of any stage of sleep; if no sleep has been observed according to these rules, then the latency is defined as 30 minutes. A higher MWT value is considered a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Mean Score on Standard Deviation of Lane Position (SDLP) Driving Test for Participants Taking MK-7288 Versus Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 4 and 6 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Study drug was administered at 08:00. Driving performance was measured by the SDLP test which is a 45-minute driving simulation country vigilance test and was performed by participants at 10:00, 12:00 and 14:00. An LS mean of the 2 SDLP driving test results performed at 10:00 and 14:00 was calculated. A lower value is considered a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Clinical and Laboratory Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 days</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the use of the study drug. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study drug, is also an AE.</description>

        <title>Mean Sleep Latency Score on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) for Participants Taking MK-7288 Versus Placebo</title>
        <description>Study drug was administered at 08:00. MWT, an objective measure of the participant's ability to maintain wakefulness, was administered at 09:00, 11:00, 13:00 and 15:00. A least squares (LS) mean of the 4 MWTs performed at 09:00, 11:00, 13:00 and 15:00 was calculated. Latency for each MWT is defined as the time to onset of the first 16 continuous seconds of any stage of sleep; if no sleep has been observed according to these rules, then the latency is defined as 30 minutes. A higher MWT value is considered a better outcome.</description>

        <description>Study drug was administered at 08:00. Driving performance was measured by the SDLP test which is a 45-minute driving simulation country vigilance test and was performed by participants at 10:00, 12:00 and 14:00. An LS mean of the 2 SDLP driving test results performed at 10:00 and 14:00 was calculated. A lower value is considered a better outcome.</description>

A least squares (LS) mean of the 4 MWTs performed at 09:00, 11:00, 13:00 and 15:00 was calculated. Latency for each MWT is defined as the time to onset of the first 16 continuous seconds of any stage of sleep; if no sleep has been observed according to these rules, then the latency is defined as 30 minutes.

        <description>Study drug was administered at 08:00. Driving performance was measured by the SDLP test which is a 45-minute driving simulation country vigilance test and was performed by participants at 10:00, 12:00 and 14:00. An LS mean of the 2 SDLP driving test results performed at 10:00 and 14:00 was calculated. A lower value is considered a better outcome.</description>
