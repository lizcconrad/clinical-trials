      The purpose of the Post-preeclampsia Renal Project is to investigate the renal function of
      preeclamptic women after delivery, and to determine whether the anti-hypertensive drug named
      benazepril efficiently improves the dysfunctions observed.

    <textblock>
      Several epidemiological studies suggest that the risk of death from cardiovascular causes
      among women with preeclampsia may be increased, and that preeclampsia contrary to what has
      been long thought, is not cured with delivery. Preeclampsia has long been considered a
      2-stage disease, stage one corresponding to an impaired placental perfusion resulting from
      abnormal spiral artery remodeling, and stage two corresponding to the maternal manifestations
      of disease, characterized by hypertension and proteinuria. However, preeclampsia might
      include an additional, 3rd stage, that of the post-partum period (Gammill &amp; Roberts, 2007)
      This phase deserves to be investigated. In particular, it is crucial to determine whether the
      changes that occur in renal hemodynamics during preeclampsia are reversible after more than 6
      weeks, and whether PEC women are salt-sensitive after delivery.

      The link between chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular mortality is well established. An
      independent, graded association exists between a reduced GFR and the risk of death,
      cardiovascular events, and hospitalization (Go et al, 2004). Besides, salt-sensitivity is
      associated with an increased cardiovascular and renal risk (Franco &amp; Oparil, 2006). The Renal
      Post PEC study aims at establishing if the renal dysfunctions that occur in PEC women can be
      reversed by the administration of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system that are known
      to improve cardiovascular and renal risk profiles in hypertensive patients. By virtue of
      their potent renal vasodilatory properties and favourable remodelling of the GBM, ACE
      inhibitors may improve salt-sensitivity, endothelial function, renal plasma flow and GFR, and
      general renal prognosis in women who experienced from preeclampsia.
