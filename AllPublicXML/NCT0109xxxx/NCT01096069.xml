  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a correlation between the CD55, CD59, CD35 and CD46 expression on B lymphocytes of
      patients before and after treatment with rituximab and the level of depletion and
      repopulation time for these cells. The theoretical rationale of the study assumes that the
      correlation, if any, will be a negative correlation. However, the hypothesis of positive
      correlation (two-tailed test) will also be tested.

    <textblock>
      Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, is a new alternative treatment for patients with
      severe immune diseases and resistance to conventional treatment. One of the mechanisms of
      action of this drug is the complement-mediated lysis. Most RA patients respond well to
      rituximab treatment, however, some are refractory and mechanism of this non-response is still
      unclear. The role of CD55 and CD59 protein and its overexpression as a mechanism of
      resistance to rituximab treatment in lymphoma patients have been investigated. However, there
      has not been studied a correlation between the intensity of expression of these regulatory
      molecules on B cells of RA patients and resistance to treatment with Rituximab.

        Patients diagnosed with RA and clinical indication for treatment with rituximab and who
        have obtained access to medication (private purchase, delivery by a private health plan,
        lawsuit or donation by the laboratory Roche) will be invited to participate in the study
        during the physician appointment.
