    <textblock>
      The Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network
      has been established to focus on a broader approach to the study of Interstitial Cystitis
      (IC)/Painful Bladder Syndrome (PBS) in men and women, and Chronic Prostatitis (CP)/Chronic
      Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS) in men, than previously undertaken. Participants with some form
      or symptoms of IC or CP are being asked to join the Trans-MAPP Epidemiology and Phenotyping
      (EP) Study.

      As with many chronic pain disorders, IC and CP are poorly understood, and treatment is often
      not helpful. The goal of this study is to better understand how pain is felt in people with
      IC or CP. The MAPP EP Study is an observational study that will enroll approximately 360
      participants from 6 Discovery Sites and 3 Satellite Sites across the U.S. We will ask
      questions and gather information about the health and life of the participants for research
      purposes. No study treatment or interventions will be given to participants in MAPP. We hope
      that this study will lead to improvement in the treatment of IC and CP.

      Potentially eligible participants will be scheduled for an eligibility screening session,
      followed by an extensive baseline phenotyping session, which together are expected to take
      approximately 2.5 hours to complete. Participants will be provided with breaks as needed
      during the clinic visit. The eligibility screening session is intended to collect the
      minimally sufficient data to confirm eligibility, so that the extensive baseline phenotyping
      session is initiated only for participants highly likely to be confirmed after the 48 hour
      urine culture results are known.

      Participants who enroll in the study and complete a baseline clinic visit will be followed up
      with bi-weekly and bi-monthly internet-based questionnaires, as well as in-clinic visits at 6
      and 12 months.

      Participants will provide self-reported symptom data using web based internet tools on a
      bi-weekly basis. These questions are expected to be completed within 5-7 minutes.

      A more extensive set of questionnaires will be administered to each participant every two
      months during the 12-month study period. The bi-monthly assessment will also be administered
      via the internet, and the questions are expected to be completed within 10-15 minutes.

    <description>Extensive data on risk factors and outcomes measures will be collected for the Trans-MAPP EP Study. These measures can be classified into a number of primary domains as described below.
Single point in time: this includes measures that do not change over time, such as demographic information, &quot;trait measures&quot; (e.g., personality), and early life history measures. In general, these measures are collected at the initial in-person clinic visit, although some are collected in the second (6-month) in-person visit to reduce participant burden at baseline;
Baseline, 6-month and 12-month phenotyping in-clinic visits;
Bi-monthly personal internet-based assessment;
Bi-weekly personal internet-based assessment.</description>

        The Trans-MAPP EP Study population will include adult participants, at least 18 years of
        age, with urological chronic pelvic pain syndromes. Approximately half of the participants
        will be male, and half will have recent onset (within two years) of pelvic pain symptoms
        and/or limited treatment as determined by self-report.

          2. Agreed to participate in Trans-MAPP EP Study procedures.

          3. Participant reports a response of at least 1 on the pain, pressure or discomfort
             scale.

        For males or females (IC/PBS criteria)

        1. Participant reports an unpleasant sensation of pain, pressure or discomfort, perceived
        to be related to the bladder and/or pelvic region, associated with lower urinary tract
        symptoms for the majority of the time during any 3 months in the previous 6 months or for
