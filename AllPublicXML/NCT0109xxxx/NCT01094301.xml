  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-stroke shoulder pain is defined as pain in the shoulder area that starts after a person
      has had a stroke. The SPR System is an investigational device that is being studied for the
      relief of post-stroke shoulder pain. The SPR System uses electrical stimulation and includes
      a Trial Stage (where a temporary system is used to see if the subject may benefit from this
      type of therapy) and may include an Implant Stage (where a small device is implanted under
      the skin in the chest). The SPR System delivers mild electrical stimulation to the muscles in
      the shoulder where the subject feels pain. This research study will evaluate the effect of
      electrical stimulation on shoulder pain.

      Individuals who are over the age of 21, who had a stroke at least six months ago, who
      experience shoulder pain, and have tried other therapies for their shoulder pain, may be
      eligible to participate in the first stage of the SPR System. Subjects meeting the specified
      success criteria at the conclusion of the SPR Trial Stage who experience a return of pain
      within 6 months of completion of the Trial Stage may be eligible for the second stage (SPR
      Implant Stage). This research study lasts a little over 3 years and may include 17 visits to
      the study doctor and at least 8 telephone calls from study staff.

    <description>The SPR System is an investigational two-staged device which delivers stimulation to the muscles in the shoulder. Subjects with chronic post-stroke shoulder pain who meet eligibility criteria for the first stage (SPR Trial Stage) will receive a temporary Lead and External Stimulator. Subjects who qualify and who agreed to proceed will advance to the second stage (SPR Implant Stage) which uses an Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG) and Implantable Lead. Subjects will be followed until 36-months after IPG stimulation has been started.</description>
