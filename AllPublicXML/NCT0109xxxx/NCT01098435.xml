    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of daily doses of RDC-0313 (ALKS 33)
      compared with placebo in adults with binge-eating disorder (BED). An additional objective is
      to explore the efficacy of RDC-0313 treatment in comparison with placebo in adults with
      binge-eating disorder.

    <textblock>
      Following screening, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to RDC-0313 (ALKS
      33) or matching placebo. Once-daily at-home dosing will begin at randomization and will
      continue for 6 weeks. There will be 8 study visits over a 12-week study period. On an ongoing
      basis, subjects will complete a take-home binge diary designed to record the number of
      binge-eating episodes (binge episodes) and binge-eating days (binge days, days during which
      at least 1 binge occurred), as well as snacks and meals consumed daily over each 7-day
      period.
