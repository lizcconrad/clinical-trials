      This study will provide data on sasety and efficacy of Ustekinumab in patients suffering from
      Palmo-Plantar Pustular Psoriasis (PPPP) or Palmo-Plantar Pustulosis(PPP)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty patients with active Palmo-Plantar Pustular Psoriasis (cohort A) and twenty patients
      with active Palmo-Plantar Pustulosis (cohort B) will be included in this placebo-controlled
      double-blind study.Patients in each cohort will be randomized (1:1) to receive either
      ustekinumab S/C (Sub-Cutaneous) (45 mg for patients weighting 100 kg or less, and 90 mg for
      patients weighting more than 100 kg) or placebo.

      Patients randomized to ustekinumab (10 with PPPP and 10 with PPP) will receive ustekinumab at
      Day 0, Weeks 4 and 16 and placebo at Week 20 whereas patients randomized to placebo (10 with
      PPPP and 10 with PPP) will receive placebo at Weeks 0 and 4 and ustekinumab at Weeks 16 and
      20.

      Patients will be seen at screening, Day 0, Weeks 4, 8, 16, 20, 24 and 28. The PPPASI
      (Palmo-Plantar Pustular Area and Severity Index), PPPGA (Palmo-Plantar Physician Global
      Assessment), PPSA (Palmo-Plantar Surface Area) will be used to evaluate severity and DLQI
      (Dermatology Life Quality Index), WPAI:PSO (Work Productivity and Activity Impairement
      Questionnaire:Psoriasis) and PPQoLI (Palmo-Plantar Quality of Life Index)will be used to
      evaluate quality of life. Safety will be assessed by physical examinations, evaluation of
      adverse events and laboratory analyses.

      High quality digital medical photographs of palms and soles will be taken at Day 0, Weeks 4,
      16 and 28. In addition, one optional skin biopsy from a palm or a sole will be performed at
      Day 0 and Week 16 and pus will be collected from pustules on palms and/or soles at Day 0 and
      Week 16. Finally, blood will be collected at Day 0 for genetic analysis from every patient
      who consents to DNA blood sampling.
