    <description>Measurement of subject's palmar and plantar psoriasis severity as measured by the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) scale, which rates the severity of psoriasis using the measures of erythema, scaling and induration. Scores are from 0 to 4, in 1 unit increments. A score of 4 is very severe, and a score of 0 is clear.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults between 18 and 85 years of age with palmar plantar psoriasis with well defined
             psoriatic plaques on the palms and/or soles with a Physician Global Assessment (PGA)
             of 3 or higher who are unresponsive to topical management. Pustules, fissures and
             psoriatic arthritis may be present but are not required.

          2. Adults in general good health as determined by the Investigator based upon the results
             of medical history, laboratory profile, and physical examination.

          3. Females of reproductive potential are eligible to participate in the study if they
             have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening and baseline and who are using 2
             forms of effective birth control.

          4. Palmar/Plantar PGA of 3 or more

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Psoriasis patients without palm and/or sole psoriasis or a palmar/plantar PGA score of
             less than 3

          2. Patients younger than 18 and older than 85 years old.

          3. Evidence of skin conditions at the time of the screening visit (e.g. eczema) other
             than psoriasis that would interfere with evaluations of the effect of study medication
             on psoriasis

          4. Receipt of any investigational drugs within 4 weeks of study drug initiation

          5. Psoralens + UltraViolet A (PUVA) or oral systemic treatments within 4 weeks of study
             drug initiation.

          6. Biologics within 3 months of study initiation

          7. Ultraviolet B (UVB) therapy or topical steroids within 2 weeks of study drug
             initiation

          8. A prior history of tuberculosis, and/or a positive Purified Protein Derivative (PPD)
             skin test/Chest X-Ray (CXR) at screening without appropriate treatment. Treatment of
             latent Tuberculosis (TB) infections (for those with positive PPD tests) must be
             initiated prior to therapy.

          9. Receipt of live vaccines 1 month prior to or while in study

         10. Chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection

         11. History of alcohol or drug abuse one year before and during the study.

         12. Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-positive status or any other
             immune-suppressing disease.

         13. Any grade 3 or 4 adverse event, or laboratory toxicity, at the time of the screening
             visit or at any time during the study

         14. Presence of a grade 3 or 4 infection &lt;30 days prior to the screening visit, between
             the screening visit and the first day of treatment on study, or any time during the
             study that in the opinion of the Investigator would preclude participation in the
             study.

         15. Any internal malignancy within 5 years (fully excised cutaneous, basal cell carcinoma
             or squamous cell carcinoma are exceptions)
