             respectively, or not on ERT.

          6. A body weight of at least 50 kg and a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 35 kg/m2,
             inclusive [BMI will be calculated as weight in kg/(height in m)2]

          7. Medically healthy, with clinically insignificant screening results (e.g., laboratory
             profiles, medical histories, ECGs, physical examination (including breast
             examination), in the opinion of the Investigator.

          8. Subjects are able to communicate with the Investigator, and to understand and to
             comply with all requirements of study participation.

          9. An adequate washout period prior to obtaining any baseline assessments in women who
             have been previously treated for postmenopausal symptoms. Calculated from study Day 1,
             the minimum washout period will be 2 and 4 weeks for prior treatment with testosterone
             oral and transdermal products, respectively, 3 months for prior treatment with
             testosterone implants and 2 weeks for treatment with estratest.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A positive serum pregnancy test at screening

          2. A history or presence of significant cardiovascular, neurological, hematological,
             psychiatric, hepatic, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, endocrine, immunologic or renal
             disease or other condition known to interfere with the transdermal absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs or place the subjects at increased
             risk as determined by the Investigator

          3. Any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities as judged by the Investigator

          4. Subjects are experiencing &gt; 20 hot flushes per week

          5. Subjects are suffering from severe acne, moderate to severe hirsutism or androgenic
             alopecia, or have a history of severe dermatological problems or drug-induced contact
             dermatitis

             screening or prior to the first dosing in this study (two rechecks are allowed)

          7. Any malignancy except basal cell carcinoma

          8. A significant psychiatric disorder (e.g., major depression, etc.) that might, in the
             Investigator's opinion, prevent the subject from completing the study

          9. Currently smoke more than 10 cigarettes a day

         10. A history of breast biopsy with atypical hyperplasia

         11. A prior history of breast cancer, suspected breast cancer, or other current or prior

             lower limit of normal reference range

         13. Diabetes mellitus

         14. Any chronic skin disorder (e.g., eczema, psoriasis) likely to interfere with
             transdermal drug absorption or assessments of skin tolerability

         15. Positive urine drug test and/or positive breath alcohol test at screening or prior to
             the first dosing in this study (Period 1 only)

             first dosing in this study

         21. Blood donation or significant blood loss within 56 days prior to the first dosing in
             this study. Any contraindication to blood sampling
