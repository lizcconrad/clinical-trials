  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (feNO) in expired air is a reliable measure of airway
      inflammation. Some research experiments have demonstrated stimulation of nitric oxide
      production in respiratory epithelial cells infected with RSV.

      The principal aims are to determine if the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (feNO) is
      elevated in hospitalized pediatric patients with viral lower respiratory illness and to
      determine if there is a difference in feNO level between RSV and non-RSV infection.

      NO may play a role in the association between RSV, airway reactivity, and airway
      inflammation.

      This is a prospective, pilot study that will noninvasively measure feNO in children 0-4 years
      of age admitted to Winthrop University Hospital, as well as controls (children in the same
      age range without respiratory conditions and who are well enough to perform the test).
      Hospitalized children will be tested for RSV (enzyme immunoassay (EIA) &amp; DFA) and via direct
      fluorescent antigen technique (DFA) for influenza A &amp; B, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus
      and adenovirus.

      Method of feNO measurement will utilize the offline options for preschool children &amp; infants
      appropriate for age as described in the 2005 Joint Statement of the American Thoracic Society
      &amp; the European Respiratory Society when discussing tidal breathing techniques with
      uncontrolled flow rate Offline exhaled air can be collected via a mouthpiece or a face mask
      connected to a non-re-breathing valve that allows inspiration of NO-free air from an NO-inert
      reservoir to avoid contamination by ambient NO. Exhaled breath samples are collected into an
      NO-inert bag fitted with the expiratory port once a stable breathing pattern is present.

      The results of all 3 groups will be compared: control, RSV positive and RSV negative samples.
