      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of calcitriol when given with
      cisplatin and gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with advanced solid tumors that
      cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Calcitriol may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking blood flow to the tumor. Calcitriol may also help cisplatin and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride kill more tumor cells by making them more sensitive to the drug.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral calcitriol when combined with a standard
      dose of gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) and cisplatin in a 28-day cycle.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the toxicity of this combination using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
      Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

      II. Study the pharmacokinetics of calcitriol at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in an
      expanded cohort of 6 patients.

      III. Describe the clinical activity associated with this regimen in this advanced solid tumor
      population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive calcitriol orally (PO) on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16; cisplatin
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 2; and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on
      days 2, 9, and 16. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
