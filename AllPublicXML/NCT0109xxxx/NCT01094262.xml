    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate pain relief, safety, and tolerability of a new
      treatment (JNJ-42160443) for moderate to severe pain of osteoarthritis of the knee in
      comparison to a standard pain treatment and placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither the physician nor the patient knows the name of the assigned
      drug) study evaluating pain relief, safety, and tolerability of a new treatment
      (JNJ-42160443) for moderate to severe pain of osteoarthritis of the knee in comparison to a
      standard pain treatment and placebo. The study will last for about 42 weeks. Patients will
      receive treatment for 16 weeks. Patients who qualify for the study based on their level of
      pain as well as other factors will receive one of the 4 possible treatments as determined by
      chance. Before entering the study, patients must stop using their present pain medication.
      During the study, patients will answer questions about their pain, side effects, and have
      tests performed to monitor their physical condition. The main purpose of the study is to
      compare pain relief with JNJ-42160443 to that of a standard pain treatment or placebo. After
      the treatment period, patients can return to taking the pain medication that they used before
      the start of the study, and their physical condition will continue to be monitored. JNJ
      42160443 10 mg/mL will be provided for use in the study. Patients will receive 1 of 4
      treatments for 16 weeks (wks): lower dosage of JNJ 42160443 by subcutaneous (under the skin)
      (SC) injection once every 4 wks + Placebo (P) capsule orally (by mouth) (PO) 2x/day, higher
      dosage of JNJ 42160443 by SC injection once every 4 wks + P capsule PO 2x/day, standard pain
      medication capsule PO 2x/day + P by SC injection once every 4 wks, or P capsule PO 2x/day + P
      by SC injection once every 4 wks.
