  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (drug assigned by chance), double-blind (a medical research study in
      which neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is
      receiving), placebo-controlled, parallel (a medical research study comparing the response in
      two or more groups of participants receiving different treatments), multicenter of
      ustekinumab in adolescent participants with moderate to severe psoriasis. The total duration
      of study will be 60 weeks. The study will consists of 2 parts; a Screening period and a
      Treatment period. In treatment period participants will receive either ustekinumab half
      standard dosage, ustekinumab standard dosage or Placebo. Participants receiving ustekinumab
      half standard dosage and ustekinumab standard dosage at Week 0, will receive placebo at Week
      12 and participants receiving placebo at Week 0 will be randomly assigned to either
      ustekinumab half standard dosage or ustekinumab standard dosage Weeks 12, 16, 28, and 40.
      Primarily efficacy will be evaluated by physician's global assessment (PGA) score of cleared
      or minimal disease. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>The Percentage of Participants Achieving a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) Score of Cleared (0) or Minimal (1) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA documents the physician's assessment of the participant's psoriasis status according to the following categories: induration, scaling, and erythema. The participant's psoriasis is assessed as 5-point scale as follows: cleared (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), or severe (4); higher score indicates worse disease. The table below shows the percentage of participants who achieved a PGA score of 0 or 1 at Week 12 in each treatment group.</description>

    <measure>The Percentage of Participants Achieving a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 Response at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating worse disease. A PASI 75 response is defined as a equal to or greater than (=&gt;) 75% improvement in PASI score from baseline. The table below shows the percentage of participants who achieved a PASI 75 response at Week 12 in each treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) Score at Week 12 Compared Between the Placebo Group and the Ustekinumab Treatment Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CDLQI is a dermatology-specific quality of life instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on a child's quality of life. The CDLQI, a 10-item questionnaire has 4 items response options and a recall period of 1 week. In addition to evaluating overall quality of life, the CDLQI can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect quality of life: symptoms and feelings, leisure, School or holidays, personal relationships, sleep, and treatment. The CDLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0; the higher the score, the greater impairment in quality of life. The table below shows the mean change in CDLQI score from baseline at Week 12 for each treatment group.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating worse disease. The table below shows the percentage of participants who achieved a PASI 90 response defined as achieving a greater than or equal to (≥) 90% improvement in PASI score from baseline.</description>

    <measure>The Percentage of Participants Who Were PASI 50 Responders and the Percentage of Participants With a PASI Score of 0 at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). The table below shows the percentage of participants in each treatment group who were PASI 50 responders at Week 12 defined as participants who achieved a greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 50% improvement in PASI score from baseline as well as the percentage of participants with a PASI score of 0.</description>

    <measure>The Change From Baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Total Scale Score, Psychosocial Health Summary Score, and Physical Health Summary Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL is a general health-related quality of life measure developed for use in children and adolescent populations. The Generic Core Scale contains 23 items and is comprised of 4 domains: physical, social, emotional, and school functioning. Each domain can be scored independently. Additionally, a Psychosocial Health and Physical Health Summary Score can be calculated as well as a total score. The measure distinguishes between healthy children and children with acute and chronic health conditions and disease severity within a chronic health condition. The measure is applicable for healthy school and community populations, as well as with pediatric populations with acute and chronic health conditions and has versions for both parent and teen report. Scores range from 0 to 100, and higher scores indicate better health related quality of life.</description>

        <title>The Percentage of Participants Achieving a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) Score of Cleared (0) or Minimal (1) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The PGA documents the physician’s assessment of the participant’s psoriasis status according to the following categories: induration, scaling, and erythema. The participant's psoriasis is assessed as 5-point scale as follows: cleared (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), or severe (4); higher score indicates worse disease. The table below shows the percentage of participants who achieved a PGA score of 0 or 1 at Week 12 in each treatment group.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) Score at Week 12 Compared Between the Placebo Group and the Ustekinumab Treatment Groups</title>
        <description>The CDLQI is a dermatology-specific quality of life instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on a child’s quality of life. The CDLQI, a 10-item questionnaire has 4 items response options and a recall period of 1 week. In addition to evaluating overall quality of life, the CDLQI can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect quality of life: symptoms and feelings, leisure, School or holidays, personal relationships, sleep, and treatment. The CDLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0; the higher the score, the greater impairment in quality of life. The table below shows the mean change in CDLQI score from baseline at Week 12 for each treatment group.</description>

        <title>The Percentage of Participants Achieving a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) Score of Cleared (0) and PGA Score of Mild or Better (&lt;=2) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The PGA documents the physician’s assessment of the participant’s psoriasis status according to the following categories: induration, scaling, and erythema. The participant's psoriasis is assessed as 5-point scale as follows: cleared (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), or severe (4); higher score indicates worse disease. The table below shows the percentage of participants who achieved a PGA score of 0 and the percentage of participants who achieved a PGA score of 0, 1, or 2 at Week 12 in each treatment group.</description>

        <title>The Change From Baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Total Scale Score, Psychosocial Health Summary Score, and Physical Health Summary Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The PedsQL is a general health-related quality of life measure developed for use in children and adolescent populations. The Generic Core Scale contains 23 items and is comprised of 4 domains: physical, social, emotional, and school functioning. Each domain can be scored independently. Additionally, a Psychosocial Health and Physical Health Summary Score can be calculated as well as a total score. The measure distinguishes between healthy children and children with acute and chronic health conditions and disease severity within a chronic health condition. The measure is applicable for healthy school and community populations, as well as with pediatric populations with acute and chronic health conditions and has versions for both parent and teen report. Scores range from 0 to 100, and higher scores indicate better health related quality of life.</description>

          <title>The Change From Baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Total Scale Score, Psychosocial Health Summary Score, and Physical Health Summary Score at Week 12</title>
          <description>The PedsQL is a general health-related quality of life measure developed for use in children and adolescent populations. The Generic Core Scale contains 23 items and is comprised of 4 domains: physical, social, emotional, and school functioning. Each domain can be scored independently. Additionally, a Psychosocial Health and Physical Health Summary Score can be calculated as well as a total score. The measure distinguishes between healthy children and children with acute and chronic health conditions and disease severity within a chronic health condition. The measure is applicable for healthy school and community populations, as well as with pediatric populations with acute and chronic health conditions and has versions for both parent and teen report. Scores range from 0 to 100, and higher scores indicate better health related quality of life.</description>
