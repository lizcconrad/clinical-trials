  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nicotine dependence is very common among Asian Americans; yet, research on understanding and
      treating nicotine dependence in this group is almost nonexistent. The proposed study is a
      first attempt to develop a smoking cessation program that is tailored to Korean-culture
      specific aspects. It is proposed that Korean Americans who receive a culturally tailored
      smoking cessation program will be more likely to have prolonged abstinence at 12-month
      follow-up than their counterparts who receive brief cessation counseling. Subjects in both
      arms receive nicotine patches for 8 weeks. Self-reported abstinence is validated with exhaled
      carbon monoxide and salivary cotinine tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Korean men have been known for very high smoking rates and the highest cancer death
      smoking-attributable fraction. In contrast, Korean women reportedly smoke at low rates
      compared to the general U.S. population. However, recent population-based survey data
      indicate steady increases in smoking prevalence of Korean American women. Particularly, it
      has been found that they tend to initiate smoking as they acculturate into social norms of
      American women. Preliminary data of the applicant and others suggests interventions must be
      culturally adapted and a motivation-based and family-involved approach is most promising. The
      training plan will help the applicant develop an independent program of drug abuse research
      that focuses on better understanding and treating tobacco dependence among Asian Americans,
      including evaluating culturally competent and gender-specific interventions. The research
      plan will examine the impact of culture and gender on nicotine dependence and utilize
      National Institute on Drug Abuse behavioral therapy development methods. The proposed
      research plan has two-phases and evaluates tobacco dependence treatment with Korean Americans
      (N = 164, 50% women). Phase 1 is a no-control group study (Stage Ia) that is aimed at
      developing an intervention manual of Group-based Motivational Interviewing (GMI)
      intervention, therapists' adherence and competence scales, training program, and small
      feasibility intervention study with 20 Korean-American (offered separately for men and
      women). Phase 2 is a randomized controlled trial (Stage Ib) with 144 Korean Americans that is
      conducted to assess feasibility and relative effectiveness of the GMI behavioral intervention
      in conjunction with Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) in comparison with a brief group
      medication management of NRT. Gender-interaction effects of psychosocial variables on
      treatment outcomes will be assessed, including acculturation and depression. This award will
      help prepare the applicant for an independent research career focusing on Asian Americans and
      Nicotine Dependence, including adapting and testing new interventions for different
      populations.

    <description>Of the 109 participants, 77 were due for the 1-year follow-up assessment that is the endpoint of this study. Those who were not available were treated as smoking. Using an intent-to-treat analysis, 35.9% of participants in the cultural intervention arm and 13.2% of participants in the brief counseling arm (odds ratio = 3.7, 95% confidence interval = 1.2-11.6, p = 0.03) had 12-month prolonged abstinence.</description>

    <time_frame>09/2009-05/2013</time_frame>
    <description>Controlling for self-efficacy and treatment condition, baseline nicotine dependence was also a strong predictor of the 12-month prolonged abstinence (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2-2.5, p = 0.004). However, unlike our expectation, individuals with higher dependence were more likely to have the abstinence than their counterparts. This finding remained significant even after controlling for gender. The overall survival of subjects who had prolonged abstinence was significantly higher in the treatment arm than in the control arm (log rank test, p = 0.003). Combining Stage I-a and I-b Studies, women were more likely to be single or divorced (χ2 =17.6, p &lt; 0.00l) and smoke at home (χ2 =6.0, p = 0.02), and live with other smokers (χ2 =14.1, p = 0.00l) than men. Women reported more severe symptoms of nicotine withdrawal (t = 2.46, p = 0.03) after quitting than did men.</description>

    <description>The primary outcome of the study, prolonged abstinence, was biochemically verified prolonged abstinence at 12-month follow-up. The CO level was measured by Micro+ Smokelyzer CO Monitor (Bedfont Scientific, NJ) and its cutoff level is 6 parts per million (ppm). The salivary cotinine level was assessed by a NicAlert® test, using adopted a cutoff level 2 (30-100ng/ml).</description>
