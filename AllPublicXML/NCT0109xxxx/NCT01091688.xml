  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We, the investigators, will provide &quot;Just-in-Time&quot; information, physician educational
      material, to primary care pediatricians of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) graduates at
      the time of NICU discharge. We will follow the rate of adverse events (deaths,
      re-hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and missed appointments) for 6 months after NICU
      discharge. We will assess levels of physician comfort in caring for NICU specific diseases,
      as well as physician satisfaction with the discharge process. We hypothesize that the
      provision of &quot;Just-in-Time&quot; information will decrease the rate of adverse events, and make
      physicians more comfortable in caring for complicated NICU graduates, and more satisfied with
      the discharge process.

      The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate the impact of providing &quot;Just-in-Time&quot;
      information, or physician educational material at the time of discharge, to primary care
      pediatricians caring for Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) graduates. The material provided
      will be tailored to the needs of each infant. The educational material will be sent to the
      physicians via email and facsimile on the day of discharge, and a hard copy will be sent with
      the parents to bring to their first clinic appointment. Outcomes, including emergency room
      visits, hospital readmissions, deaths, missed appointments, and improvements in care in the
      areas of intervention will be assessed. Levels of physician comfort in caring for various
      disorders specific to NICU graduates will be assessed, and satisfaction with the discharge
      process will also be evaluated pre- and post- intervention.
