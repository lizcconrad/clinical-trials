  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Membranous Nephropathy (MN) is an immune-mediated kidney disease that affects the glomerulus
      or the filter that removes toxins from the blood. Damage to the membrane that separates blood
      from urine results in loss of protein into the urine (proteinuria) and in some cases loss of
      kidney function.There is no standard specific treatment for MN.

      ACTH has a pronounced lipid-lowering effect in healthy individuals, in steroid-treated
      patients with renal disease and in hemodialysis patients Some studies suggest that prolonged
      synthetic ACTH therapy may represent an effective therapy in patients with idiopathic MN,
      more extensive randomized studies with longer follow-up are needed before therapeutic
      recommendations can be made.

      We propose to do a pilot study to test the hypothesis that biologic ACTH, a slow-release
      formulation of corticotropin extracted from porcine pituitary glands (H.P. Acthar gel) will
      be effective in reducing proteinuria and improving lipid profile in patients with idiopathic
      MN.

        Inclusion Criteria:• Idiopathic MN with diagnostic biopsy performed less than 36 months
        from the time of dose randomization.

          -  Patients need to be treated with an ACEI and/or ARB, for at least 3 months prior to
             ACTH treatment and have adequately controlled blood pressure (BP &lt;130/75 mm Hg in &gt;75%
             of the readings). Patients with documented evidence of &gt;3 months treatment with
             maximal Ang II blockade, target BP (BP &lt;130/75 mm Hg in &gt;75% of the readings) and who
             remain with proteinuria &gt;4.0g/24h may enter the ACTH phase of the study without the
             need to have the run-in/conservative phase of the study.

          -  Proteinuria as measured by Uprot/Ucr &gt; 4.0 on a spot sample aliquot from a 24-hour
             urine collection. The choice of Uprot/UCr is in accord with recent NKF-CKD
             guidelines.[9]

          -  Estimated GFR ≥ 40 ml/min/1.73m2 while taking ACEI/ARB therapy. The GFR will be
             estimated using the 4 variable MDRD equation as published in the NKF-CKD
             guidelines.[9] The same NKF-CKD guidelines also promote the use of estimated GFR
             (GFRest) values rather than serum creatinine levels or CrCl measurements as the
             preferred non-invasive method of determining glomerular filtration rates.[9]

        Exclusion Criteria:• Age &lt;18 years.

          -  Estimated GFR &lt; 40 ml/min/1.73m2, or serum creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dl.

          -  Renal biopsy showing more than 30% glomerulosclerosis and/or tubular atrophy.

          -  Patient must be off glucocorticoid, calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporin A, tacrolimus)
             or mycophenolic mofetil for &gt; 1 month, and alkylating agents or rituximab for &gt;6
             months.

          -  Resistance to the following immunosuppressive routines e.g. steroids alone,
             calcineurin inhibitors plus or minus steroids, cytotoxic agents plus or minus
             steroids.

          -  Patients with active infections or secondary causes of MN (e.g. hepatitis B, SLE,
             medications, malignancies). Testing for HIV, Hepatitis B and C should have occurred &lt;
             2 years prior to enrollment into the study.

          -  Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus: to exclude proteinuria secondary to diabetic
             nephropathy. Patients who have recent history of steroid induced diabetes but no
             evidence on renal biopsy performed within 6 months of entry into the study are
             eligible for enrollment.

          -  Pregnancy or nursing - for safety reasons.

          -  Acute renal vein thrombosis documented prior to entry by renal US or CT scan and
             requiring anticoagulation therapy.
