    <description>Airway mucus secretion was collected for three hours before and ten hours after treatment based on an auditory airway secretion sound and collected again at 02.00-07.00 am.The mucus secretion was collected by sterile suctioning technique via tracheostomy tube without adding any saline or sterile water.</description>

    <measure>viscosity of secretion</measure>
    <time_frame>Three hours before and after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The secretion were collected in three hours before and after treatment, It were measured viscosity by First The mucus was gently homogenized by tissue grinder 5 ml (Cw11-205, Cowie, UK) for six minute at 37 degree celsius Second using Micro-Oswald viscometers with a capillary diameter of 0.77 mm for viscosity measure at same temperature in each sample(before and after).</description>
