  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic prolapse is one of the most frequent pathology in Gynecology. Recurrency of the
      prolapse after primary surgery is relatively high, 15-30%. Sacrocolpopexy has showed to be
      effective but it requires a long learning curves and is more aggressive. New meshes
      techniques seem to be effective, as well, with less learning curve but they are expensive and
      there are no randomize studies published.

      The investigators aim is to compare both techniques in terms of: anatomical and functional
      efficacy, cost, operating time and complications.
