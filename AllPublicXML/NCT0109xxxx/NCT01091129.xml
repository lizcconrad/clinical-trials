        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is 18 years of age or older at the time of consent.

          -  Subject reports a quality-of-life rating of 3 or 4 on the Hyperhidrosis Disease
             Severity Scale.

          -  Subject has a baseline gravimetric measurement of spontaneous resting sweat production
             of at least 50mg/5min at room temperature in each axilla.

          -  Subject has primary focal axillary hyperhidrosis evidenced by at least two of the
             following:

               -  Bilateral and relatively symmetric

               -  Impairs daily activities

               -  Frequency of at least one episode per week

               -  Age of onset less than 25 years old

               -  Positive family history

               -  Cessation of focal sweating during sleep.

          -  In the opinion of the physician, treatment with the miraDry System is technically
             feasible and clinically indicated.

          -  Subject has provided written informed consent using a form that has been approved by
             the reviewing IRB/ethics committee.

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with protocol requirements and all study visits.

          -  Female subjects of child-bearing potential must not be pregnant or lactating and must
             agree to not become pregnant during the course of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has secondary hyperhidrosis due to medications, infections, malignancy or
             endocrinopathy.

          -  Subject has hyperhidrosis on the trunk or chest.

          -  Subject has evidence of active infection.

          -  Prior endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy, liposuction or other surgery for axillary
             hyperhidrosis.

          -  Axillary injection of botulinum toxin within one year preceding the miraDry treatment.

          -  Oral anticholinergic medication use (e.g., Robinul) or cholomimetic medication use
             within the last 4 weeks or planned use during the study's follow up phase.

          -  Subject is a prisoner or under incarceration.

          -  Currently participating in or recently participated in another clinical trial (within
             the last 30 days).

          -  History of or current neurologic deficit in the treatment limb.

          -  Known resistance to or history of difficulty with local anesthesia (lidocaine with
             epinephrine).

          -  History of cancer with the exception of (1) successfully treated basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or (2) subjects with a history of successfully
             treated cancer that have been disease-free for five years.

          -  Injury in the treatment area, shoulder or limb, which, in the opinion of the physician
             would render this subject an unacceptable candidate for DTS treatment (e.g., prior
             surgical repair, injury of the shoulder requiring physical therapy).

          -  Subject has a pacemaker, defibrillator or other electronic implant

          -  Subject requires supplemental oxygen.
