  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ixabepilone and capecitabine combination has demonstrated to be an active regimen in patients
      with metastatic breast cancer after failing other treatments. Cetuximab is active against
      tumors expressing epidermal growth factor receptor w/demonstrated activity in head &amp; neck and
      colorectal tumors and may be effective in some breast cancers known to express EGFR. Study
      seeks to evaluate Ixabepilone alone or in combination with cetuximab as a an antitumor
      therapy w/randomization stratified by stage (T1N1-3M0 or T2-4 N0-3M0).

      Ixabepilone and capecitabine combination has demonstrated to be an active regimen in patients
      with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) after failing an anthracycline and a taxane regimen.
      Cetuximab is active in tumors that express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with
      demonstrated activity in head and neck and colorectal tumors. A proportion of breast cancers
      are known to express EGFR. Cetuximab's mechanism of action suggests the possibility of
      efficacy in breast cancer patients, and several studies show that it may be efficacious in
      Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). This study seeks to evaluate Ixabepilone alone or in
      combination with cetuximab as a possible way to increase antitumor activity. In this
      randomized open-label phase II trial, patients will be randomized equally between 1)
      Ixabepilone or 2) Ixabepilone plus Cetuximab. Randomization will be stratified by disease
      stage (T1N1-3M0 or T2-4 N0-3M0).

      The study's primary objective is to determine the pathologic complete response rate (pCR)
      (breast and axilla) of Ixabepilone versus Ixabepilone when combined with cetuximab in
      patients with invasive breast adenocarcinoma T1N1-N3M0 or T2-4 N0-3M0 disease who are triple
      negative and who are candidates for preoperative chemotherapy. The secondary objectives are
      to evaluate overall objective response rate in both treatment groups and to assess safety and
      toxicity of each regimen. There are also tertiary, exploratory objectives that will hopefully
      allow for the correlation of biomarker expression and response to treatment.

    <description>Baseline signs and symptoms will be recorded and followed throughout the trial. Toxicity assessments will be continuous during treatment and the year of follow-up, after which all study drug-related toxicities will be deemed resolved, stabilized, or irreversible. CTCAE v.3.0 will be used to grade toxicities. Vital signs will be performed at baseline and will be monitored pre-dose and during study drug administration for Cycles 1 - 4. Chemistry and hematology laboratory tests will be done at baseline and prior to each subsequent chemotherapy cycle.</description>
