  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) at the age around 40 years belong to the first
      patients generation with early treatment of the disease. PKU is caused by an inborn error of
      the amino acid metabolism and the so far best suitable therapy is an early and strict diet,
      which is low in phenylalanine.

      Besides an early and continuously treatment in childhood, the nutritional and medical support
      during adolescence and adulthood have been suggested to influence the long-term physical
      health of adult PKU patients. As many adult PKU patients tend to neglect the necessarily
      strict diet, they do not get a balanced diet. For PKU patients some nutrients, which may be
      rare in an unbalanced diet, might help to improve health status, physical and neurological
      performance and quality of life.

      Information about the longitudinal development of the patients status and the influence of
      the type of their medical care is not available. In this 5 year follow-up the investigators
      aim to study the quality of life and the medical, nutritional and psychological status of
      adult PKU patients, in whom corresponding information has already been collected previously.

        Adult PKU patients who are or have been attending the Departements of Metabolic Diseases of
        the Klinikum der Universität München will be recruited for this study, if they had been
        participating already in the last study trial comparing adult PKU patients with healthy
        controls.

        It will be attempted to include the same control persons as in the last study trial.
