  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a patient undergoes heart surgery, their Anesthesiologist will insert a tiny plastic
      tube, called a catheter, in the artery of the patient's wrist. This is called a radial artery
      catheter. A radial artery catheter allows accurate measurement of the patient's blood
      pressure during surgery. There are two common techniques for placing the radial artery
      catheter. The first is a &quot;blind&quot; technique whereby the Anesthesiologist feels for the pulse
      in the patient's wrist and places the catheter using the location of the pulse as a guide.
      The second technique, less commonly used, is one whereby the Anesthesiologist uses an
      ultrasound machine (painless to the patient) to &quot;see&quot; the artery, and thereby uses the
      ultrasound to guide the catheter placement. Our study will test the hypothesis that
      ultrasound-guided radial artery catheterization will have faster insertion times, with fewer
      complications compared with palpation-guided insertion.

    <time_frame>up to 5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The time to successful radial arterial catheterization was defined as time zero to time of placement. Time zero for the DP group began when the anesthesiologist's fingers were placed on the patient with the purpose of palpating the artery. Time zero for the US group began when the US transducer was first placed on the patient's skin for the purpose of identifying the radial artery. Time to placement was defined as the interval from time zero until the time at which an arterial tracing was viewed on the monitor.</description>

At the discretion on the Anesthesiologist, an out-of-plane (i.e. needle plane at right angles to ultrasound plane) will be used. Colour flow doppler may also be used to identify the artery if necessary.</description>

          <description>American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status is a system for assessing fitness for surgery. Class IV refers to patients who have severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life. Status I refers to a healthy patient. Status II refers to patients with mild systemic disease. Status III refers to patients who have severe systemic disease. Thus ASA class IV patients are associated with higher morbidity and mortality compared to ASA 1 patients.</description>

            <description>Radial artery catheter insertion was conducted by ultrasound guidance. A Sono-site ilook 25 Ultrasound (Sono-site, Inc., Bothell, WA, USA) with a 10-5 MHz linear array ultrasound transducer was used.
At the discretion on the Anesthesiologist, an out-of-plane (i.e. needle plane at right angles to ultrasound plane) was used. Colour flow doppler may have also been used to identify the artery if necessary.

          <title>Time to Successful Radial Arterial Catheterization</title>
          <description>The time to successful radial arterial catheterization was defined as time zero to time of placement. Time zero for the DP group began when the anesthesiologist’s fingers were placed on the patient with the purpose of palpating the artery. Time zero for the US group began when the US transducer was first placed on the patient’s skin for the purpose of identifying the radial artery. Time to placement was defined as the interval from time zero until the time at which an arterial tracing was viewed on the monitor.</description>
