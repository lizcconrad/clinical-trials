    <textblock>
      The hypotheses to be tested are: Efficacy: Ibuprofen will be more effective than the Placebo
      in relieving muscle pain/soreness over 48 hour post-dosing with study medication. Safety:
      There will be no or minimal increased incidence of adverse events (AEs) with Ibuprofen versus
      and both will be well tolerated.
