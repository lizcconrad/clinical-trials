  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early stage hormone receptor positive breast cancer is typically treated with adjuvant
      endocrine therapy in order to decrease risk of breast cancer recurrence and to improve
      overall survival from the disease. Typical agents used for treatment include tamoxifen and
      the aromatase inhibitors. In postmenopausal women, aromatase inhibitor therapy is
      increasingly common because it is associated with fewer long-term serious toxicities compared
      to tamoxifen. However, aromatase inhibitors cause arthralgias in 40-50% of patients, which
      can influence adherence to therapy and can lead to treatment discontinuation in a minority of
      cases. The mechanism underlying development of this toxicity remains unclear, and predictors
      of who will develop these symptoms remain undefined. This observational study is designed to
      collect patient-reported outcomes and serial serum samples in order to investigate potential
      etiologies of this bothersome toxicity.
