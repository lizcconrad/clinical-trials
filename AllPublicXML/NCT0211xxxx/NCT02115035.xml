      The objective is to evaluate the overall response rate of Vermurafenib when administered
      orally to patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

      This is an open-label study to evaluate the objective response rates of orally administered
      Vermurafenib for patients with double refractory multiple myeloma. Double refractory multiple
      myeloma is myeloma that has become refractory to two chemotherapeutic agents such as
      bortexomib and lenalidomide. The study will be conducted in two stages with an interim data
      analysis performed after enrollment of the initial 21 subjects to determine whether the study
      will enroll an additional 20 subjects.
