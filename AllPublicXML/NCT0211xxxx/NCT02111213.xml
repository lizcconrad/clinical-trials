  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a computer-based
      'virtual lay advisor' intervention relative to a proven human lay advisor/promotore
      intervention to promote regular walking among inactive midlife and older Latino adults. The
      primary analysis is a non-inferiority analysis comparing these two interventions.

    <description>Participants will receive periodic, comprehensive health assessments and periodic informational sessions about heart-healthy nutrition (i.e., reducing saturated and trans fats, increasing vegetables and fruit, increasing whole grains). These informational sessions will be in a small group format and will control for the time and attention that the experimental arms will receive.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Spanish or English-speaking primarily Latino men or women

          -  Aged greater than or equal to 50 years

          -  No plans to move within the next year

          -  Inactive (have not engaged in moderate-intensity or more vigorous physical activity

          -  &gt; 3 days per week for at least 20 min per day) within last 6 months

          -  Able to participate in study intervention and assessments at their local neighborhood
             senior center

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any medical condition or disorder that would limit participation in moderate intensity
             physical activity (such as sustained walking), including life-threatening disorders,
             myocardial ischemia, major functional disabilities in the orthopedic area, or
             inability to complete baseline assessments for any reason (including psychological,
             cognitive);

          2. Not stable on their medications, including hormone replacement therapy, for â‰¥ 3 months
             (given that changes in medications can create additional stress and burden over and
             above attempts to change lifestyle behaviors);

          3. Inability to complete a face-to-face training session with a computer-based program
