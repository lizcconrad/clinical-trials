  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Essential tremor is the most common adult-onset movement disorder, and essential voice tremor
      is the vocal manifestation of essential tremor. While nearly all essential tremor patients
      experience hand tremor, many also manifest head tremor and voice tremor. Essential voice
      tremor can lead to increased vocal effort, decreased intelligibility, and misconstrued
      emotional state. Only one medication, propranolol, is FDA-approved to treat essential tremor.
      Propranolol is not felt to be nearly as effective for axial tremors (head, trunk, neck) as it
      is for extremity tremors. However, this has not been studied with any objective assessment in
      a prospective way for EVT. For patients with essential voice tremor, the limited published
      data suggests that botulinum toxin has been shown to lead to functional voice improvement.
      Botulinum toxin, though also not well-studied with objective voice outcomes, is a commonly
      used clinical therapy for treatment of essential voice tremor. While it is used more often
      for essential voice tremor than propranolol therapy, botulinum toxin also has not been
      prospectively studied with validated, objective voice outcome measures. The investigators
      would like to determine if propranolol has any significant effect on vocal tremor. The
      investigators would also like to determine, in an objective way, the effect of botulinum
      toxin on vocal tremor. If effective, propranolol would provide an affordable and non-invasive
      alternative or addition to botulinum toxin injections for patients with essential voice
      tremor.

      Specific Aims

      • Determine the effect of propranolol on vocal tremor in the treatment-seeking population.

      To date, the nonselective beta-blocker propranolol remains the only agent approved for the
      treatment of essential tremor (ET). For ET, immediate and sustained release formations of
      propranolol are equally effective, while other beta-blockers like nadolol and timolol are not
      as effective. While propranolol improves tremor in greater than half of patients with
      essential tremor, its effects on tremor are not evenly distributed. Improvement in tremor
      symptoms is greater for limb tremor than axial tremor, and therefore propranolol is not
      commonly used for the treatment of essential voice tremor (EVT). However, its effect on
      essential voice tremor has never been objectively, prospectively studied. Our aim is to
      objectively determine the effect of propranolol on essential voice tremor in the
      treatment-seeking population by evaluating patients with EVT before and after propranolol
      therapy.

      • Determine the effect of botulinum toxin injections on vocal tremor in the treatment-seeking
      population.

      More recently, botulinum toxin A has been used for the treatment of EVT. Chemical denervation
      with botulinum toxin is only modestly effective in reducing limb tremor in ET and complicated
      by side effects of weakness. However, botulinum toxin seems to be more effective in treating
      EVT than other manifestations of ET. While prior studies have not enlisted validated
      assessments of voice quality to measure the effect of botulinum toxin injections on EVT, they
      have shown subjective improvement in acoustic measures of tremor and ratings of videotaped
      speech after therapy with botulinum toxin. Our aim is to objectively determine the effect of
      botulinum toxin on vocal tremor in the treatment-seeking population by evaluating patients
      with EVT before and after botulinum therapy.

      Voice Evaluations and Medications

      For the first evaluation, a research coordinator will collect demographics and patient
      reported data. This data will result from providing patient questionnaires and recording the
      patient's voice. VRQOL data will be collected by having the patient answer ten statements on
      a 1-5 scale, such as &quot;I have trouble speaking loudly or being heard in noisy situations&quot; or
      &quot;I run out of air and need to take frequent breaths.&quot; QUEST data will be also recorded to a
      30-item essential tremor-specific questionnaire. Patient will also complete a global voice
      rating of a 0-7 scoring of &quot;How would you rate your voice today?&quot; After these subjective
      questionnaires, patient will participate in a vocal recording using prompts and passages from
      the validated CAPE-V voice assessment tool.

      After a discussion of the risks and benefits of propranolol therapy, the patient will then be
      given a prescription by the principal investigator for propranolol.

      The second evaluation will occur at an office visit two weeks after initiating propranolol
      therapy. Again, this will consist of patient-reported V-RQOL, QUEST, and global voice rating
      data. Patient will participate in a second vocal recording using prompts and passages from
      the validated CAPE-V voice assessment tool.

      At this second evaluation, patient will receive botulinum toxin injections. The risks and
      benefits of botulinum toxin therapy will be explained to the patient, and bilateral
      injections will take place.

      Four weeks after botulinum toxin injection, the patient will undergo the third voice
      assessment. Again, this will consist of patient-reported V-RQOL, QUEST, and global voice
      rating data. Patient will participate in a third vocal recording using prompts and passages
      from the validated CAPE-V voice assessment tool.

    <description>The QUEST questionnaire is a 30 item self-reported essential tremor-specific quality of life scale that asks participants to rate responses (never/no, rarely, sometimes, frequently, always/yes, or not applicable). Total scores range between 0 to 100 where 0 is the best score and 100 is the worst score. A higher score indicates a lower quality of life.</description>

    <description>The VRQOL is a ten question self-reported measure that asks patients to rate responses from 1-5 (1=none, not a problem, 2=a small amount, 3=a moderate (medium) amount, 4=a lot, 5=problem is as &quot;bad as it can be&quot;). Total scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates more problems interfering with day to day activities.</description>

    <description>The CAPE-V is a clinically validated perceptual voice assessment tool that is used to describe the severity of auditory-perceptual attributes of a voice problem, in a way that can be communicated among clinicians. Participant's speech is recorded and evaluated by trained &quot;listeners&quot;. Listeners indicate overall tremor severity by making a tick mark on a 1 to 100 mm visual analog scale. Total scores range from 0 to 100 where 0 is the best score and 100 is the worst score.</description>

        <title>Change in Quality of Life in Essential Tremor (QUEST) Questionnaire Score</title>
        <description>The QUEST questionnaire is a 30 item self-reported essential tremor-specific quality of life scale that asks participants to rate responses (never/no, rarely, sometimes, frequently, always/yes, or not applicable). Total scores range between 0 to 100 where 0 is the best score and 100 is the worst score. A higher score indicates a lower quality of life.</description>

This prescription consisted of a starting dose of generic immediate-release at 10 mg three times per day (30 mg each day) with an increase in dose in 5-7 days if there is no effect (60 mg each day) and if the participant demonstrated no side effects. Dose was increased up to 240 mg a day depending on participant improvement and side effect profile. After second evaluation, participants received botulinum toxin injections. The risks and benefits of botulinum toxin therapy were explained to the participant, and bilateral injections took place.
Propranolol: After a discussion of the risks and benefits of propranolol therapy, the patient will then be given a prescription by the principal investigator for propranolol.

        <description>The CAPE-V is a clinically validated perceptual voice assessment tool that is used to describe the severity of auditory-perceptual attributes of a voice problem, in a way that can be communicated among clinicians. Participant's speech is recorded and evaluated by trained &quot;listeners&quot;. Listeners indicate overall tremor severity by making a tick mark on a 1 to 100 mm visual analog scale. Total scores range from 0 to 100 where 0 is the best score and 100 is the worst score.</description>
