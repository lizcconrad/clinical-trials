      This is a Phase 1b/2, multicenter, single arm trial to assess the efficacy, safety, and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of MSC2156119J as monotherapy in subjects with MET+ advanced

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed HCC

          -  Child Pugh Class A liver function score

          -  For Phase 2 only: MET+ status

          -  Male or female, 18 years of age or older

          -  Measurable disease in accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST) version 1.1

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0-1 (inclusive)

          -  Availability of a pretreatment tumor biopsy (excluding fine needle aspiration and
             cytology samples) taken after the subject has discontinued sorafenib and within 28
             days before the day of first dosing with MSC2156119J. From the pretreatment biopsy
             either a formalin-fixed (formalin fixation is mandatory) paraffin-embedded block with
             tumor tissue (preferred) or at least 15 unstained slides must be sent to the central
             laboratory prior to enrollment. An associated pathology report must also be sent with
             the sample

          -  Previously treated with sorafenib for greater than or equal to 4 weeks and
             discontinued sorafenib treatment at least 14 days prior to Day 1 due to either
             intolerance or radiographic progression

          -  Signed and dated informed consent indicating that the subject (or legally acceptable
             representative if applicable by local laws) has been informed of all the pertinent
             aspects of the trial prior to enrollment

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory
             tests and other trial procedures

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months as judged by the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior systemic anticancer treatment for advanced HCC (except for sorafenib as
             described in the inclusion criteria)

          -  Prior treatment with any agent targeting the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met
             pathway

          -  Local-regional therapy within 4 weeks before Day 1

          -  Impaired cardiac function

          -  Other protocol defined exclusion criteria could apply
