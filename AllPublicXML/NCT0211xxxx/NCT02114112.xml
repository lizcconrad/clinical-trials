      Objective: To compare the effectiveness of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP)
      cycling to continuous NCPAP in successful weaning of preterm infants of 25-28 weeks gestation
      to nasal prongs.

      Methods: A total of 40 infants with a gestational age (GA) of 25-28 weeks ventilated for
      respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and extubated to NCPAP are eligible for the study. They
      will be randomized to NCPAP cycling {Group A; cycling between NCPAP of 4 cm and 1litre per
      minute of nasal prongs} or to continuous CPAP at 4 cm of water (Group B). Primary outcome is
      the number of babies who came off NCPAP at the end of 72 hours of the intervention and
      remained off NCPAP for the next 72 hours. The duration of NCPAP, Bronchopulmonary dysplasia
      (BPD) at 36 weeks post menstrual age and Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) stage â‰¥3 will be
      the secondary outcomes.

      Randomized Controlled Trial to Study the Effect of Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure
      (NCPAP) Cycling on Successful Weaning when Compared with Continuous Nasal Positive Airway
      Pressure (NCPAP) in Premature Infants of 25-28 weeks gestations Background: In Canada,
      preterm babies of &lt; 28 weeks gestation constitute 12% of all newborn admissions and their
      survival has increased from 65% to 72%. In Alberta, the premature birth rate has been
      increasing over the past several years and although these preterm infants make up a small
      percentage of births, they add disproportionately to the mortality, morbidity and cost of
      medical care. Their rate of long-term neurodevelopmental disability is also
      disproportionately high. Advances in neonatal ventilation and neonatal care including
      increased use of antenatal steroids, postnatal surfactant, improved mechanical ventilation
      and early use of total parenteral nutrition have improved survival of extremely low birth
      weight (ELBW) premature infants. Despite these advances, the incidence of Bronchopulmonary
      Dysplasia (BPD) in these infants remains high in Southern Alberta.

      Perinatal risk factors and the duration of mechanical ventilation, including high inspired
      oxygen, high peak inspiratory pressure, lower positive end-expiratory pressure, higher
      ventilation rate and hypocarbia (Partial pressure of carbon dioxide &lt; 40 cm of water at 48 to
      96 hours) are associated with later development of BPD in these premature infants. Although
      pressure-induced injury might play a role in the injury leading to 'new' BPD, alveolar over
      distention is likely to be a more important contributing factor. Atelectasis also contributes
      to BPD as ventilation of the atelectatic lung leads to pulmonary parenchymal injury through
      the sheer stress of repeatedly reinflating collapsed alveoli. Despite various preventive and
      treatment strategies including permissive hypercapnia, high frequency ventilation,
      antioxidants, indomethacin, fluid restriction and use of diuretic, the prevalence of BPD
      continues to be unacceptably high. It is unclear whether minimum ventilator pressure exposure
      to premature lungs could prevent increasing incidence of BPD with the use of nasal continuous
      positive airways pressure (NCPAP) cycling ( NCPAP for a few hours alternating with continuous
      nasal flow) when compared with continuous NCPAP. High pressure on the ventilator or
      continuous NCPAP possibly remains an underlying mechanism for pressure and volume induced
      injury to the lungs and exhaustion of the respiratory muscle.

      Prolonged ventilation may predispose diaphragmatic myofibrils to disuse atrophy or failure of
      normal growth, which contributes, to difficulties in weaning infants from mechanical
      ventilator support including Nasal continuous positive airways pressure (NCPAP). Age and
      gestation dependent changes in contractile function of the diaphragm include decreased
      fatigue resistance with advancing maturation and Ventilator Induced Diaphragmatic Dysfunction
      (VIDD). The combination of high work, rapid breathing, and low-oxidative capacity suggests
      respiratory muscle fatigue in the infant with respiratory disease. Even short-term controlled
      mechanical ventilation produces significant remodeling and functional alterations of the
      diaphragm, which could impede efforts at discontinuing ventilator support.

      Prolonged use of mechanical ventilation has also been associated with infections, subglottic
      stenosis and aspiration. Therefore, clinicians strive to wean early from the ventilator and
      avoid reintubation once infants are extubated. Clinical signs of respiratory failure after
      extubation include apnea (prolonged cessation of respiration for 20 seconds or more and/or
      associated with cyanosis; abrupt, marked pallor or hypotonia; bradycardia), respiratory
      acidosis or increasing oxygen requirements. These problems may lead to reintubation and
      ventilation with their attendant morbidity and economic costs. NCPAP appears to stabilize the
      upper airway, improve lung function and reduce apnea. Randomized trials have shown that
      NCPAP, applied prophylactically after extubation, reduces the need for additional ventilatory
      support and is associated with a lower incidence of BPD compared to mechanical ventilation.
      NCPAP supports the compliant chest wall of the neonate by providing a pneumatic splint to
      counteract the tendency to move paradoxically during inspiration or to collapse upon
      expiration. NCPAP has been used to prevent extubation failure and as an alternative to
      intubation and ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome in very preterm infants. The
      optimal method of weaning infants from NCPAP remains unanswered. Although some Neonatal
      intensive care units try abrupt discontinuation of NCPAP, most wean on an ad hoc basis by
      gradually decreasing either time spent on the Infant Flow Driver (IFD) or the NCPAP pressure.
      Early discontinuation of NCPAP may carry the risk of pulmonary atelectasis, apnea and
      bradycardia. The most common reason for failure to wean on NCPAP is respiratory acidosis,
      apneas, bradycardias, and increasing oxygen requirements above 60%. Similarly, the most
      common reason for re-ventilation is respiratory acidosis. In a prospective study in 2011 on
      preterm infants with resolving respiratory distress syndrome, NCPAP impeded systemic and
      pulmonary venous return but did not compromise systemic arterial pressure or heart rate. The
      important issue, therefore, is the rationale of continuing NCPAP when supplemental oxygen
      requirement have ended, in the absence of moderate-to-severe apnea. Mechanical ventilation
      and NCPAP both tend to cause barotraumas and possibly BPD in premature infants. It is unclear
      whether preterm infants who undergo NCPAP cycling with free flow of oxygen are at less risk
      for BPD compared to those who are dependent on continuous NCPAP. In a randomized controlled
      trial of discontinuation of NCPAP in 2011, authors found that almost all preterm infants
      breathing room air tolerated a 6 hour pause in NCPAP with no increase in apnea and
      bradycardia. A reduction in the subsequent use of NCPAP was also observed. These findings led
      to the development of a strategy to further reduce ventilator induced trauma and thus BPD.
      This strategy used non-invasive intermittent continuous positive airway pressure ventilation
      by alternating NCPAP with continuous nasal flow (CNF) via nasal prongs for ELBW infants. This
      method of ventilation is termed cycling of NCPAP. In our subjective clinical experience,
      cycling of NCPAP with CNF reduces the duration of respiratory support and therefore would be
      expected to reduce the incidence of BPD. Cycling reduces duration of NCPAP and dependency,
      trauma and or deviation of nasal septum, feed intolerance due to gastric distension,
      agitation from pain/discomfort and nosocomial infection. The benefits of cycling NCPAP in
      comparison to continuous NCPAP in premature infants have not been studied in clinical trials.
      The aim of this pilot study is to establish the ability of NCPAP cycling to prevent
      reintubation, decrease the duration of respiratory support and thereby, the incidence of BPD.

      Rationale for this study: There is no evidence in the literature that premature infants who
      are treated with NCPAP cycling alternating with continuous nasal air flow (CNF) versus NCPAP
      without alternating CNF do better or worse in the immediate newborn period. We speculate that
      NCPAP cycling or weaning will gradually shift the work of breathing from the supportive
      intervention to the baby without producing fatigue of respiratory muscles and trauma to the
      developing lungs. Currently, this mode of respiratory support is being used in our Neonatal
      intensive care unit. It is largely determined by personal preferences with little clinical
      data, only experimental or anecdotal evidence without any long-term outcomes data. A
      retrospective study to confirm benefits of cycling NCPAP with CNF versus continuous NCPAP is
      not feasible since duration of this alternative therapy has varied in infants of different
      gestational ages. There is equipoise regarding the role of cycling NCPAP with CNF versus
      continuous NCPAP without CNF in premature infants. Therefore, it would be prudent to study
      the benefits of NCPAP cycling versus continuous NCPAP in premature infants. Our pilot study
      will address the importance of NCPAP cycling as a useful weaning mode in ELBW infants.
      Results of this pilot study will inform future power and sample size calculations for a
      larger randomized controlled trial. Information obtained from this study will also fill gaps
      in the existing knowledge in neonatal medicine and will resolve current controversies
      concerning the use of NCPAP cycling with CNF versus continuous NCPAP in ELBW infants.

      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that more infants receiving NCPAP cycling with CNF will
      successfully wean to nasal prongs in 72 hours compared with continuous NCPAP.

      Rationale for pilot study: Our pilot study is an initial or preliminary investigation
      designed to test research hypothesis, gather data, and validate the scientific approach and
      methodology for NCPAP with CNF cycling versus continuous NCPAP. Results of this study will be
      an applied to designing a randomized controlled trial and in applying for an operating grant.

      Research Question: Does the use of NCPAP cycling with CNF in preterm infants of 25-28 weeks
      gestation enable successful weaning of babies to nasal prongs in 72 hours when compared to
      continuous NCPAP?

      Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine if a regimen on NCPAP with CNF will be
      more successful in weaning babies to nasal prongs in 72 hours compared with continuous NCPAP
      in premature infants.

      Research Methods: 1. Study Design: We propose a prospective, open label, pilot, randomized
      controlled trial of two different methods of respiratory support after extubation in
      premature infants in Neonatal intensive care unit. The two methods of respiratory supports
      are alternating NCPAP and CNF versus continuous NCPAP.

      2. Subjects specifications: Settings: The study will be conducted in the level III Neonatal
      intensive care unit at the Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary, Alberta.

      Target population: All premature infants 25-28 weeks gestational age admitted to Neonatal
      intensive care unit.

      Sample selection: Infants will be identified according to inclusion and exclusion criteria
      (described below). After obtaining informed consent from their parent(s), they will be
      randomized and included in the study.

      3.Randomization: This will be achieved using a computerized random number generator. We will
      use random block sizes of 2 and 4 to increase the likelihood of equal enrolment into each
      group. Randomization procedure will occur on site, will be concealed and undertaken by health
      personnel who will be not involved in our study. Treatment allocation cards will be wrapped
      in foil and inserted into opaque sequentially numbered sealed envelopes which will be kept in
      a locked drawer in the Neonatal intensive care unit. Envelopes will be opened sequentially at
      the time of allocation. 4. Inclusion criteria: All premature infants born between 25-28 weeks
      gestation, ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and extubated to NCPAP for at
      least 72hours are eligible. RDS will be defined by clinical criteria and radiological
      findings. 5. Exclusion criteria: Infants with major congenital anomalies including complex
      heart disease, central causes for respiratory depression, persistent pulmonary hypertension
      and air leaks will be excluded from the study. 6. Recruitment: Infants meeting the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria were identified and investigators approached their parents
      during the early clinical course while the baby is still ventilated to obtain informed
      written consent.

      7. Intervention: Predefined extubation criteria were used in guiding the decision to extubate
      infants. The criteria for extubation are peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cm water, positive
      end expiratory pressure of 5 cm of water, intermittent mandatory ventilation rate of 10 to 20
      and fraction of inspired oxygen 0.30 or based on attending physician's decision. Two hours
      prior to extubation, infants were started on caffeine therapy. All infants were extubated to
      Infant Flow Driver NCPAP as per standard practice. Infants, who remain on NCPAP for at least
      72 hours and meet the Weaning from NCPAP criteria, were randomized to either the Weaning
      regimen with cycling or the continuous NCPAP regimen without cycling.

      Weaning regimen in intervention arm: The weaning protocol was as follows:- 10 hours on NCPAP
      followed by 2 hours on binasal Hudson's nasal cannula at 1litre per minute flow for 12 hours
      8 hours on NCPAP followed by 4 hours on binasal Hudson's nasal cannula at 1litre per minute
      flow for 12 hours 6 hours on NCPAP followed by 6 hours on binasal Hudson's nasal cannula at
      1litre per minute flow for 24 hours 4 hours on NCPAP followed by 8 hours on binasal Hudson's
      nasal cannula at 1litre per minute flow for 24 hours Each infant was assessed following every
      12-hour period clinically, with blood gases and a chest radiograph at the end of the first
      cycle &amp; at the end of intervention. Continuous NCPAP regimen: After the infant is randomized
      to this group, he/she was placed on Infant Flow Driver CPAP at a pressure of 4 cm of water
      for 72 hours continuously. At the end of 72 hours, the infant was weaned to NP at 1litre per
      minute. If an infant meets the failure criteria, continuous NCPAP was restarted. Blood gas
      analysis was done at 12-hour intervals, which is in keeping with the standard of care for
      monitoring infants who are being weaned off of respiratory support. The infant's ACoRN score
      will be plotted every 12 hours or sooner if there is an acute deterioration. Success was
      defined as remaining off NCPAP for 72hours after the intervention. Weaning from NCPAP
      Criteria: 1) ACoRN respiratory scoreâ‰¤4 and 2) NCPAP pressures equal to 5 cm of water and 3)
      Supplemental oxygen requirement less than 40% and 4) potential of hydrogen (pH) &gt;7.25 and 5)
      Tolerating time off NCPAP well during nursing care.

      Failure Criteria:

        1. ACoRN respiratory score â‰¥5 or increase from previous score by 2 points in a 12 hour
           period or

        2. supplemental oxygen more than 50% or

        3. acidosis with pH&lt;7.25 or

        4. apnea with bradycardia or desaturation requiring stimulation &gt;1/hour or

        5. apneic episode requiring Positive Pressure Ventilation with Bag &amp; Mask in a 12 hour
           period. Criteria to Reintubate at any point during the study include

      1) Acidosis with pH â‰¤7.2 or two consecutive pHâ‰¤7.25 or 2) Fractional inspired oxygen more
      than 50% or Partial pressure of carbon dioxide â‰¥70 or 3) Severe recurrent apnea (â‰¥2 apneas
      requiring intermittent positive-pressure ventilation).

      Oxygen concentration will be titrated by the clinical team to achieve a transcutaneous oxygen
      saturation of between 88 and 92% as per the policy in our neonatal intensive care unit.

      Data collection:

      Primary Outcome: Number of babies who came off the NCPAP at the end of 72 hours of the
      intervention and remained off NCPAP for 72 hours.

      Secondary Outcome:

        1. Total duration of NCPAP after the intervention,

        2. BPD at 36 weeks of post-conceptional age,

        3. ROP stage 3 and more Additional data collection: gestational age, birth weight, RDS,
           antenatal steroids, surfactant treatment, sepsis, Intraventricular hemorrhage, Patent
           ductus arterioses, pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, Necrotizing enterocolitis. A data
           collection form will be used to gather information regarding the antenatal history,
           birth data, and details of ventilation, details of intervention, complications and
           outcome.

      Statistical considerations Sample size: Since this was a pilot study the investigators
      planned to enroll 20 premature infants in each group by randomization. The results of this
      study will help to plan a complete randomized controlled trial. For full study sample size
      estimation: The sample size estimates will be based on the results obtained from our pilot
      study.

      Data analysis: Data was analyzed using statistical package statistical analysis system (SAS)
      with the assistance of a biostatistician. A test for difference in proportions was performed
      and a 95% confidence interval for the difference provided. Student's t-test was used for
      continuous variables where the data is normally distributed and Chi square-test for
      categorical data.

      Ethical Considerations: The study was submitted to the research ethics board of University of
      Calgary. Confidentiality of patient data was enforced throughout the study. Study number
      identified each patient only. Written informed consent was obtained from parents prior to
      enrolment in the study. Participation in the study was voluntary and parents were allowed to
      withdraw their infants at any time during the study period.

      Feasibility of the study: In the year 2009, a total of 110 infants were born between 25 and
      28 weeks gestation at Foothills Medical Centre. Therefore investigators planned to complete
      the study within two years.
