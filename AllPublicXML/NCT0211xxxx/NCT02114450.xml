      This research study will investigate the use of smart lower limb robotic exoskeleton
      (developed by the CSIC, Spain) in rehabilitation after stroke. It will compare
      robotic-assisted rehabilitation with supervised motor practice. Additionally, it will also
      examine the use of noninvasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to learn specific brain
      wave patterns associated with learning to walk on the powered lower limb exoskeleton. The
      findings will be used to understand human-robot interaction and to design smart orthotic
      devices that can be controlled by thought activity and assist those that have lost all or
      part of their walking abilities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of neurological disability in the United States and accounts for
      the poor physical health and the social dysfunction evident in survivors. Gait impairment is
      a large contributor to long-term disability and ambulatory function in daily living. Many
      patients, however, lose the ability to walk independently, and furthermore, a large
      proportion does not regain their normal walking speeds following a stroke. In this context,
      newer robotic-aided therapeutic tools such as &quot;wearable&quot; lower-limb robotic exoskeletons have
      been developed, which allow for the user to be augmented by mechanically actuated lower limb
      joints that can either completely or partially assist movements of the lower limb segments
      depending on the patient needs.

      The H2 exoskeleton (developed by Technaid S.L., Spain) is an example of one such system that
      has hip, knee and ankle joints actuated for both lower limbs. These devices are very new, and
      therefore, systematic investigations of therapeutic benefits of these devices are lacking in
      the field. Further, the nature of plasticity in the brain triggered by wearing and training
      such exoskeletons is unknown. In this exploratory research study, the investigators aim to
      compare robotic-assisted rehabilitation using the H2 exoskeleton with supervised motor
      practice particularly in terms of functional recovery. Additionally, this study will also
      examine brain plasticity associated with robotic-assisted training using non-invasive scalp
      electroencephalography (EEG) and changes in lower limb joint kinematics during
      robotic-assisted training. Taken together, the findings from this research will be used to
      understand human-robot interaction and to design smart powered orthotic devices that can be
      controlled directly by brain activity and assist those that have lost all or part of their
      walking abilities due to neurological disease or injury. Moreover, this study will
      systematically track neuroplasticity associated with functional recovery after stroke, which
      will help determine optimal windows for treatment that would maximize therapeutic benefit.
      Lastly, it will also help characterize markers of learning to use these new devices, which
      will be important in the clinical setting for modifying and adapting rehabilitation protocols
      to suit changing needs of the patient (user).

    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Intervention (within a week of completion), Follow-up at 2 weeks, Follow-up at 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>This test evaluates and measures recovery in post-stroke hemiplegic patients, used in both clinical and research settings and is one of the most widely used quantitative measures of motor impairment. It uses an ordinal scale for scoring of 17 items for the lower limb component and 7 items on the Balance component of the F-M scale (0;con not perform; 1:can perform partially; 2:can perform fully). The total score ranges from 0 to 34, with higher scores representing better function.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Functional Gait Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Intervention (within a week of completion), Follow-up at 2 weeks, Follow-up at 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale assesses postural stability during various walking tasks using a 10-item test with each item scored from 0 to 3 (0 = severe impairment and 3 = normal ambulation). This test has high criterion validity to assess functional status in stroke patients, and has been shown to be responsive to measure change.</description>

    <measure>Change in cortical dynamics measured by Electroencephalography (EEG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Each Experimental/Training Session (12 visits) over the 4 week training period</time_frame>
    <description>Time and frequency domain analysis will be performed on scalp EEG signals to characterize changes in cortical dynamics, specifically in gait initiation and sensory-motor cortical networks. Additionally, we will also evaluate the extent to which lower limb kinematics during gait can be reconstructed from scalp EEG of the user. This will be used to evaluate the neural basis of changes in lower limb joint motion as well as develop EEG-based brain-machine interfaces to robotic exoskeletons.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Timed Up and Go Test score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Intervention (within a week of completion), Follow-up at 2 weeks, Follow-up at 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>This test assesses mobility, balance, walking ability, and fall risk in older adults. Scores range from 1 to 5 based on the observer's perception of the patient's risk of falling.
