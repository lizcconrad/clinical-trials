  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for better visualization of polyps during surveillance endoscopy in patients
      with hereditary colon cancer syndromes like Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and Lynch
      Syndrome (LS), to improve the adenoma detection rate. Optical molecular imaging of adenoma
      associated biomarkers is a promising technique to accommodate this need. The biomarker
      Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is overexpressed in adenomatous colon tissue versus
      normal tissue and has proven to be a valid target for molecular imaging. The University
      Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) developed a fluorescent tracer by labeling the VEGF-targeting
      humanized monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, currently used in anti-cancer therapy, with the
      fluorescent dye IRDye800CW. The investigators hypothesize that when bevacizumab-IRDye800CW is
      administered to patients, it accumulates in VEGF expressing adenomas, enabling adenoma
      visualization using a newly developed near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence endoscopy platform
      (NL43407.042.13). This hypothesis will be tested in this feasibility study, next to the
      determination of the optimal tracer dose.

    <measure>Number of fluorescent adenomatous polyps during surveillance endoscopy using the near-infrared fluorescence endoscopy platform in patients with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), after administration of the fluorescent tracer bevacizumab-IRDye800CW.</measure>
    <time_frame>At surveillance endoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>The main objective of this study is to determine the sensitivity of the fluorescent tracer bevacizumab-IRDye800CW and the near-infrared fluorescence endoscopy platform in identifying adenomatous polyps during surveillance endoscopy in patients with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Meassure the mean fluorescent intensity of the polyps during fluorescence endoscopy, resect the polyps and score VEGF intensity after immunohistochemistry for VEGF.</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>In this outcome meassure, it is determined if there is a correlation between the observed mean fluorescence intensity of a polyp and the VEGF expression in the same polyp, as determined with immunohistochemistry and eventually RNA/DNA analysis. In other words, does the mean fluorescence intensity reflect the VEGF expression of the polyp?</description>

    <description>Collection of safety data regarding administration of Bevacizumab-IRDye800CW (adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE) and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR)).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure the mean fluorescent intensity of adenomas and compare this between the three different dosing groups to determine the best tracer dose for the fluorescence endoscopy procedure.</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>The goal of this outcome measure, is to determine the optimal tracer dose (4.5, 10 or 25 mg) of bevacizumab-IRDye800CW for the molecular-guided fluorescence endoscopy procedure to visualize adenomas. The fluorescence intensity of adenomas will be measured in vivo during fluorescence endoscopy and ex vivo (e.g. using confocal fluorescence microscopy, spectroscopy). This will be compared between the three subgroups (patients with different time intervals between tracer injection and endoscopy procedure) to determine the best time interval between tracer injection and endoscopy procedure.</description>
