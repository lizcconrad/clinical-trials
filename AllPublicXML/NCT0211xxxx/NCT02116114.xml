    <textblock>
      We have as hypothesis that the aquatic aerobic physical training program can help promote
      beneficial adaptations on the cardiovascular, respiratory and systemic inflammation
      variables, functional capacity and quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (pulmonary emphysema).

    <description>The program of aquatic exercise training was developed involving the following steps : heating : dynamic stretching exercises aerobic exercises , lasting 10 minutes was performed, aquatic fitness : aerobic training and slowdown. The intensity was prescribed based on the Borg scale score 4-6. Aerobic training was performed at intervals. The duration of aerobic fitness was started with eight 20-minute sessions , progressing to eight sessions of 30 minutes and finished with eight 40-minute sessions. Downturn : global stretching exercises , lasting 10 minutes were performed. During all sessions , the patients were instructed to breath with pursed - lip .</description>
