      The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of treatment with afatinib plus letrozole
      to treatment with letrozole alone in women diagnosed with a specific type of breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, international, randomized, Phase II clinical trial that
      will assess the efficacy and safety of letrozole in combination with afatinib(oral epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR ) inhibitor) versus letrozole monotherapy for the first-line
      treatment of postmenopausal women with ER+, Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)
      negative advanced breast cancer with low ER expression.

      In order to assess the level of estrogen receptor (ER) expression we will use a
      semi-quantitative scoring system (McClelland, 1990) defined as :

      H-score = (% of cells stained at intensity category 1x1) + (% of cells stained at intensity
      category 2x2) + (% of cells stained at intensity category 3x3).

      This formula results in an H-score in the range of 0-300 where 300 equals 100% of tumor cells
      stained strongly (i.e., 3+). Low ER expression will be defined as tumor sample with H-score
      below 160 (Finn, 2009).

      All subjects who consented for the study must submit a tumor sample to the designated central
      laboratory for central confirmation of ER / Progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 statuses and
      determination of the H-score. This will be assessed prior to randomization.

      Subjects with HER2 negative, ER+ advanced breast cancer with low ER expression defined as
      H-score between 1 and 159 will enter screening phase and perform the required screening
      assessments.

      Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio and stratified according to sites
      of disease (bone only disease vs. other) and prior administration of hormonal therapy in
      neo/adjuvant setting (Yes vs. No) to either:

      Arm A : Continuous regimen of oral letrozole 2.5 mg until progression of disease or any other
      study treatment discontinuation criteria.

      or Arm B : Continuous regimen of oral letrozole 2.5 mg daily plus oral afatinib 30 mg daily
      until progression of disease or any other study treatment discontinuation criteria.

      Once the subject is discontinued from study treatment and has undergone the End of Treatment
      visit, the subject will enter in the follow-up phase.

      A total of 150 subjects, 75 per arm, will be randomized over an estimated period of 18
      months.
