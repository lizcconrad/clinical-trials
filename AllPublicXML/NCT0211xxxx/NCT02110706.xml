  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific primary objective of this study is to determine whether rituximab is a safe and
      beneficial therapeutic for Myasthenia Gravis (MG) that warrants further study in a phase III
      efficacy trial.

      Investigators plan on conducting a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      Phase II clinical trial utilizing a futility design. The study would include acetylcholine
      receptor (AChR) antibody positive generalized MG subjects. This study also presents a unique
      opportunity to study both drug and disease mechanisms because unlike many other autoimmune
      diseases in which rituximab has been used, MG affords the investigation of antigen-specific
      components that participate in the immunopathology of the disease, namely autoantibodies,
      autoantibody-producing B cells, and antigen-specific T cells. This work will further our
      understanding of MG immunopathology and it represents the first step toward gaining a more
      complete understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying treatment of MG with rituximab
      leading to new ways to treat the disease.

      In order to assess safety in the B cell recovery during the repopulation period as well as
      the assess the long-term durability of response, there are two additional optional
      observational off study-intervention time points (weeks 72 and 96). The subjects will be
      treated per medical standard of care during this period.

      The specific aim of this study is to determine whether rituximab is a safe and effective
      treatment for subjects with MG.

          3. Elevated AChR antibody titer

          4. Subject's signs and symptoms should not be better explained by another disease

                  weeks (28 days) prior to the baseline visit.

               2. Prednisone plus another immunosuppressive therapy (IST). Immunosuppressive
