  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in ACS patients treated with DES is still
      under debate. This is especially true for STEMI patients in the era of new anticoagulants and
      antiplatelet agents. Yet, the potential benefits of longterm dual antiplatelet therapy in
      avoiding thrombotic complications may be clearly counterbalanced by a higher risk of major
      bleeding complications. In particular, the COMBO dual therapy stent, being associated with
      early re-endothelization, may allow for a reduction of the duration of DAPT (dual anti
      plateled therapy) without increasing the thrombotic risk, while reducing the risk of severe
      bleeding complications.

      Study Objective:

      Aim of the current study is to demonstrate a non-inferiority of a strategy of short-term DAPT
      (90 days) as compared to standard 360 days DAPT in ACS patients treated with Combo stent.

      Study Design:

      This study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, investigator-initiated study designed
      to enroll 1500 patients with ACS receiving a COMBO dual-therapy stent who will be randomized
      1:1 to either short term (90 days) or to standard (360 days) DAPT. Patients will be
      randomized within hospitalization (before discharge in case additional revascularization is
      deemed necessary and performed during hospitalization). Clinical visit is scheduled at 90,
      and 360 days, whereas a telephone contact will be performed at 180 and 720 days.

      Patient Population:

      The study population will consist of up to 1500 ACS patients (male and female) older than 18
      years amenable to percutaneous treatment and treated with a COMBO stent. Subjects must meet
      all of the eligibility criteria and provide written informed consent.

      Study sites:

      Up to 40 investigational sites in Europe and Asia

      Patients follow-up:

      Follow-up (clinic) visits are scheduled at 90 and 360 days, whereas a telephone contact will
      be performed at 180 and 720 days. Patients randomized to short-term DAPT will continue on
      monotherapy with ASA after 90 days unless contraindicated.

      Antiplatelet therapy:

      Subjects will be treated with Aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitor. Prasugrel (10 mg/day) or
      Ticagrelor (180 mg/day) are strongly recommended as compared to Clopidogrel (75 mg/day)).
      Long term DAPT arm: will continue DAPT with P2Y12 inhibitors and ASA up to 360 days, after
      which patients will continue on monotherapy with ASA only, unless contraindications for ASA
      emerge Short term DAPT arm: will continue DAPT with P2Y12 inhibitors and ASA up to 90 days,
      after which patients will continue.
