  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart disease and stroke are the number one killers world-wide. When someone has
      hypertension, the constantly elevated blood pressure damages their blood vessels and the
      organs that they supply blood to. This causes stroke, heart attack, heart failure, kidney
      failure and dementia. Finding and lowering high blood pressure to normal with lifestyle
      changes and if necessary medications, lowers the risk of these outcomes. Canada has high
      rates of blood pressure control compared to other countries in the world, due in large part
      to the successful dissemination of hypertension guidelines. However remote and disadvantaged
      communities have not been as successful and need additional measures to help achieve the same
      level of blood pressure control as the rest of the country. The DREAM-GLOBAL team has
      extensive experience working with Canada's Aboriginal Communities and a large community in
      Tanzania. The DREAM-GLOBAL project will integrate innovations in technology with the
      implementation of guidelines-based blood pressure control and through partnerships with
      experts in government and industry, overcome barriers to lowering blood pressure in Canada's
      Aboriginal Communities, and in a community in Tanzania. Tools will be developed and tested
      that will close the circle of care around people with hypertension by bringing measurement
      data to the medical record and health care provider and also sending useful medical feedback
      to the person with hypertension via secure data servers and routine SMS messaging on cell
      phones. The system will be tested for effectiveness of diagnosing and also for managing
      hypertension. To begin the process of preventing hypertension, the team will also explore
      with an Aboriginal community how to create policies to reduce the sodium content in their
      food. If proven effective, DREAM-GLOBAL can also become a platform for managing other chronic
      diseases.
