  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of Curodont Repair for the
      treatment of early approximal carious lesions compared to no treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All study participants must have two early approximal carious lesions in need of a treatment
      but not of an invasive treatment (split-mouth design). One lesion will be treated with
      Curodont Repair and the other will not undergo a treatment as control. Study duration is 12
      months. For assessment x-ray pictures are used.
