  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of ertugliflozin (MK-8835,
      PF-04971729) in participants with hepatic impairment versus healthy participants. In Part 1
      of the study, participants with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7-9) and
      matched healthy participants will be enrolled; depending on results in Part 1, Part 2 may be
      conducted and will enroll participants with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5-6).
