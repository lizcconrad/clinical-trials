  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to determine whether risperidone alone,
      trazodone alone, or a combination of risperidone and trazodone is superior for the treatment
      of ICU acquired delirium. The hypothesis is that combination therapy is superior to either
      agent alone in treating ICU acquired delirium and sustaining delirium free time.

    <textblock>
      Delirium is defined as a disturbance of consciousness characterized by an acute onset of
      impaired cognitive function. Although delirium is thought to be common in the Intensive Care
      Unit (ICU) there are few studies that have evaluated its incidences, risks and outcomes. It
      has been associated with increased morbidity, and mortality and increased cost to the
      healthcare system. In addition to the uncertainty of the incidence of ICU delirium, there is
      a lack of information about the effects that certain pharmacological treatments have on
      delirious patients.

      The rationale for this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risperidone alone,
      trazodone alone, and risperidone plus trazodone for the treatment of delirium in critically
      ill patients when compared to placebo.
