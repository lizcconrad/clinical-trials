  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral mucositis (OM) is a painful and potentially debilitating acute toxicity that frequently
      affects children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). As a result of
      intensive conditioning with chemotherapy with or without total body irradiation, and in the
      case of allogeneic HCT, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, patients are at risk
      for developing diffuse ulcerations of the oral and esophageal mucosa that result in pain and
      suffering, increased utilization of opioid analgesics, and the need for intravenous or total
      parenteral nutritional support. Patients universally report OM as being the worst aspect of
      the HCT experience.A novel approach has been the use of larger light-emitting diode arrays to
      treat the at risk tissues from an extraoral approach, enabling exposure of the oral,
      oropharyngeal, and esophageal mucosa while avoiding the need for intraoral manipulation, and
      requiring only minimal patient cooperation. In this research study, the investigators are
      assessing the feasibility of providing extraorally delivered low level light therapy (LLLT)
      for the prevention of OM in children undergoing myeloablative HCT.

      This is an open label, single treatment arm clinical pilot study. The study is targeted to
      enroll twelve evaluable patients

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of providing extraoral LLLT for prevention of OM in pediatric
           patients undergoing HCT

      Secondary

        -  Determine the feasibility of collecting data using the WHO Oral Toxicity Scale and
           ChIMES in pediatric patients undergoing myeloablative HCT who are treated with extraoral
           LLLT for prevention of OM

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of extraoral LLLT for prevention of OM in pediatric
           patients undergoing myeloablative HCT

    <time_frame>20 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Several measures will be collected to evaluate the overall feasibility of providing daily extraoral LLLT for children undergoing HSCT including:
Accessibility and maneuverability of the LLLT device (transportation from storage site to hospital room, device weight)
Administration of LLLT (device settings, positioning of device, delivery of therapy)
Patient tolerability (level of comfort during treatments, compliance with daily therapy
Proportion of days with therapy administered, as evidence by data submitted (goal is ≥75%)
Ability to enroll at least 5 patients within the first 3 months (this pertains to the feasibility of study conduct, and not to the feasibility of the therapeutic approach)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient compliance with completing questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>To address secondary the investigators, will calculate the following proportion: (number of times patients refused to complete one or both questionnaires) / (number of questionnaire completion timepoints), and place a 95% confidence interval on the proportion.</description>

    <description>LLLT: The LLLT device will be positioned next to the face and neck for a total of 6 exposures: Right face, Midline face, Left face, Left neck, Midline neck, Right neck
Dose per anatomic site 50mW/cm2, 60 sec = 3.0J/cm2
Route: Extraoral
Total Treatment Time (all sites): 6 min
Schedule: Participants will be treated daily (including weekends and holidays) beginning on the first day of HCT conditioning and continuing through day +20 or hospital discharge if prior to day +20.
Evaluation: Participants will undergo formal mucositis and toxicity assessments at baseline and daily from day -1 through day +20, with a final assessment on the last day of treatment.</description>
