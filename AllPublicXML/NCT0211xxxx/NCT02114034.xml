      The purpose of this prospective study is:

        -  to identify by cluster analysis the main phenotypes of severe asthma and factors
           involved in the severity,

        -  to determine the clinical and functional outcomes,

        -  to identify the factors associated with severe asthma from childhood to adulthood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe asthma involves about 5 % of asthmatic children and is associated with a high impact
      on hospitalizations, absenteeism and quality of life.

      Although our knowledge has progressed in a substantial way during the last ten years, a
      number of unresolved questions persist in particular as regard to the contributing factors
      and outcomes from early childhood to adulthood.

      After parental agreement the following elements will be collected at inclusion: clinical
      environmental data, pulmonary function, allergy test data (skin prick tests and specific
      IgE), blood and serum samples for biobank (DNA / SERUM). In a restricted number of children a
      more extensive work up will be performed which may include flexible bronchoscopy, bronchial
      brushing and bronchoalveolar lavage.

      The follow-up will be performed every 6 months within the framework of the usual care
      including collection of clinical data and pulmonary function tests. The allergic status will
      be done again at 6-7 years, 12 years and 18 years.

      In the group of children having non-severe asthma, the follow-up will be annual with
      collection of clinical data and pulmonary function tests.
