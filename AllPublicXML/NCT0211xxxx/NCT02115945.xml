      Background and aim Total knee prosthetic replacement causes severe postoperative pain.
      Various analgesic techniques have been used in pain control. Comparison of epidural and
      femoral nerve block is lacking, furthermore effect on chronic pain is unclear. The
      investigators aimed to compare the effects of epidural and femoral block on acute and chronic
      postoperative pain.

      Methods The study was of randomized, prospective, and double-blind design and was conducted
      with 80 patients who had undergone total knee prosthetic replacement surgery with the
      insertion of a femoral nerve block or epidural block catheter to initiate postoperative
      analgesia. One-sided spinal anesthesia was performed in all the patients. Postoperative pain
      control was achieved with the administration via catheter using bupivacaine for
      patient-controlled analgesia. Acute postoperative pain was evaluated in the first 24 hours
      and chronic postoperative pain in the 1st and 3rd months following surgery. The
      anxiety/depression scale was used to assess anxiety and depression, the SF 12 test was used
      to evaluate quality of life, and the DN4 test was employed at patient visits at the 1st and
      3rd months.
