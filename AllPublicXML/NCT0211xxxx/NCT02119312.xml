      The purpose of this study is to identify and screen potential subjects for preliminary
      eligibility to participate in a malaria related clinical trial conducted at the Seattle
      Malaria Clinical Trials Center (Seattle MCTC) or one of our partnering sites.

      This is a continuous study enrolling approximately 350 participants per year to establish
      preliminary eligibility for participation in ongoing or future Seattle Malaria Clinical
      Trials Center (Seattle MCTC) clinical research studies. Data collected may be used to support
      preliminary eligibility for a current or future Seattle MCTC clinical research study.

      In order to maximize efficiency of the screening process potential participants who contact
      the site will be pre-screened using an IRB-approved screening form.

      Potential participants who contact the site may be asked to come in for an in-person
      screening visit. They will be given a consent form to read and sign if they should choose to
      participate in the screening process. If they have any questions during this process research
      staff will be available. This visit includes an in-depth medical history review, travel
      history, physical exam, blood draw, electrocardiogram test (ECG), and a urine test.

      The Seattle Malaria Clinical Trials Center (Seattle MCTC) is conducting research to combat
      malaria. Malaria is a disease that is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected
      mosquito and affects millions of people worldwide. Malaria can cause a wide range of medical
      problems, and may even result in death if the infection is not treated. Currently there are
      many medications, preventative measures and malaria vaccines being developed to fight malaria
      that will need to be tested before they can be made available to the general public. The
      Seattle MCTC is conducting clinical research studies for this purpose and is in need of
      healthy adult volunteers to take part in upcoming studies.
