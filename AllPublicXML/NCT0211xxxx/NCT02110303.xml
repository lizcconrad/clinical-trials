  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart attacks are most commonly caused by rupture of fatty deposits (plaques) within the wall
      of heart blood vessels. It appears that this process can also frequently occur without
      causing any symptoms and these events likely explain the development of narrowing within the
      heart arteries which can subsequently produce symptoms of angina (chest pain).

      Previous research has shown a specialised scanner known as a PET (positron emission
      tomography) scan can identify these recently ruptured plaques in patients without symptoms of
      a heart attack and these patients have changes on a blood test (troponin) which suggest that
      they are at higher risk of having a heart attack in the future. This study aims to identify
      these patients using the PET scan and then see if the markers of increased heart attack risk
      can be reduced by the use of a blood thinning medication (ticagrelor) which is already a well
      recognised treatment for people who have suffered a recent heart attack.

      The investigators aim to recruit patients with multivessel, clinically stable coronary artery
      disease. Patients will undergo baseline investigations including CT-PET imaging using
      18F-Sodium Fluoride (18F-F) tracer to detect potentially unstable coronary plaques. The
      groups will be separated into those with and without 18F-F uptake. Each of these groups will
      be randomised to receive oral ticagrelor or a matched placebo in addition to their usual
      medications. Patients will remain on aspirin but will not be eligible for the trial if taking
      additional antiplatelet/anticoagulant treatments. The treatment will be continued for 1 year.
