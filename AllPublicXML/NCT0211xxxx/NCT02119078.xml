  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to assess the effectiveness of a multi-disciplinary
      Acute Care for Elders (ACE) program dedicated to the care of patients age 70 and older
      admitted to Oregon Health &amp; Science University's hospital medicine service. The ACE program
      will aim to improve the quality of care of older patients in the investigators hospital by
      implementing focused interventions and recommendations specific to geriatric needs and
      syndromes, including: reduced fall rate, decreased incidence and duration of delirium, early
      recognition and treatment of impaired mobility and function, careful minimization of
      medication use, prevention of unnecessary catheter and restraint use, decreased hospital
      readmission rates, improved transitional care following hospital discharge, and high levels
      of patient and referring physician satisfaction. Additionally, the ACE program aims to
      improve resident and student competence in treating geriatric syndromes, and to improve staff
      and learner satisfaction with caring for older adults. ACE programs have been well studied at
      other institutions, so the investigators will be implementing a program that is already
      standard of care, and studying the elements that are unique to OHSU.

      This will be a quality improvement project. Study participants will be a convenience sample
      of OHSU faculty, staff, residents and students who are employed by or on rotation with
      General Medicine Team 1 of the Medicine Teaching Service. Faculty, staff, and learners (ACE
      team members) will receive the ACE training. Study personnel will conduct prospective and
      retrospective chart review of patients admitted to the ACE service to determine outcomes as
      noted above.
