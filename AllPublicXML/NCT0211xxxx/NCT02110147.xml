  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol has two parts - the Main Study which is 42 days in length and the Treatment
      Extension which allows the patients who complete the Main Study to continue receiving
      treatment with uridine triacetate. The purpose of this study is to replace oral
      administration of uridine with oral administration of uridine triacetate in patients with
      hereditary orotic aciduria who have received (or would reasonably be expected to receive)
      clinical benefit from treatment with exogenous uridine. It is also to document the continued
      clinical benefit of exogenous uridine when patients are switched from oral administration of
      uridine to oral administration of uridine triacetate.

      Data to be collected during the Main Study include demographic, baseline disease information
      and medical history including all prior disease-directed therapy. In addition, vital signs,
      laboratory values and adverse events information will be collected and recorded. Urine
      samples will be obtained and measured for orotic acid and orotidine levels. Systemic levels
      of uridine will be evaluated from plasma samples collected at set timepoints.

      Upon successful completion of the Main Study and entry into the Treatment Extension, physical
      exams and vital signs will be performed every six (6) months. Additionally, plasma samples to
      measure systemic levels of uridine and urine samples to measure levels of orotic acid and
      orotidine will be collected every (6) six months.

    <time_frame>Days 28 and 42</time_frame>
    <description>Hereditary orotic aciduria patients will be taking uridine triacetate as replacement therapy for uridine. The primary outcome measure will be based on predetermined principal hematologic parameter(s) based on the patient's response(s) to oral uridine when dosing is switched from oral uridine to oral uridine triacetate. The primary outcome measure in patients not previously receiving uridine replacement therapy will be improvement in the patient's principal affected hematologic parameter(s) on Days 28 and 42 compared to baseline (Day 0) of the Main Study.</description>

    <description>Significantly elevated urine orotic acid levels are characteristic of patients with HOA. Therefore, urinary orotic acid and orotidine levels were assessed in patients at baseline (on uridine or uridine naïve) and on Day 28 and Day 42 following the switch to uridine triacetate. The table below shows the number of participants with stable or improved orotic acid and orotidine levels at Day 28 and Day 42 compared to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Patients With Levels of Uridine in the Plasma Consistent With Expected Therapeutic Benefit</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 and 28</time_frame>
    <description>HOA is principally a chronic uridine deficiency disorder. The purpose of uridine triacetate administration is to provide an exogenous source of uridine. Therefore, plasma uridine levels were assessed at various time points (prior to dosing, 30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours and 8 hours) following uridine triacetate dosing to ensure levels of uridine consistent with previously observed symptomatic improvement from administration of uridine were achieved. The table below shows the number of participants with uridine levels consistent with or exceeding previously observed symptomatic improvements.</description>

    <description>Replacement therapy for oral uridine with oral administration of uridine triacetate in patients with hereditary orotic aciduria who have received (or would reasonably be expected to receive) clinical benefit from treatment with exogenous uridine. The starting dose of uridine triacetate will be 60 mg/kg/day which may be escalated to 300 mg/kg/day of oral uridine triacetate. The dose may be given once a day or as equally divided doses twice a day.</description>

        <title>Patients With Levels of Uridine in the Plasma Consistent With Expected Therapeutic Benefit</title>
        <description>HOA is principally a chronic uridine deficiency disorder. The purpose of uridine triacetate administration is to provide an exogenous source of uridine. Therefore, plasma uridine levels were assessed at various time points (prior to dosing, 30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours and 8 hours) following uridine triacetate dosing to ensure levels of uridine consistent with previously observed symptomatic improvement from administration of uridine were achieved. The table below shows the number of participants with uridine levels consistent with or exceeding previously observed symptomatic improvements.</description>
