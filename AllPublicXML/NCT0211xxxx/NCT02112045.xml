  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial compares how well adding XMO2 Filgrastim (Granix) to melphalan
      before a stem cell transplant works in treating patients with multiple myeloma. Chemotherapy
      drugs, such as melphalan, are given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant.
      Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as XMO2 Filgrastim (Granix), may help multiple
      myeloma cells move from the patient's bone marrow to the blood where they may be more
      sensitive to treatment with melphalan. It is not yet known whether adding XMO2 Filgrastim
      (Granix) to melphalan before a stem cell transplant will work better than melphalan alone in
      treating multiple myeloma

    <description>Neutrophil engraftment is defined as ANC ≥ 0.5 × 10^9/L × 3 consecutive daily assessments. The first of 3 consecutive days for which ANC ≥ 0.5 × 109/L will be recorded as the date of neutrophil engraftment. Time to neutrophil engraftment will be calculated as the time from the date of the ASCT to the date of neutrophil engraftment.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of the rate of platelet engraftment between the two arms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 100</time_frame>
    <description>Platelet engraftment is defined as an untransfused platelet measurement &gt;20,000/mm3 × 3 consecutive daily assessments. The first of 3 consecutive days for which the untransfused platelet measurement is &gt;20,000/mm3 will be recorded as the date of platelet engraftment. Time to platelet engraftment will be calculated as the time from receiving the date of ASCT to the date of platelet engraftment. Untransfused is defined as no transfusions within 7 days.</description>
