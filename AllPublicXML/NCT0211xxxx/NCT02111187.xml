      This trial is designed as a randomized two-arm (LDE225 vs. observation groups) open-label
      prospective clinical trial in men with localized high-risk prostate cancer undergoing radical
      prostatectomy.

      The investigators propose to determine the effects of LDE225 on neoplastic prostate tissue
      from men at high risk of systemic disease progression, by comparing pre-surgical core-biopsy
      specimens to tumor tissue harvested at the time of prostatectomy.

      High-risk patients will be identified based on their core-needle biopsy features, PSA levels,
      and clinical stage. After obtaining baseline laboratory and clinical values (including an
      ECG, PSA, hematologic, and renal and hepatic panels), men will receive oral LDE225 800 mg/day
      or observation daily for 4 weeks (±3 days) prior to prostatectomy. Patients will have a
      clinical visit and an ECG and laboratory testing will be performed at 2 weeks and then again
      at 4 weeks, including a 4-week pre-prostatectomy measurement of PSA and a blood sample to
      determine plasma LDE225 levels. Men will undergo radical prostatectomy (with bilateral pelvic
      lymphadenectomy as appropriate), at which point two 250-mg biopsies of prostate tissue will
      be obtained, frozen and stored for analysis.

          2. Patients with concurrent uncontrolled medical conditions that may interfere with their
             participation in the study.

          3. Patients unable to take oral drugs (e.g. lack of physical integrity of the upper GI
             tract or known malabsorption syndromes).

             statins and fibrates), and that cannot be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to
             starting LDE225. If it is essential that the patient stays on a statin for
             hyperlipidemia, only pravastatin may be used with extra caution. Patients should not
             plan to embark on a new strenuous exercise regimen after initiation of study
             treatment. (NB: Muscular activities, such as strenuous exercise, that can result in
             significant increases in plasma CK levels should be avoided whilst on LDE225
             treatment).

          6. Patients who have taken part in an experimental drug study within 4 weeks or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) of initiating treatment with LDE225.

          7. Patients who are receiving other anti-neoplastic therapy (e.g. chemotherapy, targeted
             therapy or radiotherapy) concurrently or within 2 weeks of starting LDE225.

             metabolized by CYP2B6 or CYP2C9 that have narrow therapeutic index, and that cannot be
             discontinued before starting treatment with LDE225. Medications that are strong
             CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued for at least 7 days and strong CYP3A/5
             inducers for at least 2 weeks prior to starting treatment with LDE225.

         10. No concurrent warfarin or Coumadin-derivatives

             and through the duration of LDE225 treatment.

               -  Male patients must use highly effective (double barrier) methods of contraception
                  (e.g., spermicidal gel plus condom) for the entire duration of the study, and
                  continuing using contraception and refrain from fathering a child for 6 months
                  following the last dose of the study drug. A condom is also required to be used
                  by vasectomized men as well as during intercourse with a male partner in order to
                  prevent delivery of the study treatment via seminal fluid. Sexually active males
                  must be willing to use a condom during intercourse while taking the study drug
                  and for 6 months after stopping investigational medications and agree not to
                  father a child during this period.
