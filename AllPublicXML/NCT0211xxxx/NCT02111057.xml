  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers at the Hospital for Special Surgery are trying to learn more about post-operative
      rheumatoid arthritis flare (RA). This study hopes to understand RA flare after total joint
      replacement surgery and what the result of flaring is for patients over the next year. We
      will ask patients about their RA, whether it has gotten worse, and whether they are able to
      work with the physical therapist. During the course of this study, we'll be collecting
      questionnaires, and we'll be drawing blood to better understand what's going on with RA and
      with a patient's recuperation from their joint replacement.

      We want to understand whether a flare of RA might affect the outcome of a patient's joint
      replacement. We believe this study might show us how to better manage patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis following a joint replacement. If RA patients who flare are unable to
      participate in physical therapy and do worse after one year after a total hip replacement,
      more effective treatment could be developed. The study will also help us to identify early
      factors that may influence long-term outcomes of joint replacements in RA patients.

      The condition to be studied is worsening (flare) of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients who
      have undergone arthroplasty. RA patients undergoing arthroplasty most often have severe,
      erosive disease. If the rate of flare approaches the estimated 26% rate suggested in a
      previous study for RA patients after arthroplasty (Johnson ACR 2011), this could be of
      significance in regards to their long term arthroplasty and disease outcomes. Patients who
      flare may not be able to participate in the post-operative rehabilitation thought necessary
      for optimal arthroplasty outcomes, and it may be difficult for patients who flare after
      discontinuing immunosuppressant medications for surgery to regain remission or low disease
      activity. Detailed clinical data collected longitudinally from RA patients with severe
      erosive disease undergoing arthroplasty in conjunction with further characterization of the
      molecular profile of blood and operative tissue could provide valuable information to inform
      best practices for this patient group.

      During surgery, the subjects' surgeon will take samples of the tissue removed as part of
      their surgery from their joint. Specifically for THR, the femoral head will be collected
      intraoperatively from standardized anatomic sites, (fovea and capsular reflection). For TKR,
      tissue samples of the patella cartilage, distal femur and proximal tibia, and synovium from
      the suprapatellar pouch will be collected intraoperatively.
