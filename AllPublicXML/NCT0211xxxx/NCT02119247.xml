  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the systemic availability to CHF 6001 after a single
      dose of CHF 6001 administered using the multi-dose NEXThaler® device or the single-dose
      capsule inhaler Aerolizer®.

      CHF 6001 is an antinflammatory drug under development for Chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD) therapy. The drug is presented as dry powder for inhalation delivered by an
      inhaler device. Previous studies were conducted using a single-dose capsule inhaler
      (Aerolizer®) device. For the subsequent clinical studies a novel multi-dose NEXThaler® device
      will be used.

      This is an Open-label, randomized, 2-way cross-over, Phase I study. The study is conducted in
      1 single european site. The main scope of the study is to compare the systemic availability
      to CHF 6001 after a single dose of CHF 6001 DPI administered using the multi-dose reservoir
      NEXThaler® device or the single-dose capsule Aerolizer® device.
