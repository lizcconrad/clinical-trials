    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of verapamil, a P-glycoprotein (P-gp)
      inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of ASP015K. This study will also assess the safety and
      tolerability of ASP015K administered alone and also and in combination with verapamil.
