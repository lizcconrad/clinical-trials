  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting this research study to find out if eating low or high levels
      of specific amino acids changes the levels of these same amino acids in the blood. Amino
      acids are the building blocks of protein that are normally found in food. The amino acids the
      investigators are studying are called branched chain amino acids. The investigators will look
      at the levels (amount) of branched chain amino acids in blood before and after consumption of
      specially prepared meals. The investigators hypothesize that circulating branch chain amino
      acid (BCAA) levels will be lower following a low BCAA-content diet compared with a high
      BCAA-content diet.
