  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine safety profile, initial response rates and
      progression free survival for the combination therapy of neoadjuvant system ipilimumab
      followed by ILI with melphalan in patients with in transit melanoma.

      Hypothesis:

      The combination of regional LPAm plus systemic ipilimumab will lead to a larger response rate
      than either therapy alone.

      The combination of regional LPAm plus systemic ipilimumab will cause larger changes in immune
      cell populations than are seen with either therapy along.

      Changes in immune cell populations will predict progression free survival.

             IIIB, IIIC, or stage IV (AJCC staging must be documented in patient's medical record,
             as determined by CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, and/or whole body PET scan, and
             MRI of the brain within 4 weeks prior to administration of study drug)

          2. Patients with Stage IV disease must have had all distant disease resected at least 30
             days prior to regional treatment.

          3. Patient must be greater than 18 years of age.

          4. Patient must have an ECOG/Zubrod status of 0-1.

          5. Patient's disease must be bi-dimensionally measurable by caliper or radiological
             method as defined in the RECIST criteria. For subjects with a single lesion, archived

             should be at least 10 mm.

          6. Disease to be treated by ILI must be distal to the planned site of tourniquet
             placement (which for the leg is generally the apex of the femoral triangle, or for the
             arm is distal to the deltoid insertion). If provider feels ILI appropriate with
             disease in these areas, patient may be enrolled with PI approval.

          7. Patient must have adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the
             following:

               1. Hemoglobin greater than 9.0 g/dl

               7. Creatinine less than 2.0 x ULN

          8. Patient must have a palpable femoral/radial pulse in the affected extremity.

          9. Patients must have a life expectancy of greater than 6 months.

         10. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 26 weeks after the
             last dose of investigational product, in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is
             minimized. WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not
             undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation,
             or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not post-menopausal. Post-menopause is defined as:

               2. For women with irregular menstrual periods and taking hormone replacement therapy
                  (HRT), a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level greater than
                  35 mIU/mL.

             Women who are using oral contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives (vaginal
             products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products
             such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to
             prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their partner is sterile (eg,
             vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing potential.

             WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or
             equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours before the start of ipilimumab.

             Men of fathering potential must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid
             conception throughout the study [and for up to 26 weeks after the last dose of
             investigational product] in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized.

         11. Patient must provide a signed and dated written informed consent prior to registration
             and any study-related procedures.

         12. Patient must provide written authorization to allow the use and disclosure of their
             protected health information at any institution subject to US HIPAA regulations.

             electronic survey assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Cardiac disease: Congestive heart failure greater than class II NYHA. Patients must
             not have unstable angina (angina symptoms at rest) or new onset angina (began within
             the last 3 months) or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months

          2. Autoimmune disease: History of or current active autoimmune diseases, [e.g. including
             but not limited to inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD], rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune
             thyroiditis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic sclerosis (scleroderma and variants),
             systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis, autoimmune neuropathies (such as
             Guillain-Barre syndrome). Vitiligo and adequately controlled endocrine deficiencies
             such as hypothyroidism are not exclusionary.]

          3. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

          4. Patients who have had a history of acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, GI

             irradiation].

          6. Psychiatric conditions or diminished capacity that could compromise the giving of
             informed consent, or interfere with study compliance; any underlying medical or
             psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the investigator will make the
             administration of ipilimumab hazardous or obscure the interpretation of AEs, such as a
             condition associated with frequent diarrhea.

          7. Concomitant therapy with any of the following: IL 2, interferon, or other non-study
             immunotherapy regimens; cytotoxic chemotherapy; immunosuppressive agents; other
             investigation therapies; or chronic use of systemic corticosteroids (used in the
             management of cancer or non-cancer-related illnesses). However, during the course of
             the study, use of corticosteroids is allowed if used for treating irAEs, adrenal
             insufficiencies, or if administered at doses of prednisone greater than or equal to
             7.5mg daily or equivalent.

          8. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), defined above in Section 5.1, who:

               1. are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of contraception to avoid
                  pregnancy for their entire study period and for at least 26 weeks after cessation
                  of study drug, or

               2. have a positive pregnancy test at baseline, or

               3. are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          9. Persons of reproductive potential must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception throughout treatment and for at least 26 weeks after ipilimumab is
             stopped.

             Sexually active WOCBP must use an effective method of birth control during the course
             of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Before study
             enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during study
             participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. All WOCBP
             MUST have a negative pregnancy test before first receiving ipilimumab. If the
             pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive ipilimumab and must not be
             enrolled in the study.

         10. Known brain metastasis.

         11. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or chronic Hepatitis B or C.

         12. Active clinically serious infection greater than CTCAE Grade 2.

             entry.

         15. Any other hemorrhage/bleeding event greater than CTCAE Grade 3 within 4 weeks of study
             entry.

         16. Evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

         17. Antineoplastic therapy, radiotherapy, or any other investigational drug within 30 days
             prior to first study drug administration.

         18. Current treatment, or treatment in the previous 24 months, for another non-melanoma
             malignancy, with the exception of adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

         19. Unable to return at the regular required intervals for reassessment, or study drug
             administration.
