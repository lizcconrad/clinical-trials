      The study will compare the safety, effectiveness and tolerability of gabapentin (Neurontin)
      versus gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant) as treatment restless leg syndrome. Subjects will be
      randomized to gabapentin (IR) or Horizant™ (ER). Dosing will be blinded to both patient and
      study team members. Once study medication dosing has been optimized, subjects will then
      remain on a stable dose for six weeks until study endpoint, after which subjects will be
      down-titrated off of study medications.

    <description>Gabapentin IR is the immediate release form of the medication. Subjects randomized to gabapentin IR will be started out at a dose of 300mg per day, taken one hour before bedtime for the first week. Daily dose will be increased by 300 mg daily every 4 days until 1200 mg of gabapentin IR is reached or until a stable, tolerated dose of gabapentin IR that relieves symptoms has been maintained for 2 weeks (IRLS scores less than 15). Those patients who cannot tolerate gabapentin IR will be allowed to down titrate by one dose level (300 mg daily), before dropping out of the study.</description>

    <description>Horizant is the extended release form of gabapentin enacarbil. Subjects randomized to Horizant will take 600mg at 5 pm. After four days of stable dosing of Horizant, subjects in this study group will be evaluated by phone for changes in RLS symptoms and Patient Global Impression scale to determine if a dose increase is warranted. Subjects in this group may be titrated up to 1200 mg daily during the 2 week titration period.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Outpatients with a diagnosis of primary restless leg syndrome using the International
             Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) diagnostic criteria8.

          2. RLS symptoms ≥ 15 nights of the month prior to study enrollment and for ≥ 4 of 7
             consecutive nights in the week prior to study enrollment (if untreated).

          3. Age 18 years to 80 years.

          4. International Restless Legs Scale (IRLS) Total severity score of ≥ 15 (moderate to
