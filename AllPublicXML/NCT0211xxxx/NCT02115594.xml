  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical data has demonstrated that entinostat (SNDX-275) can enhance fulvestrant
      sensitivity in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in animal models. The addition of
      entinostat to fulvestrant will provide clinical benefit to patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic breast when compared to fulvestrant plus placebo. Also, based on previous data,
      patients exposed to entinostat who demonstrate an elevated level of protein lysine
      acetylation will have an improved efficacy outcome.

    <textblock>
      Entinostat (SNDX-275) inhibits mechanisms of resistance to hormone therapy in breast cancer
      (BC) cells, thereby prolonging sensitivity of the cells to fulvestrant. Preclinical data has
      demonstrated that entinostat can enhance fulvestrant sensitivity in hormone receptor-positive
      BC in animal models. Thus, it is hypothesized that the addition of entinostat to fulvestrant
      will provide clinical benefit to patients with locally advanced or metastatic BC when
      compared to fulvestrant plus placebo.

      Preliminary data from Phase 2 Study SNDX-275-0301 suggest patients with higher levels of
      protein lysine acetylation who receive entinostat with exemestane potentially have improved
      clinical outcomes (e.g., PFS, OS) when compared to patients with lower levels of protein
      lysine acetylation. Thus, it is hypothesized that patients exposed to entinostat and who
      demonstrate an elevated level of protein lysine acetylation will have an improved efficacy
      outcome.
