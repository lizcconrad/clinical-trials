  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is one of the main causes of the metabolic syndrome, a condition which is becoming
      more common in Canada and worldwide. Metabolic syndrome is a name for a group of heart
      disease risk factors that occur together: obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and high
      cholesterol. These patients have a high risk of developing narrowing and blockages of blood
      vessels which occur when fat and cholesterol build up in the walls of blood vessels and form
      plaque. This is called atherosclerosis. Plaque buildup leads to stroke, heart attacks, and
      death. We do not understand the underlying mechanisms of the metabolic syndrome and we do not
      have a treatment for it. L-carnitine, a dietary supplement, has been shown to treat some
      components of the metabolic syndrome, but its benefit to reduce plaque in the blood vessels
      has never been studied. Recently there has been some controversy because a new study showed
      that L-carnitine could make heart disease worse in some patients. Our goal is to study
      whether supplementation with L-carnitine does in fact prevent or reduce buildup of plaque in
      blood vessels of patients with the metabolic syndrome. This novel therapy has the potential
      to decrease the burden of heart disease in obese and diabetic patients with the metabolic
      syndrome.

      Primary Question: Does L-carnitine (L-C) therapy slows down and/or regress atherosclerosis,
      as measured by total plaque volume (TPV) assessed by 3-dimensional (3D) carotid ultrasound in
      patients with metabolic syndrome? We hypothesize that L-C will regress atherosclerotic plaque
      formation.

      To assess our primary outcome of L-C induced atherosclerosis regression, we anticipate a
      significant percent (%) difference in carotid total plaque volume (TPV) over six months of
      L-C treatment, compared to placebo. For our secondary outcome, we expect to show that L-C
      therapy compared to placebo, induces a reduction in the proportion of small-sized LDL and an
      increase in large LDL particles. As small dense LDL particles are more atherogenic than large
      buoyant ones, this would suggest a mechanism contributing to the atherosclerosis reduction
      induced by L-C therapy.

        Study Population: Patients, followed in our clinics for cardiovascular disease (CVD)
        prevention, fulfilling diagnosis criteria for metabolic syndrome (MetS) will be recruited.
        Eligibility will require a 2 step process as described.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        STEP 1: Initial screening; BP, weight and fasting blood samples will be obtained.

          1. Men and women, &gt;18 years, meeting the criteria for clinical diagnosis of MetS,
             according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) harmonized definition, where
             any 3 of the 5 following risk factors cut points constitutes a diagnosis of MetS:

               1. Elevated waist circumference: Population- and country-specific definitions;
                  Health Canada recommends males 102 cm and women 88cm.

               2. Elevated triglycerides: 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L).

               3. Reduced HDL: 40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L) in males; 50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) in females or
                  treated.

               4. Elevated BP: Systolic 130 and/or diastolic 85 mm Hg or treated.

               5. Elevated fasting glucose: 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L), or HbA1c ≥6.2%, or treated.

          2. Willing to provide informed consent. STEP 2: Baseline plaque volume ≥50 mm3 by 3D US,
             to ensure sufficient detectable plaque. This will be measured after consent (at Step
             1), but prior to randomization/enrolment (Step 2).

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Individuals who have had a change in statin and/or diabetes medication therapy or

             tumor);

          8. A condition limiting adherence to study procedure (i.e. alcoholism, drug addiction,
             known poor adherence, severe mental disorder);

          9. Concomitant treatment with: anticonvulsants; L-C or derivatives; Acenocoumarol
             (Sintrom) and Warfarin (Coumadin) anticoagulants and vitamin K antagonists; &gt;1g fish
             oil; and/or thyroid treatment;
