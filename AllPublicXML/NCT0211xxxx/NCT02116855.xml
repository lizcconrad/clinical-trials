    <textblock>
      A multi centre two year long term escalating dose tertiary prophylaxis study on the efficacy
      and cost saving of individualized low dose prophylaxis regimens for boys with severe
      hemophilia A in China staring with a low dose regimen in step I, an escalated low dose
      regimen in step II and a tailored dose regimen based on individual PK profiles in step III.
      The dose escalation criteria are adjusted according to patterns and frequencies of joint
      bleeding and assessed in each subject every 3 months. Efficacy of the 3 different dose
      regimens are measured by the Annualized Joint Bleeding rate (AJBR) as a primary end point and
      the Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS ) and QoL scores (CHO-KLAT and PedsQoL) , image
      studies of target joints by Ultrasound, X-ray and MRI examinations, consumption of factor
      VIII and inhibitor rates as secondary end points.

    <description>A multi centre 2 year long term tertiary prophylaxis study designed with a three step escalating dose protocol adjusted by individual joint bleeding patterns/frequencies to study the effect and cost saving of 3 low dose /cost prophylaxis regimens in boys with severe hemophilia A and arthropathy in China. Each patient will start treatment with a low dose regimen in step I and be assessed every 3 months according to the escalating criteria.</description>
