  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of an
      extended half-life anti-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) monoclonal antibody compared to
      placebo when administered to healthy adult participants.

    <textblock>
      This was a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of MEDI8897 compared to placebo when
      administered to healthy adult participants. There were 136 participants randomized to receive
      MEDI8897 or placebo at one site. Investigational product was delivered intravenously (IV) to
      3 cohorts and intramuscularly (IM) to 2 cohorts. 4 different dose levels of investigational
      product were evaluated across the 5 cohorts. Participants were followed for approximately 1
      year.

    <time_frame>From start of study drug administration up to Day 391 (Day 361 +/- 30 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as events present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of investigational products or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug, for the period extending to 391 (Day 361 ± 30 days) days after the last dose of study drug.</description>

    <measure>Time to Reach Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Tmax) of MEDI8897</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose, End of Dosing (IV Arms), 8 Hour Postdose, Day 2, 4, 6, 8, 15, 22, 31, 61, 91, 121, 151, 181, 271 and 361</time_frame>
    <description>The Tmax is defined as actual sampling time to reach maximum observed MEDI8897 concentration. The reported Standard Deviation values are actually Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) values (that is, Coefficient of Variation).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) for MEDI8897</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose, End of Dosing (IV Arms), 8 Hour Postdose, Day 2, 4, 6, 8, 15, 22, 31, 61, 91, 121, 151, 181, 271 and 361</time_frame>
    <description>The Cmax is the maximum observed serum concentration of MEDI8897. The reported Standard Deviation values are actually Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) values (that is, Coefficient of Variation).</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Serum Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinite Time (AUC[0-infinity]) for MEDI8897</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose, End of Dosing (IV Arms), 8 Hour Postdose, Day 2, 4, 6, 8, 15, 22, 31, 61, 91, 121, 151, 181, 271 and 361</time_frame>
    <description>The AUC (0-infinity) is the area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC(last) and C(last)/lambda(z); wherein AUC(last) is area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to last quantifiable time, C(last) is the last observed quantifiable concentration, and lambda(z) is elimination rate constant. The reported Standard Deviation values are actually Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) values (that is, Coefficient of Variation).</description>

    <measure>Terminal Phase Elimination Half Life (t1/2) for MEDI8897</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose, End of Dosing (IV Arms), 8 Hour Postdose, Day 2, 4, 6, 8, 15, 22, 31, 61, 91, 121, 151, 181, 271 and 361</time_frame>
    <description>The terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) is the time measured for the serum concentration to decrease by 1 half to its original concentration. It is associated with the terminal slope of the semi logarithmic drug concentration-time curve, and is calculated as 0.693/lambda(z). Here 'n' signifies participants evaluable for specified categories, for each arm, respectively. The reported Standard Deviation values are actually Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) values (that is, Coefficient of Variation).</description>

    <description>Systemic Clearance (CL) is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the body. The total systemic clearance after the dose was estimated by dividing the total administered dose by the Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinite Time (AUC[0-infinity]). Apparent clearance (CL/F) for the IM dose groups. The reported Standard Deviation values are actually Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) values (that is, Coefficient of Variation).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Volume of Distribution (Vz) for MEDI8897</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose, End of Dosing (IV Arms), 8 Hour Postdose, Day 2, 4, 6, 8, 15, 22, 31, 61, 91, 121, 151, 181, 271 and 361</time_frame>
    <description>The Vz is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired blood concentration of a study drug. Apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) for the IM dose groups. The reported Standard Deviation values are actually Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) values (that is, Coefficient of Variation).</description>
