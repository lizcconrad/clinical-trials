  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cabazitaxel is a new generation taxane with a high capacity for blood-brain barrier crossing
      and limited peripheral neuro-toxicity, two major potential advantages in patients with
      advanced NSGCTs.

      Cabazitaxel has a broader in vitro spectrum of activity than docetaxel. Taxanes have
      demonstrated activity in pre-treated GCTs and are now part of standard treatment, but
      cabazitaxel has not yet been tested in patients with NSGCT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male patients aged 15 years or older

             (AFP or hCG) and a compatible clinical presentation

          -  Primary site located in either the testis, the retroperitoneum or the mediastinum

          -  Progressive disease after at least 2 lines of chemotherapy for advanced NSGCT (ie,
             non-stage I)

          -  In case of brain metastases, confirm that patients should be stable / controlled with
             corticosteroid/anti seizures agents

          -  No other progressive carcinoma within previous the 5 years, except for basal-cell
             carcinoma of the skin

          -  Life expectancy &gt;/= 3 months

          -  Adequate hematologic function :

          -  Adequate organ function

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN. If serum creatinine 1.0 - 1.5 x ULN, creatinine
             clearance calculated (or measured) according to CKD-EPI formula (see Appendix B) &gt; 60
             mL/min

          -  Concurrent or planned treatment with strong inhibitors or strong inducers of
             cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (see Appendix A). A one week wash-out period is necessary for
