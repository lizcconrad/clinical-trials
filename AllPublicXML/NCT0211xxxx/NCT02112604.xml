  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is part 2 of the #NCT01618240 under the same IRB protocol #2010P001919. The primary
      objective of this study is to examine factors that are related to sleep-disordered breathing
      and upper airway patency in critically ill patients who have been recently mechanically
      ventilated. Our primary hypothesize is that sedatives and neuromuscular blocking agents given
      in the ICU prior to extubation and during the first night following extubation are associated
      with sleep-disordered breathing. The secondary hypotheses are that duration of mechanical
      ventilation, BMI, and muscle strength are associated with sleep-disordered breathing during
      the night after extubation.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate if sleep-disordered breathing in the ICU can be
      predicted by standard pulmonary function testing in the ICU.

    <description>The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is calculated the night after extubation via a polysomnography device. An AHI â‰¥ 5 indicates sleep-disordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).</description>

    <description>Grip strength has been shown to be an accurate means of assessing muscle function in the critically ill. Muscle weakness may have an impact on upper airway patency.</description>

    <description>Patients in the ICU are administered sedatives, anesthetics, opiods, anti-pyschotics and neuromuscular blocking agents as part of routine care. We hypothesize that the use of these drugs is associated with sleep-disordered breathing following extubation. We will collect the drug doses from the patient's chart.</description>
