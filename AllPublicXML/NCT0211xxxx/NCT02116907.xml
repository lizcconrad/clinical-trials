    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-dose study in healthy male subjects. The study will have 2
      phases: Pretreatment and Treatment. The Pretreatment Phase will last up to 21 days and will
      consist of a Screening Period and a Baseline Period, during which each subject's study
      eligibility will be determined and baseline assessments will be conducted.

          3. Must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and their female
             partners must not be of childbearing potential or must be practicing highly effective
             contraception throughout the study period and for 90 days after study drug
             discontinuation. No sperm donation is allowed during the study period and for 90 days
             after study drug discontinuation.

          4. Provide written informed consent
