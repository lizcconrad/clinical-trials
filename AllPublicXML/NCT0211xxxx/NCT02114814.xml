  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of an intervention and an attention control
      group in producing changes in diabetes self-management, A1C and health related quality of
      life in Hispanics with type 2 diabetes.

      Hypothesis: The experimental group who receive an 8 week intervention program will show
      significantly greater improvements than an attention control group at 1 and 6 months after
      the intervention in: behavioral influences of diabetes knowledge, diabetes self-efficacy, and
      family support, outcomes of self-reported management of diabetes (physical activity, diet,
      medications, and glucose monitoring), A1C levels, and psychological outcomes of
      health-related quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 156 participants will be recruited, 78 in the experimental group (39 participants
      with diabetes and 39 family members) and 78 in the attention control group (39 participants
      with diabetes and 39 family members). This will allow for an estimated attrition of 10% in
      each group.

      An intervention will consist of eight weekly interactive modules, for a total of 12 hours,
      and based on modules from National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education, and the
      National Diabetes Education Program. Data will be collected at baseline, immediately
      post-intervention, and at 3 and 6 month follow-up visits.
