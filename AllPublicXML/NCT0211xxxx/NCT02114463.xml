  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain after amputation is a significant problem among amputees. Phantom limb pain may appear
      in up to 85% of patients and is usually resistant to a wide variety of treatments.It is
      believed that regional anesthesia, by preventing the establishment of central sensitization,
      may play a role in reducing the incidence of acute and chronic pain. Therefore the
      investigators will compare two methods of postoperative analgesic after after amputation by
      their efficiency and complication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral nerve transection results in an afferent nociceptive barrage that initiates spinal
      cord hyperexcitability with expansion of the receptive fields of dorsal horn neurons that
      respond to the nearest intact afferents. These neuroplastic changes are believed to be
      responsible for the development of postsurgical chronic pain syndromes, including phantom
      limb and stump pain.At present, there are no randomized studies with sample sizes that ensure
      power, or blinded for end-point assessment,to support the evidence on pharmacological and
      non-pharmacological treatments of Pain after amputation. Consequently, our study was designed
      to arrive at clear conclusions about treatment efficacy and to give stronger recommendations
      for clinical practice.
