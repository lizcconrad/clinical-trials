  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human body houses a huge microbial ecosystem, including the intestinal and oral
      microbiota. Both these ecosystems, and, in particular, the intestinal one, are responsible
      for maintaining human health. The response of the organism to the diet and the relative
      alteration of the susceptibility to disease are worth of investigation to comprehend the role
      of the microbiota to maintain the state of well being in humans. This concept, which is the
      overall scientific basis of the entire project, perfectly fits with the declared scopes of
      Horizon 2020. Understanding the impact of omnivore, vegetarian and vegan diets on human
      intestinal microbiota is aligned to the Grand Societal Challenge of the Horizon 2020 scheme,
      which is addressing the human nutritional needs and the impact of food on human physiological
      functions. In particular, studying the link between dietary habits and the intestinal
      microbiota activity will be pivotal to improve the food-based promotion of health and well
      being. The project aims at studying how the omnivore, vegetarian and vegan diets may affect
      the oral intake of microorganims, and the composition of the oral and fecal microbiota. With
      the aim to build up a permanent European platform for such type of studies, ten Research
      Units (RUs) are involved in the proposal, with the partnership of 16 National and,
      especially, foreign Institutions, covering 12 different countries. About 50 omnivore,
      vegetarian and vegan volunteers, for a total of 150 subjects will be recruited. Volunteers
      will be asked to fill in diaries, describing their dietary habits, and to collect biological
      samples (saliva, feces and urine), once a week for three weeks. For obvious ethical
      constraints, biopsies will be not available in this study. RUs will share their tasks, mainly
      depending on the nature of the samples to be studied, namely foods and biological samples.
      Based on the different dietary habits, the presumptive intake of microorganims will be
      estimated using literature data and, especially, culture-dependent methods. Typing and
      antibiotic resistance of some food related microbial communities or foods will be also
      investigated. The microbial diversity of foods, whose microbiota has never been studied in
      depth, will be characterized by PCR-DGGE and deep sequencing. The metabolome characterization
      will complete the overview on foods. After collecting and preparing biological samples from
      the three diet groups, the oral and fecal microbiota will be studied. The viable cell number
      of several microbial groups will be estimated in fecal samples, before freezing.
      Preliminarily, the microbial diversity of saliva and fecal ecosystems will be analyzed
      through PCR-DGGE. PCR assessment of genetic basis of antibiotic resistance will be also
      carried out. Selected numbers of biological samples will be further subjected to next
      generation sequencing, aiming at determining representative individuals/samples of the three
      types of diet. Only for feces, representative samples (e.g., 4/5 for each diet) will be
      subjected to meta-omics analyses based on meta-genomic, meta-transcriptomic and
      meta-proteomic approaches. An integrated and iterative workflow will be also developed, by
      assembling an in house synthetic meta-genome. The functionality of fecal samples and/or of
      isolates from feces will be characterized based on fecal genotoxic and anti-genotoxic
      activities, and modulation of the immune response. In agreement with an holistic approach,
      the metabolome analysis of saliva, feces and urine will complete the characterization of
      biological samples. All data available from the different RUs will merge into a common
      database, whose structure will be developed during the project. Based on the literature data
      (ISI Web of Knowledge), this is the first study that aims at correlating the effect of the
      main dietary habits on the oral and fecal microbiota through integrated meta-omics analyses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to find the relationship between diet and saliva and
      fecal microbiota, through high-throughput and integrated meta-omics (genomic, transcriptomic,
      proteomic and metabolomic) analyses. Several questions are still debated within this context.
      For instance, what is the daily intake of microbes and their role on the balance of the
      intestinal microbiota? How is the intestinal microbiota affected by the main types of diet
      (omnivore, vegetarian and vegan)? Which are the prevailing microbial groups at intestinal
      level, depending on the type of diet? What is the presumptive contribution of each microbial
      group in maintaining the host health? The quantitative and qualitative determination of the
      main microbial groups harboured in foods, depending on dietary habits, responds to an earlier
      question and coincides with one of the objectives of this project. The estimation of the
      diversity (genomics), functional activity (transcriptomics and proteomics) and metabolites
      (metabolomics) of, especially, the fecal microbiota coincide with the holistic approach of
      this project and responds to several of the earlier questions. Considering the close
      correlation between the balance of different microbial populations in various niches of the
      human body and the onset of metabolic pathologies, this project shall furnish novel knowledge
      that may highlight possible relationships between diet and dismetabolisms. Diet has to be
      considered as the most appropriate and inexpensive tool to determine a stable and favourable
      oral and intestinal microbiota, which prevents diseases and guarantees human longevity. These
      overall objectives of the project shall be reached on the basis of specific targets, such as:
      (i) the identification of biological, molecular and metabolic markers specific to the type of
      diet; (ii) the estimation of the differences in the microbiota and metabolome of saliva and
      feces, both among individuals and between types of diet; (iii) the estimation of the
      qualitative and quantitative differences on the microbial intake connected to the type of
      diet; and (iv) the identification of the functional features of fecal samples related to the
      type of diet, which can be regarded as indicators of disease susceptibility.

      With the aim to reach the overall objective of this project, ten Research Units (RUs; RU1-10)
      are involved in the proposal, with the partnership of 16 National and, especially, foreign

           achieve the main objectives of the project.

      This study will composed by different activity (AI-VI) described below:

        -  ACTIVITY I. Recruitment of individuals, administration of diaries, handling, preparation
           and storage of biological samples, and microbiological analyses of fecal samples.

        -  AI.1. Recruitment of individuals and administration of diaries (RU1, 4, 6, 8) About 50
           omnivore, vegetarian and vegan volunteers, for a total of 150 subjects will be
           recruited.Vegetarian and vegan individuals will be recruited with the cooperation of the
           Italian Scientific Society of Vegetarian Nutrition. Omnivore individuals will be
           recruited through advertisements published at the Universities. About 50 healthy
           volunteers will be recruited including an approximately equal number of omnivores,
           vegetarians and vegans (age 18-59 years, male/female ratio ca. 1:1). Recruited
           volunteers will be asked to sign a consensus document, to record their dietary habits.
           The diaries will be elaborate to get detailed information on food characteristics,
           allowing an easy identification of the products on the market and an estimation of the
           presumptive microbial load ingested. The Ethics Committee of the Universities will be
           informed before the project will start.

        -  AI.2. Handling, preparation and storage of biological samples (RU1, 4, 6, 8). Each
           individual will supply samples of saliva, feces and urine weekly, for a time span of
           three weeks. Triplicate samples will be pooled before analyses in order to limit the
           intra-individual variability. Handling will be carried out differently depending on the
           type of biological samples (saliva, feces, urine) and subsequent analyses (e.g., DNA,
           RNA, proteome). Simultaneously with the recruitment of individuals and collection of
           biological samples, most of the RUs will be involved in setting up the
           techniques/methods.

        -  AI.3. Microbiological analyses of fecal samples (RU1, 4, 6, 8). In the first time the
           viable counts will be performed by plating fresh fecal material on different selective
           culture media, to enumerate the most common fecal microbial groups.

        -  AI.4. Set up of techniques/methods (RU1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). Simultaneously with
           the recruitment of individuals and collection of biological samples, most of the RUs
           will be involved in setting up the techniques/methods. In order to establish an
           independent and competitive platform for meta-omics analyses, RU3 will purchase
           equipment for high throughput sequencing, which is a main economic investment in this
           project.

        -  ACTIVITY II. Food microbiota and metabolome. Based on the information from dietary
           diaries, the most representative foods of the 3 diets will be split in 3 categories: (i)
           low (TBC, 10^3 cfu/g); (ii) intermediate (TBC 10^3 - 10^6 cfu/g); and (iii) high (TBC ¬≥
           10^6 cfu/g) microbial load. For foods of group (i) the microbial number will be
           estimated based on literature data. For foods of groups (ii) and (iii) the microbial
           number will be determined based on literature data in the case of well known products
           with low market differentiation (e.g., Parmigiano Reggiano cheese), whereas appropriate
           analyses will be done in the case of products with large market variability (e.g.,
           Mozzarella cheese). In the latter case, the analyses will involve a large number of
           products available in the market. The microbial diversity of foods will be studied more
           in depth first by PCR-DGGE (Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel
           electrophoresis) and when needed by deep sequencing on the basis of level of complexity
           and current knowledge of the microbiota of the specific foods.

        -  AII.1 Quantitative determination of microorganisms in foods (RU 4, 5; 7). The analysis
           of foods will be shared between RU4 and 5, and some samples will be analysed by both RU
           to reciprocally validate the results. Subsequently, RU4 will characterize selected foods
           by LH-PCR (Length Heterogeneity Polymerase Chain Reaction) analysis, and the results
           will be compared with those obtained by RU7 using PCR-DGGE. RU5 will identify a large
           collection of isolates from foods, aiming at finding possible relationships with a
           reduced anti-genotoxic activity of the fecal waters and presence of specific
           microorgansims in the ingested foods.

        -  AII.2 Microbial diversity in foods (RU 2, 3). First, this activity will consider poorly
           characterized foods that are specifically eaten by veregetarians and vegans based on
           records from diaries. Both micro- and mico-biota will be investigated. PCR-DGGE analyses
           for yeasts and filamentous fungi will be based on the amplification of parts of the
           D1/D2 domain encoding for the subunit LSU or 26S of the rRNA, and the ITS (Internal
           transcribed spacer) regions. The V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene will be targeted to
           detect bacteria. After DGGE analysis, the resulting gels will be digitalised and
           analysed by the software Bionumerics. Dendrograms will be subjected to cluster analysis
           to exclude from the further sequencing those samples having a coefficient of similarity
           85%; such selection will save costs of the next generation sequencing, and will assure
           to get a manageable quantity of data to be analyzed via bio-informatics. RU3 will
           perform the deep sequencing using libraries of amplicons of variable genes of taxonomic
           interest and using specific procedures according to the type of sequencing platform that
           will be purchased. The sequencing results will be elaborated on a bioinformatic basis by
           the RU2.

        -  AII.3 Food metabolome (RU 10). Based on the information on dietary habits, the fermented
           foods most represented in the three diets, will be analysed to find a possible
           relationship between chemical compounds ingested (e.g., salycilic acid) and
           presumptively recovered in biological samples. The metabolome analyses will be carried
           out by GC-MS/SPME (Gas Chromatography-mass Spectrometry /solid-phase microextraction)
           and FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy.

        -  ACTIVITY III. The microbiota of feces and saliva. Preliminarily, all saliva and fecal
           samples from all the ca. 150 volunteers will be subjected to PCR-DGGE analyses to get an
           overview of the microbial diversity. RT-PCR-DGGE (Real Time- Polymerase Chain Reaction-
           Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) will be also considered to estimate viable
           populations in feces. Based on these analyses, representative samples of each dietary
           habit will be subjected to next generation sequencing. The output of all these results
           should allow, step by step, the selection of 4/5 fecal samples for each of the three
           diets to be subjected to meta-omics analyses.

        -  ACTIVITY III.1. Study of the biodiversity.

        -  AIII.1.1. PCR-DGGE Profiling (RU 2, 3, 8) PCR-DGGE analyses for yeasts and filamentous
           fungi will target 26S rRNA and ITS regions, while V3 and/or V6-V8 regions of the 16S
           rRNA will be studied for bacteria. Both DNA and RNA (after RT-PCR) will be used as
           target to investigate total and viable populations, respectively. Under the same
           experimental conditions, RU3 will characterize the bacterial diversity of saliva
           samples. After DGGE, image and cluster analyses from DNA and RNA samples it will be
           possible to define a difference between the global and viable population. The
           dendrograms of similarity will be used to exclude from the further sequencing activity
           those samples having a coefficient of similarity ¬≥ 85%; such selection will save costs
           of the next generation sequencing analyses, and will assure to get a manageable quantity
           of data to be analyzed via bio-informatics.

        -  AIII.1.2. Next Generation Sequencing (RU 3, 8) Deep sequencing on selected saliva and
           fecal samples will be done using libraries of amplicons of variable genes of taxonomic
           interest. All sequencing results obtained both for bacteria and fungi will be elaborated
           on a bioinformatic basis by the RU2.

        -  AIII.1.3. Antibiotic resistance (RU 7) DNA extracted directly from saliva and fecals
           samples will be screened for the occurrence of genes encoding for resistances to several
           antibiotics using PCR assays. Samples, resulted to be positive for antibiotic resistance
           (AR) genes, will be used to isolate antibiotic-resistant lactobacilli, lactococci and
           enterococci. After identification, isolates showing values of minimum inhibitory
           concentration (MIC) higher than the corresponding breakpoints will be confirmed by PCR
           amplification of the corresponding AR genes. The possibility of transferring AR genes
           localized on genetic mobile elements from isolates to bacteria of clinical interest will
           be evaluated by conjugation trials.

        -  AIII.2. Meta-omics analyses of selected fecal samples According to the cascade approach,
           the results from the study of the microbial diversity of fecal samples will select 4/5
           individuals representative of each of the 3 types of diet (4/5 x 3 = 12/15) to be
           subjected to meta-omics analyses. The meta-omics approaches will provide an in house
           database, consisting of the DNA and RNA sequences from the fecal microbiomes of the
           12/15 individuals, which will allow a complete view of the synthesized proteins.

        -  AIII.2.1. Meta-genomics (RU3, 8) Fecal DNA will be quantified and a shotgun sequencing
           protocol will be applied for meta-genomic analysis. This task should be performed by the
           RU3, depending on performance and availability of the sequencing platform, which will be
           engaged full time in the analysis of DNA and cDNA amplicons of feces and saliva.
           Alternatively, specialized companies will carry out this task as a service.

        -  AIII.2.2. Meta-transcriptomics (RU 6) The overall microbial gene expression profile will
           be characterized using an innovative Illumina-based Metatranscriptomic approach and the
           protocol set up during first months of the project. cDNA will be sinthetised from RNA
           according to optimized procedures. Random amplification of the cDNA will be performed
           and the cDNA will be sequenced by using the Illumina HiSeq platform. The sequenced
           meta-transcriptomes will be assembled together using Velvet/MetaVelvet or SOAPdenovo
           packages to achieve the largest possible consensus sequence. The transcripts sequences
           will be annotated using well-established pipelines and transcripts will be searched
           using RPS-BLAST (Reversed Position Specific- Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) against
           KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes), COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) and
           the Genbank databases. Bacteria-like reads identified by nr BLASTX will be further
           searched against the COG database. The functional roles of the sequences will be
           assigned based on the KEGG and COG searches.

        -  AIII.2.3. Meta-proteomics (RU1) Based on the workflow designed within the first months
           of activity, proteins will be extracted from each fecal sample and analysed by gel-free
           and/or gel-based proteomics. The identification of peptides will be performed using the
           mass spectrometer Finnigan LCQ Deca XP MAX. Differential proteomic analysis will be
           carried out. For peptide identification, the Open Mass Spectra Search Algorithm will be
           used to search MS/MS spectra against the available databases. To retrieve further
           functional information, the proteins based on COG classification will be annotated. The
           identified COGs will be mapped on KEGG metabolic pathways database and visualized by the
           online application of iPath. After FDR correction, all identified peptides will be
           searched against UniProtKB and then mapped. To address the highest functional level of
           all the identified proteins, the identified COGs onto KEGG pathways will be mapped.
           Besides the common microbial core, inter-individual and inter-diet differences will be
           determined in terms of metabolic function.

        -  ACTIVITY IV. Functional characterization. The characterization of some functional
           features of fecal samples and of microbial isolates from fecal samples will strengthen
           the link between diet and intestinal microbiota.

        -  AIV.1 Fecal genotoxic and anti-genotoxic activities (RU 5) Samples of fecal water (FW)
           will be prepared and the genotoxicity will be determined by Comet assay. The HT29
           enterocytes (10^6 cells/assay) co-exposed to FW and incorporated into LMA slide will be
           subjected to Single-Cell Gel-Electrophoresis (SCGE) and analysed by epifluorescence.
           Several microbial isolates from foods will be investigated for the inhibitory activity
           towards genotoxic and mutagenic compounds, which are potentially present in the
           intestine. The effect of the microorganism-genotoxin co-incubation will be assayed
           through the evaluation of the residual genotoxic activity of the compounds using the
           SOS-Chromotest (target Escherichia coli PQ37 sfiA:lacZ) and, in parallel, the Comet
           assay (target enterocytes HT29).

        -  AIV.2. Fecal microorganisms and modulation of the immune response (RU 9) The conditions
           for growth and differentiation of dendritic cells (DC) and Caco-2 cells will be set up
           within the first months of activity. Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria will be isolated
           from all fecal samples and used as irradiated bacteria to detect the expression of
           immune mediators in enterocytes. Transcript and cognate protein secretion levels of IL-8
           and tolerogenic TGF-beta (Transforming growth factor beta) and TSLP (Thymic Stromal
           Lymphopoietin) will be determined. Irradiated bacteria will be also used to stimulate
           surface markers in DC cells. Total RNA will be extracted from the Caco-2 and DC cells,
           and cDNA will be prepared to look at the relative gene expression of IL-8, TGF-beta,
           TSLP, TNF-alpha, IL-12p40 and IL-10; the concentration of the corresponding gene
           products will be determined by ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay).

        -  ATTIVITY V. Saliva, fecal and urine metabolome (RU10). To complete the &quot;omics&quot; approach,
           the metabolome of samples of feces, urine and saliva will be analysed with three
           techniques (GC-MS/SPME, FTIR/ATR (Fourier Transform Infrared/Attenuated Total
           Reflectance) and NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) according to the protocols previously
           set up. Chemical compounds will be identified using mass spectra databases as well as
           mass spectra data in the literature and/or data from pure chemical compounds. Upon
           thawing of urine and saliva samples, the NMR analysis will be performed within 2 h.
           Fecal samples will be prepared giving the maximum importance to the complete recovery of
           water-soluble molecules. The NMR spectra will be prepared for statistical analysis by
           correcting the little peaks misalignments through iCoshift algorithm.

        -  ATTIVITY VI. Statistical elaboration of the results (all RUs). During project
           development, RU2 will take care of the maintenance of the website in collaboration with
           the partner CBS (Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures, Utrecht, NL), the site will
           collect all the results from the different research activities. This database will be
           used for analysis in &quot;R mode&quot; to assess the impact of various descriptors in determining
           the diversity of the three diets, and in &quot;Q mode&quot; to determine difference between the
           three diets. During the same time, the most relevant results will be disseminated
           through scientific publications into peer-reviewed journals.

      Taking into account the topic to be studied, this project has undoubtedly applied potential
      aspects. For instance, the knowledge of the effect of diet on human microbiota could result
      in the preparation of appropriate guidelines to be distributed in campaigns of integrated
      care promotion. Consumer preferences, attitudes, needs, behaviour, lifestyle and education
      will be taken care of, and communication between consumers and the food chain research
      community will be enhanced in order to improve informed choice and its impact on quality of
      life. Empowering individuals to improve and manage their health through correct dietary
      habits will result in cost savings to healthcare systems.
