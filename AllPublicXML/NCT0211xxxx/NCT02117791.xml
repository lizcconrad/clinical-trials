  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This local, prospective, non-interventional, multi-center study includes patients treated
      with Riociguat for inoperable CTEPH(Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension)/
      persistent or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment. It is planned to include a total of
      400 patients (valid for safety analysis). This study is performed as an all-case
      investigation. The treatment of Riociguat is performed based on the product label in Japan.
      The standard observation period is 12 months from the 1st treatment of Riociguat. Safety and
      effectiveness are evaluated at 4th and 12th month. In addition, the extension observation is
      carried out once a year for 7 years at the longest to collect information on safety and
      effectiveness as long as Riociguat treatment continues. When the treatment of Riociguat is
      terminated, observation of a patient ends. For each patient, the investigator records data as
      defined in the protocol at each evaluation point by using the Electronic Data Capture (EDC)
      system. The duration of the study is approximately 9 years from launch.

        Study population includes patients treated with Riociguat for inoperable CTEPH/ persistent
        or recurrent CTEPH after surgical treatment. This study is performed as an all-case
        investigation. Therefore, all patients who have been treated with Riociguat for CTEPH need
        to be registered in principle, until the target number of patients reached.
