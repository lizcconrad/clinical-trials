  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm pharmacodynamic study with mandatory metastatic tumor biopsies in men
      with castration-resistant prostate cancer.

      The trial will evaluate the effect of vismodegib on tumor tissue in men with metastatic CRPC
      by obtaining tumor biopsies at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment with vismodegib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 10 evaluable patients. Patients will receive a 30-day supply of 150 mg
      of vismodegib on day one of each cycle daily by mouth, beginning on Day 1, and continuously
      until one of the following occurs: Disease progression, intolerable toxicity most probably
      attributable to vismodegib or withdrawal from the study.

      Tumor biopsies (nodal or visceral), skin biopsies, and CTCs will be obtained at baseline and
      after 4 weeks of treatment. PSA evaluations will be conducted every 4 weeks, imaging
      assessments (CT and Bone scan) will be conducted every 12 weeks and routine labs (blood
      counts and chemistry panel) will be conducted every 4 weeks.

      The investigator's intent is to examine the fold change in GLI1 expression in each man
      following exposure to drug (comparing pre-treatment and on-treatment core biopsy samples). As
      secondary endpoints, the investigator will also explore clinical response (PSA responses,
      progression-free survival [PFS], radiographic responses), safety, and will examine changes
      from baseline in Gli2, PTCH1, and AKT1 mRNA levels by qRT-PCR, in situ GLI1 expression in
      tissue sections by mRNA in situ hybridization, and GLI1 expression in isolated circulating
      tumor cells (CTCs).
