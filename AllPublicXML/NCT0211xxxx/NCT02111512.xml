  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Egg allergy is common in early childhood, affecting at least one in 50 preschool children.
      Influenza (&quot;'flu&quot;) vaccines contain egg protein, as the vaccine is cultured in hen's eggs.
      There is robust data to support the safety of influenza vaccines (containing low or
      negligible amounts of egg protein) in patients with egg allergy.

      A new influenza vaccine, known as LAIV (Live Attenuated Intranasal Vaccine) has recently been
      approved by a number of licensing boards and is given by a spray into the nose. This new
      vaccine has been available in the United States for several years and is highly effective and
      against influenza infection, with an excellent safety profile in children without egg
      allergy. However, LAIV is also grown in hen's eggs and contains egg protein, and there are NO
      published data on the safety of LAIV in egg-allergic children. In SNIFFLE 1 Study, 433 doses
      were given to 282 egg-allergic children; data is currently being analysed.

      The objective of this multicentre study is to further assess the safety of intranasal LAIV in
      egg-allergic children, in order to demonstrate that these children can safely be given the
      new LAIV within a primary care health environment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 2 - 17 years old

          -  Physician-diagnosis of egg allergy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical resolution of egg allergy

          2. Contraindications to LAIV (notwithstanding allergy to egg protein):

               -  Hypersensitivity to the active ingredients, gelatin or gentamicin (a possible
                  trace residue)

               -  Previous systemic allergic reaction to LAIV

               -  Previous allergic reaction to an influenza vaccine (not LAIV) is a relative
                  contra-indication, which must be discussed with the site PI to confirm patient
                  suitability

               -  Children/adolescents who are clinically immunodeficient due to conditions or
                  immunosuppressive therapy such as: acute and chronic leukaemias; lymphoma;
                  symptomatic HIV infection; cellular immune deficiencies; and high-dose
                  corticosteroids. NB: LAIV is not contraindicated for use in individuals with
                  asymptomatic HIV infection; or individuals who are receiving topical/inhaled
                  corticosteroids or low-dose systemic corticosteroids or those receiving

                  therapy because of the association of Reye's syndrome with salicylates and
                  wild-type influenza infection.

          3. Contraindication to vaccination on that occasion, due to child being acutely unwell:

               -  Febrile â‰¥38.0oC in last 72 hours

               -  Acute wheeze in last 72 hours requiring treatment beyond that normally prescribed
                  for regular use by the child's treating healthcare professional

               -  Current oral steroid for asthma exacerbation or course completed within last 2
                  weeks
