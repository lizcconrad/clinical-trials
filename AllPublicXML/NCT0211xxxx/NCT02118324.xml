    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility study to collect preliminary data for a large-scale exergaming
      intervention in children undergoing maintenance therapy for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
      (ALL). Patients, ages 5-17 years will be randomized to the intervention or non-intervention
      control group. The intervention will consist of 30 minute sessions of exergaming 3-5 times a
      week for 6 months, with weekly assessment of exercise level and phone calls by kinesiology
      graduate students for safety and compliance. Physical activity at baseline and at the end of
      study will be assessed using accelerometers. Outcome measures will include: anthropometrics,
      blood pressure, body composition, visceral fat, vascular function, fasting insulin, fasting
      glucose, LDL-cholesterol, HDL- cholesterol, triglycerides, functional mobility and endurance,
      and strength.
