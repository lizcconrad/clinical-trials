    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy the OptiMedica Femtosecond
      Laser System, also known as the Catalys™ Precision Laser System, to perform two surgical
      maneuvers used in the treatment of subjects with cataracts. Efficacy will be evaluated by
      comparisons to the standard surgical procedure of continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC)
      and ultrasonic phacoemulsification.
