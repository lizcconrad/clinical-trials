      The purpose of this study is (i) Main Study: To describe the baseline characteristics
      (including demographics, cognitive status, and other measures) and the cognitive and
      functional changes of persons at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD).

      (ii) SubStudy: To investigate the longitudinal change of the components of the Preclinical
      Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC) and the components of the Repeatable Battery for the
      Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) in asymptomatic at risk for AD (ARAD)
      individuals compared with individuals not classified as ARAD.

      (iii) NeuroVision Ancillary Study: To explore correlation between retinal amyloid beta
      plaques identified by fluorescence with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET)
      Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta 42 testing
      in participants at risk for Alzheimer's dementia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-interventional study consisting of a Main Study, a SubStudy, and
      an Ancillary Study that will enroll participants without dementia who are considered at high,
      medium, and low risk for developing AD from a community based register (referred to as the
      CHARIOT registry) in the United Kingdom. The Main Study will be conducted only at one site
      and the SubStudy and the Ancillary Study will be conducted at two sites. Participants in both
      the Main Study and the SubStudy will undergo a series of neuropsychological evaluations to
      characterize the patterns of cognitive change and their inter-relationship in the earliest
      stages of cognitive impairment. The SubStudy will investigate the longitudinal change of
      components of the PACC and RBANS in ARAD individuals who have demonstrable amyloid in the
      brain by either PET or CSF compared with individuals not classified as ARAD. The Ancillary
      Study will explore how measures of retinal amyloid plaques relate to cerebellar amyloid SUVR
      taken from PET imaging or with amyloid beta 42 levels measured in CSF. Data collection to
      assess outcome measures associated with disease progression will occur at baseline and every
      6 months thereafter at the clinic during the follow-up period of 48 months (Main Study).
      SubStudy participants will be followed every 3 months throughout the SubStudy and will
      alternate between completing the alternative forms of the PACC and RBANS for a period of up
      to 3.5 years (42 months). Ancillary Study participants will be followed on Day 1, Days 4-15
      and a follow-up call (greater than [30] and less than [&lt;] 35 days after Visit 2). Blood,
      urine, and saliva samples will be collected from participants during the study for biomarker
      analyses to assess risk factors for dementia, Alzheimer's disease or confounding factors of
      dementia risk. Adverse events experienced by the participants during their participation in
      the study will be monitored.

    <measure>SubStudy: Change From Baseline on Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC) Component Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The PACC is a retrospectively validated measure that is weighted towards episodic memory, and also includes a timed executive function test and a global cognitive screening test. The PACC includes: 1. Total Recall score from the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test [FCSRT] (0-48 words); 2. Delayed Paragraph Recall total score on single administration of the Logical Memory story from the Wechsler Memory Scale [WMS]-Revised (0-25 story units); 3. Digit Symbol Substitution Test score from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale [WAIS]-Revised (0-135 symbols), and 4. MMSE score (0-30 points). The component scores are transformed using an established normalization method into z-scores. Each of the 4 component change scores is divided by the baseline sample standard deviation of that component. Z-score implies how many standard deviations higher or lower the score is compared with the baseline score.</description>

    <measure>SubStudy: Change From Baseline in Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status-Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (RBANS-PACC) Component Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>This brief test is for cognitive assessment, detection, and characterization of dementia in the elderly as well as neuropsychological screening for younger patients. The RBANS-PACC includes: 1. RBANS List Learning; 2. RBAN Delayed Story Recall; 3. RBANS Coding; 4. MMSE score; and may also include a fifth component, the RBANS Semantic Fluency. The component scores are transformed using an established normalization method into z-scores. Each of the 4 component change scores is divided by the baseline sample standard deviation of that component. Z-score implies how many standard deviations higher or lower the score is compared with the baseline score.</description>

    <measure>SubStudy: Change From Baseline on the RBANS-PACC Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>This brief test is for cognitive assessment, detection and characterization of dementia in the elderly as well as neuropsychological screening for younger participants. RBANSPACC composite score will be calculated similar to PACC, by replacing 1 or more PACC components as: FCSRT replaced by RBANS List Learning; Delayed Paragraph Recall replaced by RBANS Delayed Story Recall; WAIS-IV Coding replaced by RBANS Coding; MMSE. It may also include a fifth component, RBANS Semantic Fluency. Composite score is determined from its components using an established normalization method. Each of the component change scores is divided by the baseline sample standard deviation of that component, to form standardized z-scores. Z-score implies how many standard deviations higher or lower the score is compared with baseline score. Composite score is a sum of z-scores for component scores. A change of 1 baseline standard deviation on each component would correspond to a 4-point change on the composite.</description>
