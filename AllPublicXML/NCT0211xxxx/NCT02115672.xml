  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to test the safety and efficacy of BL-8040 (a CXCR4 antagonist) in
      improving the response to imatinib in CML patients not achieving an optimal response with
      imatinib alone.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To improve cytogenetic and molecular response of CML patients receiving Imatinib, who have
      not achieved an optimal response according to European LeukemiaNet (ELN) definitions , or MR4
      after 24 months with Imatinib. This will be achieved by addition of the CXCR4 antagonist
      BL-8040, mobilizing CML leukemia stem cells from their protective bone marrow niche and
      exposing them to Imatinib and BL-8040-mediated apoptosis.

    <description>Patients with chronic phase CML on Imatinib therapy (400 mg/day) achieving less than an optimal response will be treated with sc injections of BL-8040, while continuing Imatinib. The first part of the study will include escalating dose groups. Up to 4 dose levels will be investigated starting at dose level 1. Patients will be accrued in a conventional 3+3 design. Applying this study design, the first cohort of 3 patients will be treated at dose level 1 (0.5 mg/kg) on Day 1, 15, 29 and 43. Patients will continue taking Imatinib 400 mg/day throughout the study. Dose escalation will continue until the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) is established and protocol specific stopping rules for toxicity are met. If no MTD is reached, dose escalation will continue up to dose level 4 (1.25 mg/kg).</description>
