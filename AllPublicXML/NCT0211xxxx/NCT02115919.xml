  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), anogenital warts are a common sexually-transmitted
      infection (STI). They are distressing to those who have them and are a source of viral
      shedding and transmission to others. Treatment of warts is aimed at destruction of the
      lesion.

      Objectives:

        1. Establish safety of Multikine in treatment of perianal condyloma.

        2. Describe presence of anal HPV and anal dysplasia in participants with perianal
           condyloma.

        3. Describe adverse effects associated with Multikine in the management of perianal
           condyloma.

      Design:

      Phase I, dose-escalation trial. Potential participants desiring treatment for their perianal
      warts will be referred to study by their primary clinician. All participants will undergo
      baseline anal Pap, anal HPV subtyping, perianal condyloma characterization (count,
      measurement, photography), and complete a baseline questionnaire. Cohort A participants will
      undergo perilesional Multikine injections (200IU) once daily, Monday through Friday, for 14
      days, off for 14 days, then again once daily, Monday through Friday for 14 days. If no
      serious adverse events are noted after 4 weeks of therapy, cohort B will be studied using the
      same schedule but with a dose of 400IU per treatment. Each participant will undergo anal Pap
      and anal HPV subtyping once weekly during treatment. Condyloma characterization (count,
      measurement, photography) will occur prior to each treatment. After treatment completed,
      participants will complete a follow-up visit at 70, 100, 130, 160 days and have anal Pap,
      anal HPV subtyping, and perianal condyloma characterization (count, measurement, photography)
      performed.

      Subjects:

      The study will be open to adult men and women who are HIV-infected who receive medical care
      from the Naval Medical Center San Diego.

      Main Outcome Measures:

        1. Perianal wart characterization [count, measurement (in millimeters diameter)],
           photography)

        2. HPV subtype in anal canal

        3. Anal dysplasia cytologic grade

        4. Questionnaire responses

        5. Adverse effects experienced during treatment, recorded in symptom log
