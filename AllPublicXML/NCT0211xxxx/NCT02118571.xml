  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to develop items for a patient-reported outcome (PRO)
      measure to assess the patient's perspective and subjective experience of cognitive impairment
      associated with schizophrenia (CIAS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS) has been shown to be the strongest
      predictor of functional impairment among people with schizophrenia because it is associated
      with poor response to psychosocial interventions, employment status, and social functioning.
      Because the subjective experience of CIAS is likely to be associated with patient burden,
      distress, and motivation for treatment, it is important that this experience be assessed in a
      reliable and valid manner and from the perspective of the patient's self report. No existing
      instrument to assess CIAS has been developed with patient input directly about their
      qualitative experience of impaired cognition during the item generation stage, in accordance
      with FDA guidance for patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with established diagnoses of schizophrenia (confirmed by the Structured
             Clinical Interview for DSM-IV [full version or Clinical Trial version] either
             performed as part of the study screening process or as documented in the medical
             record within 2 years prior to the study) with the following clinical features:

               -  a)Clinically stable and in the residual (non-acute) phase of their illness for at
                  least 8 weeks

               -  b)Maintained on current antipsychotic and concomitant psychotropic medications
                  for at least 6 weeks and on current dose for at least 2 weeks

               -  c)Have no more than a ''moderate'' severity rating on hallucinations and
                  delusions (e.g. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] item scores &lt; 5

               -  d)Have no more than a ''moderate'' severity rating on positive formal thought
                  disorder (e.g. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] conceptual
                  disorganization item score &lt; 5)

               -  e)Have no more than a ''moderate'' severity rating on negative symptoms (e.g.,
                  Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-negative syndrome total score &lt; 21)

               -  f) Have no more than a minimal level of depressive symptoms (e.g. Calgary
                  Depression Scale total score &lt; 10); or, for eligibility for a waiting list, have
                  a moderate level of depressive symptoms (e.g., Calgary Depression Scale total
                  score between 10 and 15)

          2. Male or female patients age 18 to 55 years

             participate meaningfully in a semi-structured interview, in the clinical judgment of
             the investigator

          3. Any suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 in the C-SSRS in the past 3 months (i.e. active
             suicidal thought with intent but without specific plan, or active suicidal thought
             with plan and intent)

          4. Non-psychiatric disorders of the central nervous system (including but not limited to
             any kind of seizures, stroke, or traumatic brain injury)

          5. Any other clinical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
