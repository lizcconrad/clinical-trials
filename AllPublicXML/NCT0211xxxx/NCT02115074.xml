  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optico-chiasmatic gliomas have therapeutic feature since surgical resection plays a secondary
      role. Unlike other sites, many of these tumors are not amenable to complete resection either
      because of anatomical location, and sometimes they only can be biopsied. A substantial number
      of children will have recurrences following resection or will experience progression
      following incomplete tumor removal or biopsy.

      Celebrex is a Cox-2 inhibitor with anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor properties, while statins
      are known to increase the sensitivity of gliomas to anti-tumor agents. Their association
      could be administered for long periods, in the hope of much reduced risk of toxicities.

      This is a national, multicentric, interventional, open-label, non-comparative, and
      non-randomized phase I study evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of the Fluvastatin in
      combination with fixed-dose of Celebrex.

      This project involves 10 SFCE health centers accustomed to phase I / II studies(Société
      Française de Lutte contre les Cancers et Leucémies de l'Enfant et de l'Adolescent - French
      Society for the Fight against Cancer and Leukemia in Children and Adolescents).

      Method : the total number of patients and the number of dose levels tested will depend upon
      the safety data that occurred in the previous level. A minimum of two patients will be
      included in each dose level. The second patient will be included after a sufficient time to
      assess the absence of dose-limiting toxicity in the first patient level, or within 3 weeks of
      treatment. The first cycle of the first patient must be monitored before proposing transition
      to the next level.

      Dose escalation : the safety data for each dose level will be reviewed and discussed before
      the transition to the next level. An IDMC will meet at the end the dose escalation step, and
      will decide the possibility of extending the study to 14 additional patients at a dose level
      set below the maximum tolerated dose.
