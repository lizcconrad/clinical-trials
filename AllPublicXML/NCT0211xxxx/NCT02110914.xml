  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment burden for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is significant and poor adherence
      has been well-documented. The investigators hypothesize that a coaching intervention will
      empower young adults with CF to manage their lives with CF and improve health-related quality
      of life (HRQoL). The main aim of the study is to establish the feasibility and acceptability
      of a life-coaching intervention.

    <description>The primary effect outcome is change in health-related quality of life (HRQoL), with special focus on the two domains: Social and Emotional functioning on the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R).
For the intervention group HRQoL is measured at baseline, midway (after 5 coaching sessions), post intervention (after 10 coaching sessions) and at follow up (12 months post intervention) For the control group HRQoL is measured at baseline, midway (after 4 months), post intervention (after 9 months) and at follow up (12 months post intervention)</description>

    <description>Coaching is based on the principles of the Co-active coaching model and performed by a certified coach. At the first coaching session the coach and client will make an agreement about the format for subsequent coaching sessions. The first and the last coaching session will always be &quot;face to face&quot; at the hospital and last 1- 1½ hours. Intervening coaching sessions will be approximately 60 minutes by phone or face to face. In total, ten coaching sessions will be offered, one every 1-2 weeks early in the program and one every 2-4 weeks later in the process. The duration of the coaching intervention will be between 6 and 9 months.</description>
