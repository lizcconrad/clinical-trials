  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies gene expression analysis and fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)
      positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in evaluating treatment
      response in patients with rectal cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes
      undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy before surgery. Studying samples of tissue in
      the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) and may also help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment before surgery.
      PET-MRI is a procedure that combines the pictures from a PET scan and an MRI scan. The
      combined scans give more detailed pictures of areas inside the body than either scan gives by
      itself. PET-MRI may help determine how well people respond to pre-surgery chemotherapy and
      radiation therapy and help the surgeon make the best plan for removal of the tumor.

          -  Candidate for neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

          -  Clinical evidence of T1-3N1 or T3N0 disease. This can be either by imaging studies or
             by physical exam findings.

             conditions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant.

          -  Past history of pelvic radiotherapy.
