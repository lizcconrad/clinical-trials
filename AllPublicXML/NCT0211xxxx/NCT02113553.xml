    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, prospective study willing to evaluate AMH levels changes in response
      to chemotherapy plus GnRHa.

      In the present study we propose to determine AMH levels in breast cancer patients, aged
      &lt;40yrs receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and ovarian suppression by means of GnRHa with the aim
      to assess the role of AMH as surrogate marker of the preservation of ovarian reserve exerted
      by GnRHa.

  <detailed_description>

      Patients will receive 4 to 8 cycles of chemotherapy according to Institutional guidelines.
      Triptorelin 3.75 will be administered as an intramuscular injection before chemotherapy and
      every 28 days thereafter for all the duration of chemotherapy in patients with ER negative
      tumors and for 2 to 5 years in patients with ER positive tumors according to Institutional
      guidelines. Patients with ER+ve tumour will receive tamoxifen for 5 years at the end of
      chemotherapy as standard care. A blood sample will be drawn after signed informed consent to
      determine baseline AMH levels. A blood sample for determination of AMH levels will be
      collected at the end of chemotherapy and at 12 months after the end of chemotherapy.
