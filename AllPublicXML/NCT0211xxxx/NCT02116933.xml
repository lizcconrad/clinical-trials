    <textblock>
      Grafting of autologous stromal cell trial is a prospective study comparing routine fat
      grafting versus stromal vascular fraction enriched fat grafting.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to objectively compare outcomes between autologous fat grafting
      breast augmentation and stromal vascular fraction enhanced autologous fat grafting for
      cosmetic breast augmentation in a carefully designed study.

      Patients will be given the option of participating in one of two studies:

        1. A small, level I study will compare AFG to SVF-enriched AFG in the same patient. One
           breast will be treated with AFG alone (control) and the other breast with SVF-enriched
           AFG (experimental).

        2. A larger, level II study comparing AFG to SVF-enriched AFG in different patients. The
           patient will either receive AFG alone in both breasts or SVF-enhanced AFG in both
           breasts.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must consent in writing to participate in the study by signing and dating an
             informed consent document indicating that the patient has been informed of all
             pertinent aspects of the study prior to completing any of the screening procedures.

          -  Female of any race, age 21-65.

          -  Patients must desire a small breast augmentation with a ½-1 cup size increase in their
             breast volume. (If they wish to have a larger breast size increase, then they must
             understand a secondary procedure may be required to achieve that size increase).

          -  Patients must have a normal physical exam with no breast masses, no nipple discharge,
             no fibrocystic disease, no axillary adenopathy and/or history of abnormal bleeding.

          -  Patients must not be pregnant or lactating when enrolled in the study and must agree
             to have a pregnancy test (urine or blood) prior to the surgical procedure. - The
             patient should also not be trying to get pregnant during the course of the study.

          -  Patients must have a stable weight and not be fluctuating in their weight (otherwise
             this will distort volumetric measurements of breast size post operatively, making it
             impossible to determine true augmentation volume from SVF-enriched AFG).

          -  Patients must also consent to be photographed before and after the procedure and at
             the end of the study.

          -  All patients in the level I (randomized) and level II (nonrandomized) part of the
             study must also consent to undergo ultrasound imaging of the breast prior to the
             procedure and after the procedure to evaluate and treat any oil-filled cysts that may
             arise due to the procedure.

          -  All patients in the level I (randomized) and level II (nonrandomized) part of the
             study must also consent to allow their results to be included in any scientific
             research, scientific publication, or presentations at scientific meetings.

          -  All patients in the level I and level II part of the study must also consent to allow
             their photos to be used for publication in scientific journals, internet website, and
             patient educational material such as brochures, before and after photos, and patient
             education videos.

          -  All patients in the study must also agree to have mammography done when indicated
             after the procedure.

          -  All patients in the study must agree to have a biopsy of any suspicious abnormality
             seen on mammography, ultrasound, or MRI during the study.

          -  Patients must not be anemic at the time of the procedure (Hg &lt; 10). If they are anemic
             at the time of enrollment, they can still be included in the study if the anemia is
             corrected pre-operatively with iron supplementation. This must be continued during the
             study to avoid any adverse reporting that may not be related to the procedure (i.e.
             anemia not caused by SVF-enriched fat grafting)

          -  Patients must have no history of abnormal bleeding during surgery, bruising and no
             personal/family history of coagulopathy.

          -  Patients must be off aspirin and other NSAIDs for two weeks prior to the procedure and
             have a normal blood coagulation panel within two weeks of surgery: Pts &gt; 150K, PT(INR)
             &lt; 1.3, APTT &lt;1.3×control.

          -  Patients must have normal renal function (demonstrated by a Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl,)
             and no urinary tract infection (less than 5 WBCs on UA and leukocyte esterase negative
             on U/A Dipstick). If a UTI is present, the patient may still enroll if this is treated
             pre-operatively

          -  If a multigenerational family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer is present, a
             surgical or medical oncologist must evaluate the patient to obtain pre-operative
             clearance and to provide reassurance that they do not need BRCA testing.

          -  Patients with prior radiation to the chest wall (for Hodgkin's disease) may not be
             included in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a positive pregnancy test

          -  Patients with an abnormal breast exam

          -  Patients with a bleeding disorder who are on anticoagulants

          -  Patients unwilling to have mammographic testing done before and after the procedure

          -  Patients with Fibromyalgia, regional pain syndrome, or chronic fatigue.

          -  Patients with positive human immunodeficiency (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C

          -  Patients with a positive urinalysis for pregnancy or UTI.

          -  Patients whose diabetes is not adequately controlled (HgA1c &gt; 7).

          -  Patients with a history of local anesthetic allergy.

             Cyclosporin A or azathioprine within the past six weeks

          -  Research participants on anticoagulants that cannot be stopped or corrected. Use of
             biologics, e.g. TNF-inhibitors, such as adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, including
