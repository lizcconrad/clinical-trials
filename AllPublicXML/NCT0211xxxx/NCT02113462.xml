  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Triglycerides (TG) to High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio is a feature of
      insulin resistance and an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk. The investigators
      aimed to evaluate the relationship between TG/HDL-C ratio and the endothelial functions in
      patients with CKD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is substantially increased in subjects with chronic kidney
      disease (CKD).The reasons for the elevated risk of CVD in patients with CKD are not fully
      elucidated. There is not a good prognostic tool for the prediction of increased
      cardiovascular risk in CKD. A simple, widely available, relatively inexpensive, and generally
      reproducible marker to predict the CVD risk in subjects with CKD is needed.

      The Triglycerides (TG) to High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio is a feature of
      insulin resistance and an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk. No study has been
      performed so far, to evaluate the role of TG/HDL ratio to predict the CVD risk in patients
      with CKD.

      This study is designed to evaluate the relationship between TG/HDL-C ratio and the
      endothelial functions in patients with CKD.

    <description>The COX analysis was performed in order to establish which covariates were independent predictors of cardiovascular outcomes. Kaplan Meier survival curves are generated to show the impact of the TG/HDL ratio on the cumulative survival of the cohort. The predictive power of the median TG/HDL ratio in each CKD stage for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events are measured.</description>
