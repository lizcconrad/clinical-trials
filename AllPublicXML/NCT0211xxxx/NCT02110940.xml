      This clinical trial is the first study to apply neurodynamic mobilization, a nervous system
      specific therapeutic exercise, on patients with rheumatoid arthritis(RA). Objective of the
      study is to find out the effect of neurodynamic mobilization for joint inflammation in
      patients with RA.

    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by generalized
      joints inflammation. With increasing investigation on the pathology, the treatment focus on
      the conditions shifted from a musculoskeletal point of view to a systemic approach. The
      awareness of holistic treatment was also increased.

      Latest studies have found out the neurogenic inflammatory mechanism played an important role
      in the inflammatory process of RA, the pathological changes of neural tissues in RA were also
      noted.

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Rheumatoid Arthritis Pain Scale (RAPS) will be used to rate the severity of the pain in subjects with RA; before, between and after the experimental period. The questionnaire consists of 24 items with a scale from 0-6 to quantify the severity of the Rheumatoid Arthritis
The test will be conducted in the baseline, at 4th week, and the end of the investigation at 8th week.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>C-reactive protein (CRP) test</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>C-reactive protein (CRP) is one of the most widely used measurements to indicate the severity of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. The choice of CRP is due to its cost effectiveness, reliability and reproducibility.
The test will be coducted by nurses, a 3cc blood sample will be taken from the subject and sent to the laboratory to investigate the C-reactive protein level. The test will be conducted in the baseline, at 4th week, and the end of the investigation at 8th week.</description>

    <description>The experimental group will be given three neurodynamic mobilization exercises which focus more on lower limbs and the major innervating cutaneous nerves - saphenous nerve, sciatica nerve and femoral nerve.
Subjects will be instructed to practice everyday, each action repeat for 10 times.</description>

    <description>The mobilization exercise is conducted with 10 repetitions for each action, the action is hold for 5 seconds when subjects had the stretch feeling. The series of exercise is told to perform 2 sets a day, daily practice.
Subjects' conditions will be reviewed at the end of 4th and 8th week. An exercise log book will be provided for each subject to record down the compliance of the exercise.</description>
