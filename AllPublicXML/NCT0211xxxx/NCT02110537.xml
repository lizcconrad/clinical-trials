  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on prevention of atrial
      fibrillation (AF) recurrence after electrical cardioversion (EC) for persistent AF patients
      resistant to the antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, participant and assessor blinded, randomized,
      sham-controlled clinical trial with 2 parallel arms. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      acupuncture, a total of 80 persistent AF participants will be recruited and randomly assigned
      to active acupuncture and sham acupuncture group. Both group commonly take antiarrhythmic
      medication during study period. These patients who are resistant to drug therapy will get a
      electrical cardioversion. After cardioversion, the recurrence rate and duration of atrial
      fibrillation free time will be evaluated.

      This trial consists of 2 weeks of observation and medical therapy, 2 weeks of acupuncture
      intervention before EC, EC and acupuncture intervention, 7 weeks of additional intervention,
      and 5 weeks of follow-up. After randomization, participants receive 10 sessions of
      acupuncture treatments over 10 weeks. The outcome is assessed at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 16 week
      after randomization.

    <description>All participants and practitioners are taught to report any AEs. If there are any AEs, the following items are recorded by practitioners at each visit and appropriate actions are taken: type of AEs, occurrence date, lost date, frequency of occurrence, severity, causality with the treatment, actions taken with the acupuncture intervention, and actions taken to the participants. Serious AEs, i.e. death or life-threatening events which are required urgent intervention, will be noted to the principal investigators immediately and determine whether the participants are dropped out.</description>

    <intervention_name>Active Acupuncture</intervention_name>
    <description>Active acupuncture treatment group consists of electroacupuncture (EA) and intradermal acupuncture (IDA). For EA treatment, unilateral PC5, PC6, ST36, and ST37 are chosen. Disposable, sterile needles and low frequency electrical stimulator (ES-160, ITO, Japan) are used. Each needle is inserted to the depth of 2 ± 0.5 cm with a 90 degree angle. Thereafter, needles are connected with the pole and electrical stimulation is applied with 2Hz, continuous wave current for 20 minutes. For IDA treatment, bilateral HT7 and TF4 are selected. Disposable, sterile, sticker-type needles (0.18 mm x 1.3 mm x 1.5mm) are used. Attached needles are maintained as long as possible.</description>

    <description>For sham intervention, nonacupuncture points are used. As with active treatment group, two types of acupuncture, sham EA and sham IDA, compose the sham intervention. Electrical acupuncture is connected but electrical stimulation is not given to sham acupuncture group.</description>
