    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and safety of Daratumumab in
      Japanese participants with relapsed (the return of a medical problem) or refractory (not
      responding to treatment) multiple myeloma (cancer of plasma cells in bone marrow,
      characterized by the presence of abnormal proteins in the blood).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label (all participants and study personnel will know the identity of
      the study treatments) and multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites) study in Japanese
      participants. The study will include a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, and a Follow-up
      Phase. The Treatment Phase consists of 2 parts: intense dosing regimen and less intense
      dosing regimen. Follow-up phase will be until 8 weeks after last dose
      administration/death/lost to follow up/consent withdrawal for study participation or study
      end, whichever occurs first. The primary endpoints will be Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLTs) and
      overall Adverse Events (AEs) profiling. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.

    <description>The Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) are based on drug-related adverse events and defined as any of the following events: Infusion-related reactions, non-hematologic toxicity of Grade 3 or higher, or hematologic toxicity.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants affected by Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 4 Weeks after the last dose of study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until disease progression, unmanageable adverse event or death, whichever occurs first, up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Overall Response rate is defined according to Internal Myeloma Working Group criteria based on participants achieving greater than or equal to (&gt;=) partial Response, including participants achieving stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), and partial response (PR). Percentage of participants with overall response will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Time to Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until first documented response or up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Time to response is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the date of the first documentation of observed response.</description>
