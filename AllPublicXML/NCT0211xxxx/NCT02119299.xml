      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that (1) we will observe at least 40% of the
      subjects in the Per Protocol population having a measured ≥5% weight loss at 16 weeks
      compared to week 0; and (2) the observed mean % Total Body Weight Loss at 16 weeks compared
      to Week 0 is ≥4% in the Per Protocol population.

          -  Subject agrees to sign a behavioral contract describing that they understand the
             mechanism by which the device reduces food intake, that they will use the device
             during all meals and eating episodes (including snacks and while consuming
             sugar-sweetened liquids), that they will properly care for the device and that they
             will attend all study visits.

          -  Subject is fully ambulatory.

          -  Subject has normal condition, anatomy and function of the oral cavity as self-reported
             and confirmed by the trained health care provider.

             fitting and wearing the device: oral deformity, upper arch removable partial dentures,
             inadequate oral anatomy (e.g., 3 or more loose or missing teeth on the upper arch,
             molars or pre-molars either missing or worn down to within 4 mm above gum line, teeth
             with excessive convexity or undercuts that will make placement and removal of the
             device difficult, an oro-nasal fistula secondary to cleft palate, or a large torus
             palatinus), veneers, temporary crowns or recently placed osteointegrated dental
             implants, and any fixed orthodontic appliances (e.g., braces).

          -  Subject is unable to complete the mold-making process.

          -  Subject is currently involved in another clinical trial or intends to participate in

          -  Subjects are excluded if they report the following eating patterns that are less
             likely to be helped by the SMART device; diagnosis of night eating syndrome* (wakened
             by hunger and desire to eat at night); diagnosis of sleep eating* (unconscious eating
             while asleep); self-report of consumption of 32 or more ounces of sugar-sweetened
             beverages per day; self-report of extremely slow eating, such that family members and
             friends remark on the trait; self-report of a grazing eating pattern, defined as
             eating or snacking in more than 6 episodes per day.
