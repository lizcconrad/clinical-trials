  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of renal function and dialysis techniques
      on the percentage of senescent T lymphocytes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The immunosenescence is a complex and profound remodeling of the immune system during life.
      It is mainly due to thymic involution and repeated antigenic stimulation. Kidney disease is
      associated with a decrease in adaptive immunity as evidenced by the decrease in vaccine
      response and increased susceptibility to infections, similar to those observed in the elderly
      population.

      However, data on aging of the immune system in chronic kidney disease remains incomplete.
      Furthermore, the determinants of immunosenescence are not also not known. It is possible that
      &quot;uremic&quot; factors help explain the phenotypic and functional changes of lymphocytes, as
      antigenic stimuli associated with repeated bio-compatible materials used in dialysis contact.

      The purpose of this study is to describe the phenotypes of the immune system of renal and
      analyze the determinants of these changes.
