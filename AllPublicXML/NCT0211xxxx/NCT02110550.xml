      Background: no randomized controlled trial has tried to compare treatment outcomes between
      the IPS.emmax endocrowns and the IPS.emmax conventional crowns .

      Objective: to investigate the clinical performance of the IPS.emmax endocrowns and the
      IPS.emmax conventional crowns Design and setting: Parallel-groups randomized controlled trial
      on patients with one or more intensive damaged molars requiring crowning and being treated at
      the University of Damascus, Dental School in Damascus, Syria .All molars will be examined at
      the baseline assessment using a modified US Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria.

      Participants: Incoming patients to the Fixed Prosthetic and Endodontic Departments will be
      examined to find any excessively damaged molars requiring crowning. Forty patients will be
      recruited according to specific inclusion criteria. Randomization will be performed using
      computer-generated tables; allocation will be concealed using sequentially numbered opaque
      and sealed envelopes.The included 40 patients will be analyzed (age range between 20-60
      years). They will be randomly distributed into two groups with 20 patients in each group (1:1
      allocation ratio).

      Intervention: Excessively damaged and endodontically treated molars will be restored with
      IPS.emmax endocrowns or IPS.emmax crowns supported with composite core.

      Main outcome measure: marginal adaptation and anatomic form will be investigated clinically
      and by apical radiographs at the baseline assessment using the modified (USPHS) at six
      assessment times during an 18-month observation period.

      Assessor blinding will be employed.
