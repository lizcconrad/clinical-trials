  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a naturally occurring gas that readily diffuses across body tissues
      and membranes. Data from earlier clinical studies conducted in 975 subjects with allergic
      rhinitis have shown that nasally administered CO2 may provide relief of the associated
      symptoms. Symptom relief has been shown to occur as soon as 10 minutes after administration,
      and may persist for four to six hours.

      This study aims to assess the consumer appeal of a prototype CO2 delivery device, as well as
      evaluate its perceived effectiveness for nasal congestion. Properly consented subjects who
      qualify and choose to participate in the clinical study will be administered nasal CO2 under
      medical supervision, wait a period of 1 hour in clinic, and then be dispensed a device for
      self-treatment at home. Subjects will return to the clinic on day 7 for final evaluation and
      completion of assessment questionnaires.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two parts. In the first part of the study, recruited subjects
      with nasal congestion will view a description of a new treatment option (concept). Interested
      subjects will be offered the opportunity to enter the clinical trial. Subjects who consent
      and are found otherwise eligible will then receive one dose of CO2 in the study clinic under
      medical supervision. Afterward, subjects who wish to continue will be allowed to take the
      administration device home for an additional six days of use (study part 2).

      During the at-home use portion of the study, subjects will use a diary to record the number
      of times the product was used and their nasal congestion symptoms before and after use.

      At the end of the study period, subjects will return to the study center for global
      assessment of their impressions of treatment and to answer questions designed to estimate
      market acceptability. Subjects may be asked to participate voluntarily in a market research
      focus group following their participation in this study.

    <description>There was one questionnaire used in this study which was divided into 3 parts: screening survey, after product trial questions, and at home usage experience. This question was asked after at-home use of the product. Participants could select only one option. It was done to compare the spray with the product selected by the participant in Q1. There were 11 points between the two products that participants could divide anyways thet wanted (11-0, 10-1, 9-2, 8-3, 7-4 or 6-5 etc). The more the participant liked a product compared to other, the higher the number of points were to be given to that product.</description>

        <title>Divide 11 Points Between Two Products (CO2 Nasal Spray and Brand Selected at Q1)?</title>
        <description>There was one questionnaire used in this study which was divided into 3 parts: screening survey, after product trial questions, and at home usage experience. This question was asked after at-home use of the product. Participants could select only one option. It was done to compare the spray with the product selected by the participant in Q1. There were 11 points between the two products that participants could divide anyways thet wanted (11-0, 10-1, 9-2, 8-3, 7-4 or 6-5 etc). The more the participant liked a product compared to other, the higher the number of points were to be given to that product.</description>

        <population>The per protocol (PP) population was the primary population for analysis. Of the 143 participants who completed this study, 10 participants had device failure (device that did not perform well), and therefore 133 participants were included in PP population.</population>
