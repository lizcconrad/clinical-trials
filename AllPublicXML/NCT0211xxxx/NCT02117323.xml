  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective observational study on corneal opacities in infants and children (1 month to 18
      years old) will be conducted at CHLA. Most of these cases will be due to congenital corneal
      opacity (e.g. Peter's anomaly, mucopolysacharidoses) or scarring due to infectious keratitis.
      Sixty (60) subjects will be recruited. The children will be examined under anesthesia with a
      portable slit-lamp and OCT. An iVue OCT system (Optovue) attached to an operating
      microscope-style mount at CHLA will be used for the intraoperative scans. Both
      cross-sectional and 3-D OCT scans will be performed to assess opacity depth, pachymetry map,
      endothelial defects, and any abnormal adhesion between the cornea, iris and lens. The
      anterior chamber angle will also be imaged with cross-sectional OCT to assess angle depth,
      trabecular meshwork, Schwalbe's line, and possible peripheral iridocorneal adhesion or
      posterior embryotoxon. OCT of the crystalline lens will be obtained to assess the presence of
      cataract. Slit-lamp photography will be obtained, and gonioscopy will be performed if
      indicated. Corneal diameter will be measured with a caliper, and intraocular pressure will be
      measured with a tonopen (Reichert).
