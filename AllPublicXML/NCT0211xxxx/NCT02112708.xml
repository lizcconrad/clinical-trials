      Introduction: Minor psychiatric disorders are important in primary care, because of its high
      prevalence and consumption of healthcare resources generated.

      Objective: Evaluate the effectiveness of rational emotive behavioral therapy (REBT), as an
      instrument of social work intervention to enhance changes in the parameters of quality of
      life, medical consultations and drug use in patients with dysthymia.

      Design: Multicenter, prospective, not randomized clinical trial, with intervention and
      control group simultaneously in urban primary care settings and 1 year of follow up.

      Participants: Out-patients seen in two Primary Care centers diagnosed with dysthymia
      according to DSM-IV classification of American Psychiatric Association.

      Intervention: Subjects receive up to 8 biweekly individual sessions of thirty minutes of REBT
      administered by the Social Worker.

      Variables: Demographic data, educational level, coexistence, comorbidity, quality of life
      assessment, severity of depression, number of visits to the General Practitioner (GP) and
      drug consumption: sedatives / antidepressants.

      Expected Results: The expected results of the intervention, estimated from previous data,
      are:

        -  A decrease in attendance at medical visits per year

        -  An improvement in perceived quality of life, measured as values of the Quality of Life
           (QOL) questionnaire (Baker &amp; Intagliata)

        -  An improvement in severity of depression, measured according to the Beck Depression
           Inventory.

        -  A reduction of treatment with psychotropic drugs (sedatives and antidepressants).

      Potential impact expected: The investigators hope that rational emotive theory is an
      effective intervention method for handling minor psychiatric disorders in clinical social
      work.

      The calculation of the size of the population sample was performed for the worst case
      comparison of different outcome variables, so for a final ratio of 8% people taking hypnotics
      in IG versus 37% in the CG, with significance level of 5% and a statistical power of 80%,
      previewing a 20% loss to follow-up and a ratio of 1 control per case, we need 50 individuals
      in the CG and 50 individuals in the IG.

      Regarding to the attendance to primary care centers, was categorized as &quot;improved&quot; and &quot;not
      improved or remains the same.&quot; &quot;Improvement&quot; is when the number of visits decrease over the
      previous year, comparing baseline data with respect 12 months. Also, improvement in the use
      of psychotropic medication is when intakes fall in the previous year by comparing baseline
      data with respect 12 months. When no data were available at 12 months, the comparison was
      made with data collected at 4 months.

      Patients in IG were recruited from primary care center Sant Andreu, while the CG were
      enrolled in the primary care center in Martorell. The selection of the two groups in separate
      centers was determined to avoid the possible effects of contamination bias of the CBT-REBT.
      In the IG, each physician systematically derived patients with inclusion criteria to the
      social worker. In the CG, the physician made ordinary care task. In both groups, the number
      of visits to primary care centers and consumption of psychotropic drugs were extracted from
      the medical record and other information was obtained through interviews at baseline, 4 and
      12 months.

      All patients signed informed consent at baseline. In order to recruit homogeneous cases,
      clearly diagnosed and ensure comparability training for all recruiters was conducted.
      Collection forms and the database did not include confidential information to ensure
      confidentiality and anonymity, keeping a separately single list with relation to the number
      of each case.

      Access data base was used to systematize the registration data collection and handling errors
      by different professionals. Previous comparison of baseline data between completers and
      dropouts, as well as between the IG and CG was performed by Chi-square and mean comparison. A
      descriptive analysis of baseline variables as frequencies, means, and dispersion measures was
      carried out. For the analysis of post-intervention improvement in outcome parameters in one
      group compared with another, only data from the baseline and 12 months were taken into
      account. Bivariate and multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression to
      control for confounding factors. Values less than 0.05 were considered significant. The SPSS
      18 software was used.

    <time_frame>Baseline, month 4, month 12.</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) consisted of twenty-one questions about how the subject has been feeling in the last week. Each question has a set of at least four possible answer choices, ranging in intensity.
When the test is scored, a value of 0 to 3 is assigned for each answer and then the total score is compared to a key to determine the depression's severity. The standard cut-offs are as follows:
0-9: indicates minimal depression
10-18: indicates mild depression
19-29: indicates moderate depression
30-63: indicates severe depression. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in perceived quality of life, measured as values of Satisfaction with Life Domains Scale (SLDS) (Baker &amp; Intagliata, 1982) at 4 and 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, month 4, month 12.</time_frame>
    <description>The Satisfaction with Life Domains Scale (SLDS) is a measure of respondent satisfaction constructed to assess patient's satisfaction regarding 15 life domains.
The respondent is asked to indicate his/her feelings by choosing one of seven faces ranging from a &quot;delighted&quot; face with a large upturned smile (scored 7) to a &quot;terrible&quot; face with a deep frown (scored 1).
The patients are asked to pick the face that best represented their degree of satisfaction with the proposed life areas.
The last of the life areas (The place they live in currently compared with the state hospital) has been discarded for our study, because the patients were treated by primary care.</description>
