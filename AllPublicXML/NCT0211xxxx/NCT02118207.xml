  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SCUBA diving frequently involves repetitive exposures over multiple days. The goal of this
      study was to see how exercise impacts microparticles (MPs), endothelial function, and venous
      gas emboli (VGE) over a series of dives.

      16 divers in 2 groups each completed 6 dives. One group completed 3 control dives followed by
      5 days rest then 3 dives preceded by exercise. The other group completed the opposite
      protocol. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) data and blood for MP analysis was collected before
      and after each dive. VGE were monitored via transthoracic echocardiography 30, 60, and 90 min
      after surfacing. Exercise before diving consisted of 60 min running outdoors including 8x4
      min intervals at 90% VO2max effort.
