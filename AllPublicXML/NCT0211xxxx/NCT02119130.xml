  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use a cluster randomized trial to compare the effectiveness
      of linking the Quantiferon-gold in-tube test (QGIT) with routine CD4 testing to the routine
      use of the tuberculin skin test (TST), the current standard of care for diagnosing latent
      tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in South Africa. The investigators hypothesize that QGIT
      clinics will identify LTBI and initiate isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) in a higher
      proportion of patients and in a significantly faster timeframe. The cost-effectiveness of
      linking QGIT with routine CD4 compared to routine TST will also be evaluated, and the process
      of implementation of QGIT into the routine cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) blood draw will
      be evaluated using a mixed method approach to identify steps that can be modified for future
      scale-up of the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a cluster randomized trial in 16 HIV clinics in South Africa to
      compare time to determine LTBI status in patients in clinics using QGIT and TST and those
      with TST only. The investigators will take advantage of the excellent HIV services provided
      in South Africa and link QGIT with CD4 blood collection and provide the first evidence of an
      operational comparison between QGIT and TST in HIV-infected patients in a country that
      accounts for one-third of the HIV-related TB in the world. The QGIT study will contribute to
      the understanding of QGIT performance and implementation in HIV-infected individuals. Careful
      evaluation of the implementation and operational aspects of the program will provide useful
      knowledge for future scale-up in this and other HIV clinic settings.
