  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, the incidence of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) is 16 000 new
      cases/year. During these last years, many new chemotherapies and targeted therapies have been
      developed improving significantly the overall survival of patients notably anti-HER
      molecules. In inoperable recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC, the best treatment is based on an
      anti-Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) antibody, targeting Human Epidermal Growth
      Factor Receptor 1 (HER1), the Cetuximab combined with platinum +/- 5 Fluoro Uracil (5FU): &quot;
      Extreme protocol &quot;. However, no clinical or biological criteria predictive of drug efficacy
      have been reported yet. Thus, the development of such a predictive factor is an urgent need
      in HNSCC at both the clinical and pharmacy-economic level, to propose the best personalized
      treatment. One idea would be to enumerate and characterize the circulating tumor cells (CTC)
      which could give us an early evaluation of the therapeutic efficiency. In this context, the
      investigators have developed an innovative technology, the EPISPOT assay (patent of the
      University Medical Center of Montpellier), that allows the detection &amp; characterization of
      viable CTC in the peripheral blood. The EPISPOT technology has been already evaluated in the
      breast and prostate cancer.Thus, the investigators would like for the first time to perform a
      prospective study on a cohort of patients treated following the Extreme protocol, with this
      technology, to assess the predictive value of CTC count. The investigators will use the
      CellSearch® system as the reference test.

      This is a multi-centric prospective non randomized open labeled study performed on a cohort
      of patients with inoperable recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC who will be treated, with a
      first line treatment based on an anti-Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER), the
      Cetuximab.
