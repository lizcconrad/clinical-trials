  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether a combination of intensive training of
      visual-spatial abilities (LOCATO task) with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) leads to an improvement of learning and memory in healthy older adults and to examine
      the underlying neuronal mechanism.
