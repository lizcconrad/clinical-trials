    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of IL-YANG Inactivated
      Split Influenza Vaccine (IL-YANG FLU Vaccine Vial INJ.) administered as a single
      intramuscular injection

    <textblock>
      This was an open-label study. Subjects providing voluntary written informed consent underwent
      protocol-specific assessments and tests within 4 weeks prior to administration of the study
      vaccine, and those who met all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were considered
      eligible were sequentially enrolled in the study.

      Subjects enrolled in the study received 0.5ml of the study vaccine as an intramuscular
      injection in the deltoid muscle, and returned to the clinic every day for the first 3 days.
      On Day 14 post-vaccination, subjects underwent the safety assessments. On Day 28
      post-vaccination, subjects returned for safety and immunogenicity assessments.
