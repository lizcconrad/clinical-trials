    <textblock>
      This investigation proposes to examine the effectiveness of a technology supported treatment
      manual for pediatric feeding disorders. Children with pediatric feeding disorders display
      intense avoidance behaviors (e.g., crying, tantrums, and disruptions) that prevent
      appropriate nutritional intake during meals and lead to a number of negative and potentially
      life threatening medical outcomes, including chronic malnutrition, growth retardation, and
      placement of a feeding tube. To date, behavioral intervention involving extinction-based
      procedures represents the only treatment for pediatric feeding disorders supported by
      research to improve mealtime behaviors. Due to the chronic and extreme nature of food
      refusal, treatment typically requires intensive, daily intervention conducted at highly
      specialized clinics to improve feeding behaviors. The cost and duration of intervention can
      total as much as $60,000 per child requiring up to 6 to 8 weeks, respectively. The potential
      for serious consequences associated with chronic food refusal, combined with the high cost of
      treatment, intensifies the need to identify means to disseminate effective treatment
      approaches to the broader community of healthcare providers.

      The proposed study represents the first attempt to systematically investigate the use of a
      treatment manual to address chronic food aversion through a randomized, waitlist control
      trial in children treated at the Marcus Autism Center's Pediatrics Feeding Disorders Program.
      This study will involve a total of 20 participants randomly assigned to experimental
      conditions: technology supported treatment manual or waitlist control group (10 in each
      group). Children assigned to the waitlist control group will receive the technology supported
      treatment manual after the specified time on the waitlist. All participants will receive the
      same behavioral protocol involving three treatment sessions per day (45 minutes in length),
      for a total of 15 sessions across five consecutive days. Data will be collected on feeding
      behaviors during each treatment session and at follow-up using trained observers to collect
      data on mealtime behaviors, including acceptance, swallowing, disruption, expulsion, and
      grams consumed. This type of data collection and treatment is standard practice in the
      feeding disorders program; however, the use of a touch screen application for data capture
      with integrated manual is novel to this project.

    <description>Behavioral ratings will document such variables as acceptance, mouth clean, combined inappropriate behavior, expulsions, and grams consumed. Data on each of these variables will be collected on computers using an event-recording program built into the computerized manual. Acceptance will be scored when a child takes one or more bites independently every 30 seconds or allows the entire bite of food to be deposited in his/her mouth within 5 seconds of the initial presentation. A mouth clean will be scored when the child swallows all the food within 30 seconds. Data will also be collected on combined inappropriate mealtime behaviors, which are defined as head turns and disruptions. Expulsions will be defined as the presence of food greater than the size of a pea visible outside the mouth after the bite enters the child's mouth.</description>

    <measure>Parenting Stress Index- Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The PSI-SF is a screening instrument designed to provide an indication of the overall level of parenting stress an individual is experiencing through self-report. It is comprised of three subscales of 12 items each: Parental Distress (PD), Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction (P-CDI), and Difficult Child (DC). It has been used in pediatric samples and has exhibited high internal reliability.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participants must demonstrate failure to meet appropriate nutritional and/or energy needs
        based on DSM-V criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) for Avoidant/Restrictive
        Food Intake Disorder, focusing exclusively on children with dependence on enteral feeding
        or oral supplementation with a nutritionally complete formula. Specifically, participants
        must have a history of food refusal as evidenced by tube, formula, or bottle dependence,
        receiving at least 50% of their nutritional needs from this method of intake. In order to
        be considered eligible, participants will need to meet the following inclusion criteria: 1)
        Present with partial food refusal as evidenced by greater than 50% of caloric needs met by
        bottle, formula, or tube feedings; 2) Have a medical history significant for an organic
        factor (e.g., gastrointestinal issues) which precipitated or played a role in the
        development of feeding concern; 3) Fall between the ages of 12 months and 6 years, which
        will ensure a sample of children appropriate for the introduction of solid food; and 4)
        Patients must be English literate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The following will be considered ineligible to participate in the study: 1) Patients with
        active medical diagnoses requiring hospitalization or significant oversight from a
        physician; and 2) Patients with active medical, structural, or functional limitations
        preventing safe oral intake of pureed foods (e.g., aspiration, upper airway obstruction).
