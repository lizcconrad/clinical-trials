  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety of a chemotherapy drug called
      docetaxel and focused radiation therapy (SBRT) and see what effects (good and bad) it has on
      recurrent head and neck cancer that is not surgically removable.
