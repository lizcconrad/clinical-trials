      First-in-human study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single and

  <detailed_description>

      This is a 2-part study to be conducted at a single study center. Part 1 is a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of CC-90001 following a single oral dose in healthy subjects. During the
      course of Part 1, each subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase, a
      treatment phase and a follow up visit. There will be a total of 7 planned cohorts, each of
      which will consist of a different dose level, with 8 subjects per cohort. In each cohort, 6
      subjects will receive a dose of CC 90001 and 2 subjects will receive placebo depending on the
      randomization schedule. Administration of study drug at the next higher dose level will not
      begin until the safety and tolerability of the preceding dose have been evaluated and deemed
      acceptable by the investigator and sponsor's medical monitor. Part 2 is a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of CC-90001 following multiple oral doses in healthy subjects. Only doses
      that are safe and well tolerated in Part 1 will be administered in Part 2. During the course
      of Part 2, each subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase, a treatment
      phase and a follow up visit. There will be a total of up to 6 planned cohorts, each of which
      will consist of a different dose level, with 8 subjects per cohort. In each cohort, 6
      subjects will receive a dose of CC 90001 and 2 subjects will receive placebo depending on the
      randomization schedule. It is planned for study drug to be administered once daily for up to
      14 days. Proposed dose levels in Part 2 may be modified and/or eliminated based on data
      obtained from Part 1; however, the maximum dose administered in Part 2 will not exceed the
      maximum tolerated dose in Part 1.

             [for example, latex or polyurethane condoms are acceptable]) when engaging in sexual
             activity with a female of childbearing potential while on study medication, and for at
             least 28 days after the last dose of study medication.

        bilateral oophorectomy; proper documentation required) at least 6 months before screening,
        or be postmenopausal (defined as 24 months without menses before screening, with an
