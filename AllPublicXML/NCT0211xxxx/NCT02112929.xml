  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to use hyperpolarized xenon gas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      computed tomography to develop a new technique capable of objectively and quantitatively
      describing regional and structural lung abnormality. Since this is a relatively novel
      technique, the investigators first need to acquire imaging and clinical data from a group of
      participants with normal lungs. The investigators hope to generate an &quot;atlas&quot; of normality,
      which will form the foundation of future studies to compare with patients suffering from
      chronic respiratory disease. The investigators also aim to validate the new technique in
      terms of intra-subject reproducibility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the gold standard for assessment of lung function in chronic respiratory disease
      is spirometry. This is combined with anatomical imaging (chest x-ray and computed tomography)
      for structural assessment. Spirometry only measures global lung function. It provides no
      information regarding the different regions of the lung or about the supporting &quot;framework&quot;
      of the lung itself, the parenchyma. In addition, changes in lung function as measured with
      spirometric indices do not correlate coherently with the symptoms experienced by patients,
      nor reflect their decline in health. This weak relationship is probably because the lung is a
      complex regional organ where localized disturbances of a variety of factors including gas
      flow (ventilation), blood flow (perfusion) and gas transfer all combine to impair respiratory
      function.

      MRI has the advantage of being an imaging technique free from ionizing radiation making it
      safe and practical for diseases such as asthma and obstructive lung disease where repeated
      follow-up scans are necessary. Hyperpolarized xenon, in the doses given for imaging has been
      shown to be safe. Conventional MRI has limited use in respiratory disease, because the lung
      is largely composed of air spaces that do not generate an MR signal. Hyperpolarized noble
      gases can resolve this problem.
