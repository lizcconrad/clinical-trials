  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Damage and scarring of a transplanted kidney has become the most common cause of loss of the
      transplanted kidney. This kidney damage is a complex process caused by many factors including
      injury during obtaining and transplanting the kidney, injury from the immune system, injury
      from infections, and injury from drugs used to stop rejection. This injury leads to scars
      that decrease the kidney's ability to function properly, and over time the kidney is lost.
      Prograf® (tacrolimus) has been one of the main drugs used to prevent rejection. However, when
      used over time it has been shown to cause chronic damage and scarring in the transplanted
      kidney.

      The purpose of this experimental study is to determine whether children can safely be
      withdrawn from Prograf® after transplantation and changed to Rapamycin® (sirolimus). Recent
      research studies in adult transplantation have demonstrated that with the use of Rapamycin®
      (sirolimus), it is possible to discontinue the use of Prograf (tacrolimus) with no increase
      in rejection, with decreased scarring in the kidney, and with improvements in kidney function
      and survival of the kidney. A total of 50 children will enroll in this study at university
      centers around the country. This study will last about 3 years.

      Advances in immunosuppressive therapies in pediatrics have been associated with rapidly
      falling incidence of acute rejection and improving allograft survival. In recent analyses of
      the NAPRTCS database, acute rejection is no longer the most common cause of hospitalization
      or allograft failure. Chronic rejection has now become the most common cause of allograft
      failure and accounts for over 35% of allograft loss. Chronic rejection is a complex clinical
      condition that includes both immunologic and non-immunologic causes and is more accurately
      referred to as Chronic Allograft Nephropathy (CAN). Although Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI)
      have played a central role in reducing acute rejection and improving allograft survival, it
      has long been shown that they contribute to interstitial fibrosis and chronic allograft
      nephropathy. Recent trials in adult transplantation have demonstrated that with the use of
      the TOR-inhibitor, Sirolimus, it is possible to withdraw Calcineurin inhibitors with no
      increase in rejection and with improvements in allograft function, interstitial fibrosis and
      long term survival (1). We hypothesize that the use of Sirolimus (SRL) in pediatric kidney
      transplantation will allow the withdrawal of Calcineurin inhibitor and improved kidney
      function and long term survival. We plan to enroll 50 patients at the time of
      transplantation. Patients will receive routine immunosuppression of CNI (Prograf),
      Mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept) and prednisone. Those patients with normal function and no
      rejection episodes after 6 months of transplantation will undergo a slow conversion from
      Prograf to Sirolimus (Rapamune). We will then assess the rate of rejection, allograft
      function, fibrosis on biopsy, and allograft survival over the following 18 months.
