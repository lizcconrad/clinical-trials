  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is to examine the role of serotonin on the cognitive parameters
      of motivation. They are embedded in a conceptual framework of motivation that merges
      decision-making and reinforcement learning theories. Every action is conceived as path from
      one state to another. The different states are associated to different values (positive for
      rewards and negative for punishments), and the different actions to different costs (risk,
      effort and delay). The tasks are designed such that the sensitivity to the state and action
      parameters can be inferred by fitting computational models.The primary objective is to
      characterize the effect of Citalopram 30mg on reward sensitivity, assessed in an incentive
      force task, in which participants are asked to squeeze a hand grip to win monetary rewards.
      Secondary objectives are to characterize the effect of Citalopram 30mg on other cognitive
      parameters of motivation (assessed with a motivational battery that includes rating, choice
      and learning tasks).

    <description>Apathy will be assessed as the sensitivity to rewards in an incentive force task.
The primary Outcome measure is the change in this parameter between the placebo condition and the Citalopram condition.</description>
