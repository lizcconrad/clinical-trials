    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome(PFPS) is one of the most common health-related complaints in
      today's societies. Myofascial pain syndrome(MPS) have been attributed as the main cause and
      primary source of musculoskeletal pain. Trigger point of the vastus lateralis muscle may pull
      the patella superiorly and laterally, increasing compression of the patellofemoral joint
      during physical activities, result in PFPS and anterior knee pain. The purpose of this study
      was to investigate the effects of Dry Needling &amp; kinesio tape on trigger point of vastus
      lateralis muscle in PFPS subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of a palpable taut band in muscle.

          2. Presence of a hypersensitive tender spot in the taut band.

          3. Reproduction of the typical referred pain pattern of the trigger point in response to
             compression. To detect active trigger point, trigger point pressure tolerance was
             assessed using a mechanical pressure algometer. The investigator applied continuous
             pressure with the algometer with an approximate pressure of 2.5 kg/cm2.

          4. Spontaneous presence of the typical referred pain pattern and/or patient recognition
             of the referred pain as familiar.

        5- Pain of at least 30 mm on a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm
        (worst imaginable pain).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. had a history of fracture of knee joint, dislocation of patella

          2. previous knee or ankle surgery

          3. had a history of neurologic condition

          4. having physical therapy within the past month before the study

          5. pregnancy

          6. taking anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin)

          7. local infection
