  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the registry study is to demonstrate the clinical utility of the CELLSEARCH速
      CTC Test among the Medicare-Eligible metastatic Breast Cancer (mBC) patients in the United
      States. The objective of the present registry is to demonstrate the impact on patient
      management of the CELLSEARCH速 CTC Test among the Medicare-eligible mBC patients. Hereto the
      hypothesis that the availability of CTC information provides clinicians important, timely
      information and impacts treatment decisions, will be tested.

      This study is IDE-exempt since CELLSEARCH速 CTC Test is a legally marketed device in the US,
      and is being used in accordance with its labeling.
