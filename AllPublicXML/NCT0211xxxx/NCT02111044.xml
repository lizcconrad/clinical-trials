      The purpose of this study is to investigate in acromegalic patients the effect of different
      doses of ITF2984 on GH and IGF-1 concentrations and to investigate safety and tolerability of
      three different doses of ITF2984.

      The study will enroll patients with active acromegaly, de novo or partial responder to
      previous treatment with somatostatin analogues. For patients who had previously received
      medical therapy for acromegaly a washout periods before study entry of 3 months for
      long-acting formulation of somatostatin analogs, 2 weeks for octreotide sc, 2 months for
      pegvisomant and/or cabergoline must be foreseen.

      Each patient will be randomized and wll remain in the study for about 6 months, and they will
      attend a visit every two weeks.

      The patients will be treated for 4 months in a total, in particular every month of treatment
      will be followed by a washout period of 2 weeks.

      At each month of treatment the patients will receive one of the four treatment as reported
      below:

      Octreotide 100 mcg sc three times daily (t.i.d) for 4 weeks, ITF2984 500 mcg sc twice a day
      (b.i.d) for 4 weeks, ITF2984 1000 mcg sc b.i.d for 4 weeks, ITF2984 2000 mcg sc b.i.d for 4
      weeks. Patients will be randomized using a 4 way crossover design to receive ITF2984 or
      octreotide at each treatment month. Each patient will receive all of the four treatments
      overseen in this study.
