  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse occurs with descent of one or more pelvic structures: the uterus and/or
      cervix, bowel, bladder, or rectum. Although options for treatment include expectant
      management, pelvic floor physical therapy, and pessary (intravaginal device) use, surgery is
      the only option which potentially offers a cure.

      It is well known that women with pelvic organ prolapse are at risk of developing new stress
      urinary incontinence symptoms after prolapse surgery. Stress urinary incontinence is defined
      as involuntary loss of urine with an increase in intra-abdominal pressure, such as sneezing,
      coughing, or laughing. Previous studies have demonstrated that the addition of a prophylactic
      anti-incontinence procedure at the time of prolapse surgery reduces this risk. One example of
      such a procedure is a mesh sling placed underneath the urethra (midurethral sling).
      Nevertheless, the decision to place a midurethral sling to prevent stress urinary
      incontinence after prolapse surgery remains controversial.

      A new risk calculator tool has been developed to provide patients' with their individualized
      risk of developing de novo stress urinary incontinence after prolapse surgery. The primary
      objective of this study is to determine whether use of this new personalized online risk
      calculator tool increases patient satisfaction with the decision whether or not to have a
      midurethral sling placed at the time of prolapse surgery to prevent development of stress
      urinary incontinence. The investigators hypothesize that use of this tool will increase
      patient satisfaction with their decision regarding midurethral sling placement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to conduct a randomized, controlled clinical trial involving women
      with pelvic organ prolapse planning to have prolapse surgery with 1 of 4 fellowship-trained
      Urogynecologists at the National Center for Advanced Pelvic Surgery at MedStar Washington
      Hospital Center in Washington, DC. Women will be recruited prior to their preoperative
      counseling sessions during routine office visits and/or by telephone. After obtaining
      informed consent, women who agree to participate will be randomized to preoperative
      counseling sessions where an online risk calculator tool for the development of postoperative
      de novo stress urinary incontinence is or is not used. This tool is accessible at no cost
      from the following website: http://www.r-calc.com/ExistingFormulas.aspx?filter=CCQHS. At the
      time of these sessions, participants will decide whether to have a midurethral sling placed
      at the time of their prolapse repair to prevent development of stress urinary incontinence
      after surgery. After making this decision, all participants will complete the validated
      Satisfaction with Decision Scale to assess their satisfaction with their decision regarding
      midurethral sling placement. This validated 6-item self-administered questionnaire with a 5
      point response scale takes approximately 3 minutes to complete. Participants will complete
      the Satisfaction with Decision Scale a second time at the time of their 2 week postoperative
      visit. Three months after surgery, participants will complete the Satisfaction with Decision
      Scale a third time, along with other validated quality of life questionnaires.

    <description>A new online risk calculator tool has been developed to predict a woman's individual risk of developing de novo stress urinary incontinence after prolapse surgery. This validated tool has been shown to outperform preoperative prolapse reduction stress testing results and expert predictions when providing risk assessment of de novo stress urinary incontinence after vaginal prolapse surgery. After inputting individual patient characteristics, including patient age, body mass index, number of vaginal deliveries, presence or absence of urgency urinary incontinence and diabetes, and prolapse reduction stress testing results if available, this tool calculates the theoretical risk of postoperative de novo stress urinary incontinence both with and without an anti-incontinence procedure.</description>
