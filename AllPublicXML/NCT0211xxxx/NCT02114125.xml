  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators assume that there are some positive effects of cognitive training and physical
      activities on cognitive function, depression and quality of life in a sample of older
      residents in long-term care facilities.

      The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of various interventions (physical
      activity, cognitive training, integration of physical activity and cognitive training) on
      different outcome indictors in institutionalized older residents.

      1. to develop an intervention protocol that achieves clinical development objectives in a
           scientifically rigorous and time efficient manner.

        2. to further analyze the effects of the various interventions and make a comparison of
           dose-response relation and efficacy.
