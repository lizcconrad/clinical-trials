  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimization of newborns nutrition is a challenge especially for preterm newborns for
      whom nutrition plays a crucial part in cerebral and global development. Human milk is
      considered as the best food for newborns. Several short and long-term beneficial health
      effects were attributed to breastfeeding and have induced the increase of human milk in
      preterm newborns nutrition.

      Whereas the chemical composition of infant formula has been optimized to mimic human milk,
      there is still a major difference between the structure of human milk and commercial infant
      formulas. It is well known in adult nutrition that the structure of emulsions influences
      their susceptibility to hydrolysis, such results have been obtained either on in vitro or in
      vivo studies.

      Human milk is a natural emulsion (oil in water). Lipids droplets are dispersed under the form
      of entities called milk fat globules (average diameter 4 µm, span 0.1-20 μm). The globules
      are stabilized by a trilayered membrane composed mainly of polar lipids (phospholipids,
      sphingolipids and gangliosides), of proteins, neutral lipids and other minor compounds.

      The physical treatments apply to human milk or more generally to bovine milk to pasteurize or
      stabilize the milk modify the structure of the natural emulsion. Heat treatment for instance
      induces whey proteins denaturation and the adsorption of protein aggregates on the surface of
      the milk fat globules. Heat treatment also leads to the denaturation of bile salt stimulated
      lipase. These effects limit intragastric lipolysis in preterm newborns.

      Conversely, reduction of milk globules size, by homogenisation of milk, increases the
      specific surface available for lipase adsorption and limits the lost of fat during enteral
      administration of milk. Such treatment could thus enhance gastric lipolysis and improve fat
      absorption of preterm newborns.

      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effects of physical treatments (pasteurization
      and homogenisation by ultrasonication) applied to human milk on gastric lipolysis and milk
      destructuration. This trial is conducted, in vivo, on preterm newborns.

    <description>Raw human milk compared to pasteurized human milk. Two meals administration (20mL/kg) per day during 6 days in a randomized order, with an intragastric tube : one with raw milk and one with pasteurized milk.
In order to characterise gastric effluents at different postprandial times after ingestion and to measure gastric lipolysis and proteolysis, at each administration two gastric samples will be collected with the intragastric tube :
one before the meal,
and one either 35, 60 or 90 minutes (randomized time frame) after the meal.</description>
