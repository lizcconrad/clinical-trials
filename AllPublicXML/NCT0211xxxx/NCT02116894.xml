      The primary objective of this open-label phase Ib trial is to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose and the recommended phase II dose for the combination of PF-03446962 plus regorafenib in
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The secondary objectives are to describe the
      safety and tolerablility, and to describe the clinical activity of PF-03446962 plus
      regorafenib in terms of response rate and progression free survival

                  Disease (ILD), any evidence of ILD on scan.

               2. Active (acute or chronic) severe infections requiring treatment with I.V.

                  (BP) must be re-assessed three times at approximately 2-minute intervals. At
                  least 24 hours must have elapsed between anti-hypertensive medication initiation
                  or adjustment and BP measurement. These three values should be averaged to obtain

                  SBP/DBP ratio must be &lt;140/90 mmHg in order for a subject to be eligible for the
                  study.

             significantly alter the absorption of oral medications (e.g., ulcerative disease,
             uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel
             resection).

         20. History of abdominal fistula or gastrointestinal perforation at any point within 6
             months prior to day 1 of study drug, unless surgically repaired.

         21. Active peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. ulcerative colitis,
             Crohn's disease), or other gastrointestinal conditions with increased risk of
             perforation or gastrointestinal bleeding.

         22. Use or need for full dose anticoagulation other than low molecular weight heparin and
             Factor Xa inhibitors (e.g. Lovenox, Fondaparinux) and no other bleeding risk.

         24. Active bleeding diathesis.

         25. Known endobronchial lesions and/or lesions infiltrating major pulmonary vessels that
             increase the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage.

         26. Known history of HIV or Hepatitis B or C seropositivity.

         27. Female patients who are pregnant or breast feeding, or adults of reproductive
             potential who are not using effective birth control methods. Two acceptable forms of
             contraceptives must be continued throughout the trial by either sex and for 2 months
             (60 days) following last dose of either drug. Hormonal contraceptives are not
             acceptable as a sole method of contraception. (Women of childbearing potential must
             have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to day 1 of study drug).

         28. Concomitant use of CYP3A4 strong inducers and strong inhibitors. (See Appendix 7).

         29. Corrected QTc interval &gt; 500 msec. If QTc interval is &gt; 500 msec, then 2 additional
             ECGs should be obtained over a brief period of time (e.g., within 15-20 minutes) to
             confirm the abnormality. The average QTc interval will be determined from the 3 ECG
             tracings by manual evaluation and will be used to determine if the subject will be
             excluded from the study. The same method of QTc determination must be used throughout
             the subject's participation in the trial.

         30. History of Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome or Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia

         31. Patients unwilling to or unable to comply with the protocol.
