  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate decision-making using the Iowa Gambling Task
      (IGT) among patients with euthymic bipolar disorder according to their personal history of
      suicide attempt (&quot;suicidal&quot; vs. &quot;not suicidal &quot;).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      A. Evaluate other aspects of cognitive functioning (using the Tower of London, the
      Probabilistic Reversal-learning task, the Rey Complex Figure, the Reading the Mind in the
      Eyes test) in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder, depending on the presence or absence
      of a history of suicide attempt; B. Explore performance on neuropsychological tests depending
      on the type of therapy administered (lithium salts or valproate monotherapy or in combination
      with other mood stabilizers); C. Explore a possible relationship between circulating levels
      of lithium or sodium divalproex results and different neuropsychological tests; D.
      Establishment of a biobank for this population with leftover blood samples following serum
      lithium or divalproex testing.

        Patients are recruited via the Bipolar Expert Centres (BEC) at the participating hospitals.
        Euthymic bipolar patients requiring a lithium or divalproex -based mood stabilizer will be
        included.
