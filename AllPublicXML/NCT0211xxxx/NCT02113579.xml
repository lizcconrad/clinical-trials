  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for people with sensitive teeth and involves going to the dentist for 4 visits
      over 6 weeks. At each visit the dentist will look at the mouth, teeth, tongue and gums of
      participants, and check for sensitive teeth.

      During the first 2 weeks, participants will brush their teeth 2 times a day with the fluoride
      toothpaste provided.

      Then, if they qualify to continue in the study, participants will be assigned to one of two
      treatment groups for the last 4 weeks. Both groups will use assigned toothpaste currently
      sold on the market. Both groups will each have an investigative mouth rinse to use as well.
      Participants will have an equal chance of being assigned to any one of the three groups.

      For the next 4 weeks, participants will use their assigned products according to the
      directions provided. At Visit 1, participants will be supervised while they brush their teeth
      to ensure they understand the directions. They will also have supervised use of the products
      at Visit 2.

      Results will be analyzed to assess whether the mouthwashes help to reduce tooth sensitivity
      during the study.

      This study will consist of run-in and treatment phases. To qualify for the study,
      participants must meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and return tactile sensitivity scores
      within protocol-specified parameters at both the screening and baseline visits.

      Run-in will consist of a 2-week period during which participants will use a sodium fluoride
      dentifrice. At the start of the first phase, participants will attend a Screening Visit. They
      will participate in the informed consent process, complete a medical/dental history, and be
      evaluated for tactile sensitivity to Yeaple probe and response to a cold air stimulus.

      Participants who qualify through screening will begin a run-in period that will last
      approximately two weeks. The run-in period will be followed by a Baseline visit. Participants
      who continue to qualify through Baseline will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment
      groups.

      During the four-week treatment period, all participants will brush their teeth twice daily
      for at least one minute in their usual manner, with their assigned toothpaste. After
      brushing, participants will rinse with water, and then rinse with 10 mL of their assigned
      experimental mouth rinse for 60 seconds.

      The study duration is approximately six weeks with each participant visiting the clinical
      site four times.

      Adverse events will be observed and collected by querying each participant at each visit for
      new or continuing symptoms.

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Reduction From Baseline by at Least 30% in Mean Cold Air VAS Stimulus Score at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tooth sensitivity was measured using a Cold Air Stimulus. When being assessed, participants rated their perception of the pain/discomfort experienced when cold air was directed at the exposed root of each tooth by marking a single vertical line on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 = No Pain/Discomfort and 100 = Intense Pain/Discomfort. The dental recorder measured the length of the line from 0 to the participant's line and recorded the VAS score in mm. The score for each participant was calculated by averaging the scores for all study teeth for that participant. A participant was considered an individual success if the participant's mean cold air stimulus VAS score at Week 4 was at least 30% lower than the participant's mean baseline cold air stimulus VAS score.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects With Reduction From Baseline by at Least 30% in Mean Cold Air VAS Stimulus Score at Week 4</title>
        <description>Tooth sensitivity was measured using a Cold Air Stimulus. When being assessed, participants rated their perception of the pain/discomfort experienced when cold air was directed at the exposed root of each tooth by marking a single vertical line on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 = No Pain/Discomfort and 100 = Intense Pain/Discomfort. The dental recorder measured the length of the line from 0 to the participant's line and recorded the VAS score in mm. The score for each participant was calculated by averaging the scores for all study teeth for that participant. A participant was considered an individual success if the participant's mean cold air stimulus VAS score at Week 4 was at least 30% lower than the participant's mean baseline cold air stimulus VAS score.</description>

        <title>Mean Cold Air Stimulus VAS Score at Week 2</title>
        <description>Tooth sensitivity was measured using a Cold Air Stimulus. When being assessed, participants rated their perception of the pain/discomfort experienced when cold air was directed at the exposed root of each tooth by marking a single vertical line on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 = No Pain/Discomfort and 100 = Intense Pain/Discomfort. The dental recorder measured the length of the line from 0 to the participant's line and recorded the VAS score in mm. The score for each participant was calculated by averaging the scores for all study teeth for that participant.</description>

        <description>Tooth sensitivity was measured using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). At each visit, participants rated their perception of the pain/discomfort experienced from the Yeaple probe by marking a single vertical line on a VAS scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 = No Pain/Discomfort and 100 = Intense Pain/Discomfort. The dental recorder measured the length of the line from 0 to the participant's line and recorded the VAS score in mm. The investigator recorded a VAS score of 0 mm for participants who did not experience discomfort at the maximum force of 80 grams. The score for each participant was calculated by averaging the scores for all study teeth for that participant.</description>
