  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that antibiotic therapy for asymptomatic bacteriuria in renal
      transplant patients does not have impact on the development of symptomatic urinary tract
      infection (UTI) or progression of renal impairment in patients during the first year after
      transplantation.
