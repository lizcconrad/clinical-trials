    <textblock>
      Ingestion of capsules of omega 3 EPA and DHA, with 1.8 g of EPA and 1.2 g DHA for morbidly
      obese patients, will improve the inflammatory status? C-reactive protein? Weight?

    <textblock>
      Intake of EPA and DHA for the management of morbid obesity in capsules

      - Reduction of inflammatory factors such as adipokines, glucose, C-reactive protein,
      cholesterol, weight, BMI. Will be 2 groups: cases and controls. The cases will intake of
      omega 3 capsules and placebo control.

    <description>They received gelatin (colorless) capsules. A nutritional evaluation was performed, a 24-h recordatory was applied to verify macro and micronutrients intake, biochemical evaluation before and after the intervention. Macro and micronutrients were calculated using the Avanutri 2.0 system. Clinical history was verified through a questionnaire previously filled out by a physician.</description>
