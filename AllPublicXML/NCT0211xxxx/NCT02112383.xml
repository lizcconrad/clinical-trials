  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Procrastination is defined as a voluntarily delay of an intended course of action despite
      expecting to be worse-off for the delay, and is considered a persistent behavior pattern that
      can result in major psychological suffering. About one-fifth of the adult population and half
      of the student population are presumed having substantial difficulties due to recurrent
      procrastination in their everyday life. However, chronic and severe procrastinators seldom
      receive adequate care due to preconceptions and the lack of understanding regarding
      procrastination and the treatment interventions that are assumed beneficial. Cognitive
      behavior therapy is often deemed treatment of choice, although the evidence supporting its
      use is scarce, and only one randomized controlled trial has been performed. The primary aim
      of the current study is therefore to test the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy
      delivered as either a group intervention or via the Internet. Participants will consist of
      students recruited through the Student Health Centre at Karolinska Institutet. A randomized
      controlled trial with a sample size of 100 participants divided into two conditions will be
      employed; a ten week Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy intervention, and an eight
      week group intervention based on cognitive behavior therapy. The current study is believed to
      result in two important findings. First, different interventions inherent in cognitive
      behavior therapy are assumed to be helpful for people suffering from problems caused by
      procrastination. Second, both a group intervention and an Internet-based cognitive behavior
      therapy intervention are presumed suitable for administering treatment for procrastination,
      which is considered highly important as the availability of adequate care is limited,
      particularly among students. The current study will increase the knowledge regarding the
      efficacy of different treatments of procrastination, as well as enhance the overall
      comprehension of the difficulties related to dilatory behavior.

    <description>For participants in the group intervention condition, the modules from a self-help treatment for procrastination will be delivered at four consecutive three-hour sessions at the Student Health Centre at Karolinska Institutet, with approximately two modules given at each session. The sessions will be spaced two weeks apart, during which participants are instructed to complete assignments related to the modules that were in focus of the previous session, e.g., goal-setting, time management, and behavioral experiments, which they are advised to present and discuss with the other participants.</description>

    <description>For participants in the Internet-based condition, the modules from a self-help treatment for procrastination will be distributed weekly during the treatment period, with one module given each week, i.e., ten weeks. In comparison to the group condition, participants will not receive a therapist contact or attend any sessions. In addition, the participants are expected to complete both the reading material and the assignments that are included in each module.</description>
