    <textblock>
      This pilot, phase II trial studies the side effects and how well paclitaxel given into the
      vein and carboplatin given directly into the abdominal cavity (intraperitoneally) followed by
      radiation therapy work in treating patients with stage IIIC-IV serous uterine cancer. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, stopping them from dividing, or stopping
      them from spreading. Giving the drugs in different ways may kill more tumor cells. Radiation
      therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy followed by
      radiation therapy may be an effective treatment for uterine cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity (as defined by National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Toxicity
      Criteria version [v.] 4.0) of weekly intravenous (IV) paclitaxel with intraperitoneal (IP)
      carboplatin chemotherapy given every third week, followed by radiation therapy (RT) in
      patients with advanced stage uterine serous cancer (USC).

      II. To determine the feasibility of this regimen in women with advanced stage USC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the frequency and the reasons for early discontinuation of the study treatments.

      II. To describe patient-reported quality of life parameters at specified time points during
      the study using validated questionnaires: European Organization for Research and the
      Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 and QLQ-ovarian cancer
      module (OV)28.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define patterns of recurrence (e.g. local versus distant) and progression-free survival
      in patients with advanced and recurrent USC treated with dose dense IV paclitaxel and IP
      carboplatin therapy.

      II. To correlate surrogate endpoint biomarkers that is performed in standard histology
      processing (estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status as well as human epidermal
      growth factor 2 [Her2/neu] status) with progression-free survival and prognosis.

      III. To assess the potential late effects of combined intraperitoneal chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy on the gastrointestinal, genitoureteral, bone marrow and other body systems
      beginning at 6 months post treatment completion during routine office visits.

      OUTLINE:

      CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15
      and carboplatin intraperitoneally (IP) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6
      courses (weeks 1-18) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      RADIATION: At provider discretion, patients may undergo 3-dimensional (3D) conformal or
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) 5 days a week for 5 weeks (weeks 19-23).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then yearly thereafter for up to 10 years.

             and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage 3C1, 3C2, stage 4A, and 4B uterine serous carcinoma; in
             addition, certain stage 3A and B disease are also allowed

               -  Residual disease after primary surgery:

                    -  Eligible:

                         -  Stage 3A and B (pelvic, but confined to adnexa or vagina), residual
                            disease present

                         -  Stage 3CI (pelvic node positive)

                         -  Stage 3CII (para-aortic node positive)

                         -  Stage 4A (bladder or pelvic bowel)

                         -  Stage 4B (distant metastases [mets] including abdominal mets),
                            completely resected

                    -  Not eligible

                         -  Stage 3A and B (pelvic, but confined to adnexa or vagina), completely
                            resected

                         -  Stage 4B (distant mets including abdominal mets), residual disease
                            present

          -  All patients must have a procedure for determining diagnosis of high-risk uterine
             cancer (HRUC); minimum surgical intervention required is tissue biopsy (may be from
             endometrium), if significant clinical evidence exists to support a stage 3 or 4
             diagnosis; as per the discretion of the surgeon, complete surgical staging should
             include: total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, peritoneal
             washings, omental biopsy and lymph node samplings; this is typically the standard
             unless the disease is bulky or the clinician feels the patient would be best served by
             chemotherapy and radiation therapy after histologic diagnosis is confirmed

          -  Written voluntary informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Distant metastasis to the lung, bone or brain; typically, most stage 4 uterine
             papillary serous cancer (UPSC) is confined to the abdomen on presentation
