  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts. The first part of the study looked at the absorption of
      three different polyphenol preparations into the blood, the variability of their absorption
      and whether their absorption could be enhanced by mixing with pollen shells. For this purpose
      12 healthy volunteers were recruited. All participants received all the 3 supplements with
      and without mixing with pollen shells so they had a total of 3 tests. For each test six blood
      samples were taken over an 8 hour period. Urine samples were also collected.

      Oligopin was selected from the first study. The second part of study aims to look at the
      effects of Oligopin on endothelial function by assessing vascular tone and function in
      healthy volunteers using a non-invasive, direct measurement of vasodilatory capacity
      (EndoPAT). Nitrate and nitrite measurements, as well as blood pressure measurements, will
      also be recorded to provide a clear clinical assessment of the effects of this preparation
      (if any) upon vascular function. The effects of Oligopin will be compared to a placebo
      (methylcellulose-filled capsules) to allow a robust assessment of any clinical effects. A
      total of 24 healthy volunteers will be recruited for this study.

      three different polyphenol preparations into the blood, the variability of their absorption
      and whether their absorption could be enhanced by mixing with pollen shells (pollen shells
      have been shown to enhance lipid molecule absorption). For this purpose 12 healthy volunteers
      were recruited. All participants received all the 3 supplements with and without mixing with
      pollen shells so they had a total of 3 tests. For each test six blood samples were taken over
