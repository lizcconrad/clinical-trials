      The purpose of this study is to look at how defects in the skin barrier and immune response
      affect risk for skin infections.

      Participants will be classified into 4 groups based on Atopic Dermatitis (AD)/Non-Atopic (NA)
      status and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonization (negative or positive):

        -  AD S. aureus negative

        -  AD S. aureus positive

        -  NA S. aureus negative and

        -  NA S. aureus positive.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis, also called eczema, is a disease in which the skin is dry and scaly with
      severe itching. People with atopic dermatitis have defects in the skin barrier as well as
      defects in the immune system which fights off skin infections. People who have atopic
      dermatitis often have complications from viral and bacterial skin infections, such as
      recurring Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), or Staph infections.

      The study will compare the skin barrier and immune response of people with and without atopic
      dermatitis in relation to whether Staph bacteria is growing on their skin.
