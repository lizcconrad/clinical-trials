  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our bodies respond differently to stress. Animal studies by the investigators have found that
      endothelin-1 plays a role in regulating blood pressure in response to stress. This study is
      an extension of the investigators previous animal work to evaluate the role of endothelin-1
      during stress in humans.

      Using a salt sensitive animal model of prehypertension, the Dahl S rat,the investigators have
      previously published that acute stress elicits a pressor response that is accompanied by an
      increase in 8 isoprostane and endothelin-1. However, the pressor response is suppressed by
      endothelin A/B receptor antagonism. Moreover, the investigators have identified that the
      increase in 8-isoprostane occurs downstream of endothelin receptor activation. These data
      indicate that endothelin receptor activation is a main player In the pressor response to
      acute stress in pre-hypertensive animals; however, this phenomenon has yet to be elucidated
      in humans.
