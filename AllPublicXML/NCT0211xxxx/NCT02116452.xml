  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to evaluate whether a specific prebiotic (GOS/PDX) may have an effect
      in preventing atopic dermatitis, food allergy, intestinal and/or respiratory infections in
      infants at risk of atopy. In infants with dermatitis, the hypothesis will be tested that
      prebiotics reduce the severity of the disease.

      This study is a prospective, double blind, randomised, 24 month study trial comparing formula
      with 50/50 mixture of GOS/PDX (Enfamil Premium Infant Formula 1 for children &lt;6 months and
      Formula 2 for children ≥ 6 months) versus standard formula (Enfamil Premium Formula 1 and 2).

      Study population is composed by newborns at risk for allergy that will be identified at time
      of delivery. Infants will be eligible if at least one parent or one older sibling have a
      physician-diagnosed atopic disease (asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis , atopic dermatitis,
      allergic urticaria, and food allergy as follow described. At time of enrolment (within the
      first 4 weeks of life) infants will be randomised 1:1 to receive once they will start formula
      feeding before the day of the 6th month birthday.
