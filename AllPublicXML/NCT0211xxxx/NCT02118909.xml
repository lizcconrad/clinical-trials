    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a 2-part, open-label study to assess the effect of pracinostat with
      itraconazole (part 1) and pracinostat with ciprofloxacin (part 2) on the bioavailability of
      pracinostat. Secondarily to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pracinostat administered
      with itraconazole or ciprofloxacin.
