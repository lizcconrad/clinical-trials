  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to investigate the tolerability and the safety of Cyclosporine A
      containing CyclASol® eye drops compared to Placebo (vehicle) in a cohort of healthy
      volunteers. Subjects will be randomly assigned to dosing with CyclASol® eye drops or Placebo
      (vehicle) in the first part (first period) of the study, and switched to the alternative
      dosing in the second part (second period) of the study. An ophthalmological assessment of the
      eyes will be performed, and a questionnaire will be issued in the beginning and after each
      dosing. Additionally physical examinations, safety laboratory and ECGs will be performed, and
      blood samples will be analyzed for Cyclosporine A and Placebo (vehicle).
