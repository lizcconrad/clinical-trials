          -  Subjects who are contact lens wearers must have two (2) central keratometry readings
             and two (2) manifest subjective refractions taken pre-operatively at least one week
             apart. The refraction values must not differ by more than 0.50 D as defined by
             manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE). The keratometry values must not
             differ from the previous values by more than 0.50 D in either meridian.

          -  High contrast, manifest, best spectacle-corrected distance visual acuity correctable
             binocular to at least 1.0 (Snellen 20/20 or 6/6) and monocular to at least 0.8

             treated must have a best corrected distance visual acuity of at least 0.8 (Snellen
             20/25 or 6/7.5).

          -  For treatments with the SUPRACOR presbyopic algorithm, subjects have to be at least 45
             years old and no more than 85 years.

          -  For treatments with the SUPRACOR presbyopic algorithm, subjects must have presbyopia
             as determined by an age-related need for optical aid (&gt; +1.50 D) for reading with
             their best distance correction and been screened successfully for acceptance of the
             SUPRACOR simulation.

          -  For treatments with the SUPRACOR presbyopic algorithm, subjects must been screened
             successfully for acceptance of the SUPRACOR simulation

          -  For treatments with the SUPRACOR presbyopic algorithm, Myopic subjects must have up to
             -7.0 diopters (D) of absolute spherical myopia (not spherical equivalent), with up to
             -4.0 D of refractive astigmatism (NOT corneal astigmatism) by manifest subjective
             refraction. The spherical equivalent and must be no more than -9.0 D.

          -  Hyperopic subjects must have up to +4 diopters (D) of absolute spherical hyperopia
             (not spherical equivalent), with up to +2.5 D of refractive astigmatism (NOT corneal
             astigmatism) by manifest subjective refraction in both eyes. The spherical equivalent
             must be no more than +5.25 D.

          -  Mesopic pupil size measured with the Zywave II WaveFront Aberrometer must be &lt; 7.0 mm

             0.35µm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects for whom the combination of their baseline corneal thickness and the planned
             operative parameters for the LASIK procedure would result in less than 250 microns of

          -  Subjects with unstable central keratometry readings with irregular mires.

             clinically significant atopic disease, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other acute
             or chronic illnesses that will increase the risk to the subject or confound the
             outcomes of this study.

          -  Subject taking systemic medications likely to affect wound healing such as
             corticosteroids or antimetabolites.

             the course of the study.

          -  Subjects with known sensitivity to medications used for standard LASIK.

          -  Subjects participating in any other ophthalmic clinical trials during this clinical
             study.

          -  Subjects with an ocular muscle disorder including a strabismus or nystagmus, or other
             disorders affecting fixation.
