      The purpose of this research is to explore the relationship of metamemory and memory of
      elders and to evaluate the effectiveness of a metamemory cognitive intervention on elders
      with mild cognitive impairment and low memory self-efficacy.

      There are 3 studies in the present research. Study 1 is a reliability and validity study of
      the Chinese Metamemory Scales. Study 2 is a cross-sectional study to explore the relationship
      between metamemory and memory of elders encountered in Hong Kong primary health care
      setting.Study 3 is an Effectiveness Study of Metamemory Cognitive Intervention on elders with
      mild cognitive impairment and low memory self-efficacy.

      This research has the following aims and hypotheses:

      Research Aims:

        1. To evaluate the reliability and validity of the Chinese Metamemory Scales

        2. To explore the relationship between metamemory and memory of elders

        3. To evaluate the effectiveness of a metamemory cognitive intervention on Mild Cognitive
           Impairment (MCI) elders who have low memory self-efficacy

      Research Hypotheses:

      Study 1: The Chinese Metamemory Scales will show acceptable psychometric properties.

      Study 2: There is a positive correlation between metamemory (subjective memory) and memory
      (objective memory) and this relationship is mediated by stereotyped beliefs about memory
      ageing.

      Study 3: Comparing to Control Group, the Intervention Group will yield the following expected
      results:

        1. There is an improvement in objective memory measures post-training.

        2. There is an improvement in subjective memory measures post-training.

        3. There is an improvement in mood measures post-training.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Study 1:

        Participants are Chinese elderly of age 65 or above and they speak Cantonese as their
        primary language. They are to be recruited from a convenience sample of clients who are
        without cognitive problems and are attending service in the Elderly Health Centres (EHC) of
        the Elderly Health Service of the Department of Health, Hong Kong Special Administrative
        Region Government (HKSARG).

          -  Study 2:

        In addition to the inclusion criteria of Study 1, EHC members with confirmed dementia,
        suspected dementia, and suspected MCI will also be invited to participate in Study 2.
        However, confirmed demented clients and suspected demented clients must show their capacity
        to appraise by passing Quality of Life Appraisal Inventory (CapQOL) (Wong, J.G.W.S. et al.,
        2005) before they are accepted to the Study. All clients are recruited upon consent.

          -  Study 3:

        Suspected MCI participants of Study 2 with below average memory self-efficacy assessed to
        have MCI (according to operational definition) will be invited and recruited to Study 3
        upon consent. In the present research, MCI is defined operationally according to prior
        local studies and determined with reference to the educational level-adjusted cutoff scores
        of Chinese Mini Mental Status Examination (CMMSE) and Abbreviated version of Memory
        Inventory for the Chinese combined (Lam, L. C.W. &amp; et al., 2005; Lam, L.C.W. &amp; et al.,
        2008).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The presence of currently active medical conditions potentially affecting cognition
             e.g. vitamin B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, chronic alcoholism, delirium, and active
             psychiatric disorders e.g. schizophrenia

          -  Other conditions that might affect cognitive competency e.g. aphasia, severe visual or
             hearing impairment.
