    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of the treatment combination of alternating
      standard chemotherapy and another (melphalan) chemotherapy at different interval schedules.
      Researchers want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the treatment combination has on
      the patients and their retinoblastoma.

             scan (or FDG PET scan), and/or any other additional tests done at study entry.

          -  Patients who have previously been treated with chemotherapy (with the exception of
             second inclusion criteria) radiation therapy, or intra-arterial therapy.

             artery (e.g., small for age infant, untreatable allergy to contrast).

          -  Abnormal cerebral vasculature noted on MR angiography that would increase the risk of
             the procedure, including but not limited to an incomplete Circle of Willis. Other
             abnormalities that are less severe than an incomplete Circle of Willis will be
             reviewed by the study chair in consultation with a neuro-interventional radiologist.

          -  Any serious ongoing condition, such as an untreated infection or organ dysfunction.

          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of
             CYP450 enzyme(s) are ineligible.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study due to potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects of therapy. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother breastfeeding
             should be discontinued upon start of protocol therapy.
