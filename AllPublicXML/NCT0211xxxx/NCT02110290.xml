  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is assessing quality of life in children with a physical disability who
      participate in the Children's Hospital Colorado Hospital Sports Program (HSP), where children
      with physical disabilities are able to participate in more organized sports and active
      programs with the use of adaptive equipment. This study would assess a child's self reported
      and parent perceived quality of life before and after child participation in HSP for the
      winter season. The investigators aim to determine the level of child and parent happiness and
      satisfaction in specific quality of life aspects including: physical activities and health,
      feelings, moods, self perception, home life, friends, school, learning and bullying. The
      investigators believe that children with any physical disability will have a more
      satisfactory reported quality of life after participating in HSP for one or many years.

      The purpose of this proposed research is to quantify the impact of participation in an
      adaptive ski/snowboarding program on parent perceived and child self-reported health related
      quality of life. To this effect, the study will assess children's self-perception of
      psychological, emotional, physical health of participants as well as their parents perception
      of the same, through the use of a validated self reported quality of life questionnaire,
      KIDSCREEN-52, before and after participating in an adaptive ski/snowboarding program every
      year.

      Primary Aims:

        1. To determine the level of subject and parent satisfaction and happiness, through a
           composite of 10 aspects in a quality of life questionnaire, following participation in
           the Children's Hospital Colorado Hospital Sports Program (HSP) for one winter season.

        2. To determine the long-term impact of repeated participation in an adapted
           ski/snowboarding program through a composite of 10 aspects in a quality of life
           questionnaire, following participation in the Children's Hospital Colorado Hospital
           Sports Program (HSP) for consistent winter seasons.

        The Hospital Sports Program at Children's Hospital Colorado only has the capability to
        accommodate 60 to 65 children a year. This study contacts all of the subjects who meet the
        study inclusion criteria from the enrolled HSP participant list. It should be noted that
        the investigators will only be recruiting from children already participating in HSP; they
        will not be recruiting for children to join HSP.
