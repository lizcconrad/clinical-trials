      The purpose of this study is to assess the utility of FDG PET/CT in evaluating response of
      bone dominant breast cancer to therapy. Eligible patients with bone dominant ER+ breast
      cancer will undergo baseline FDG PET/CT for evaluation of their disease, after the start of
      therapy they will undergo an FDG PET/CT scan at 4 weeks and again at 12 weeks. PET/CT results
      will be compared to clinical measures of response, time to progression and overall survival.

        A total of up to 75 subjects, age 18 years, with a diagnosis or estrogen receptor positive
        (ER+) breast cancer, with clinical evidence of bone dominant stage IV disease will be
        enrolled in this study. This study will enroll both women and men but it is anticipate that
        the majority of subjects will be women due to the small percentage of breast cancer
        patients that are male.

          -  Previous treatment with radiation or surgery to a significant percentage of bony
             metastatic sites 6. Treatment with marrow stimulating agents (e.g. granulocyte colony
