      This trial is a prospective, single center, unblinded, randomized, controlled study to assess
      the safety and efficacy of negative pressure wound therapy in preventing infections after TKA
      surgery . The study will enroll 316 patients that will undergo TKA. patients will be
      randomized to the treatment group and undergo the study intervention - (NPWT) The
      intervention will take place at the end of the surgery. The Patients that are randomized to
      the control group will receive standard treatment. Both groups will be assessed at two weeks
      and six weeks. period.
