      Primary objective

      To demonstrate that administration of the 9vHPV vaccine induces non-inferior Geometric Mean
      Titres (GMTs) for serum anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18, compared to GARDASIL in 16- to
      26-year-old men

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate the tolerability of the 9vHPVvaccine in 16- to 26-year-old men.

        -  To summarise humoral immune responses, including anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52,
           58 GMTs and seroconversion rates at 4 weeks post-dose 3, in 16- to 26-year-old men who
           received 9vHPVvaccine or GARDASIL
