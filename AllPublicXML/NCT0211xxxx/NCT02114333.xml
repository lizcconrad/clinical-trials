  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the two vaccines that have been developed to prevent and/or lessen
      the effects of shingles. One vaccine is live (Zostavax, licensed by FDA) and the other,
      herpes zoster subunit (HZ/su), contains a piece of the shingles virus (not live) and an
      ingredient that may enhance the body's immune response to the vaccine, and is currently
      investigational. The vaccines are being compared to assess their ability to stimulated
      protection against shingles. The study will provide an opportunity to determine the safety
      profile of each vaccine in a single trial. The study will also look at the effect of age on
      the immune response to the two vaccines and on the persistence of these responses.

      160 people from the Denver area will participate. Duration is up to 5 years with 10-12 visits
      in that period. Subjects are randomized into one of 4 arms to receive either Zostavax or
      HZ/su. In this single blind study all subjects receive 2 injections: one at the first visit
      (Day 0) and the second at Day 60. HZ/su subjects will receive vaccine at both visits;
      Zostavax subjects will receive vaccine at the first visit and a placebo at the Day 60 visit.
      Blood is collected from all subjects at most visits. Some subjects spit into a tube for
      saliva collection. A urine sample is collected prior to vaccination if subject is a woman of
      childbearing potential. Subjects are asked to complete a diary to record any reactions in the
      30 days after each injection. The Day 90 visit is the last one until the annual visits for
      blood draws begin at Day 365. Some subjects are also seen at Year 2 and Year 4; all subjects
      are seen at Year 5 for blood draw.
