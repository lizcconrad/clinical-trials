  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate in patients with chronic low back pain
      (lasting for more than 3 months and not postoperative) the effect of an instrumental
      rehabilitation using the I-Moove ® device compared to a conventional physiotherapy
      rehabilitation for ambulatory postural stability (mean and standard deviation of excursions
      from the center of gravity) without visual control, 6 weeks after the start of the
      rehabilitation protocol. We focus on the relative variation between the values obtained on
      day 0 versus 6 weeks, via measures performed on a force platform. The results will be
      stratified into 3 age groups (18-39 years, 40-60 years and over 60 years).

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate and compare the two physical therapy
      techniques at 6 weeks and 6 months after the start of the rehabilitation protocol in terms
      of:

      A - improving postural stability and visual control on an unstable surface (with and without
      visual control)

      B - improving levels of abdominal strength (Ito test) and erector spinae (Sørensen test)

      C - the impact of back pain on daily life using questionnaires (Dallas, Québec, FABQ and
      Tampa questionnaires/scores)

      D - Improvement of pain (Visual Analog Scale),
