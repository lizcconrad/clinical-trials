      The goals of this study are to 1. Investigate the sensitivity of allocentric visual memory
      when compared to more established measures of cognition in identifying cognitive difficulties
      among MS subjects when compared to controls. 2. Determine which cognitive test variable will
      be most strongly associated with self and informant reports of cognition. 3. Determine which
      MRI metric will be most strongly related to neuropsychological test performance 4. Determine
      the degree to which allocentric visual memory is related to functional connectivity on fMRI.

      This is a cross-sectional, case-control, observational experimental design. The study will
      enroll subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS) and age/gender matched on a battery of
      neuropsychological cognitive tests and self-report measures of cognition.

        Subjects with relapsing remitting Multiple Sclerosis and demographically matched controls
        will be recruited for this study. The MS subjects will consist of patients who were
        referred for a neuropsychological evaluation and neuroimaging as part of standard practice
        of care to evaluate for cognitive difficulties and/or track disease progression.
