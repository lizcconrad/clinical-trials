      Patients in the intervention arm will view the 23-minute video depicting the Hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation (HSCT) experience. Patients in the control arm will receive HSCT
      frequently asked questions (FAQ) sheet developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at
      the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

      The study's overall goals are 1) to improve outcomes; and 2) to increase satisfaction with
      the physician consultation.

      Patients will be randomized to intervention or control and data will be collected at three
      time points (before treatment, 30 days post-HSCT and 12 months post-HSCT).

    <description>The Physician consultation will be measured by the Patient Satisfaction Communication Questionnaire (PSCQA). Participants are asked to rate their experience with the physician consultation. There are 17 items, 8 positively worded and 9 negatively worded. Each item is rated on a 5 point likert scale with 1 being strongly agree to 5 being strongly disagree. The maximum score on the PSCQ is 85. The measure takes approximately 4 minutes to administer.</description>
