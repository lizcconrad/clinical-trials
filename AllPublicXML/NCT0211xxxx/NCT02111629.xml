  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genital tract infections (GTIs) have increased in the past decade and there is an association
      between sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and other infections like bacterial vaginosis
      (BV), with the HIV transmission. BV and Candida are the most common causes of vaginal
      infections in symptomatic women, the prevalence of BV being 22-50% and the prevalence of
      Candida 17-39%. In an effort to reduce the transmission of GTIs, the World Health
      Organization (WHO) proposed a syndromic diagnostic approach as a low cost alternative in
      places with no access to laboratory diagnostic tests.

      Justification. In patients with syndrome of vaginal discharge, an effective treatment against
      Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis, and bacterial vaginosis is adviced, therefore, for
      syndromic management of symptomatic vaginal discharge the combination of fluconazole and
      secnidazole could be used. No studies evaluating this combination were found in the
      literature reviewed.

      Objectives: To describe the safety and the clinical and microbiological efficacy of a single
      oral dose of a combined treatment with secnidazole + fluconazole for the syndromic management
      of symptomatic vaginal discharge.

      Methods: Design: open label, uncontrolled clinical trial to estimate clinical efficacy and
      safety of the combination of fluconazole and secnidazole for the treatment of symptomatic
      vaginal discharge. The participants will be sexually active women with lower genital tract
      symptoms (leukorrhea, itching, burning, pain, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, or urethral
      symptoms) compatible with symptomatic vaginal discharge syndrome. The study will be conducted
      in an outpatient service of a hospital in Bogota, Colombia. Given the descriptive character
      of the study, no a priori hypothesis is considered. A consecutive convenience sample size of
      100 symptomatic patients is calculated. The statistical analysis will be performed with STATA
      11.0 software (College Station, Texas, USA). Simple and relative frequencies and measures of
      central tendency and dispersion appropriate for the distribution of the variables will be
      calculated. The study has been submitted and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty
      of Medicine of the National University of Colombia and the Institutional Review Board of the
      participating institution. All women must sign a written informed consent form agreeing to
      voluntarily participate in the study.
