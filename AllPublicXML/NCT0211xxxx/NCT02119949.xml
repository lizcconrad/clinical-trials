  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Substance abusers show impaired working memory (WM) functioning. Promising
      findings show training WM results in an improved working memory capacity (WMC) and a decrease
      of clinical symptoms in a range of disorders, including alcohol addiction.

      Aim: To test the effect of a WM training in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) on substance
      use, craving, WMC, impulsivity, attention bias and psychopathology.

      Design: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial with a parallel group design. The
      WM training adapted to participants' WMC whereas the placebo training consisted of
      non-adaptive easy versions of these tasks.

      Setting: Two departments of an addiction treatment clinic in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

      Participants: 120 inpatients diagnosed with an alcohol, cannabis or cocaine dependency who
      were in treatment as usual .

      Measurements: Primary outcome measures: Substance use and craving. Secondary outcome
      measures: WMC, impulsivity, attention bias and psychopathology. Participants were assessed
      before and after 24 sessions of WM training as well as two months after the training.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Craving: Desires for Alcohol Questionnaire and Desires for Drug Questionnaire score change and Obsessive Compulsive Drug Use Scale and Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale score change between pre and post training and follow up (two months after post)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre (baseline), post (after 4 weeks of training-starting 1 day after pre-test) and follow-up (2 months after post-test)</time_frame>
    <description>The 14-item Desires for Drug Questionnaire (DDQ) and the 13-item Desires for Alcohol Questionnaire (DAQ) measure instant craving to respectively drug and alcohol. The DDQ is based on the DAQ.
The Obsessive Compulsive Drug Use Scale (OCDUS) and Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) measure the subjective interference and distress caused by respectively drug and alcohol related thoughts and compulsive-behavior patterns.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Digit Span score on pre and post training and follow up after two months</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre (baseline), post (after 4 weeks of training-starting 1 day after pre-test) and follow-up (2 months after post-test)</time_frame>
    <description>The Digit Span task consists of two parts: the forward Digit Span is a frequently used measure for short term memory, an important subcomponent of the memory system (Shipstead, Redick, &amp; Engle, 2012) and the backward version measures WM.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Reading Span partial-scredit uni score on pre and post training and follow up after two months</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre (baseline), post (after 4 weeks of training-starting 1 day after pre-test) and follow-up (2 months after post-test)</time_frame>
    <description>The Reading Span measures the processing and storage functions of WM (Shipstead et al., 2012), specifically participants' ability to shift between two tasks and to cope with proactive interference.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Barratt Impulsivity Scale-11 score on pre and post training and follow up after two months</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre (baseline), post (after 4 weeks of training-starting 1 day after pre-test) and follow-up (2 months after post-test)</time_frame>
    <description>The 30-item Barratt Impulsivity Scale-11 (BIS-11) measures impulsivity.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Stroop score on pre and post training and follow up after two months</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre (baseline), post (after 4 weeks of training-starting 1 day after pre-test) and follow-up (2 months after post-test)</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroop measures participants' attention bias for addiction related stimuli.</description>

    <measure>Change in Beck Depression Inventory - Second Edition (BDI-II) score on pre and post training and follow up after two months</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre (baseline), post (after 4 weeks of training-starting 1 day after pre-test) and follow-up (2 months after post-test)</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory - Second Edition (BDI-II) measures the severity of depression in 21 statements, with four levels of increasing severity each.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score on pre and post training and follow up after two months</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre (baseline), post (after 4 weeks of training-starting 1 day after pre-test) and follow-up (2 months after post-test)</time_frame>
    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) measures self-reported anxiety in 40 questions on a 4-point scale. The questionnaire consists of two parts; state and trait anxiety, respectively transient and dispositional anxiety.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in substance use, measured with the Addiction Severity Index over pre-, post (1 day after training) and follow-up (2 months after post-test) measurements.</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre (baseline), post (after 4 weeks of training-starting 1 day after pre-test) and follow-up (2 months after post-test)</time_frame>
    <description>The Addiction Severity Index (ASI) is a semi-structured interview that measures the severity of addiction in 25 questions concerning seven problem areas: medical problems, employment problems, drug use, alcohol use, family and social problems, criminality, and psychiatric problems. We used three of these questions to assess the severity of participants' abuse problems.</description>

    <description>The working memory training started the day after the pre-test and included 24 sessions of 25 minutes each. Participants trained, under supervision of an experimenter, on weekdays in the clinic. The training consisted of two tasks: the Symmetry Span and the N-back Task. Participants in the experimental group executed versions of these task that adapt to their working memory capacity, to train their working memory optimally.</description>
