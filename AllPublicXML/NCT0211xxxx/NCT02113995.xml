      Background To evaluate clinical results, insulin resistance and inflammatory response to
      trauma in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic Sleeve gastrectomy who received
      either traditional preoperative care or treatment following the ACERTO protocol.

      Methods The population of the study consisted of morbidly obese patients, who were operated
      on with the Sleeve procedure, from Cuiaba, MT, between April and October 2012. We studied the
      inflammatory response and insulin resistance by measuring levels of glucose, insulin, Homa
      IR, reactive C protein, albumin, pre-albumin, alpha 1 acid glicoprotein, interleukin 6 and
      glycosylated hemoglobin. We also studied hydration, nausea and vomiting, hypertension, and
      length of hospital stay.

    <description>Patients received 400 ml of a beverage containing water and 50 g of maltodextrin 6 hours before the operation. They received orally extra 200 ml of this beverage containing water and 25 g of maltodextrin 3 hours before the operation. Regarding the intravenous fluids, they received 1 to 1.5 liter of crystalloid fluids (ringer lactate) in the intraoperative. In the immediate postoperative they were programmed to receive 2 liters of crystalloid fluids (ringer lactate) and 1 to 2 liters in the first day of the postoperative period. The venous hydration was suspended as soon as they started to drink liquids.
Prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting with dexamethasone 8 mg at the beginning of the anesthesia and ondansetron 4-8 mg after the surgery. In the postoperative period we utilized analgesics such as dipyrone and ketorolac and, if necessary, low doses of morphine and antiemetics like ondansetron.</description>

    <description>The analgesia in the postoperative period of the group control was performed with dipyrone, tramadol hydrochloride, and morphine. The prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting with dexamethasone 8 mg in the beginning of the anesthesia and the metoclopramide at the end of the surgery. During the anesthetic induction antibiotic prophylaxis (cefazolin 3 grams/day for 2 days) was administrated.
The control group were submitted to the protocol of traditional fasting with at least 8 hours. Patients in this group received 1 to 2 liters of crystalloid fluid (ringer lactate) in the intraoperative, and they received 3 to 4 liters of crystalloid fluids (ringer lactate, saline 0.9% and/or dextrose 5%). In the immediate postoperative, 2 to 3 liters in the first day of postoperative and, finally, 1 to 2 liters in the second day of the postoperative.</description>

    <description>Three sample blood collections were performed, being one in the anesthesic induction and the others in the next 24 to 48 hours. The blood was sent to the laboratory for dosages of glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein, albumin, prealbumin, alpha 1 acid glycoprotein and interleukin 6. During the anesthesic induction we also collected blood for analize glycosylated hemoglobin.</description>
