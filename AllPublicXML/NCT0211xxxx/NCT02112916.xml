      This randomized phase III trial compares how well combination chemotherapy works when given
      with or without bortezomib in treating patients with newly diagnosed T-cell acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia or stage II-IV T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Bortezomib may help
      reduce the number of leukemia or lymphoma cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. It may also help chemotherapy work better by making cancer cells more sensitive
      to the drugs. It is not yet known if giving standard chemotherapy with or without bortezomib
      is more effective in treating T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and T-cell lymphoblastic
      lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare event-free survival (EFS) in patients with newly diagnosed T-cell acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LLy) who are randomized
      to a modified augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (ABFM) backbone versus bortezomib plus the
      modified ABFM backbone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of modifying standard therapy for T-ALL and T-LLy
      based on the results of UKALL 2003, which includes a dexamethasone-based induction,
      additional doses of pegaspargase (PEG-ASP) during induction and delayed intensification (DI),
      and dexamethasone pulses during maintenance therapy.

      II. To determine if prophylactic (presymptomatic) cranial radiation therapy (CRT) can be
      safely and effectively eliminated in the 85-90% of T-ALL patients classified as standard or
      intermediate risk.

      III. To determine the proportion of end of consolidation (EOC) minimal residual disease (MRD)
      &gt;= 0.1% T-ALL patients who become MRD negative (undetectable by flow cytometry) after
      intensification of chemotherapy, using three high risk (HR) BFM blocks, and to compare EFS
      between the patients who become MRD negative after the three HR BFM blocks and continue on
      chemotherapy with those who continue to have detectable MRD and are eligible for other
      treatment strategies, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Similarly, to
      compare the EFS between very high risk (induction failure) T-LLy patients treated with HR BFM
      intensification blocks who have partial or complete response (PR or CR) with those who do not
      respond (NR).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the prognostic significance of day 29 bone marrow (BM) MRD in T-LLy
      patients.

      II. To determine if protein expression patterns can predict bortezomib response and drug
      resistance in T-ALL.

      III. To analyze and target relevant signaling pathways in T-ALL blasts, focusing on early T
      cell precursor (ETP) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      INDUCTION ARM A: Patients receive cytarabine intrathecally (IT) at time of diagnostic lumbar
      puncture (if within 72 hours from start of protocol therapy) OR day 1; vincristine sulfate

      daily (BID) on days 1-28 (no taper); daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1-15 minutes on days
      1, 8, 15, and 22; pegaspargase IV over 1-2 hours on days 4 and 18; and methotrexate IT on
      days 8 and 29 (and on days 15 and 22 for central nervous system 3 involvement [CNS3] T-ALL
      patients).

      INDUCTION ARM B: Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; and

      methotrexate as in Induction Arm A.

      CONSOLIDATION: Beginning on day 36 from Induction, patients receive methotrexate IT on days
      1, 8, 15, and 22 (days 1 and 8 only for CNS3 T-ALL or CNS3 T-LLy patients); cyclophosphamide
      IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 29; cytarabine IV over 1-30 minutes or subcutaneously

      vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 15, 29, and 43; mercaptopurine PO QD on days 1-56; and
      methotrexate IT on days 1 and 29. The next course (based on randomization assignment) begins

      cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours on days 1-2; etoposide IV over 1-2 hours every 12
      hours on days 3-5; pegaspargase IV over 1-2 hours on day 6; and triple IT therapy on day 5 as
      in Intensification Block I. The next course (based on randomization) begins on day 22 or when
      blood counts recover (whichever occurs later).

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: All patients receive vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 29, and 57;
      dexamethasone PO BID or IV on days 1-5, 29-33, and 57-61; mercaptopurine PO on days 1-84;
      methotrexate PO on days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71, and 78 (omit day 29 for SR
      patients during the first 4 courses); methotrexate IT on day 1 (and day 29 during the first 4
      courses for SR patients and during the first 2 courses for IR patients). Patients with CNS3
      IR disease also undergo cranial radiation therapy during the first 4 weeks (course 1).
      Treatment in female patients with T-ALL and patients with T-LLY repeats every 12 weeks for up
      to 2 years from the start of Interim Maintenance (week 119). Treatment in male patients with
      T-ALL repeats every 12 weeks for up to 3 years from the start of Interim Maintenance (week
      171).

      All treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 10
      years.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  T-ALL: T-ALL patients must be enrolled on AALL08B1 or Project:EveryChild (APEC14B1, if
             open for the classification of ALL patients) prior to treatment and enrollment on
             AALL1231

          -  Patients must have newly diagnosed T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) or T-lymphoblastic
             lymphoma (T-LLy) stages II-IV

               -  Note: a diagnosis of T-ALL is established when leukemic blasts lack
                  myeloperoxidase or evidence of B-lineage derivation (cluster of differentiation
                  [CD]19/CD22/CD20), and express either surface or cytoplasmic CD3 or two or more
                  of the antigens CD8, CD7, CD5, CD4, CD2 or CD1a, and are present either in
                  peripheral blood or &gt; 25% in the bone marrow; if surface CD3 is expressed on all
                  leukemic cells, additional markers of immaturity, including terminal
                  deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), CD34 or CD99 will be assessed for expression;
                  cases with uncertain expression will receive additional review within the
                  appropriate Children's Oncology Group (COG) reference laboratory

               -  For T-LLy patients with tissue available for flow cytometry, the criterion for
                  diagnosis should be analogous to T-ALL; for tissue processed by other means (i.e.
                  paraffin blocks), the methodology and criteria for immunophenotypic analysis to
                  establish the diagnosis of T-LLy defined by the submitting institution will be
                  accepted

          -  All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed
             consent; assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional
             guidelines

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must not have received any cytotoxic chemotherapy for either the current
             diagnosis of T-ALL, T-L-Ly or for any cancer diagnosis prior to the initiation of
             protocol therapy on AALL1231, with the exception of:

               -  Steroid pretreatment: prednisone or methylprednisolone for =&lt; 120 hours (5 days)
                  in the 7 days prior to initiating induction chemotherapy or for =&lt; 336 hours (14
                  days) in the 28 days prior to initiating induction chemotherapy; prior exposure
                  to ANY steroids that occurred &gt; 28 days before the initiation of protocol therapy
                  does not affect eligibility; the dose of prednisone or methylprednisolone does
                  not affect eligibility
