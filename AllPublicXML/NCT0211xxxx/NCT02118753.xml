  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the laboratory, the researchers will investigate whether the drug eplerenone improves
      contractile function after ischemia and reperfusion in heart tissue.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In animal studies, the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eplerenone appears to limit
      myocardial infarct size. This cardioprotective effect might explain, at least in part, the
      beneficial effect on mortality of eplerenone in patients with heart failure. Previous animal
      studies suggest that this cardioprotective effect is mediated by an increased formation of
      the endogenous nucleoside adenosine.

      Our objective is to study for the first time in human myocardial tissue ex vivo wether
      eplerenone limits ischemia reperfusion injury and whether this is mediated by adenosine
      receptor stimulation.

      From patients undergoing open heart surgery, the right atrial appendage will be harvested by
      the cardiothoracic surgeon. In the laboratory, two trabeculae will be dissected and suspended
      in an organ bath. Contraction will be induced by electrical field stimulation. Recovery of
      contractile force after a period of simulated ischemia and reperfusion will be used as an
      endpoint of ischemia-reperfusion injury.

      The trabeculae of each patient will be randomized to pretreatment with A)ischemic
      preconditioning (IP) of no IP as a positive control experiment; B)eplerenone or vehicle;
      C)eplerenone with or without caffeine; and D)aldosterone with and without eplerenone.

    <time_frame>210 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The recovery of contractile function (% of baseline) in human myocardial tissue after simulated ischemia and reperfusion in 2 trabeculae will be compared: 1 of the trabeculae will be exposed to eplerenone, the other to vehicle.
We will use the experimental set up as described by Speechly-Dick et al. with small modifications to allow simultaneous measurement of 2 trabeculae from 1 patient. The two trabeculae will be dissected and vertically suspended in an organ bath and linked to a force transducer. During electrical field stimulation, we will calculate the developed force (difference between maximal tension during contraction and minimal tension during relaxation), maximal speed of tension development during contraction and maximal speed of tension during relaxation. We will average these parameters for baseline, and during the experiment. Functional recovery will be expressed as a percentage of baseline.</description>

    <description>After baseline recordings of contractile function, the investigators will assign 2 trabeculae of each patient to either a stimulus for (1) ischemic preconditioning (IP) or (2) no IP. Subsequently, the trabeculae will be exposed to 90 min of ischemia, followed by 120 minutes of recovery. The investigators will measure the recovery of contractile function in both trabeculae.
This experiment serves as a positive control, to ensure that our model is still working properly.</description>

    <description>In the next patients, a similar ischemia-reperfusion experiment will be performed, but now the 2 trabeculae will be randomized to pretreatment with eplerenone or DMSO. The percentage recovery (compared to baseline) of contractile force of the trabeculae at the end of reperfusion will serve as the primary endpoint.</description>
