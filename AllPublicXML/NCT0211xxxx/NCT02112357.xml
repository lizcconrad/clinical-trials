  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the feasibility of sequencing locally advanced/metastatic
      gastrointestinal cancers in real-time to enable future treatment stratification by molecular
      characteristics. Targeted next generation sequencing of a panel of genes will be performed on
      tumour specimens and results will be discussed at a Sequencing Tumour Board to establish if a
      patient is potentially suitable for a targeted therapy.

      Both fresh frozen tissue and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour samples will be
      obtained.

      Biopsies may be taken at entry to the study and/or at the time of radiological response
      assessment. Each patient can have a maximum of 3 research biopsies in this study.

      Up to 35 ml of blood will be collected at study entry to provide normal germline DNA and for
      possible additional biomarker analysis. If the patient has consented to optional blood sample
      collection, then additional blood samples will also be collected at the time of radiological
      response assessment to study molecular changes that occur during treatment.
