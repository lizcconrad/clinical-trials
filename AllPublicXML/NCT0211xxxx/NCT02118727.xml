    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if memantine at 20 mg BID when used in conjunction
      with riluzole, can slow down the disease progression of patients with ALS including
      potentially improving their neuropsychiatric changes, as well as determine if CSF protein
      biomarkers can be used both as a diagnostic and a prognostic marker in patients with ALS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects 30,000
      Americans each year. Of these 30,000 Americans, it has been suggested that up to 50% will
      experience cognitive and behavioral changes in the form of frontotemporal dysfunction and up
      to 40% will meet criteria for frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Riluzole the only FDA approved
      agent for ALS extends a patient's lifespan by 2-3 months, and there are no proven therapies
      for the cognitive changes associated with ALS. More effective therapy for this universally
      fatal disease is desperately needed.

      Results from an open label pilot trial of 20 patients treated with memantine at 10 mg BID
      suggested that treatment with the combination of memantine and riluzole slowed ALS disease
      progression. This trial also showed that levels of specific protein biomarkers in the CSF at
      baseline correlated with the rate of disease progression. A concurrent phase II study
      performed by Dr Carvalho, found no effect with similar dosing; however, the study was limited
      in terms of power. Comments on previous failed drug trials in ALS have raised the concern
      that many ALS trials study a potential therapeutic agent at only a single dose and thus may
      miss the potential efficacy of non FDA approved doses; therefore, this proposed study will
      test a higher dose of memantine, 20 mg BID, in a double blind, placebo controlled, randomized
      trial of 90 patients with ALS to determine if a combination therapy of memantine with
      riluzole can slow disease progression compared to treatment with riluzole alone. The primary
      outcome measure will be the rate of disease progression as measured by the ALS Functional
      Rating Scale- Revised (ALSFRS-R). In addition the investigators will examine the cognitive
      deficits seen in ALS patients measured by the ALS Cognitive Behavioral Screen (ALS-CBS) and
      the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NIP-Q). Finally the investigators will examine
      specific validated protein biomarkers found in the cerebrospinal fluid to determine if there
      is a correlation between the levels of these biomarkers and the rate of disease progression.
      In particular the investigators will measure the ratio of phosphorylated heavy neurofilament
      to Complement 3 to see if this ratio is predictive of disease progression and if the levels
      change during therapy with memantine.

      This project will offer unique insights into this untreatable disease. If this study confirms
      earlier results and suggests that memantine, when used in conjunction with riluzole,
      significantly slows down the progression of the disease, as well as ameliorates cognitive
      deficits in patients with fronto-temporal dysfunction, it will set the groundwork for
      conducting a larger phase III trial.

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be disease progression as measured by the number of points lost on the ALS Functional Rating Scale- Revised (ALSFRS-R) during the 36 weeks of therapy. The patient's rate of progression on active therapy during the 36 week treatment arm will be compared to the rate of progression of the placebo arm. Disease progression in numerous ALS clinical trials has been measured using the ALSFRS-R which is a 12 question rating scale used to determine each participant's assessment of their capability and independence in daily activities. The ALSFRS-R can be administered with high inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability in person or over the phone. The advantages of using such a measurement to determine disease progression are that the categories are relevant to ALS, it is a sensitive and reliable tool, and the rate of decline correlates strongly with survival</description>

    <measure>Measuring the levels of Tau, pNFH and the pNFH/C3 ratio in CSF and blood</measure>
    <time_frame>36 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Preliminary data have demonstrated that there are elevated levels of tau and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNF-H) in the CSF of patients with ALS as compared to healthy controls suggesting that these proteins could also be used for measuring a patient's disease progression. Recently published data have also shown a high sensitivity and specificity for the ratio of pNFH/C3 in the CSF for diagnosing ALS. These combinations of biomarkers could be markers for axonal injury and neuronal cell death.</description>

    <measure>Slowing of behavioral decline in those with FTD characteristics based on the NPI-Q and the ALS-CBS</measure>
    <time_frame>the course of 36 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>It is demonstrated that up to half of patients with ALS may develop cognitive impairment during the course of the disease and up to 40% of ALS patients develop FTD. The ALS Cognitive Behavioral Screen (ALS-CBSâ„¢) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), are two neuropsychological batteries that are validated, brief practical measures that will be administered. Previous data has shown that memantine can slow the progression of behavioral and cognitive decline in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Lewy Body Disease, that there may be potential for a positive effect in patients with ALS. These scales should be great indicators of not only the diagnosis frototemporal dysfunction and even FTD, but also whether memantine can have any positive effect upon the progression of these changes.</description>
