  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a drug called omalizumab (brand name 'Xolair') as a
      potential treatment to be used in conjunction with drug desensitization to prevent reactions
      from recurring and allowing the participant to be treated with the chemotherapy the
      participant's oncologist prefers to give.

      After the screening procedures confirm that eligibility:

        -  The participant will receive a dose of 300mg of omalizumab under the skin every four
           weeks at three separate visits representing a treatment period of 12 weeks.

        -  During the entire course of the study, the participant will continue receiving their
           chemotherapy per their oncologist's prescribed schedule via desensitization supervised
           by an Allergy specialist from the BWH/DFCI Desensitization Team. The participant cannot
           receive omalizumab on the same day as their desensitization however.

        -  A careful review of the participant's symptoms will be done with each desensitization
           while on the study by filling out a questionnaire detailing what reactions, if any, the
           participant experienced with each desensitization during the study period. Additionally,
           the Allergy specialist will be documenting what complications, if any, were experienced
           in the participant's medical record, and this note will also be collected as part of
           their monitoring during the study period.

        -  The participant may have had skin testing to the agent they are being desensitized to in
           the course of the study. This would have been part of the initial allergy consultation
           prior to the participant's enrollment in the Desensitization Program. If the skin
           testing was positive, the participant will have to undergo repeat skin testing to that
           agent at the conclusion of the treatment period (week 12) to see if omalizumab is
           effective in changing skin test outcomes in participant's chemotherapy allergy.

Skin testing will only be done to those patients who have previously had a positive skin test to their agent with earlier drug allergy workup pre-dating enrollment in the trial (all candidate patients have had previous allergy workup to enroll in the desensitization program to begin with). Previous skin test data may not be available because A) the drug being desensitized to causes direct skin irritation, B) skin testing to the drug being desensitized to has unreliable sensitivity and/or specificity, or C) the diagnosis of drug allergy was strongly compelling enough to warrant desensitization even with a negative skin test. workup to enroll in the desensitization program to begin with).</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must meet all of the following criteria on screening examination to be
             eligible to participate in the study:

          -  Patients with type I hypersensitivity reactions to chemotherapy agents including, but
             not exclusive to, platins, taxanes, or monoclonal agents as evidenced by typical
             IgE-mediated symptoms (ie. flushing, hives, dyspnea, wheezing, nausea, itchy eyes,
             nasal congestion, hypotension, angioedema)

          -  For various reasons, some, but not all, patients enrolled in the desensitization
             program may have positive skin test data to confirm an IgE-mediated reaction.

             --These reasons include

               -  1) cutaneous toxicity of the drug precludes testing

               -  2) limited sensitivity of skin testing depending on the drug being tested with

               -  3) lack of adequate testing reagent and controls.

          -  Patients with breakthrough reactions requiring multiple desensitization interventions
             including 16 step protocols and intervention with additional antihistamine (requiring
             &gt;50mg IV diphenhydramine or po hydroxyzine; OR &gt;10mg cetirizine or loratadine)

          -  All cancer patients receiving chemotherapy agents, ages 18 and over.

          -  A positive skin test to the allergy-inducing agent or elevated tryptase level in the
             setting of infusion reaction.

          -  Clinical indication for additional doses of the chemotherapy as determined by the
             patient's oncologist.

          -  Patients stable enough to undergo chemotherapy as determined by the patient's
             oncologist.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.- We expect the majority of study patients to be women with ovarian cancer as
             this patient population frequently receives platin therapy with paclitaxel as first
             line therapy. This patient population also is at highest risk of developing
             hypersensitivity reactions to platin-based agents since these patients often receive
             multiple rounds of chemotherapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be
             eligible for admission into the study.

          -  Medically unable to undergo desensitization.

          -  Unable to provide informed consent.

          -  Known sensitivity to omalizumab.

          -  Participants may not be receiving any other study agents.

          -  Chemotherapy treatment schedule &lt;12 weeks

          -  Pregnant women. Women of child-bearing potential should be using two forms of birth
             control while on the study. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while participating in the study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Patients with underlying primary mast cell disease (ie. mastocytosis)

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because carboplatin, cisplatin, and
             oxaliplatin are chemotherapeutic agent with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with platin-based
             agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued. These potential risks may also apply to
             other agents used in this study.
