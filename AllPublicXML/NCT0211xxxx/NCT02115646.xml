  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying the appearance and function of burn scars after treatment with
      fractionated carbon dioxide laser. The investigators hypothesize that the cosmetic appearance
      and range of motion will improve with treatment.

      The primary goal of the study will analyze whether the fractionated carbon dioxide laser can
      improve other subjective and objective qualities of hypertrophic and/or contracted burn scars
      with or without involvement of nearby mobile joints.

      The investigators hypothesize that fractionated carbon dioxide laser therapy will increase
      range of motion and improve tissue compliance in all scars overlying a mobile joint that has
      been limited due to burn scar contracture. In addition, the investigators will evaluate the
      effect of fractionated carbon dioxide laser therapy on common sequelae of hypertrophic and/or
      contracted burn scars.

    <measure>Scar Pigmentation, Baseline vs 15-months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Using the colorimeter, will measure change in pigmentation of the scar at the conclusion of the study. This tool measures the pigment in a scar, with a possible range of 0-100, with 100 being the darkest hyperpigmentation, and 0 being no hyperpigmentation.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Scar Elasticity, Baseline vs 15-months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is the measure of the elasticity of the scar using a Torque-meter. It is measured on a 0-1 unit scale, with 0 being normal skin elasticity and 1 being completely inelastic.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Scar Thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is an ultrasound measurement using the Dermascan Cyberderm to measure the thickness of the scar at baseline in millimeters.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form 36-item (SF-36) survey is a validated quality of life survey assessing physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to emotional problems, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, and general health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>POSAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) is a validated scale that measures both the patient assessment and the observer assessment on the quality (height, color, stiffness, thickness, symptoms, relief, surface area) of the scar. Scores range from 0-60, with 60 being the worst quality of scar.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy males and females between 5 and 70 years of age with hypertrophic and/or
             contracted burn scars with or without involvement of mobile joints. The burn scars
             must have occurred at least 1 year prior to the date of enrollment.

          -  Having suitable areas of treatment: All wounds in the area of interest must be closed
             for at least two months, and the scars must be deemed stable for a period of 3 months
             before initiation of treatment.

          -  Fitzpatrick skin types I-VI

          -  Able and willing to comply with all visit, treatment and evaluation schedules and
             requirements

          -  Able to understand provide written informed consent

          -  Women of child-bearing age are required to be using a reliable method of birth control
             at least three months prior to study enrollment and throughout the course of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant, intending to become pregnant during the course of the study, less than three
             months postpartum or less than six weeks after completion of breastfeeding.

             study, except for use of aminolevulinic acid(Levulan®) which requires a washout period

          <description>The 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) is a validated quality of life measurement tool. It measures 8 health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. It is scored on a 0-100 scale, with 100 being the least bothersome to quality of life.</description>
