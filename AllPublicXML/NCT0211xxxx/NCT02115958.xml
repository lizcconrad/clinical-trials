  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most studies of cancer stem cells (CSC) involve the inoculation of cells from human tumors
      into immunosuppressed mice, preventing an assessment on the immunologic interactions and
      effects of CSCs. In this study, the investigators examined the vaccination effects produced
      by CSC-enriched populations from histologically distinct murine tumors after their
      inoculation into different syngeneic immunocompetent hosts. Enriched CSCs were immunogenic
      and more effective as an antigen source than unselected tumor cells in inducing protective
      antitumor immunity.Immune sera from CSC-vaccinated hosts contained high levels of IgG which
      bound to CSCs, resulting in CSC lysis in the presence of complement.CTLs generated from
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells or splenocytes harvested from CSC-vaccinated hosts were
      capable of killing CSCs in vitro. Mechanistic investigations established that CSC-primed
      antibodies and T cells were capable of selective targeting CSCs and conferring antitumor
      immunity.

      To assess the feasibility of generating CSC-loaded DC vaccines for clinical use, the
      investigators will harvest peripheral blood and tumor specimen from patients with
      Nasopharyngeal Cancer. The investigators will purify T, B cells and generate DCs from the
      PBMCs of the nasopharyngeal cancer patient.On the other hand, investigators will isolate
      ALDHhigh and ALDHlow tumor cells from the tumor specimen of the nasopharyngeal cancer patient
      using a similar protocol as investigators reported .

      Aim 1: To demonstrate, in vitro, the relative cellular anti-nasopharyngeal cancer CSC
      immunity induced by nasopharyngeal cancer CSC-DC primed cytotoxic T cells.

      Aim 2: To determine, in vitro, specific binding and lysis of nasopharyngeal cancer CSCs by
      antibodies produced by purified B cells from PBMCs stimulated with nasopharyngeal cancer
      CSC-DC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1.patients are greater than 18 years of age, with advanced local disease
             (T3-T4N0-1M0), nodal disease (T1-T2N2-3M0) and loco-regional disease (T3-T4N2-3M0) at
             onset but presently controlled by standard therapy (combination of chemotherapy and
             radiotherapy) or with completely resected metastatic disease.

             2.Pathologic confirmation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma by the NCI Laboratory of
             Pathology (NPC).

             3.serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dl or less. 4.Total bilirubin 1.6 mg/dl or less, except
             for patients with Gilbert's Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0
             mg/dl.

             5.WBC 3000/mm(3) or greater. 6.platelet count 90,000 mm(3) or greater. 7.serum AST/ALT
