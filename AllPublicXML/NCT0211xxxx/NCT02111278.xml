      The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of lumbar manipulation will improve
      function, decrease pain, and recurrence in adolescents with low back pain. The secondary aim
      of this study is to determine if a modification of a clinical prediction rule by Flynn will
      be effective in identifying adolescent patients with low back pain who would benefit from
      lumbar manipulation.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a double blind, randomized controlled, parallel group study. The investigators will
      consider adolescent patients with a primary complaint of low back pain referred to physical
      therapy.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of lumbar manipulation will improve
      function, decrease pain, and recurrence in adolescents with low back pain. The secondary aim
      of this study is to determine if a modification of a clinical prediction rule by Flynn will
      be effective in identifying adolescent patients with low back pain who would benefit from
      lumbar manipulation.

      Prior to randomization, patients will complete several self-report measures and then receive
      a standardized history and physical examination performed by the treating physical therapist.
      The information collected will include age, sex, duration and nature of symptoms.
      Standardized physical examination measures include lumbar active range of motion assessment
      for quality and mobility, lumbar segmental mobility, hip internal rotation range of motion,
      straight leg raise test, and prone instability test. Treating physical therapists were
      trained in all evaluation measures before data collection began. Patients are assessed on
      each item of a modified clinical prediction rule which consists of 4 items; duration of
      symptoms, symptoms distal to knee, Hip Internal Rotation &gt;35 degrees, and presence of lumbar
      segmental hypomobility. The fear avoidance beliefs questionnaire work sub-scale component was
      removed since the score would likely not be valid in the adolescent population. Meeting 3 of
      the 4 items was considered to be positive on the rule in this population.

      The manipulating therapist who performs the intervention will be aware of treatment
      allocation, whereas the treating physical therapist and patients are blinded to treatment
      group allocation. To assess if the patients are successfully blinded to group allocation, the
      investigator will ask each patient to guess which intervention was performed on them
      following discharge from therapy.

      Randomization is determined by checking a randomly generated computer list that tells the
      manipulating therapist the assigned group. The computer list was generated by an aide not
      involved in the study who blindly drew 52 cards that placed an equal number of patients into
      either the manipulation or sham group.

      To address the issue of safety, patients who experience a clinically significant decrease in
      functional ability or increase in pain will be classified as having an adverse reaction. The
      minimally clinical important difference for the Patient Specific Functional Scale is &gt;= 6.
      While the minimal clinical important difference of the Numeric Pain Rating Scale is 2 points.
      Following the manipulation or sham intervention patients will be asked if they experienced
      pain or discomfort during or following the intervention. An interim analysis is planned at
      the midpoint of the study to assess the safety and efficacy of the intervention. If &gt;1/3 of
      patients in the manipulation group have a worsening of symptoms at any follow up, the study
      will be terminated for safety reasons.

    <description>The Patient Specific Functional scale asks the participant to nominate 3 important activities they are not able to do or are having difficulty performing because of their back pain. Each activity is scored on a numerical rating scale from 0 (unable to perform) to 10 (able to perform at pre-injury level).</description>

    <time_frame>1 week, and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Rating of Change scale is a 15-point Likert type scale (-7 to +7). A score of 0 represents no change from initial injury, +7 represents a great deal better, and -7 represents a great deal worse.</description>

    <description>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale is an 11-point pain-rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain) to assess current pain intensity and the best and worst level of pain during the last 24 hours. An average of the 3 ratings will be used.</description>

    <intervention_name>Lumbar Manipulation</intervention_name>
    <description>The manipulating therapist performs the lumbar manipulation technique. With the patient supine, the therapist stands opposite the side to be manipulated. The patient is passively side-bent away from the therapist. The therapist rotates the thoracic spine and then delivers a quick posterior and inferior thrust through the anterior superior iliac spine. The manipulation is performed on the side the patient reported to be more symptomatic. If the patient is unable to identify a more painful side, the side to be manipulated is left to the manipulating therapist discretion. If a cavitation is experienced, no more manipulations are performed that session. If no cavitation is produced, the patient is repositioned, and the manipulation is attempted again. If no cavitation is experienced again, the therapist attempts to manipulate the opposite side. A maximum of two attempts per side will be attempted.</description>

    <intervention_name>Sham Manipulation</intervention_name>
    <description>The manipulating therapist will perform the sham lumbar manipulation technique with the patient side-lying. The therapist passively flexes both hips until slight lumbar flexion is noted at the patient's most painful vertebral level. The therapist will take time palpating patient's spine taking care to avoid rotating the spine. The therapist will then place both hands on the same lumbar spinous process. An equal and opposite force is then applied to the spinous process with both hands. No physiologic motion is expected with this technique. The patient will then be setup for the same sham technique on the opposite side. The sham manipulation technique will be performed in an attempt to blind the patient to group allocation. This technique is designed to provide similar hands on treatment time as the manipulation intervention.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive 4 weeks of physical therapy with 2 visits per week. The treating physical therapist is blinded to group allocation. The treating physical therapist will prescribe exercises based on patient presentation. Therapy visits last approximately 45-60 minutes depending of patient ability to perform exercises. The treating physical therapist will perform no mobilizations or manipulations on the patient.</description>
