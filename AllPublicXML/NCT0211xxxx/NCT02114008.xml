  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To reduce the risk of aspiration for elective procedures, residual gastric volumes (RGV) have
      traditionally been minimized with overnight fasting. However, prolonged fasting can also have
      some adverse consequences and has been abandoned for some procedures in several patient
      populations with the exception of obese and/or diabetic patients. The aim of this study was
      to assess RGV in morbidly obese diabetic patients after traditional or abbreviated fasting.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients underwent two endoscopic examinations within two weeks. RGV was measured by
      aspiration of gastric contentes into a graduated cylinder after traditional fasting (at least
      8 hours before the test) and after abbreviated fasting (3 hours with 200ml of water
      containing 25g of 12.5% maltodextrin). All patients received both oral and written
      information about the protocol at the outpatient clinic.

      All the endoscopic procedures began at 9 AM, and were performed by the same board-certified
      endoscopist, JMS, who was blinded as to the duration of the fast. The endoscopies were
      conducted at Gastroclinica, Cuiaba, MT, in the period from April to June, 2013. Sedation was
      performed by a board-certified anesthesiologist, who was also blinded as to the duration of
      the fast. The anesthetic regimem included a intravenous bolus of 2 ml of lidocaine
      hydrochloride (Astra Zeneca, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil) followed by 100 to 150mg of propofol before
      endoscopy. Digital oximetry was monitored throughout the procedure. Patients were positioned
      in the lateral recumbent position. A flexible electronic videoendoscope (EG2770K; Pentax
      Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) of 9 mm in outer diameter was used. The main outcome variable was
      the RGV measured by the endoscopist after aspiration of gastric residue.
