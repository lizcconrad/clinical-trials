      The current endoscopic methods for diagnosing and monitoring treatment response in
      Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) are costly, inconvenient, and risky. Novel diagnostic methods
      are needed, and the minimally-invasive Cytosponge holds great promise. It has been shown to
      be safe and accurate in Barrett's esophagus, it has the advantage (over the string test) of
      obtaining a true tissue sample, and our preliminary data supports its further study in EoE.
      The proposed prospective cohort study, conducted by experts in esophageal diseases and EoE,
      will assess the accuracy of Cytosponge compared to endoscopy and biopsy in EoE, and determine
      the safety and acceptability of this technique. Use of the Cytosponge would fundamentally
      change the paradigm for clinical management of EoE by allowing collection of non-endoscopic
      esophageal biopsies, thus minimizing the need for invasive testing. It would also facilitate
      future genetic, mechanistic, and pathogenesis research in EoE.

      Study design overview (all Aims) This will be a prospective cohort study, with patient
      enrollment conducted at UNC and Mayo Clinic with sample analysis performed by the University
      of Cambridge. In Aim 1, patients with EoE will be enrolled, tissue will be obtained from both
      the Cytosponge and endoscopy, and the methods will be compared for a single time point to
      determine accuracy of Cytosponge for quantifying esophageal eosinophil counts. In Aim 2, the
      patients who are being treated will be followed and tissue will be assessed over time with
      both Cytosponge and endoscopy to determine the utility of Cytosponge for monitoring treatment
      response in patients with EoE. For all patients, safety will be monitored and subjects will
      complete a survey about the acceptability of Cytosponge (Aim 3).

      Cytosponge protocol:

      After the study has been explained and a patient provides informed consent, the Cytosponge
      will be administered prior to endoscopy by trained research staff under physician
      supervision. If subjects opt to receive a local anesthetic, then they will be provided with a
      2% lidocaine gargle prior to administration of the Cytosponge. The Cytosponge will be
      administered according to it's instructions for use. After retrieval, the string is cut and
      the sponge (which contains the tissue specimen) is placed in a container, immersed in
      fixative, and stored in a refrigerator at 4°C. The fixative is then spun in a centrifuge, and
      the pelleted cells are embedded in a paraffin block using standard techniques.

      Upper endoscopy and biopsy:

      After the Cytosponge has been removed, the patient will undergo standard of care (routine
      care) upper endoscopy and biopsy, as clinically indicated. During this exam, research staff
      will record all endoscopic features of EoE, including rings, furrows, white plaques,
      decreased vascularity, and strictures. The severity of the endoscopy findings will be
      measured using the recently validated EREFS scoring system.23 Four esophageal biopsies will
      be taken both from the distal (5 cm above the gastro-esophageal junction) and proximal (15 cm
      above the gastro-esophageal junction) esophagus. This number of biopsies has been shown to
      maximize the diagnostic sensitivity for EoE.24

      Histology and eosinophil counts:

      All tissue samples from the Cytosponge and endoscopy will be coded with a subject's ID
      number, but will otherwise be masked for all clinical data, including EoE activity, symptoms,
      patient characteristics, and treatments prescribed. Using the paraffin blocks, pathology
      slides will be cut and the tissue processed with routine H&amp;E staining. The slides will then
      be digitized, and using the Aperio ImageScope (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA), the maximum
      eosinophil density (eosinophils/mm2 [eos/mm2]) will be determined using our previously
      validated protocol.25 For purposes of comparison to previous studies, eosinophil density will
      then be converted to eosinophil counts (eos/hpf) for an assumed hpf size of 0.24 mm2, the
      size of an average field as reported in the literature.26 The study pathologists from UNC and
      Mayo Clinic will review the specimens from their sites, and the study pathology from
      Cambridge will provide a second review of all specimens to ensure the most accurate
      quantification of eosinophil counts possible.

      In addition, investigators plan to perform special staining and analysis of the existing
      biopsy and sponge samples with the goal of determining if the diagnostic accuracy of this
      test can be improved. In particular investigators will examine markers of eosinophil
      function, activation, and inflammation, such as eosinophil peroxidase (EPX), a granule
      protein that clearly identifies intact eosinophils, as well as extracellular EPX deposition
      suggestive of degranulation. This can be detected with immunohistochemistry. This would be
      done at Mayo clinic with our current collaborators who currently have the coded specimens.

      Safety and accessibility assessments:

      Patients will be assessed at multiple points to determine the safety of the Cytosponge in
      EoE. Investigators will assess for any symptoms or events as soon as the sponge capsule is
      swallowed, as well as immediately after the expanded sponge is removed. Participants will be
      contacted 1 and 7 days after the endoscopy to assess for adverse events. For Aim 3,
      participants will be administered the acceptability survey at the 7 day follow-up point, so
      patients have adequate time to reflect on their experiences with both tissue collection
      approaches. In particular this survey will record the patient's experience with swallowing
      the Cytosponge, whether they would do it again, and whether they prefer the Cytosponge or
      endoscopy for diagnosis and monitoring of EoE.

    <description>The accuracy of Cytosponge for quantifying esophageal eosinophil counts in patients with active EoE (aim 1) and use in monitoring treatment response in patients with EoE (aim 2) will be assessed through comparing pathology from the Cytosponge with pathology from the gold standard of endoscopy with biopsy. The primary outcome variables will be sensitivity and specificity of the novel assay, compared against the gold standard of the presence of EoE as detected by upper endoscopy with biopsies.</description>

    <description>Acceptability will be measured the Impact of Events Scale. This widely used scale was developed to assess the distress associated with a specific life event. It includes measures of both the intrusiveness of the event, and any avoidance responses by the subject in response to the event. The scale will be administrated both shortly after, and 7 days after, the sampling. In order to allow the subjects to have time to reflect on the experience and to compare with the EGD, the 7 day measurements will represent the primary acceptability outcome of the study. Secondary acceptability outcomes will include a visual analogue scale of acceptability of the Cytosponge, performed after the Cytosponge is administered. Also, the subject will be asked whether he/she would be willing to repeat the assay, and, assuming similar accuracy between Cytosponge and upper endoscopy, whether he/she would rather undergo surveillance by Cytosponge or standard esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsies.</description>

    <description>The Cytosponge™ Cell Collection Device (Cytosponge) is intended to collect surface cells from the esophagus. The device consists of a swallowable capsule, which dissolves in the body cavity, releasing a self-expandable sponge. The sponge is then retrieved from the esophagus using an attached cord. During the retrieval process, the sponge collects cells from the most superficial layer of the esophageal mucosa. Once removed from the body cavity, the sponge and cells are retained for investigation and/or testing. The Cytosponge™ Cell Collection Device (Cytosponge) received 510(k) clearance from the FDA on November 26, 2014 (K142695). The Cytosponge ™ Cell Collection device is a Class II product under 21 CFR 874.4710 esophagoscope (flexible or rigid) and accessories.</description>
