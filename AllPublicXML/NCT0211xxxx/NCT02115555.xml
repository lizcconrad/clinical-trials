    <textblock>
      The study will compare three treatment strategies to look at the best clinical outcomes.

      The investigator hypothesizes that the combined approach of a health information technology
      program plus a conflict-management contract will lead to the best outcomes.

      This study will compare three strategies for enhancing adherence to diabetes care in our
      population. The study will look at which strategy results in the best short-term clinical
      outcomes for the population. Also, the study will look at patient satisfaction of contact
      with his/her health care team, quality of life, and family dynamics.

      The three arms are:

        1. HIT (health information technology) aided approach

        2. Contracted conflict-management strategy

        3. Combination of the HIT-aided approach and the contracted conflict management strategy

The subject will receive messages from the HIT system on the meter based upon the tests. In addition, adolescent-parent pairs will meet with a health educator to establish a behavioral contract that will set patient-centered self-management goals for the adolescent.
