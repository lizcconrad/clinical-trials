    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of ixazomib and to see how well
      it works when given together with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in treating patients with
      relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Ixazomib may stop the growth of cancer by
      interfering with proteasomes (the protein breakdown mechanism in the cells). Pomalidomide and
      dexamethasone can modify and regulate the immune system and may stop cancer cells from
      growing. Giving ixazomib with pomalidomide and dexamethasone may be an effective treatment
      for relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of MLN9708 (ixazomib), when given in
      combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, in patients with relapsed or
      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. (Phase I) II. To estimate the response rate and to
      evaluate the antitumor activity of the three drug combination: MLN9708 (at the RP2D),
      pomalidomide and dexamethasone, in patients with relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple
      myeloma. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of MLN9708 at each dose level when given as part of a three drug
      combination by assessing the following: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course
      and duration of adverse events; and clinical laboratory tests at various points in the study.
      (Phase I) II. To characterize and evaluate toxicities, including type, frequency, severity,
      attribution, time course and duration, at the RP2D, for the three drug combination. (Phase
      II) III. To obtain estimates of response duration, depth of response, clinical benefit
      response, and survival (overall and progression-free), at the RP2D, for the three drug
      combination. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ixazomib followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive ixazomib orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15; dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8,
      15, and 22; and pomalidomide PO on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.

    <description>The highest dose level that produces 1/6 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in course 1 will be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The RP2D of ixazomib and pomalidomide will generally be the MTD, but it may be less than the MTD based on a review of available data/cumulative toxicities from phase I.</description>

    <description>Response rates (overall, clinical benefit) and depth of response will be calculated as the percent of evaluable patients that have confirmed sCR/CR/VGPR or PR (overall) or sCR/CR/VGPR/PR/minimal response (MR) or stable disease (SD) (clinical benefit), exact 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for these estimates.
