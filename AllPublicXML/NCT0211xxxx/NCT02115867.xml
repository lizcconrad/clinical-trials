  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diverticulitis is an extremely common digestive disease particularly found in the large
      intestine in elderly patients and develops from diverticulosis. Diverticulosis is
      characterized by the formation of pouches (diverticula) that bulge to the outside of the
      colon, through areas of weakness in the colonic wall. Inflammation (diverticulitis) results
      if one of these diverticula becomes infected and / or obstructed. It is commonly accompanied
      by obvious or microscopic perforation, ranging in severity from a single, mild, acute attack
      of diverticulitis to more severe attacks characterized by abscess formation, occasionally
      resulting in chronic complications such as obstruction and fistula formation. After an
      episode of diverticulitis many patients develop changes in bowel openings, from diarrhoea and
      constipation, and many patients have abdominal pain and a symptom complex that resembles
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).

      According to available guidelines, treatment of symptomatic, but uncomplicated, diverticular
      disease aims to reduce the frequency and severity of diverticular related symptoms (abdominal
      pain, bloating, alterations in bowel habit) and to prevent complications. Different agents
      have been proposed, such as bulking agents, antispasmodics, and nonabsorbed topical
      antibiotics, 5amino acid preparations but these measures are unproven or controversial. It is
      thought that intestinal bacteria may play a significant role in the symptoms of
      post-diverticulitis.

      The investigators have recently shown that a probiotic (Symprove) reduced the symptoms of IBS
      significantly in comparison with a placebo in a double-blind randomized trial and without
      side effects (paper in preparation). Because the symptoms in IBS and post-diverticulitis are
      so similar the investigators propose a double-blind placebo controlled trial of Symprove in
      patients with problematic diverticulitis. Patients will be recruited from a dedicated
      diverticulitis clinic using standard exclusion criteria. This is a 90 day symptom based trial
      using accepted outcome measures. If successful the results will have widespread implications
      for treatment of diverticular disease.

      The patients for this study will be recruited from the diverticular disease clinic at King's
      College Hospital. The clinic is the first and the largest specialist diverticular clinic in
      the UK and attracts referrals directly from GP's, internal referrals from gastroenterology,
      in and outpatients and increasingly from Gastroenterology and Colorectal Surgery clinics in
      the South East of England. Eligible patients who meet fulfill the entry criteria will be
      invited to participate. They will receive a patient information sheet, which they take home
      with them for reading. They will then be seen again (usually within 2 weeks, or after any
      confirmatory tests have been completed) to discuss any questions that they may have and for a
      decision for inclusion into the trial.

      Each will undergo a full blood count and conventional biochemistry and they will provide a
      stool sample for assessment of intestinal inflammation by a calprotectin estimation. They
      will also complete a baseline symptoms-based questionnaire. They will then be randomized to
      treatments A or B, both investigator and patient will be unaware of whether it is the active
      treatment (Symprove) or placebo. Each patient will complete the symptom-based questionnaire
      every 30 days while on on the 90 day treatment (Day 30, Day 60, and Day 90). The primary
      outcome measure will be a change in symptoms score from Day 0 to Day 90.

      Also every 30 days while on treatment, stool tests will be repeated for faecal calprotectin.
      An additional sample will be frozen for eventual microbiota assessment. The secondary outcome
      measure will be change in the faecal microbiota between Day 0 and Day 90.

      Patients will be seen in clinic 30 days after cessation of the trial (Day 120), at which time
      those patients on placebo will be offered a 90 day free treatment with the active ingredient
      if they so wish.

    <description>The primary outcome in this study is the postulated improvement in symptom severity scores over the 90 day treatment period. There is no generally approved or validated symptom severity scoring system for patients with diverticular disease. In view of the fact that the symptoms (and possible the cause of symptoms) of post-diverticulitis is almost identical to that of IBS we propose to use this scoring system and we have added a separate additional pain score outcome as this is the principal symptoms that diverticulitis patients experience. In addition to the symptoms based assessment, patients will complete an SF-8 questionnaire. Both questionnaires will be completed prior to treatment initiation (Day 0) and again at the end of treatment (Day 90). The change from baseline symptoms score to symptoms score at Day 90 will be the primary outcome measurement.</description>
