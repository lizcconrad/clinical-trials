    <description>The recruited subjects will receive 20-session device assisted upper limb training with an intensity of 3 to 5 sessions/week, which will be finished within 7 consecutive weeks. In each session, the subjects will conduct the system assisted and task-oriented upper limb training for 1.5 hours.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The recruited subjects will

          -  have unilateral ischemic brain injury or intracerebral hemorrhage at least 6 months
             after the onset of single stroke

          -  have moderate level of motor impairment in the affected upper limb, assessed by
             Fugl-Meyer Assessment (9&lt;shoulder/elbow&lt;27; 6&lt;wrist/hand&lt;18)

          -  have enough cognition to be able to follow the training protocol as assessed by
             Mini-metal State Examination (MMSE&gt;21)

          -  have detectable EMG signals (3 times of the standard deviation above the baseline)
             from the upper limb muscles.
