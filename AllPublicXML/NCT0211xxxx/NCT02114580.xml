  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to explore brain mechanisms mediating the cognitive benefits of
      aerobic exercise in patients with mild cognitive impairment- a prodromal stage of Alzheimer
      disease. We will perform FMRI experiments, as well as laboratory and behavioral tests that
      will advance our knowledge about the nature of these mechanisms. Participants will
      participate in individual- tailored aerobic training program. Pre and post evaluation will
      identify brain changes following the training using advanced techniques of brain imaging.
      Cognitive performance will be assessed prior and at the end of the program, as well as
      endocrine markers reflecting improvement in learning abilities. Moreover, demonstrating
      cortical plasticity in subjects with aMCI has tremendous practical significance for these
      subjects .

    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of Alzheimer disease (AD), refers to a
      transitional state between the cognition of normal aging and dementia such AD. To date,
      therapeutic approaches to AD are symptomatic and of modest efficacy. Nontheless, recent
      studies in animal models or healthy subjects, have shown that aerobic exercise affect brain
      plasticity. The current proposal aims at exploring the brain mechanisms mediating the
      cognitive benefits of aerobic exercise in patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI),in compare to a
      control group of subjects with aMCI receiving stretching exercise. More specifically, we aim
      to perform two fMRI experiments, that will advance our knowledge about the nature of
      mechanism of the cognitive benefit resulting of aerobic exercise. Our preleminary results
      suggest that subjects with aMCI show different hierarchy of reliable responses when
      processing long time scales in auditory task. Therefore, in the first experiment, we will
      evaluate how these patterns of temporal hierarchy of language processing are affected by
      aerobic exercise. Next, we will explore whether aerobic exercise affect memory enocoding
      task, which rely on areas in the medial temporal lobe who bear a heavy neuropathological
      burden in MCI. The insights gained from the study may have important clinical implications
      for patients who are at the early stages of Alzheimer's disease

    <description>Participants in both the aerobic and stretching groups will carry out their activity routines 3 d/wk for 45 to 60 minutes per session for 4 months. Training will be on &quot;one on one&quot; basis, where each participant will be supervised by an experienced trainer at the participant's home.Aerobic intervention protocol: subjects will practice with stationary bicycle. Exercise intensity will be monitored through wireless HR monitor. Participants will be also monitored for the intensity of their workouts by the Borg's Rating of Perceived Exertion and the &quot;talk&quot; test (a subjective method for estimating of appropriate cardiorespiratory exercise intensity).
Stretching exercise protocol: Participants in the stretching control group will carry out a prescribed routine of stretching and balance exercises.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Only patients at the age of 60-90 who have met criteria for a diagnosis of MCI will be
             included.

          -  Participants will be both men and women, and this factor is not specifically
             addressed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with any significant medical (i.e. cardiac), neurological (other than MCI)
             illness will be excluded from the study.

          -  Medical and neurological illnesses will be ruled out by physical and neurological
             examinations, reports of the patients' treating physicians and medical records.

          -  The experiments will be undertaken in compliance with the safety guidelines for MRI
             research. Based on initial fMRI screening questionnaires, subjects will be excluded if
             they indicate any risk factor on these questionnaires.
