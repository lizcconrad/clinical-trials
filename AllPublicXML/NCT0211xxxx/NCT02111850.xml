  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patients with
      metastatic cancer that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing them in
      the laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying these specific cells with a type of
      virus (retrovirus) to attack only the tumor cells, and then giving the cells back to the
      patient. This type of therapy is called gene transfer. In this protocol, we are modifying the
      patient s white blood cells with a retrovirus that has the gene for anti-MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402
      incorporated in the retrovirus.

      Objective:

      The purpose of this study is to determine a safe number of these cells to infuse and to see
      if these particular tumor-fighting cells (anti-MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402 cells) cause tumors to
      shrink and to be certain the treatment is safe.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults age 18-70 with metastatic cancer expressing the MAGE-A3 molecule.

      Design:

        -  Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and
           undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as
           needed

        -  Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will
           undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti-MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402
           cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells
           from the patient.}

        -  Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital
           for the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti-MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402 cells and aldesleukin.
           They will stay in the hospital for approximately 4 weeks for the treatment.

        -  Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side
           effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every
           6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking.

      Background:

        -  We have constructed a single retroviral vector that contains both and $ &lt;= chains of a T
           cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes the DP0401/0402 restricted MAGE-A3 tumor antigen,
           which can be used to mediate genetic transfer of this TCR with high efficiency.

        -  In co-cultures with HLA-DP0401/0402 and MAGE-A3 double positive tumors, the anti-
           MAGE-A3- DP0401/0402 restricted (anti-MAGE-A3-DP4) TCR transduced T cells secreted
           significant amounts of IFN-y with high specificity.

      Objectives:

      Primary objectives:

        -  Determine a safe dose of the administration of autologous CD4 cells transduced with an
           anti- MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402 restricted (MAGE-A3-DP4) TCR and aldesleukin to patients
           following a nonmyeloablative but lymphoid depleting preparative regimen.

        -  Determine if this approach will result in objective tumor regression in patients with
           metastatic cancer expressing MAGE-A3-DP4.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen.

      Eligibility:

      Patients who are HLA-DP0401/0402 positive and 18 years of age or older must have

        -  Metastatic cancer whose tumors express the MAGE-A3-DP4 antigen;

        -  Previously received and have been a non-responder to or recurred following at least one
           first line treatment for metastatic disease;

      Patients may not have:

      - Contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration.

      Design:

        -  PBMC obtained by leukapheresis will be enriched for CD4 cells and transduced with the
           retroviral vector supernatant encoding the anti-MAGE-A3-DP4 TCR.

        -  The study will begin in a standard phase I dose escalation. After the MTD cell dose has
           been determined, patients will be enrolled into the phase 2 portion of the trial at the
           MTD established during the phase I portion of the study. In the phase 2 portion,
           patients will be entered into two cohorts: cohort 1 will include patients with
           metastatic melanoma; cohort 2 will include patients with renal cancer and other types of
           metastatic cancer.

        -  Patients will receive a nonmyeloablative but lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen
           consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by intravenous infusion of ex
           vivo tumor reactive, TCR gene-transduced PBMC plus IV aldesleukin.

        -  Patients will undergo complete evaluation of tumor response every 1-6 months until off
           study criteria are met.

        -  For each of the 2 strata evaluated in the phase 2 portion, the study will be conducted
           using a phase II optimal design where initially 21 evaluable patients will be enrolled.
           For each of these two arms of the trial, if 0 or 1 of the 21 patients experiences a
           clinical response, then no further patients will be enrolled but if 2 or more of the
           first 21 evaluable patients enrolled have a clinical response, then accrual will
           continue until a total of 41 evaluable patients have been enrolled in that stratum.

        -  For both strata, the objective will be to determine if the treatment regimen is able to
           be associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of a
           modest 20% PR + CR rate (p1=0.20).

        -INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Metastatic or locally advanced refractory/recurrent cancer that expresses MAGE-A3 as
             assessed by one of the following methods: RT-PCR on tumor tissue defined as 30,000
             copies of MAGE-A3 per 10^6 GAPDH copies, or by immunohistochemistry of resected tissue
             defined as 10% or greater of tumor cells being 2-3+ for MAGE-A3, or serum antibody
             reactive with MAGE-A3. Metastatic cancer diagnosis will be confirmed by the Laboratory
             of Pathology at the NCI.

          2. Patients must have previously received prior first line standard therapy (or effective
             salvage chemotherapy regimens) for their disease, if known to be effective for that
             disease, and have been either non-responders (progressive disease) or have recurred.

          3. Patients must be HLA-DP4 positive.

          4. Patients with 3 or fewer brain metastases that are less than 1 cm in diameter and
             asymptomatic are eligible. Lesions that have been treated with stereotactic
             radiosurgery must be clinically stable for 1 month after treatment for the patient to
             be eligible. Patients with surgically resected brain metastases are eligible.

          5. Greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to age 70.

          6. Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign the Informed Consent
             Document.

               -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
                  this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV
                  seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to
                  the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)

               -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody.
                  If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be tested for the
                  presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

         11. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.

          2. Active systemic infections, (e.g.: requiring anti-infective treatment), coagulation
             disorders or any other active major medical illnesses

          3. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency
             Disease).

          4. Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
