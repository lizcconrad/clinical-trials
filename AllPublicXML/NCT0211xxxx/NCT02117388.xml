      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative efficacy and effectiveness of specific
      components of cognitive behavioral therapies for insomnia: sleep restriction (SR) and
      cognitive therapy (CT) in comparison to combined SR and CT (SR+CT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As many as one in three older adults may experience insomnia. Older adults are the most
      frequent users of hypnotic medications. Although safer, use of even the latest &quot;sleeping
      pills&quot; can lead to cognitive impairment and risk of falls. Thus, it is not surprising that
      non-pharmacological treatments for insomnia have been pursued as alternatives to medications,
      with some suggesting they should be the &quot;first line of therapy&quot;. We propose a randomized
      clinical trial to evaluate the relative efficacy and effectiveness of specific components of
      cognitive behavioral therapies for insomnia (CBT-I): sleep restriction (SR) and cognitive
      therapy (CT) in comparison to combined SR and CT (SR+CT). We hypothesize that because the
      proposed mechanisms of action of CT versus SR substantially differ, their combination may
      have additive effects. Even though the mechanisms of action of SR and CT may differ, no data
      exists to document that the addition of one to the other provides more overall clinical
      benefit than either intervention alone. Finally, to better understand &quot;how&quot; and &quot;in whom&quot; SR
      and CT work, we plan to formally evaluate selected mediators and moderators of the clinical
      effect including physiological measures of anxiety and arousal. Three treatments (SR, CT, and
      SR+CT) will be compared in a randomized clinical trial with a parallel groups design.
      Efficacy and effectiveness data will be collected prior to the beginning of treatment, after
      6 weeks of treatment, and at the end of a 6-month follow-up. These efforts follow the
      National Institute of Mental Health Strategic Plan Strategy 3.1 to develop innovative
      interventions and designs for intervention studies, in this case, to promote a new
      intervention trial that focuses on the mediators and moderators of treatment response.
