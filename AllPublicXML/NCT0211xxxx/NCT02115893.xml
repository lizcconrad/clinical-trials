      The main aim of the current study will be to find the optimal duration of supplementation to
      enhance sports performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral ingestion of nitrate (NO3-) in the form of both nitrate salts and beetroot juice has
      been shown to significantly lower blood pressure at rest and to also lower pulmonary oxygen
      uptake during exercise, in addition to improving exercise performance during cycle time
      trial. However, there has been no consensus on the optimal supplementation protocols, in
      terms of duration of supplementation to see these metabolic effects. Furthermore, a positive
      exercise performance effect of nitrate ingestion has primarily been observed in recreational
      athletes. The potentially ergogenic effects of nitrate in well-trained or elite athletes
      therefore remain to be fully established. Based on the gaps in current literature, our main
      goal will be to gain further insight into different aspects of nitrate supplementation to
      enhance (elite) sports performance. This will be investigated in this study by assessing the
      effect of an acute vs. chronic supplementation period of sodium nitrate (NaNO3-) on exercise
      performance.
