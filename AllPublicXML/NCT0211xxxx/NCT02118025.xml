  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to evaluate the clinical results and the inflammatory response of the
      minimal extracorporeal circulation system (MECC) Compared with off-pump coronary
      revascularization (OPCABG).

      This is a randomized and prospective study in 230 patients with indications for coronary
      surgery, with 113 patients in the OPCABG group and 117 in the MECC group. The endpoints were
      the clinical and biochemical results, intra-operative outcomes and the determination of 19
      inflammatory circulating markers, 17 of them for the first time analyzed comparing both
      techniques.
