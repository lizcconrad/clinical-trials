  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Haemorrhage following major trauma is an important preventable cause of death. Those patients
      who survive may have a prolonged period of debility caused by failure of key body organs. We
      suspect that an important contributor to this organ failure may be dysfunction in the network
      of small blood vessels that supply the bodies organs with oxygen and nutrients. Our study
      will examine the link between the microcirculation and organ failure in patients who have
      suffered significant bleeding after traumatic injury. We will also explore the relationship
      between resuscitation of the global circulation (blood pressure, cardiac output etc.)an area
      that is monitored in clinical practice with the state of the microcirculation, which by
      contrast is not monitored. Patients with severe traumatic injury commonly have problems with
      blood clotting. Some researchers have suggested that microcirculatory failure may be an
      important contributor to this problem and we will explore this in more detail. Finally, we
      will attempt to examine some of the mechanisms by which the microcirculation may be disrupted
      by trauma and subsequent bleeding. These may include inappropriate activation of white blood
      cells, inadequate function of oxygen carrying red blood cells and changes to the cells lining
      the small blood vessels.

      We will use a non invasive method to assess the microcirculation termed Side Stream Dark
      Field microscopy. This involves recorded a video image of the movement of blood within the
      small blood vessels under a patients tongue. In addition we will use ultrasound to assess the
      flow of blood from the heart. Small samples of blood will be taken to assess blood clotting
      and to look at possible mechanisms of microcirculatory dysfunction.

      We aim to study ten patients in the first instance. The study will be carried out within the
      intensive care units at Kings College Hospital.
