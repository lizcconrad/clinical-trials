      Social cognition impairments was highlighted for persons suffering with schizophrenia by
      numerous studies. The use of treatment programs intended to treat specifically these deficits
      through procedures of cognitive remediation, will allow decreasing their impact on everyday
      life by improving abilities to understand and interact with others. Such tools could allow
      also profits in terms of reduction of positive and negative of schizophrenia. The Gaïa
      program is intended to improve the perception of the facial affects which is one of social
      cognition processes impaired in schizophrenia.

      Methods:

      This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled study comparing people aged 18 to 45 years with
      a diagnostic of schizophrenia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical manuel of Mental
      disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV-TR).

      The GAÏA program will be compared to an already validated neurocognitive remediation program,
      training attentional processes (RECOS).

      100 patients will be randomized as follows: Arm 1, experimental: Gaïa (20h with therapist,
      computer assisted method) Arm 2, control: RECOS (20h with therapist, computer assisted
      method)

      Condition: Schizophrenia Intervention: Behavioural: computer assisted cognitive remediation

      Hypothesis:

      A targeted cognitive remediation will more increased abilities in facial affects recognition
      processes than a non specific, attentional cognitive remediation.

      Primary outcome measures:

      - Change from baseline in performances in the Facial Emotion Recognition Task (TREF) after 10
      weeks and 20 session of treatment.

      Secondary outcome measures

        -  Change from baseline in clinical, psychosocial, social cognition and neurocognitive
           measures, after 10 weeks and 20 session of treatment and at 6 months follow-up.

        -  Change from baseline in performances in the Facial Emotion Recognition Task (TREF) after
           treatment and 6 months follow-up.

      Purpose:

      Rationale:

      Social cognition impairments was highlighted for persons suffering with schizophrenia by
      numerous studies. The use of treatment programs intended to treat specifically these deficits
      through procedures of cognitive remediation, will allow decreasing their impact on everyday
      life by improving abilities to understand and interact with others. Such tools could allow
      also profits in terms of reduction of positive and negative of schizophrenia. The Gaïa
      program is intended to improve the perception of the facial affects which is one of social
      cognition processes impaired in schizophrenia.

      Methods:

      This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled study comparing people aged 18 to 45 years with
      a diagnostic of schizophrenia according to the DSM-IV-TR.

      The Gaïa program will be compared to an already validated neurocognitive remediation program,
      training attentional processes (RECOS).

      100 patients will be randomized as follows:

        1. Arm 1,Experimental: Gaïa (20h with therapist, computer assisted method)

             -  10 week-treatment, with 2 sessions of 1 hour per week, and 1 homework exercise
                without therapist per week.Individual therapy.

             -  Gaïa exercises were designed by B. Gaudelus and tutoractiv' company, for specific
                use in schizophrenia. It includes computer based and paper &amp; pen, photos and role
                games exercises targeting the recognition of facial emotions.

             -  Computer based exercises have 5 increasing difficulty levels.

             -  Each participant practices all the modules of Gaïa.

        2. Arm 2, control: RECOS (20h with therapist, computer assisted method)

             -  10 week-treatment, with 2 sessions of 1 hour per week and 1 homework exercise
                without therapist per week.Individual therapy.

             -  RECOS (Cognitive Remediation for Schizophrenia) exercises were designed by
                Scientific Brain Training (SBT) company and P. Vianin in year 2007 for specific use
                in schizophrenia.

             -  It includes computer based and paper &amp; pen exercises.

             -  Only the RECOS attentional function module is used in the study (5 modules
                available in the program) with gradual difficulty in 10 levels

      Condition: Schizophrenia Intervention: Behavioural: computer assisted cognitive remediation

      Study type: interventional

      Study design:

        -  Allocation: randomized

    <description>RECOS (Cognitive REmediation for Schizophrenia): 20 hours individual cognitive remediation with therapist, 10 tasks at home, 10 week-treatment.
RECOS is a validated cognitive remediation program, developed by P. Vianin and SBT company. It includes paper and pen and computer based exercises. The original program proposes 5 modules targeting 5 cognitive functions, each patient participated in the module corresponding to his/her most altered cognitive function. In this study, all patients randomized in this arm are allocated in the attentional module.Every computer exercises have 10 difficulty levels.
2 sessions of one hour per week with therapist.
Tasks at home are given once a week and targeting functional outcome</description>

    <description>2 sessions of one hour per week with therapist. Intervention proposes 3 stages : 1)discovering and learning facial affects recognition and discrimination criterions for joy, sadness and anger (photos exercises); 2) facial affect recognition training (computer based and role game exercises); 3) generalization to other emotions (photos, role games and computer based exercises).
The therapist chooses the change of stages; 5 sessions or more are proposed for the generalization stage.</description>
