    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate FUSE-colonoscopy in terms of feasibility and its
      possible additive contribution in the detection of important lesions, namely polyps and
      cancers, compared to the standard &quot;forward-viewing&quot; approach, with and without the addition
      of the right-colon retroflexion technique, in a series of patients undergoing back-to-back
      screening or surveillance colonoscopies in a randomized fashion.

      We changed the anticipated number of subjects enrollment for study: NCT02117674 from 120 to
      200 based on the following sample size estimation:

      Tandem colonoscopies studies results, show that novel endoscopic technologies detect about
      20% more adenomas than those conventional colonoscopy does (missed adenomas). Since FUSE
      colonoscopy cannot be considered as a perfect examination, we hypothesize that conventional
      colonoscopy will detect one third of the missed adenomas that FUSE detects in a similar
      setting. Therefore a sample size of 120 adenomas achieves 80% power to detect an odds ratio
      of 3.0 using a two-sided McNemar test with a significance level of 0.05. The odds ratio is
      equivalent to a difference between two paired proportions of 14% which occurs when the
      proportion of detected missed adenomas during FUSE is 21% and the proportion of missed
      adenomas during conventional colonoscopy is 7%. During one year period before the study
      initiation, our colonoscopy performance quality data show that we detect a mean number of
      adenomas per patient equal of 0.7 in a population similar to the one recruited in our study.
      Therefore, 172 patients overall will be required to detect 120 adenomas. Given the
      uncertainty of our estimation and in order to cope with patients exclusions, withdrawals and
      unexpected incomplete colonoscopies, we decided to recruit 200 patients.
