  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedation drugs that are commonly used in ICU in treatment of ARDS, includes propofol,
      midazolam and dexmedetomidine . Among these, both dexmedetomidine and propofol have been
      reported to be used together with midazolam in ICU and the combination of propofol and
      midazolam is most commonly used, but things follow include a high incidence rate of delirium,
      But the combination of midazolam and dexmedetomidine may have complementary advantages and
      could have be a better choice for sedation. In this study, we attempted to observe the
      effects of two different drug regimens on delirium incidence rates in severe ARDS patients' :
      midazolam and propofol vs propofol and dexmedetomidine .
