  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus. It is the most common cause
      of serious liver disease in the United States. Many people have few if any symptoms. It can
      lead to cirrhosis, which can cause liver failure and cancer. Researchers want to study how a
      medicine called chlorcyclizine works in patients with hepatitis C. They want to see if it can
      be used to treat hepatitis C alone or when used with the standard hepatitis C treatment drug
      ribavirin.

      Objectives:

      - To see if chlorcyclizine can be used to treat hepatitis C alone or in combination with the
      drug ribavirin.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults with chronic hepatitis C who either have never been treated for it or have relapsed
      after prior treatment.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, blood and urine
           tests, and a questionnaire. They will also have an ultrasound of their abdomen and
           electrocardiogram. Some of these tests will be repeated throughout the study.

        -  Participants will spend 3 days as an inpatient to be monitored while starting study
           drug. They will be assigned randomly to a group and will begin taking the study drug.
           Blood will be taken frequently.

        -  Group I will take the study drug twice a day for 28 days.

        -  Group II will take the study drug twice a day and ribavirin twice a day for 28 days.

        -  Participants will visit the clinic every 7 days for 28 days.

        -  After participants stop taking the study drug, they will have 5 follow-up visits over 3
           months.

      Up to 50 patients with chronic hepatitis C, who are treatment na(SqrRoot) ve or relapsers to
      any interferon/ribavirin regimen will be enrolled into this pilot study evaluating
      chlorcyclizine HCl with or without ribavirin (RBV) as antiviral therapy. Adult patients
      (greater than or equal to18 years of age) with evidence of active chronic hepatitis C
      infection (all genotypes) with detectable HCV RNA in serum &gt;10,000 IU/mL without
      contraindications to chlorcyclizine HCl or ribavirin or evidence/history of hepatic
      decompensation will be enrolled. Patients will be monitored for at least two months with
      regular testing for ALT and HCV RNA quantitative levels before treatment and will undergo
      admission to start therapy, which includes a thorough medical evaluation and timed blood
      sampling. Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment groups; one with chlorcyclizine
      HCl (75 mg twice daily) and the other with RBV+ chlorcyclizine HCl (75 mg twice daily). For
      all genotypes, RBV will be dosed based on weight (1000 mg daily &lt;75 kg and 1200 mg daily
      greater than or equal to 75 kg). At each clinic visit, patients will be questioned about side
      effects and symptoms, undergo a focused physical examination, and have blood taken for
      complete blood counts, HCV RNA, PT/INR and routine liver tests (ALT, AST, alkaline
      phosphatase, direct and total bilirubin, and albumin). At the end of 28 days of treatment,
      patients will undergo a repeat thorough medical evaluation inclusive of a complete physical
      exam, symptom scale evaluation, complete blood counts, routine liver tests, and HCV serology
      panels. The primary endpoint of therapy will be a decline in quantitative HCV RNA viral
      levels after 28 days of treatment as compared to baseline viral titers and between groups.
      Several secondary endpoints will be measured, including side effects of therapy, ALT levels,
      quantification of chlorcyclizine HCl and its metabolites in serum, and quality of life.
      Therapy will be stopped for intolerance to RBV and/or chlorcyclizine HCl (which will be
      carefully defined).
