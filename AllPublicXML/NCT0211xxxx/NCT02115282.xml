      This randomized phase III trial studies exemestane and entinostat to see how well they work
      compared to exemestane alone in treating patients with hormone receptor-positive breast
      cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or another place in the body. Estrogen
      can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Endocrine therapy using exemestane may fight
      breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. Entinostat may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet
      known whether exemestane is more effective with or without entinostat in treating breast
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether the addition of entinostat to endocrine therapy (exemestane) improves
      progression-free survival (PFS) and/or overall survival (OS) in patients with hormone
      receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have previously progressed on a non-steroidal
      aromatase inhibitor (Al).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of entinostat in combination with exemestane, and
      to compare the safety profile to that of endocrine therapy with placebo.

      II. To evaluate the objective response rate of exemestane in combination with entinostat or
      placebo.

      III. To evaluate whether the efficacy of exemestane with entinostat varies with changes in
      acetylation status in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

      IV. To evaluate the time to treatment deterioration (as defined by decrease in health-related
      quality of life [HRQL], progression, death) of exemestane + entinostat versus exemestane +
      placebo arms.

      V. To evaluate the differences in overall health-related quality of life (HRQL) between the
      exemestane + entinostat versus exemestane + placebo arms.

      VI. To evaluate the difference with respect to specific symptoms that are associated with
      entinostat, i.e., fatigue, nausea, anorexia and diarrhea, between the exemestane + entinostat
      versus exemestane + placebo arms.

      VII. To measure adherence to protocol therapy. VIII. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of
      entinostat in patients with advanced breast cancer.

      IX. To evaluate what, if any, patient variables alter the pharmacokinetic profile of
      entinostat in patients with advanced breast cancer.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect archival tumor samples and germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to explore
      other potential biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy.

      II. To collect patient ratings of adverse events (AEs) using select patient-reported outcomes
      (PRO)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) items to evaluate the
      psychometric properties of PRO-CTCAE items and explore the incorporation of PRO-CTCAE items
      into a phase III double-blind placebo-controlled trial.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive exemestane orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and entinostat PO
      on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive exemestane as in Arm A and placebo PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      In both arms, pre/perimenopausal female patients and all male patients also receive goserelin
      acetate subcutaneously (SC) on day 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 5 years.

    <time_frame>Time from randomization to the earliest of documented disease progression, new primary breast cancer, or death without progression, assessed up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method, with 95% confidence intervals calculated using Greenwood's formula. In the primary analysis of PFS, differences in treatment effect will be tested using stratified log rank tests, stratifying on the randomization stratification factors. Stratified univariate and multivariable Cox proportional-hazard models will be built to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for treatment effect for PFS as a supportive analysis. In all analyses, P-values will be two-sided.</description>

    <description>The distribution of OS will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method, with 95% confidence intervals calculated using Greenwood's formula. In the primary analyses of OS, differences in treatment effect will be tested using stratified log rank tests, stratifying on the randomization stratification factors. Stratified univariate and multivariable Cox proportional-hazard models will be built to estimate the HRs for treatment effect for OS as a supportive analysis. In all analyses, P-values will be two-sided.</description>

    <measure>Objective response, defined as the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) among all patients assessed per RESIST v1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response in the two arms will be evaluated by comparing objective response rate (ORR, PR+CR) using a Fisher's exact test on the intention-to-treat patients with one-sided type I error of 2.5%. ORR will be summarized along with the exact binomial 95% confidence interval. In all analyses, P-values will be two-sided.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>All treatment-emergent and baseline adverse events and hematological/biochemical toxicities based on laboratory measurements, as well as drug related AEs, will be summarized by treatment group and worst grade. The incidence of deaths and treatment-emergent serious AEs (defined as number of patients experiencing the AE divided by all treated patients) will be summarized and compared between treatment arms using Fisher's exact test. Also, the incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation of investigational product and/or withdrawal from the study will be summarized and listed.</description>

    <time_frame>Time from randomization to disease progression or death or worsening of symptoms, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of TTD will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method, and TTD comparisons between treatment arms will be tested primarily using log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazards models will be conducted to estimate the HR for treatment effect for TTD as a supportive analysis.</description>

    <measure>Percent change in protein lysine acetylation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 70 months</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of the percentage change in protein lysine acetylation will be plotted for the two treatment groups and difference will be compared using the Wilcoxon ranks sum test. Tumor response rate will be compared between the patients with percentage change in acetylation being above or below median using Fisher's exact tests in each treatment arm. In all analyses, P-values will be two-sided and a level of 5% will be considered statistically significant.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Overall HRQL score measured by the Trial Outcome Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Mixed effect models will be constructed to estimate the time profile of HRQL in the two treatment arms and to evaluate treatment-by-time interactions. Time will be included as a continuous variable if there is a linear trend in HRQL over time or a set of dummy variables if non-linear trend exits for HRQL. PROs will be correlated with PFS (prognostic value of PROs) in the study patients. Kaplan-Meier method, log rank test and Cox models will be used to compare PFS between patients with good quality of life (QOL) and those with poor QOL in the overall patient population.</description>

    <measure>Adherence to study</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of the adherence score for each agent will be displayed via box-and-whisker plot. The proportion of high, medium and low adherence to each agent will be calculated along with the binomial exact 95% confidence interval. The proportion of high adherence to entinostat and placebo will be compared between arms A and B using Fisher exact test.
