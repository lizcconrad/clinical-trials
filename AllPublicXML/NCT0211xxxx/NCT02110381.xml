  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 76 million adults in the United States over the age of 20 have hypertension
      (HTN); which translates into 1 out of 3 adults. Globally the prevalence of HTN is over 25%
      for adults, and accounts for approximately 13.5% of all deaths. Given the aging of the
      population together with increases in obesity and sedentary behavior, it is not surprising
      that HTN is projected to increase significantly over the next several decades; with over 1.5
      billion adults having HTN by the year 2025. Thus the public health implications to preventing
      and/or reducing elevations in blood pressure are substantial.

      This study compares the efficacy of two different non-pharmacologic interventions (device
      guided breathing and isometric hand grip exercises) used alone and in combination for
      lowering blood pressure. This pilot study will include 30 adults with stage 1 hypertension.
      The primary outcome is the change in blood pressure from baseline to 8 weeks. Secondary
      outcomes include change in blood pressure from 8 weeks to 16 weeks and acceptability of the
      interventions by participants. The knowledge gained from this study can provide information
      on non-pharmacologic methods that may be useful in decreasing blood pressure. Such knowledge
      may be especially useful for patients for whom access to medications and health care is
      limited and among patients unwilling to take or intolerant to pharmacologic therapies.

    <intervention_name>Device guided breathing RESPeRATE</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will use a device called RESPeRATE which will measure how many breaths they take per minute. A strap wraps around the participants chest that measures breathing frequency. Headphones plug into the device to inform participants about their breathing. The device will help guide participants to breathe slowly using musical tones, with a goal of about ten breaths per minute.
Participants will use the breathing device 5 days per week for about 15 minutes each day. Participants will keep a log of their exercises and return it with each visit.</description>

A session consists of 2 minutes of squeezing the device followed by 1 minute of rest. Participants will do a total of 4 sessions (2 sessions for each hand) for a total of about 12 minutes of exercise.
Participants will do these exercises 5 days per week. Participants will keep a log of their exercise and return it with each visit.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>After consent, participants completed a run-in period in which they measured their blood pressure at home for 2 weeks. Participants with multiple readings greater than 160mmHg SBP or 100mmHg DBP were considered screen failures (n=13, plus 1 withdrawal).</pre_assignment_details>

            <description>Participants will first do device guided breathing for 8 weeks, followed by 8 weeks of doing BOTH the device guided breathing AND the hand grip exercises.
Device guided breathing: Participants will use a device (RESPeRATE) to guide them through slow controlled breathing, with a goal of about ten breaths per minute.
Participants will use the breathing device 5 days per week for about 15 minutes each day. Participants will keep a log of their exercises and return it with each visit.
Isometric hand grip: Participants will use a device (Zona Plus) which they will hold in their hand and squeeze. A session consists of 2 minutes of squeezing followed by 1 minute of rest. Participants will do a total of 4 sessions (2 sessions for each hand) for a total of about 12 minutes of exercise.
