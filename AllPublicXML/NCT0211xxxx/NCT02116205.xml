  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the immune responses of two different doses (1.0 mg
      and 2.0 mg) and two different dosing schedules (two doses or three doses) of a mixed Hantaan
      virus (HTNV) and Puumala virus (PUUV) DNA vaccine in healthy participants. To maintain a
      blind, participants in the two-dose group will receive one dose of normal saline placebo. All
      of the groups will also receive a booster dose 6 months after first vaccination. The results
      will help to determine which dose and vaccination schedule will be best to move forward in
      the vaccine development process.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adult male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female, ages 18-49 (inclusive) at
             the time of screening

          -  Have provided written informed consent before screening

          -  Free of clinically significant health problems, as determined by pertinent medical
             history and clinical examination prior to entry into the study

          -  Available and able to participate for all study visits and procedures

          -  Females, if sexually active, are known to be at least one year post-menopausal

             intrauterine device, condom, anatomical sterility [self or partner]) from the date of
             screening until at least 3 months after the last injection

          -  Ongoing participation in another clinical trial

          -  Receipt or planned receipt of any vaccination, experimental or otherwise within the

             obscured due to a physical condition or permanent body art

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant hematologic, pulmonary, cardiovascular, or
             hepatic or renal functional abnormality as determined by the investigator based on

                  equal to 0.5 mg/kg/day

               2. Intranasal and topical steroids are allowed

          -  Any chronic or active neurologic disorder, including seizures and epilepsy, excluding
             a single febrile seizure as a child

          -  Syncopal episode within 12 months of screening
