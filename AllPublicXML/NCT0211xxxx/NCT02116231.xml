      The study is designed to compare Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) in combination with
      concurrent chemotherapy and IMRT alone in treatment of stage II nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is endemic in Southern China, Southeast Asia, the Arctic, and
      mid-East/North Africa. NPC prevalence is reported to be highest in southern China, where an
      average of 80 cases per 100,000 population are reported each year. It is both radiosensitive
      and chemosensitive. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (version 1,
      2013), have recommended use of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with or without adjuvant
      chemotherapy (AC) as standard treatment for NPC.

      Recently, the technique of IMRT has become widely used in the treatment of nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma. The preliminary results showed that IMRT might improve the rate of local control
      and the quality of life in NPC. In a retrospective study (Ivan,2010), the result showed that
      IMRT without concurrent chemotherapy provides good outcome for patients with stage IIB NPC
      with acceptable toxicity. Another study showed that Comparing with IMRT alone, IMRT in
      combination with chemotherapy provided no significant benefit to locoregionally advanced NPC
      (Su,2011). With IMRT, it was unclear whether the additional of concurrent chemotherapy was
      essential for stage II nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

      The investigators designed the present study to research the role of adding concurrent
      chemotherapy to intensity modulated radiotherapy in the treatment of stage II NPC. The
      primary endpoint is failure-free survival (FFS).The second endpoints were overall survival
      (OS),loco-regional failure-free survival (LFFS), distant metastasis failure-free survival
      (DMFS), and acute and late adverse events.
