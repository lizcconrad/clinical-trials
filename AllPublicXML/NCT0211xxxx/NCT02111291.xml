  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current trial examines the potential benefits of continuous 12 week treatment with
      Santyl, measured in terms of wound bed appearance. The visual appearance of granulation
      tissue will be recorded at each visit for the purpose of examining the relationship between
      wound bed appearance and progress towards healing. In support of this longer treatment
      regimen with Santyl, a recent animal study found that application of Santyl for 12 weeks was
      safe and well tolerated. Therefore, the present study is designed to test the hypothesis that
      daily treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) with Santyl for up to 12 weeks will result in
      more rapid development of granulation tissue than DFU treated with supportive care.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide written informed consent, which will consist of reading, signing, and dating
             the informed consent document after the Investigator, sub-Investigator or other
             designated study staff member has explained the study procedures, risks, and contact
             information.

          2. Eighteen (18) years of age or older, of either sex, and of any race or skin type
             provided that their skin color, in the opinion of the Investigator, will not interfere
             with the study assessments.

          3. Willing and able to make all required study visits.

          4. Able to follow instructions and perform the dressing changes at home or have a
             caregiver who can perform the dressing changes according to the protocol.

          5. Willing to use an appropriate off-loading device whenever necessary to keep weight off
             of any foot ulcers.

          6. An ulcer present on any part of the plantar surface of the foot or plantar surface of
             the hallux which is 0.5 cm2 - 10 cm2 inclusive (as measured at the Screening Visit)
             with a duration ≥ 6 weeks but not more than 52 weeks (12 months) documented in the
             patient's history or by patient report of onset which requires debridement.

          7. Adequate arterial blood flow as evidenced by an ankle brachial index (ABI) of &gt; 0.70
             and ≤ 1.20. If ABI &gt; 1.2, perfusion at or near the site of the ulcer should be
             confirmed; the foot is warm to the touch and has palpable pulses.

          8. Separation of at least 5 cm (closest ulcer edge to other closest ulcer edge) if ≥ 2
             ulcers are present.

          9. Diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or 2) requiring insulin or oral/injectable medications to
             control blood glucose levels.

         10. Target ulcer is not infected based on clinical assessment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        participation in the study.

          1. Contraindications or hypersensitivity to the use of clostridial collagenase or
             hydrogel.

          2. Undergoing therapy with another investigational agent within thirty (30) days of Visit
             1, or planned participation overlapping with this study.

             tachycardia, hypotension, confusion, vomiting, leukocytosis, acidosis, severe
             hyperglycemia, azotemia).

          6. A target ulcer which involves the underlying tissues of tendon, muscle, or bone.

          7. Diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease, leukocyte adhesion defects, or severe

               -  Dermal substitute (e.g., Dermagraft, Integra, Oasis, etc.)

         10. Treatment of target ulcer for any length of time with clostridial collagenase ointment
             (SANTYL®) if within 12 weeks prior to screening.
