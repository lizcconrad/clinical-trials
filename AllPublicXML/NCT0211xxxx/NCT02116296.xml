      The ToyBox proposal addresses Knowledge-Based Bio-Economy (KBBE)-2009-2-1-03 - Behavioural
      models for prevention of obesity, with a particular focus on children. It will primary aim to
      influence children's behaviours and prevent obesity in early childhood. The proposal will
      identify key behaviours related to early childhood obesity and their determinants and
      evaluate behavioural models and educational strategies. Based on the obtained insights at a
      local level, a multidisciplinary team will develop and implement a school based family
      involved intervention programme that could be applied on a European scale. Process, impact,
      outcome and cost-effectiveness evaluation will be conducted to support decision making for
      European Public Health Policy. The combined use of Precede-Proceed Model and Intervention
      Mapping will provide the framework for the development, implementation and evaluation of the
      ToyBox intervention. To achieve this, the project will be subdivided into 10 Work Packages
      (WPs). This carefully planned stepwise approach will include systematic reviews, secondary
      analyses of existing data sets, focus group research and school policies overview. The ToyBox
      project consortium spans the necessary multidisciplinary variety of experts such as public
      health experts, epidemiologists, nutritionists, physical activity experts, pedagogists,
      psychologists, behavioural scientists, nutritionists, paediatricians, early childhood
      psychologists, health economists, totalling 15 partners, from 10 countries. The consortium,
      consists of 11 universities, 1 research institute, 2 advocacy groups and a small to medium
      enterprise (SME) representing all regions of Europe. The consortium has ample experience in
      conducting and coordinating multi-centre international research as well as undertaking
      dissemination activities to all relevant stakeholders.
