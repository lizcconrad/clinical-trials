  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is almost always successful in
      patients with malignant biliary obstruction, selective biliary cannulation fails in some
      cases and conventional ERCP may not be possible in patients with tumor invasion of the
      duodenum or major papilla, surgically altered anatomy (e.g., Roux-en-Y anastomosis), or
      complex hilar biliary strictures. In such cases, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage
      (PTBD) is an useful alternative. However, PTBD had various complications and the presence of
      an external drainage catheter would also have a cosmetic problem related to the external
      drainage and an adverse impact on quality of life (QOL) of terminally ill patients.

      Since endoscopic ultrasound-guided bile duct puncture was described in 1996, sporadic case
      reports of EUS-guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) suggested that it was a feasible and
      effective alternative in patients with failed conventional ERCP stenting. The potential
      benefits of EUS-BD include one-stage procedure in ERCP unit, and internal drainage for
      avoiding long-term external drainage in cases where external PTBD drainage catheters cannot
      be internalized, thus significantly improving the QOL of terminally ill patients, and
      possibly lower morbidity than PTBD or surgery.

      Up to date, only a few case series of EUS-BD with small numbers of patients have been
      published, and known the feasibility and safety in terms of the incidence of
      procedure-related clinical outcomes.

      We investigated the efficacy and safety of EUS-BD using partially covered (hybrid) metallic
      stent with a dedicated introducer for EUS-BD, or fully covered antimigration metallic stents
      in malignant biliary obstruction after failed conventional ERCP as a prospective multicenter
      study.

    <description>EUS-guided hepaticogastrostomy (EUS-HG) will be performed in patients with hilar stricture or altered anatomy such as Roux-en-Y anastomosis, and EUS-guided choledochoduodenostomy (EUS-CD) will be performed in patients with mid to distal extrahepatic bile duct strictures. Because EUS-guided rendezvous technique can be attempted only in patients in whom the papilla is endoscopically accessible. Following bile duct puncture using a 19-gauge fine needle, one-step or graded tract dilatation will be performed. Then, finally we insert a partially or fully covered metallic stent.</description>
