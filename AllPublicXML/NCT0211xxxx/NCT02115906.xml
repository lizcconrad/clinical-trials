  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Growth hormone (GH) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of body composition including
      ectopic lipid deposition in insulin sensitive organs like liver and skeletal muscle. Recent
      evidence indicates that the GH-IGF1 axis affects body composition via regulating
      mitochondrial oxidation capacity.

      Thus, excessive GH secretion by a pituitary adenoma (Acromegaly) might be accompanied by
      increased mitochondrial activity leading to inappropriately low intracellular lipid depots,
      especially in metabolically active tissue like liver and skeletal muscle.

      This study aims to assess metabolic activity and intracellular lipid content in skeletal
      muscle and liver in patients suffering from acromegaly compared to controls by 31P/1H
      Magnetic resonance spectroscopy before and in follow up examinations 3, 6 and 12 months after
      initiation of GH lowering treatments including surgery, somatostatinanalogs or pegvisomant,
      as well as oral glucose tolerance tests at each examination to assess treatment responses and
      calculate validated parameters for insulin sensitivity and resistance.

      Background: Growth hormone (GH) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of body composition
      including ectopic lipid deposition in insulin sensitive organs like liver and skeletal
      muscle. Direct inhibition of growth hormone action by a receptor antagonist has been shown to
      induce hepatic steatosis and growth hormone replacement decreases liver fat content in obese
      humans. Of note, recent evidence indicates that the GH-IGF1 axis affects body composition via
      regulating mitochondrial oxidation capacity.

      Hypothesis: Direct and/or indirect effects of GH on mitochondrial function might mediate the
      changes in body composition and lipid deposition. Thus, excessive GH secretion by a pituitary
      adenoma (Acromegaly) might be accompanied by increased mitochondrial activity leading to
      inappropriately low intracellular lipid depots, especially in metabolically active tissue
      like liver and skeletal muscle.

      Aim: Assessment of metabolic activity and intracellular lipid content in skeletal muscle and
      liver in patients suffering from acromegaly compared to controls.

      Methods: Non-interventional study:

        -  31P/1H Magnetic resonance spectroscopy before and in follow up examinations 3, 6 and 12
           months after initiation of GH lowering treatments including surgery, somatostatinanalogs
           or pegvisomant.

        -  oral glucose tolerance tests at each examination to assess treatment responses and
           calculate validated parameters for insulin sensitivity and resistance.

    <description>The 31P-MRS examinations will be performed in a 7 T MR system (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) using a double-tuned (31P/1H) surface coil (Rapid Biomedical Ltd, Rimpar, Germany), with a diameter of 10 cm.</description>

    <time_frame>before, as well as 3,6,9 &amp;12 months after initiation of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Hepatic lipid content will be assessed using localized single voxel 1H MRS as published by our study group. STEAM sequence (VOI= 3×3×3 cm3; TE= 30, 50, 70, 120 ms; NA= 4 for each TE) data acquisition will be performed during repetitive single breath holds. Hepatocellular lipid (HCL) content will be calculated from ration of summed area of methylene and methyl resonance to that of water following the individual spin-spin relaxation correction as per cent of total tissue MRS signal (water + methylene + methyl).</description>

    <time_frame>before, as well as 3,6,9 and 12 months after initiation of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Resting-state ATP turnover will be measured using a ST experiment. The subjects will be lying in a supine position with the surface coil fixed underneath the right calf muscle. Baseline intramyocellular concentrations of phosphorous metabolites will be assessed based on T1 corrected partially relaxed baseline spectra (TR, 15 s; 16 averages). The exchange between γ-ATP and PCr (i.e., CK reaction), and between γ-ATP and Pi (i.e., ATP- synthesis) will be investigated.</description>

    <description>Intramyocellular lipid content will be assessed using localized single voxel 1H MRS as published by our studygroup[34]. STEAM sequence (VOI= 12x12x12 mm3; TE= 20 ms; TR= 4 sec, NA= 16) data acquisition will be performed in two volumes of interest positioned in soleus and tibialis anterior muscle. Separate spectra without water signal suppression (NA= 4) will be obtained from both muscle groups. Intramyocellular lipid content (IMCL) content will be calculated from ratio of area of methylene (1.25 ppm) to that of water following the individual spin-spin relaxation correction as per cent of tissue water MRS signal.</description>

    <description>In patients without overt diabetes, glucose tolerance will be assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test, routinely performed at the outpatients clinic. The test will be performed in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours. Blood will be drawn via a catheter placed in an antecubital vein of one arm. Blood samples for the assessment of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, free fatty acids and growth hormone will be drawn at baseline as well as 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after ingestion of 75g glucose in a solution.
Concentrations of glucose, insulin and C-peptide will be used to derive parameters of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity by mathematical modelling.</description>
