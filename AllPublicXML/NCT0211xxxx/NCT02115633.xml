    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to continue development and commercialization of a
      Wearable Sensory Prosthesis termed Walkasins. The device measures foot pressure through a
      thin sole insert, developed under NIA SBIR Phase I funding, and displays pressure information
      through a vibrotactile feedback array, placed around the lower leg, to help improve balance
      function. The device can replace lost foot pressure sensation in individuals with peripheral
      neuropathy who have balance problems.

      Our specific aims are to:

        1. Revise and finalize design of Walkasinsâ„¢ based on accomplishments, user input, as well
           as reviewer criticism from our Phase 1 grant and manufacture 200 units of the device for
           clinical testing.

           Milestone 1: 200 units manufactured and ready for clinical testing under Aim 2. This
           goal is accomplished.

        2. Investigate effects of using Walkasins on clinical outcomes related to gait, balance
           function and associated fall risk in a population of patients with sensory peripheral
           neuropathy and balance problems.

      Hypotheses 1A-B: Patients who are trained to use Walkasins programmed to display relevant
      balance cues will attain higher gait speed and Functional Gait Assessment when compared to a
      matched cohort not using Walkasins.

      Milestone 2: Data collection to assess clinical utility and safety of the Walkasins on
      patients briefly trained to use the device has been completed.
