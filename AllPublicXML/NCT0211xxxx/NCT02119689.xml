  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to study blood stem cells in diabetic patients and
      normal patients. We would like to better understand if these cells, called endothelial
      precursor cells (EPCs), are not working as expected in people with diabetes. We would like to
      see if the function of these cells can predict the development of diabetic retinopathy.

      Diabetic retinopathy is an eye disease associated with diabetes in which the cells of the
      retina are damaged. It can cause blurred vision, vision loss, blindness or possible bleeding
      in the retina. Even with current treatments, the quality of life for people with diabetic
      retinopathy is much reduced.

    <measure>The ACE/ACE2 ratio within EPC's</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 216 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Peripheral blood of 150cc, approximately 8-10 tablespoons will be collected from a vein in the arm of both diabetic and healthy control patients.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The balance of the RAS (renin-angiotensin system) within EPCs</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 216 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Endo-PAT2000 will be used to obtain this measurement. This is a 15-minute office-based test where a blood-pressure cuff is placed around the arm, inflated and measurements are obtained from a small fingertip monitor</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Photography findings</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 216 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The findings from eye photographs will be collected and evaluated from both the diabetic patients and the heallthy control patients. This will be done at either the patient's yearly visit or at their 6 week follow-up visit.</description>
