  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a Computer-based auditory training
      (CBAT) intervention for children with Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) by
      comparing the changes in auditory processing (AP) and functional listening skills of these
      children immediately post-intervention, to that of the untrained controls. The AP skills of
      the trained group were evaluated again at 3 months post-intervention to examine the
      sustainability of any improvements made from the CBAT intervention. I hypothesised that after
      intervention, children from the auditory training (AT) group would improve in their AP
      skills, and that improvement would be greater than the changes in AP skills of those
      untrained controls. I also hypothesised that the improvement made from the intervention would
      sustain for at least 3 months after the end of intervention. Finally, I examined if the
      training outcomes are predictable from any underlying factors such as the initial AP,
      language, or cognitive skills of these children.

      This prospective study incorporated a parallel group design that randomly assigned
      participants identified with CAPD to an auditory training (AT) group or a no intervention
      (Control) group. Both groups were matched for age and gender. Baseline measures were
      conducted prior to the randomisation process.

      Participants from the AT group were given a 3-month home therapy using a CBAT programme
      developed for this study, while participants from the control group received no intervention
      for the same period of time. Apart from regular school attendance and activities, all
      participants were requested to discontinue any other auditory-based interventions, which
      might affect the outcomes of this study. All the participants were assessed again after the
      conclusion of the training period.

      After the end of the intervention, participants from the AT group were requested to undergo a
      no-intervention phase for a period of 3 months before another assessment. This was intended
      to examine the sustainability of any improvement made through the CBAT programme.

      An auditory test and two validated questionnaires were used as outcome measures, administered
      at baseline, and at post-3 months (immediately post-intervention).

    <description>The auditory processing skills of patients were assessed using the LiSN-S. The LiSN-S is an auditory task that assesses the ability of children to understand speech in the background of two other talkers. The LiSN-S test was administered using a laptop with a circumaural headphones connected to the computer. The target sentences were presented at an initial level of 62 dB SPL, whereas the distracter stories were presented at a constant level of 55 dB SPL. The target stimuli and distracter discourse were presented to both ears simultaneously. A maximum of 30 sentences were presented in each of the four listening conditions. The patient was required to repeat the targeted sentences verbally in every listening condition and correct responses were scored manually by the me on the computer. The stimulus presentation level was adjusted adaptively depending on the patient's response. The assessment took approximately 20 minutes to complete.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, and post-3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The listening skills of patients were assessed using two questionnaires: a) Pragmatic Profile (PP) questionnaire consisted of 52 items concerning the rituals and conversational skills of a child, how a child asks for information and gives responses, and nonverbal communication skills; b) The CHAPS questionnaire consisted of 36 questions evaluating a child's listening skills in 6 different auditory conditions (noise, quiet, ideal, multiple inputs, auditory memory sequencing, and auditory attention span) in comparison to his/her peers. The PP and CHAPS questionnaire was completed by each patient's parents and teacher respectively.</description>

    <description>The CBAT programmes in the current study were specifically designed to improve speech-in-noise and dichotic listening skills of children diagnosed with CAPD. All the training programmes were designed to be installed on home-user's computer, and they were visually attractive and appealing to children. The development of the software (non commercial) for the speech-in-noise and dichotic listening training was done by two different teams in the United Kingdom and Singapore, respectively.</description>

    <description>There are 3 listening games (i.e. Doggy, Who-Is-Right, Story-in-noise) that target on speech-in-noise training and 1 listening game (i.e. TATP) that aims to train dichotic listening.
Patient was required to undergo the training for 30 minutes per day, 5 sessions per week, for a duration of 12 weeks. Parents were advised to keep a journal to record child's training hour of the day.</description>
