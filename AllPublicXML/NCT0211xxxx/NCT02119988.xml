      The purpose of this study is to determine whether TIPS combined with variceal embolization
      are effective in the prevention of variceal rebleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Variceal bleeding is one of the leading causes of death in patients with cirrhosis. Patients
      with cirrhosis surviving a variceal bleeding are at high risk of rebleeding (over 60% at 1
      year), and mortality from each rebleeding episode is about 20%.

      Placement of TIPS is a well-established technique that is highly effective in preventing
      recurrent variceal bleeding, especially if the TIPS is created with an expanded
      polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)-covered stent, which has a significantly lower risk of shunt
      dysfunction than does TIPS created with bare stents. But the risk of hepatic encephalopathy
      greatly increases and the risk of recurrent variceal bleeding after TIPS placement remains an
      issue. Besides an insufficient decrease in portosystemic pressure gradient after TIPS
      creation alone, fragile variceal vessels also are considered a risk factor for recurrent
      bleeding.

      Accordingly, TIPS combined with variceal embolization has been advocated to achieve the best
      result possible in preventing recurrent variceal bleeding. However, in recent American
      Association of the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) practice guidelines and Baveno V consensus,
      no treatment strategies were clearly recommended maybe because the exact efficacy of this
      strategy remains unclear and high-quality randomized controlled trials still lacks.

      So the investigators hypothesized that embolization of these collateral vessels may increase
      the blood flow within the shunt and into the liver, which can theoretically decrease the
      incidence of shunt dysfunction and encephalopathy, even can prolong the patients' survival.
