  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Supporting Healthy Marriage (SHM) evaluation was launched in 2003 to test the
      effectiveness of a skills-based relationship education program designed to help low- and
      modest-income married couples strengthen their relationships and to support more stable and
      more nurturing home environments and more positive outcomes for parents and their children.
      The evaluation was led by MDRC with Abt Associates and other partners, and it was sponsored
      by the Administration for Children and Families, in the U.S. Department of Health and Human
      Services.

      SHM was a voluntary, year long, marriage education program for lower-income, married couples
      who had children or were expecting a child. The program provided group workshops based on
      structured curricula; supplemental activities to build on workshop themes; and family support
      services to address participation barriers, connect families with other services, and
      reinforce curricular themes. The study's random assignment design compared outcomes for
      families who were offered SHM's services with outcomes for a similar group of families who
      were not but could access other services in the community.

    <measure>Percent Married at 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome is examined at the couple level. A couple is considered married if both spouses report that they are married or in a committed relationship. If either respondent indicates that the couple is separated, divorced, or had the marriage annulled, the outcome is coded with a negative (0) response. If only one spouse responds, that response is used for the couple.</description>

    <description>The program's central and most intensive component was a series of relationship and marriage education workshops for groups of couples that was offered in the first four to five months of enrollment in the program.
Complementing the workshops was a second component, offered for the year after enrollment, that consisted of supplemental activities: educational and social events that were intended to build on and reinforce lessons from the curricula.
The third component, family support services, paired couples with a specialized staff member who maintained contact with them and facilitated their participation in the other two components throughout the duration of the program.</description>
