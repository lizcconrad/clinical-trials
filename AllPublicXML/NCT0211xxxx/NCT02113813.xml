  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of ASP8273 and to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). This study
      will also determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASP8273, evaluate the potential inhibition
      of CYP3A4 by ASP8273 and the antitumor activity of ASP8273 as well as determine the effect of
      food on the bioavailability of ASP8273.

      This study is composed of 2 parts: part 1 is the dose escalation phase and part 2 is the
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) phase, Food Effect (FE) cohort and Exon 20 cohort.
