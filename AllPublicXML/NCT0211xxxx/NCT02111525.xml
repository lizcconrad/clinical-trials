        Patients who present with shortness of breath to an emergency department or urgent care
        facility are possible candidates for the study and shall be screened for suitability based
        on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Shortness of breath as the most prominent presenting symptom

          -  Age greater ≥ 45

          -  Willingness, ability, and commitment to participate in the study

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Patients with any active implantable medical device

          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Patients who have tattoos and or non-intact skin directly under the electrode position

          -  Patients who have had past allergic reactions to medical grade adhesives

          -  Patients that are dialysis dependent

          -  Patients who have had a lung lobectomy

          -  Patients in whom the shortness of breath presentation is due to obvious non HF cause
             such as acute chest trauma

          -  Patients who have received nitrates (sub-lingual, topical or IV), diuretics or
             vasopressors ≥ 1 hour prior to IMED-4 Recording

          -  Patients who decline to have their backs photographed with the IMED-4 device in
             position

          -  Patients who are receiving invasive or non-invasive positive airway pressure (PAP)
             ventilation prior to or following presentation to the ED (Self presentation or
             admission via EMS).

          -  Severe co-morbidity or poor general physical/mental health that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, will not allow the subject to be a good study candidate (i.e. other
             disease processes, mental capacity, substance abuse, incarceration, shortened life
             expectancy, etc.)
