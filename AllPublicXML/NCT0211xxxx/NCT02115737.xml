  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Youth with depressive symptoms are at risk for a range of problems later in life. This
      includes problematic interpersonal relationships, occupational stress, and the occurrence of
      adult mental disorders. The main purpose of this study is to test how effective two types of
      group therapy are at reducing depressive symptoms in youth. A focus on group therapy is
      important because group therapy allows for many youth to be treated in a short amount of
      time. Group therapy is also helpful because youth can get social support and feel less alone
      in their symptoms when they participate in group. This study compares two groups, one that
      targets skills for managing difficult emotional experiences (dialectical behavior therapy
      skills group) and another group focuses on psychoeducation and is based on a publicly
      available treatment manual from the Services for Teens At Risk (STAR) Center at the
      University of Pittsburgh. The results of this study will provide insights regarding the
      comparative efficacy of these two treatments, and regarding predictors of treatment response.
