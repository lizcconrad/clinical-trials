  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild brain injury or concussion affects about four million Americans each year. Some people
      recover completely while others, especially those with multiple concussions, develop chronic
      headaches, neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders. One of the reasons that
      concussion is difficult to treat is that it is difficult to detect. Radiographic studies such
      as CT (computed tomography scan) are by definition unrevealing of structural injury in
      concussed patients. Some MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) sequences may be useful adjuncts in
      the diagnosis of concussion but even these are not consistently present in all patients with
      symptoms. Clinical tests for concussion often require baseline studies, and thus are
      generally reserved for athletes and others at highest risk for concussion.

      The investigators have developed a novel eye movement tracking algorithm performed while
      subjects watch television or a music video that determines whether the eyes are moving
      together (conjugate) or are subtly not together (disconjugate). The investigators preliminary
      data shows that people with lesions in their brain or recovering from brain injury have
      disconjugate gaze that is not detectable by ophthalmologic examination but is detected by our
      algorithm.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the validity of this eye tracking algorithm for
      detecting structural (visible on CT scan) and non-structural (concussive) brain injury. The
      study will recruit brain injured subjects and non-brain injured controls from the Bellevue
      Hospital Emergency Department and neurosurgery services for eye-tracking as well as studies
      that assess the extent of brain injury. The investigators will determine if disconjugate gaze
      on eye tracking is significantly associated with abnormal functional, neuro-cognitive, and
      psychiatric outcomes.

      The investigators hypothesize that individuals who demonstrate sustained disconjugate gaze on
      the eye tracking task from the time of injury to 1 month will have elevated functional
      impairment in multiple domains of life (work, interpersonal relationships), will be poor
      performers on neuro-cognitive tasks (working memory, executive functioning, verbal memory,
      impulsivity), and will be significantly more symptomatic of posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD) and depression than those who demonstrate conjugate eye tracking in the normal range
      at one month. Achievement of the investigators aims will provide the first evidence that eye
      tracking is a valid physiologic outcome measure for brain injury.

    <description>The current effort in the trauma field is focusing on cognitive, behavioral, neural, genetic, and emotional models of traumatic stress. The unique aspect of this approach is that it integrates and examines these perspectives side by side to determine their additive value in predicting outcomes rather than taking a myopic approach.
Possible predictors of post-traumatic stress or concussive symptoms will be done by the completion of neuropsychiatric and cognitive testing and self-report tasks that can be completed over the Internet using HIPAA compliant online survey tools. This testing will assess brain or mental function including memory, intelligence, ability to concentrate, and &quot;mental quickness&quot;. Eye tracking, which consist of watching videos that would be shown on public television or are rated PG (videos by popular artists and sports highlight videos), and the SCAT3/CHILD SCAT3 questionnaire with balance task.</description>

        There are three populations being studied:

          1. structural traumatic brain injury

          2. non-structural traumatic brain injury

          3. non-brain injured (bodily or extremity injured)

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients will be recruited from the Bellevue Hospital Emergency Services
             (Emergency Department and Trauma Bay) or from among inpatient populations at Bellevue
             Hospital. They will need to be consentable and able/willing to participate and meet
             criteria for distribution into one of the three subject populations (structural TBI,
             non-structural TBI, injured/non-TBI) described here:

               -  mild to moderate structural traumatic brain injury (TBI) as evidenced by CT scan
                  demonstrating the presence of hemorrhage (subdural, epidural, subarachnoid or
                  intraparenchymal), brain contusion, or skull fracture.

               -  non-structural TBI(concussion), meaning no signs of structural injury on imaging;
                  however, they complain of usual brain injury symptoms such as headache,
                  dizziness, cognitive impairments, etc., A subject with a traumatically induced
                  physiological disruption of brain function, manifested by &gt;1 of the following:

          -  Any period of loss of consciousness (LOC).

          -  Any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the accident.

          -  Any alteration in mental state at the time of accident (i.e. feeling dazed,
             disoriented, or confused).

          -  Focal neurological deficit(s) that may or may not be transient, but where the severity
             of the injury does not exceed the following:

               1. Loss of consciousness of approximately 30 minutes or less

               2. After 30 minutes, an initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 13-15

               3. Posttraumatic amnesia (PTA) not greater than 24 hours.

          -  Non-brain injured subjects that have suffered some type of injury such as to the
             extremities or other parts of the body. The subjects will have sustained a blunt or
             penetrating trauma such as, to the corpus or extremities (i.e. car accident, falling).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects that receive minor penetrating trauma insufficiently traumatizing to result
             in sufficient sequelae will be excluded.

          -  Subjects suffering burns, anoxic injury or multiple/extensive injuries resulting in
             any medical, surgical or hemodynamic instability will also be excluded.

          -  Particularly for the purposes of eye tracking all subjects that are blind (no light
             perception), are missing eyes, do not open eyes will be excluded from the research.

          -  It is pertinent that subjects be able to detect light and have both eyes in order for
             the eye tracking data to be effective and significant.

          -  Any physical or mental injury or baseline disability rendering task completion
             difficult will be excluded, also inability to participate in longtitudinal care, or
             obvious intoxication or blood alcohol level greater than 0.2.

          -  Pregnant individuals and prisoners will also be excluded from the study.
