  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to study how to improve patients' management of chronic back pain,
      particularly their management of prescription medication, through increasing health literacy
      and patient empowerment through an internet based intervention. We do this by designing both
      patient education materials and physician communication strategies to increase literacy and
      volitional components of patients. We will test two conditions using a website called
      Oneself: one providing only information (literacy-only control) and a second providing
      relational communications designed to increase both literacy and volitional empowerment. To
      test the self-management enhancing effects of empowerment and health literacy, we will
      conduct a longitudinal experiment with 51 chronich back pain patients over two months. This
      span of time is the minimum necessary to achieve a systematic change in self-management and
      literacy skills, increasing also the range of possible decisions to be made and actions to be
      real-ized by the patients.

    <description>Empowerment is a pychological outcome measure. Patient empowerment is defined as a complex construct that includes different individual competencies and skills. Empowerment can be considered a multilevel and multidimensional construct closely linked to self-determination and self-efficacy.
Empowerment is measured the with the Psychological Empowerment Scale According to the scale, empowerment is a multidimensional concept composed of four cognitive dimensions (or task assessments): impact (or the degree to which behavior is seen as &quot;making a difference&quot;), competence (or the degree to which a person can perform task activities skillfully), meaningfulness (or the individual's intrinsic caring about a given task), and choice (or whether a person's behavior is perceived as self-determined).</description>

    <measure>Medication misuse Physical exercise Pain burden</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Medication misuse is measured with the Prescription Medication Use and Perception of Risk Instrument. The scale is scored as a continuous measure to provide greater sensitivity ranging from 0 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree) with higher scores indicating greater level of medication misuse.
Physical exercise in leisure time is measured with the respective sub-dimensions from the Short Questionnaire to Assess Health-Enhancing Physical Activity and it gives the amount of time spent in physical exercise in hours/week
Pain burden is measured with six items from the Chronic Pain Grading Scale that gives two measures related with pain: pain disability perception and pain intensity perception</description>
