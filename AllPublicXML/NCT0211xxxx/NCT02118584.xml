      This two-part, part 1: open-label extension (OLE) and part 2: safety monitoring (SM) study
      will examine the efficacy and safety of continued etrolizumab treatment in moderate to severe
      ulcerative colitis (UC) participants previously enrolled in etrolizumab Phase II/III studies.
      Participants with moderate to severe UC who were enrolled in the Phase II OLE study (GA27927
      [NCT01461317]) or the Phase III studies (GA28948 [NCT02163759], GA28949 [NCT02171429],
      GA28950 [NCT02100696], GA29102 [NCT02165215], and GA29103 [NCT02136069]) were included.
      Participants from the Phase II OLE study or the Phase III studies who are not eligible or
      willing to receive etrolizumab in the OLE-SM study, and who have completed the 12-week safety
      follow-up period will be enrolled in Part 2. Part 1 of OLE-SM will continue for up to 7 years
      after the first participant is enrolled into the study. Following Part 1, participants will
      enter Part 2 for a period of 92 weeks.
