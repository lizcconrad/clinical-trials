      The purpose of this prospective randomized study is to evaluate iAssist with respect to
      radiographic, clinical and economic outcomes in comparison to conventional instrumentation in
      primary total knee arthroplasty using the Persona knee system among patients with BMI&gt;=30.

    <description>iAssist is an electronic displacement sensor based instrumentation system that provides intra-operative verification at each surgical step (bone cuts alignment and resection level); in order to help reduce bone cuts errors. iAssist features simple and intuitive instrumentation that is based on conventional total knee arthroplasty instrumentation. iAssist should take less than 2-3 minutes (on average) to setup</description>

          5. BMI&gt;=30

          6. Able to:

               -  Understand what participation in the study entails and give written informed
                  consent, and

               -  Follow surgeon/staff instructions, and

               -  Return for all follow-up evaluations, and

               -  Able and willing to undergo a preoperative full-leg, standing radiographs (all
                  cases)

               -  Willing to consent (patient or his/her legal guardian) to participate in the
                  study by signing and dating an approved consent.

               -  Meet an acceptable preoperative medical clearance and is free of or treated for
                  cardiac, pulmonary, hematological or other conditions that would pose excessive
                  operative risk.

          7. Presence of varus or valgus deformity of 15 degrees or less.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently enrolled in an investigational new drug or device study

          2. Active Infection (including septic knee, distant infection, or osteomyelitis)

          9. Scheduled for simultaneous bilateral TKA

         10. Indications of intra- and/or extra-articular deformations that would eliminate or tend
             to eliminate adequate implant support or prevent the use of an appropriately sized
             implant, such as polio, history of tibial plateau fracture, etc.

         11. Any metal within 150 mm of the joint line for the operative-side knee

         12. Knee deformities greater than 15 degrees of fixed varus, valgus, or flexion
             contracture on initial physical examination

         13. A female who is pregnant or lactating

         14. Current involvement in any personal injury litigation, medical-legal or worker's
             compensation claims

         15. Arterial disease or stents that would exclude the use of a tourniquet

         16. Insufficient quality or quantity of bone to support the implant due to prior knee
             surgery (or surgeries), cancer, metabolic bone disease, osteoporosis/osteopenia
             (diagnosed or treated with medication), active/old/remote infection, etc.

         17. Mental condition that may interfere with his/her ability to give an informed consent
             or interfere with his/her ability or willingness to fulfill the requirements of the
             study.

         18. Condition that would place excessive demands on the implant (e.g., Charcot's joints,
             muscle deficiencies, multiple joint disabilities, skeletal immaturity, etc.).

         19. Collateral ligament insufficiency.

         20. Immunosuppressive disorder (e.g., AIDS, etc.) that would require cytotoxic drugs,
             corticosteroids, large dose of irradiation, or antilymphocytic serum.

         21. An existing condition that would, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise
             participation or follow-up in this study
