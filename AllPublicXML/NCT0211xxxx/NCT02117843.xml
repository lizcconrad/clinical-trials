      The study is a Prospective, Multi-center, Single Armed Registry to Evaluate The Safety and
      Efficacy of 'AVI' Stent for Treating Coronary Revascularization, 1200 primary coronary artery
      disease patients will be enrolled, at approximately 40 sites. Subject follow-up will occur
      via telephone contact or clinical visit at 30 days, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 2-5 years
      after procedure.
