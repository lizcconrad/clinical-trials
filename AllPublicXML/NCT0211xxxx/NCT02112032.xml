      This study is to test how safe it is to give the combination of PEG IFN-α2b (SYLATRON) and
      MK-3475, an investigational drug, to patients with advanced melanoma. Its effectiveness
      against melanoma will also be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a safety and dose-seeking study of combination MK-3475 and peginterferon alfa-2b for
      adult patients (≥18) with advanced melanoma. A total of 32 patients will be included.
      Subjects will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility within 28 days (4 weeks)
      of the first dose. Each 21 day dosing period will constitute a cycle.

      Peginterferon alfa-2b is given subcutaneously, weekly according to the regimen below.
      peginterferon alfa-2b (Sylatron) is FDA-approved for the adjuvant treatment of patients with
      melanoma with microscopic or gross nodal involvement within 84 days of definitive surgical
      resection including complete lymphadenectomy.

      MK-3475 is a potent humanized IgG4 mAb with high specificity of binding to the PD-1 receptor,
      thus inhibiting its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2. MK-3475 has an acceptable preclinical
      safety profile and is being advanced for clinical development as an immunotherapy for
      advanced malignancies. In this protocol, MK-3475 is being evaluated at 2 mg/kg intravenously
      every 3 weeks for 2 years in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b at 1 µg/kg/week, 2
      µg/kg/week, or 3 µg/kg/week by subcutaneous injection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of
             unresectable stage III or IV melanoma. Patient may not have a diagnosis of uveal
             melanoma.

          -  Patients may be previously untreated or have received up to 3 prior systemic therapies
             for metastatic disease. Prior radiation therapy (any number) and interferon use in the
             adjuvant or metastatic disease settings is permitted (in this trial interferon is
             mainly used to enhance or initiate immune responses to MK-3475). Vaccine therapy will
             not be counted as systemic therapy. All prior therapies must have been discontinued
             for at least 4 weeks. A 2 week washout for kinase inhibitors is acceptable.

          -  Patients can be either ipilimumab naïve or refractory to ipilimumab, defined as
             received at least two doses of ipilimumab and documented disease progression. Patients
             who were re-treated with ipilimumab and patients who were on maintenance ipilimumab
             will be allowed to enter the trial as long as there is documented PD. Progressive
             disease will be defined as increase in tumor burden &gt; 25% relative to nadir (minimum
             recorded tumor burden) which is confirmed by repeat assessment no less than four weeks
             from the date of the first documented PD. Once PD is confirmed, initial date of PD
             documentation will be considered as the date of disease progression.

          -  Full resolution of ipilimumab related AEs to baseline (including irAEs) off of steroid
             treatment (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent dose) for irAEs for at least two weeks
             prior to first dose of study drug.

               1. No history of severe irAEs from ipilimumab of CTCAE Grade 4 requiring steroid
                  treatment; no history of CTCAE Grade 3 requiring steroid treatment (&gt; 10mg/day
                  prednisone or equivalent dose) for &gt; 12 weeks.

               2. Minimum of four weeks (wash out period) from the last dose of ipilimumab.

          -  Patients must consent to participate in the correlative studies and should have
             available tumor tissue for tumor biopsies.

          -  Patient must have measurable disease as per RECIST version 1.1. At least 1 of the
             tumor sites must be amenable to biopsy and this may not be the site of disease used to
             measure antitumor response.

          -  Patient is ≥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          -  Patient must have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale

          -  Patient must have adequate organ function as indicated by the following laboratory
             values (within 4 weeks prior to starting the study drugs):

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/uL

               2. Platelets ≥ 100,000/uL

                  total bilirubin level 1.5 ULN

               6. AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN for patients with liver
                  metastases

               7. International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤ 1.5 X ULN unless
                  the patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy

               8. Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 X ULN unless the patient is
                  receiving anticoagulant therapy

          -  Patient has voluntarily agreed to participate by giving written informed
             consent/assent for the trial.

          -  Female patient of childbearing potential has a negative urine or serum pregnancy test
             within 7 days prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test
             is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be
             required. The serum pregnancy test must be negative for the patient to be eligible.

          -  Female patients enrolled in the study, who are not free from menses for &gt; 2 years,
             post hysterectomy/oophorectomy, or surgically sterilized, must be willing to use
             either 2 adequate barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method of
             contraception to prevent pregnancy, or to abstain from heterosexual activity
             throughout the study, starting with the first dose of study drug at visit 1 through
             120 days after the last dose of study drug. Approved contraceptive methods include for
             example: intra-uterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, cervical cap with
             spermicide, male condoms, or female condom with spermicide. Spermicides alone are not
             an acceptable method of contraception. Male patients must agree to use an adequate
             method of contraception starting with the first dose of study drug through 120 days
             after the last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient who has had chemotherapy, radioactive, or biological cancer therapy within
             four weeks prior to the first dose of study drug, or who has not recovered to CTCAE
             Grade 1 or better from the AEs due to cancer therapeutics administered more than four
             weeks earlier. Subjects with ≤ grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion
             and may qualify for the study.

        Note: If patient received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the
        toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.

        Note: Toxicity that has not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 is allowed if it meets the inclusion
        requirements for laboratory parameters defined in Inclusion Criterion #9.

          -  Patient is currently participating or has participated in a study of an
             investigational agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first

          -  Patient is expected to require any other form of systemic or localized antineoplastic
             therapy while on study.

        definitive resection of basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder
        cancer, in situ cancers including cervical cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, or other in
        situ cancers.

             rule. Patients who require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid
             injections would not be excluded from the study. Patients with hypothyroidism stable

             abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the patient's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.

          -  Patient has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Patient is, at the time of signing informed consent, a regular user (including illicit
             drugs or had a recent history (within the last year) of substance abuse (including
