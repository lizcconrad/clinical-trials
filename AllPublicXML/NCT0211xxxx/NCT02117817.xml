    <textblock>
      The purpose of the first part of this study or the dose escalation portion of the study is to
      determine what dose of BKM120 and Abraxane is safe to give when the two drugs are used at the
      same time in patients who are diagnosed with a solid cancer. A solid cancer is a cancer that
      does not involve the blood, bone marrow or lymph nodes. Dose escalation determines the least
      toxic and most effect dose of this drug combination for treatment. Once this dose is
      established, it will be used for the dose expansion phase of the study where we will
      determine the effect of BKM120 and Abraxane in women diagnosed with a recurrent endometrial
      or ovarian cancer. We will see whether the combination of both drugs improves the response
      and survival of patients treated on the two drug regimen. Also we will try to find out
      whether there are changes in tumors that can help us determine what patients are more likely
      to respond to BKM120 and Abraxane.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of BKM120 in combination with weekly
           nabpaclitaxel (Abraxane®) in patients with a recurrent solid tumor and in particular a
           recurrent endometrial or ovarian cancer.

        -  To determine the MTD and DLT of BKM120 in combination with weekly nabpaclitaxel
           (Abraxane®) thereby establishing the recommended phase II dose.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Obtain pilot data on the clinical tumor response utilizing RECIST criteria of BKM120 in
           combination with weekly nabpaclitaxel (Abraxane®) in patients with a history of
           recurrent endometrial or a recurrent ovarian cancer.

        -  To determine the progression free survival (PFS) of patients treated with BKM120 and
           nabpaclitaxel (Abraxane®) and a history of recurrent endometrial or ovarian cancer.

        -  To explore molecular markers that my serve as potential molecular predictors of response
           including PIK3CA, mTOR, KRAS, PTEN and p53 mutations as well as amplification of ErbB2.

        -  To test the predictive value of PIK3CA and KRAS mutations in predicting response to this
           regimen in women diagnosed with a recurrent endometrial or ovarian cancer.

             coumadin-derivative anticoagulant.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast feeding or adults of reproductive potential not
             employing an effective method of birth control. Double barrier contraceptives must be
             used through the trial by both sexes. Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives
             may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered
             effective for this study. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test ≤ 72 hours prior to initiating treatment.

               -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
                  becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during treatment and
                  for16 additional weeks after stopping treatment... The highly effective
                  contraception is defined as either:

                    1. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle
                       of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                       symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
                       methods of contraception.

                    2. Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
                       hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In case of
                       oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
                       confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

                    3. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy
                       documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects
                       on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for
                       that patient.

                    4. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):

                         1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

                         2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                            cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                            suppository

               -  Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as
                  BKM120 potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.

               -  Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving
                  offspring must use condom during treatment and for an additional 16 weeks after
                  stopping treatment.

               -  Female partner of male study subject should use highly effective contraception
                  during dosing of any study agent and for 16 weeks after final dose of study
                  therapy.

          -  Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          -  History of another malignancy within 3 years, except cured basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin or excised carcinoma in situ of the cervix

          -  Patient is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully with
             the investigator
