  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a perspective, Phase IV, multi-center, single arm, open-label, interventional study
      in adult participants with Wegener's granulomatosis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis [GPA])
      or microscopic polyangiitis. Participants will be treated with rituximab (Ristova) and
      glucocorticoids. Rituximab will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion at a dose of 375
      milligrams per meter square (mg/m^2) body surface area once weekly during Weeks 1 to 4.
      Participants will also receive one or three pulses of methylprednisolone (1000 milligram [mg]
      each), followed by a tapering dose of oral prednisolone (start dose of 1 mg per kilogram per
      day). The dose of oral prednisone will be reduced as per evaluation by the investigator till
      the participant is completely off the drug. The participants will be followed up for duration
      of 6 months from the date of starting rituximab therapy with three follow-up visits at Days
      52, 112 and 172. All adverse events occurring during this period will be captured.
