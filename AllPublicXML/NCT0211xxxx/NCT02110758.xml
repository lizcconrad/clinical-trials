  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The National Committee for Quality Assurance has worked with the National Coalition for
      Cancer Survivorship, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Oncology Management Services,
      Independence Blue Cross, and RAND, as well as a broader multi-stakeholder advisory group, to
      define the Patient-Centered Oncology Care model. The purpose of this project is to pilot and
      evaluate this model. Specific research questions are:

        1. Does Patient-Centered Oncology Care improve patient experiences and quality of care?
           Does it reduce undesirable events like emergency department visits and hospital stays?

        2. How does adoption of Patient-Centered Oncology Care vary across a variety of practices
           and what factors affect adoption?

      The demonstration will take place in oncology practices in southeastern Pennsylvania.
      Practices will receive implementation support during the 24-month demonstration period. They
      will be evaluated using patient surveys, quality measures, and measures of emergency
      department and hospital use. Results from these practices will be compared in two ways: 1)
      with their performance before they became oncology medical homes and 2) with other similar
      practices.

      Background. Advances in cancer treatment mean that a growing number of Americans are living
      with cancer and experiencing it as a chronic, long-term condition. National panels led by
      consumers have identified the need for improved cancer care in the areas of communication
      between providers and patients and their families, care planning, attention to nonmedical
      needs, care coordination and provision of evidence-based treatment. The patient-centered
      medical home (PCMH) model of care is being widely adopted as a way to provide accessible,
      proactive, coordinated care and self-care through primary care practices. During active
      treatment for cancer, the oncology practice is often the primary setting supporting the
      patient and coordinating cancer treatment. By implementing the patient-centered medical home
      model, an innovative oncology practice in Pennsylvania has been able to improve access and
      reduce emergency department visits and hospitalizations for its patients.

      Objectives. Building on these recommendations and experience, the National Committee for
      Quality Assurance has worked with the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, the
      American Society of Clinical Oncology, Oncology Management Services, Independence Blue Cross,
      and RAND, as well as a broader multi-stakeholder advisory group, to define the
      Patient-Centered Oncology Care model. We seek PCORI support to pilot and evaluate this model.
      Specific research questions are:

        1. Does Patient-Centered Oncology Care improve patient experiences and quality of care?
           Does it reduce undesirable events like emergency department visits and hospital stays?

        2. How does adoption of Patient-Centered Oncology Care vary across a variety of practices
           and what factors affect adoption?

      Methods. The demonstration will take place in 10 oncology practices in southeastern
      Pennsylvania. Practices will receive implementation support during the 24-month demonstration
      period. They will be evaluated using patient surveys, quality measures, and measures of
      emergency department and hospital use. Results from these practices will be compared in two
      ways: 1) with their performance before they became oncology medical homes and 2) with other
      similar practices. Patients, clinicians, and health plan leaders will help design the
      project, and disseminate results. The project uses Patient Centered Outcomes Research
      Institute (PCORI) resources efficiently by building on ongoing efforts.

      Patient Outcomes (Projected). People with cancer are seeking high quality, coordinated and
      supportive care. The Patient-Centered Oncology Model has the potential to address current
      gaps in cancer care. If this model can demonstrate better care, then patients will have
      important information about what kind of care is possible. Our multi-stakeholder team will be
      poised to support widespread dissemination through training, policy and payment initiatives.

    <description>Patient experience will be evaluated using a modified version of the Cancer Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) patient survey conducted at baseline and 18 months follow up among patients receiving care from practices implementing Patient-Centered Oncology Care as well as matched comparison practices in the same region. Focus groups with patients receiving care at practices implementing Patient-Centered Oncology Care will be conducted at follow-up to evaluate patient perspectives on the care processes surrounding decision-making, goal-setting and care planning, as well as their experiences and satisfaction with their care.</description>

        The study population will consist of patients with cancer who receive their cancer care
        from oncology practices. We plan to attribute patients to the study practices based on the
        plurality of office visits for cancer diagnoses, but in sensitivity analyses, we will
        investigate other attribution rules, such as the majority of such office visits. The study
        population also consists of physicians/leadership and nursing/administrative staff at each
        of the practices implementing Patient-Centered Oncology Care
