  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of our study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of copeptin testing in
      association with troponin HS testing during pre-hospital care (ambulance care) in the
      treatment of patients whose pattern of use is the occurrence chest pain suggestive of ACS but
      not ST+.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to:

      A. Evaluate the diagnostic value of determination of copeptin testing in pre-hospital care in
      another diagnosis;

      B. Assess the prognostic value of copeptin assay on vital prognosis at day 28;

      C. Evaluate the kinetics of copeptin and troponin HS between initial ambulance care and
      arrival at the emergency department;

      D. Evaluate the potential impact of copeptin testing on pre-hospital patient care;

      E. Assess the economic impact of pre-hospital copeptin testing in terms of hospital stays and
      optimizing ambulance movements.
