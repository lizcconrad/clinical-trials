  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the exocrine glands. It
      particularly affects the lacrimal and salivary glands. Severe dry mouth and eyes are
      frequently reported as presenting symptoms. These symptoms are in many cases accompanied by
      nonspecific symptoms, such as malaise and fatigue. In addition, extraglandular
      manifestations, like purpura, polyneuropathy, and arthritis, can be present. SS affects
      mainly women with a female/male ratio of 9:1 and can occur at all ages. Due to the
      irreversible damage to the saliva producing cells, the quantity and quality of saliva
      reduces. The progressive nature of the syndrome results in a further reduction of salivary
      flow. Due to hyposalivation the patients suffer from progressive dental decay, dental
      erosion, severe dry mouth complaints (i.e. eating and swallowing problems, lack of taste),
      inflammation of the oral mucosa and lack of retention of removable dentures. Overall, this
      can be qualified as a reduction in the quality of life. Until now no effective (palliative)
      therapy to relieve dry mouth complaints is available. A recent case series study suggests
      that an endoscopic technique (sialoendoscopy) is able to alleviate the symptoms of patients
      suffering from SS. In this technique the ducts of the salivary glands are rinsed with saline
      and cortisone and possible strictures are dilated. It is hypothesised that performing a
      sialoendoscopic treatment will raise or restore (un)stimulated salivary flow levels and
      improve the reported mouthfeel score.
