    <textblock>
      This is an open label randomized controlled clinical trial comparing two regimens for
      treatment of smear-positive pulmonary TB, among patients previously treated for TB. The
      primary objective is to determine if a moxifloxacin-containing regimen, substituting
      moxifloxacin for ethambutol, of 24 weeks duration is superior to a control regimen of 24
      weeks duration in improving treatment outcomes in patients with recurrent TB and shortens the
      duration of TB treatment.

               -  Serum potassium greater than 3.0 mmol/L

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients on a Nevirapine (NVP)-containing ART regimen at screening

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Received an antibiotic active against M. tuberculosis in the last 14 days (e.g.
             fluoroquinolones, macrolides, standard anti-tuberculosis drugs).

          -  Patients with known M. tuberculosis resistance to any of the study drugs at screening

          -  History of prolonged QT syndrome or current or planned therapy with quinidine,
             procainamide, amiodarone, sotalol, or ziprasidone during the intensive phase of
