      The purpose of this treatment registry study is to determine if monthly infusions of
      Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) for 6 months will neutralize donor specific antibodies that
      are thought to be responsible for chronic rejection episodes in renal transplant subjects.
      162 renal transplant subjects will receive IVIg 5% at 2gm/kg/month for 6 months and be
      followed for 3 years.

    <description>Success is defined as:
Allograft survival as compared to the performance goal (PG) at 36 months. For the purposes of this study, a graft will be presumed to be lost is when a subject is started on dialysis and is not able to subsequently be removed from dialysis; or a subject's serum creatinine reaches 4.0 mg/dL, is sustained for &gt;48hours and is not thought to be due to other causes; or the subject is re-transplanted; or the subject dies.
