    <textblock>
      Objective and background: The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcome of using
      the hyaluronic acid gel in reconstructing inter-dental papillae at the aesthetic zones in a
      follow-up period of six months.

      Materials and Methods: 30 interdental papilla deficiencies which would meet the the inclusion
      criteria will be evaluated. After applying local anesthesia, 0.2 ml hyaluronic acid gel will
      be injected at the affected areas. This procedure will be repeated 3 times for the evaluated
      areas. Photographs will be taken before injection this material, and at 3 and 6 months
      following the intervention.

      The presence or absence of the interproximal papilla is essential concern to periodontists,
      restorative dentists, and to the patients. The loss of papilla can cause cosmetic deformities
      (black triangles), phonetic problems, and food debris accumulation. Often the loss of papilla
      is a consequence of periodontal disease because of gingival inflammation, attachment loss and
      interproximal bone height resorption.

      Several reasons also lead to absence of interdental papillae including:

      1) Plaque associated lesions, 2) Traumatic oral hygiene procedures, 3) Abnormal tooth shape,
      4) Improper contours of the restoration, 5) Spacing between teeth, 6) Loss of teeth.

        Patients will be recruited from the database of Periodontics Department at University of
        Damascus. A random sample of 30 patients will be included in this evaluation study from
        those who have been identified with defected interdental papillae.
