  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial to compare patient satisfaction and prosthetic
      outcomes with lower dentures retained by one or two implants. The investigators long-term
      objective is to establish evidence of the cost-effectiveness of a single implant intervention
      for improving tolerance to complete dentures. The investigators MAIN AIM will be to
      investigate patient satisfaction between and within groups with mandibular dentures retained
      by one or two implants over five years, and SECONDARILY to investigate the survival of
      implants, and the frequency of events to maintain the dentures and prosthetic attachments as
      clinically serviceable. Furthermore, multivariate analysis can assess the prediction of
      patient satisfaction with implant dentures based on various possible factors including age,
      health, demography and socioeconomic status, number of implants, and maintenance needs.
      Patient satisfaction will be measured by means of Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) including a
      measure of overall satisfaction and various specific aspects of satisfaction such as
      appearance, stability and comfort of the dentures.

      The CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS is that mandibular complete dentures retained by single implants are
      at least as satisfying to patients over a five years period as those retained by two implants
      for the same period.

      The SECONDARY HYPOTHESES are that:

      i) there is no difference over five years between groups in the survival of original
      implants, or in the number of events for maintenance of the dentures or implant attachments;
      and ii) using each treatment group as it's own control, there is no change in patient
      satisfaction with lower dentures retained by either one or two implants during the five year
      loading period.

    <description>Self-assessed satisfaction is measured on a 10 cm uninterrupted visual analogue scale (VAS) representing a continuum of feelings, with &quot;unsatisfied&quot; at one end and &quot;satisfied&quot; at the other. Each participant makes a global assessment of their satisfaction by marking an X on the line at a point corresponding to their response to the question: &quot;How would you evaluate your 'overall satisfaction' with your lower denture?&quot;. A research assistant translates the mark into a number from 0 to 100 by superimposing a template with numbered intervals from 0 to 100 mm.</description>
