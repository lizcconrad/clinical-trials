  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether a combination of intensive training of
      visual-spatial abilities (LOCATO task) with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) leads to an improvement in learning and memory in patients with mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) and to examine the underlying neuronal mechanism.
