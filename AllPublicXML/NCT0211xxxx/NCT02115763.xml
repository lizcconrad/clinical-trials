  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caffeine has been shown to consistently improve time-trial performance, warranting
      restrictions on consumption under regulation of the National Collegiate Athletics Association
      (NCAA) and World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). This ergogenic effect is not well understood,
      possibly occurring as a result of altered metabolism, improved strength, and/or reduced
      muscle pain. The hypothesis of altered metabolism has recently fallen out of favor while
      muscular strength has a tenuous relationship with endurance exercise performance. Reductions
      in muscle pain have been observed during low and moderate intensity endurance exercise, and
      this may be the mechanism of caffeine's ergogenic effect. In lieu of reducing pain during
      high intensity exercise, caffeine significantly improves performance. Therefore, caffeine
      appears to improve the amount of work that can be done for a given muscle pain rating,
      suggesting that participants may pace based upon sensations of muscle pain during endurance
      exercise. Most time-trial exercise is conducted in a fixed distance manner, measuring the
      time it takes participants to cover a given distance. Little research has been conducted on a
      fixed pain time-trial that would require participants to produce and sustain a given level of
      muscle pain while measuring the distance covered in an allotted time. A fixed pain time-trial
      could allow researchers to better understand the effect of pain on endurance performance. The
      purpose of this study is to examine the effects of caffeine on a fixed pain time-trial.
