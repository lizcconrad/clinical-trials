  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children who receive general anesthesia may become agitated (emergence delirium) in the
      recovery period. This occurs more often after inhalational anesthetics, particularly
      sevoflurane and desflurane than after propofol. However, agitation after anesthesia in
      children may be difficult to distinguish from pain; accordingly studies are ideally designed
      during MRI to obviate the contribution of pain during emergence. Airway complications have
      been reported after LMA and isoflurane more commonly than with IV propofol and nasal prongs.
      Whether the airway complications were due to the LMA or the isoflurane was unclear.
      Therefore, this study was designed to study the incidence of 1. agitation after sevoflurane
      compared with IV propofol and 2. airway complications after LMA or nasal prongs.

      180 children, ASA physical status 1 or 2 will be recruited for elective MRI scan. Randomized
      after consent is obtained to one of four groups. Anxiety will be assessed preoperatively
      using the modified Yale preoperative anxiety scale. Children will be accompanied by one
      parent to MRI scanner where monitors are applied. All children will have anesthesia induced
      with nitrous oxide and oxygen followed by sevoflurane until IV is established. Thereupon,
      they will be managed by their randomization assignment. The propofol pump will be concealed
      at all times. If propofol was used, it will be disconnected from the patient and residual
      propofol in the line flushed so prevent unblinding the patient's assignment. A blinded
      observer will be present to evaluate the patient when emergence begins. The single blinded
      observer will follow the patient from the MRI scanner through recovery room evaluating vital
      signs as well as emergence delirium (using the PAED scale). A PAED score &gt; 12 at any time
      during emergence period will confirm the diagnosis of emergence delirium. After discharge
      from hospital, a post-discharge questionnaire will be completed at 12, 24 and 48 hours after
      discharge. All parents will be called to retrieve the questionnaire results after 48 hours
      after discharge from hospital.

    <description>After securing the IV, sevoflurane will be discontinued and a propofol infusion will be started at the dose of 300 mcg/kg/min depending on the child's age and neurologic status. A bolus of propofol will not be administered. Oxygen will be delivered via nasal prongs at 2 liters per minute. The infusion rate of propofol will be decreased to 250 after 15 min and then 200 mcg/kg/min also after 15 min. Supplemental IV boluses of Propofol (0.5 mg/kg) will be administered if the child moves or if signs of light anesthesia are noticed. The propofol infusion may also be increased in response to light anesthesia.</description>
