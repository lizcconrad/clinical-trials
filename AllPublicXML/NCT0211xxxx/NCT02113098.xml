  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the add load on non-paretic lower limb of
      individuals that suffer a stroke, while walking on a treadmill, is effective for restore gait
      symmetry of these individuals, in a subacute phase of stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized and blinded clinical trial, in which participants are being randomly
      divided into experimental group and control group, in order to verify the effects of adding
      load on gait symmetry after stroke. 40 individuals will participate, and the calculation of
      sample size was performed from the ratio variable symmetry of swing time, based on previous
      study. Whereas about 15% of individuals could give up to participate in the study during
      their course (dropout rate), we determined a number of 20 participants in each group.
