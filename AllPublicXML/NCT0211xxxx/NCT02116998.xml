  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Eligible subjects will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive GEN-004 with adjuvant or placebo. Each subject will
      receive up to 3 doses at 4 week intervals.

      Following the third dose, subjects will be inoculated intranasally with S. pneumoniae
      serotype 6B. Nasal washes to identify S. pneumoniae colonization will be obtained
      pre-inoculation, and then 2, 7 and 14 days after inoculation.

      Subjects will also be monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the dosing period, and
      then for 12 months after their last dose.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of GEN-004 in reducing
      colonization rates and magnitude of colonization following the S. pneumoniae challenge.

    <description>GEN-004: 100 µg of each antigen, with adjuvant, 350 µg aluminum hydroxide, administered as a 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) injection.
GEN-004 is a recombinant S. pneumoniae protein subunit vaccine consisting of 3 recombinant T cell antigens:
GB104: ABC transporter, substrate-binding protein
GB144: Maltose/maltodextrin binding protein, ABC transporter
GB152: Hypothetical protein
GEN-004 is filled in 2 mL vials containing 0.5 mL (350 µg/mL of each antigen).
Aluminum hydroxide adjuvant is filled in 2 mL vials containing 1 mL at a concentration of 5 mg/mL.</description>

             requirements.

        NOTE: Subjects who are taking a medication to control an underlying co-morbidity may be
        enrolled if there have been no changes to their medication within 60 days prior to first
        dose of Study Drug.
