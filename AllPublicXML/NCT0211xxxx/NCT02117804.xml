      The purpose of this study is to determine the predictive performance of the Early Screen for
      Discharge Planning (ESDP) tool in a regional community hospital. The central hypothesis is
      that the ESDP differentiates between patients in a regional community hospital who would
      benefit from those who would not benefit from early discharge-planning intervention as
      measured by problems and unmet continuing care needs, quality of life, length of stay, and
      referrals to post-acute services.

      Patients who are hospitalized for medical or surgical reasons who consent to the study will
      be screened within 24 hours of hospital admission using the Early Screen for Discharge
      Planning (ESDP). The ESDP is a four-item screening tool used to determine on admission which
      patients are likely to have complex discharge plans and could benefit from early engagement
      of discharge planning personnel. The ESDP yields a total score, and those with a score of 10
      or greater are considered to have a &quot;high score&quot; and likely to have a complex discharge plan.
      Those with a score of 9 or below have a &quot;low score&quot;. The ESDP screen has been proven to be
      valid in large academic medical centers. This study will determine if the screen performs
      with the same validity in a small community hospital.

    <measure>Number of problems reported after discharge, measured by the Problems After Discharge Questionnaire - English Version (PADQ-E)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after hospital discharge</time_frame>
    <description>A problem is defined as any worry, limitation, concern, or difficulty reported by the patient. The Problems After Discharge Questionnaire - English Version measures important patient factors often overlooked that contribute to poor post-acute recovery experience which are recognized as important factors likely to impact readmission.</description>

    <measure>Number of unmet needs reported after discharge, measured by the Problems After Discharge Questionnaire - English Version (PADQ-E)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after hospital discharge</time_frame>
    <description>An unmet need is a need for help identified by the patient that is reported to be inadequately met. The Problems After Discharge Questionnaire - English Version measures important patient factors often overlooked that contribute to poor post-acute recovery experience which are recognized as important factors likely to impact readmission.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life, measured by the EuroQoL-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after hospital discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health out-come. Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care.</description>

    <description>This screen is completed by a study coordinator within 24 hours of patient admission to the hospital. The screen measures four variables available from routine hospital admission clinical data (walking limitation, age, living alone prior to admission, and level of disability) that exhibit high sensitivity and specificity (AUC's were .82 and.84) in identifying patients who should receive targeted attention from a DP expert.</description>

        The study targets adults hospitalized for a variety of medical and surgical conditions in a
        rural regional community hospital that is part of a large health system in the Midwest. The
        sample will be limited to adults who are returning home in the community, because the
        investigators are primarily interested in the problems and unmet needs encountered after
        discharge during the recovery period at home. To enhance the generalizability of the
        results, the sample will be stratified based on 2010 national estimates of age categories
        for hospitalized adults.
