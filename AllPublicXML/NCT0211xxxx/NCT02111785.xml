    <textblock>
      Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is condition where blood has slowly leaked out of small
      blood vessels surrounding the brain. Over time, the blood may cause a variety of symptoms
      including headache, confusion, limb weakness, and difficulty speaking.

      There is currently no agreement among physicians as to the best way to treat this condition.
      One option is to do a surgery to drain the blood that has collected. Usually the surgery
      involves drilling small holes in the skull to relieve pressure and allow blood and fluids to
      be drained. Another option is to give medications such as steroids that might reduce the
      swelling. However, no drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      specifically to treat this condition. Some patients elect to have no treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether investigational treatment with a 2 week
      course of oral dexamethasone is as effective as surgery for cSDH. The study hypothesis to be
      tested is: For patients with unilateral, symptomatic chronic subdural hematoma, there is no
      difference in clinical outcomes, as measured by achievement of modified Rankin Score of 0-2
      at 6 months, between those treated with a 2 week course of oral dexamethasone, compared with
      those treated with burr hole surgical drainage.
