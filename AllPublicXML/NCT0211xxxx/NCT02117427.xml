      This is a Phase I-II, open-label study. Each patient will receive targeted dose of EPO
      delivered via TARGTEPO. The targeted doses will be determined according to 3 cohorts as
      follows: Group A (18-25 IU/Kg/day), Group B (35-45 IU/Kg/day), Group C (55-65 IU/Kg/day). The
      objective is to evaluate safety and biologic activity of TARGTEPO treatment when maintaining
      Hb levels within the target range of 9-12 g/dl. Biological activity assessments will include
      duration of TARGTEPO secretion as measured by serum EPO levels above baseline

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. For ESRD patients: Subject diagnosed with Anemia due to Chronic Renal Failure CKD
             stage 5 on hemodialysis treatment for at least 6 months. Average Hb during last month
             between 9 to 12g/dL.

          2. Kt/V &gt;1

          3. INR not higher than 1.2

          4. Serum albumin &gt;3.5

          5. Subjects with adequate iron stores (transferrin saturation &gt; 20.0% and/or ferritin
             &gt;100 ng/ml).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Uncontrolled hypertension (defined as diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mmHg or systolic
             blood pressure &gt; 180 mmHg during screening).

          2. Subjects who receive oral anti-coagulation treatment (e.g. warfarin)

          3. Subjects who receive Acetyl Salicylic Acid (ASA) above 325 mg/day or patients who
             receive ASA treatment between 100mg/d and 325 mg/d who cannot discontinue it for 1
             week prior to each EPODURE procedure

          4. Patients currently receiving injections of long-acting Erythropoiesis Stimulating
             Agents (ESA) (e.g. Aranesp, Mircera), a patient on long acting ESA can be switched to
             a short acting preparation (e.g Eprex) and enroll in the study after meeting the
             inclusion criteria and not meeting any other exclusion criteria.
