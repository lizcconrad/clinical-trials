  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In type 1 diabetes (T1D), immune defense cells in the body attack and destroy
      insulin-producing beta cells leaving affected people with a lifelong need for daily insulin
      injections. Even with insulin injections, blood glucose (sugar) control is imperfect and
      leads to many health complications and a shortened life span. This is a pilot clinical trial
      to test the safety of a drug, ustekinumab, in 20 adult subjects with recent-onset T1D.
      Ustekinumab is currently licensed for use in psoriasis where it has proven to be both highly
      effective and safe and so the investigators hope to see a similar effect in T1D. This trial
      will also be used to determine the best dosage and frequency of the drug to be given to
      people with T1D to help design future studies on the drug's effectiveness. The investigators
      hope that if the drug can block immune cells soon after the development of diabetes, any
      remaining insulin-producing cells may be protected, and regenerate, thus producing more
      insulin so that individuals may be insulin free, or require less insulin.

      The investigators will perform an open-label pilot safety study (Phase I/II clinical trial)
      with a total of 20 adult (18-35 years old) subjects with recent-onset T1D. There will be four
      study cohorts, which will be recruited sequentially all to the treatment arm: five subjects
      will be given ustekinumab, 45mg subcutaneously (SC) at 0, 4, 16, 28 and 40weeks, five
      subjects will be given ustekinumab, 90mg SC at weeks 0, 4, 16, 28 and 40, five subjects will
      be given 45mg SC at weeks 0, 4 and 16 and five subjects will be given 90mg subcutaneously
      (SC) at weeks 0, 4 and 16. Recruitment and screening for the pilot study will be completed
      within the first 6 months. The follow up period is 1 year from the first dose.
