    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of 12 weeks of simeprevir
      (150 mg qd) in combination with sofosbuvir (400 mg qd) in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      genotype 1 infected men and women with cirrhosis who are HCV treatment-naïve or
      treatment-experienced.

      This is a open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single arm,
      multicenter study. The study will consist of a screening phase up to 4 weeks, open-label
      treatment phase of 12 weeks, and post-treatment follow up phase up to 24 weeks after end of
      treatment. Approximately 100 participants will receive 150 mg simeprevir in combination with
      400 mg sofosbuvir once dailyfor 12 weeks. Safety evaluations will include assessment of
      adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical examination. The maximum
      study duration for each participant will be approximately 40 weeks.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hepatitis C Symptom and Impact Questionnaire Version 4 (HCV-SIQv4) Overall Body System Score (OBSS) up to Follow-up Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 12 and Follow-Up Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The HCV-SIQv4 OBSS was a self-administered questionnaire that contained 33 items: 29 questions developed to assess severity or frequency of symptoms associated with HCV or its treatment, 3 questions regarding the impact of symptoms on work/school attendance, and 1 question regarding the impact of symptoms on daily activities. A symptom severity score (the mean of responses to the 29 symptom items); each symptom score was transformed to have a range from 0 to 100 (most severe). Higher HCV SIQv4 scores indicates worse symptom severity, more time missed from work/school, and more impairment in daily activities, respectively.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Fatigue Severity Score (FSS) up to Follow-up Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Follow-up Week 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The FSS was a self-administered questionnaire with 9 items developed to assess disabling fatigue that has been used extensively in studies of chronic HCV infection. Item responses were measured on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (1 point) to strongly agree (7 points). The 9 items were averaged to produce a total score; a lower total score indicates less severe fatigue. FSS scores have a range from 1 to 7 where higher scores indicate more severe fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Depression by Using Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Follow-up Week 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CES-D Scale assessed how often during the past week participants experienced 20 symptoms commonly associated with major depression. The CES-D scores range from 0 (no symptoms) to 60 (all 20 symptoms most or all of the time during the past 5 to 7 days). The CES-D scores between 16 and 23 points indicate mild to moderate depressive illness while CES-D scores &gt;=23 indicate probable major depressive illness.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in EuroQol 5 Dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D) up to Follow-up Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Follow-up Week 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D questionnaire was a brief, generic health-related quality of life (HRQOL) assessment that could also be used to incorporate participant preferences into health economic evaluations. The EQ-5D questionnaire assessed HRQOL in terms of degree of limitation on 5 health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) and as overall health using a &quot;thermometer&quot; visual analog scale with response options ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health).</description>

    <description>Sequencing of the HCV nonstructural protein 3/4A (NS3/4A) and nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B) genes was done to identify pre-existing sequence polymorphisms and characterize emerging HCV viral variants in participants not achieving SVR. Sequencing data is available for 16 participants.</description>

        <description>The HCV-SIQv4 OBSS was a self-administered questionnaire that contained 33 items: 29 questions developed to assess severity or frequency of symptoms associated with HCV or its treatment, 3 questions regarding the impact of symptoms on work/school attendance, and 1 question regarding the impact of symptoms on daily activities. A symptom severity score (the mean of responses to the 29 symptom items); each symptom score was transformed to have a range from 0 to 100 (most severe). Higher HCV SIQv4 scores indicates worse symptom severity, more time missed from work/school, and more impairment in daily activities, respectively.</description>

        <description>The FSS was a self-administered questionnaire with 9 items developed to assess disabling fatigue that has been used extensively in studies of chronic HCV infection. Item responses were measured on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (1 point) to strongly agree (7 points). The 9 items were averaged to produce a total score; a lower total score indicates less severe fatigue. FSS scores have a range from 1 to 7 where higher scores indicate more severe fatigue.</description>

        <description>The CES-D Scale assessed how often during the past week participants experienced 20 symptoms commonly associated with major depression. The CES-D scores range from 0 (no symptoms) to 60 (all 20 symptoms most or all of the time during the past 5 to 7 days). The CES-D scores between 16 and 23 points indicate mild to moderate depressive illness while CES-D scores &gt;=23 indicate probable major depressive illness.</description>
