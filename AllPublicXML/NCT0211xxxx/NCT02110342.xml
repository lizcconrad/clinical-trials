  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to understand, using radiolabelled PF-04449913, how this compound is modified
      by the body once it is absorbed. The study also aims to understand how much of the compound
      is broken down and how much leaves the body unchanged.

    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years (inclusive):Healthy is
             defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical
             history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate
             measurement, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

          -  An informed consent document signed and dated by the subject.

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  Subjects enrolled in a previous radionucleotide study or who have received
             radiotherapy within 12 months prior to screening or such that total radioactivity
             would exceed acceptable dosimetry.

          -  A positive urine drug screen or urine cotinine test

          -  12 lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec msec at Screening. If
             QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more
             times and the average of the three QTc values should be used to determine the
             subject's eligibility. Subjects with family history of myocardial infarction,
             congenital long QT syndrome, torsades de pointes or clinically significant ventricular
             arrhythmias. Subjects should be within normal range of potassium, magnesium and
             calcium at screening.
