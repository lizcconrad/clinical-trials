  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT)
      in finding beads after Yttrium-90 bead therapy in patients with primary liver cancer or
      cancer that has spread to the liver (metastatic) that can not be removed by surgery. Imaging
      procedures, such as PET/CT after Yttrium-90 bead therapy, may help see if the beads are
      present in the lung and compare the results with the pre-therapy imaging.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the absolute difference in post-therapy Yttrium-90 microsphere hepatopulmonary
      shunt fraction and the pre-therapy Technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin hepatopulmonary
      shunt fraction in patients with unresectable primary hepatic malignancy and hepatic
      metastatic disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To quantify and compare the pre-therapy Technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin particle
      sizes and post-therapy Yttrium-90 microsphere sizes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive routine pre-therapy Technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin. Patients then
      undergo routine radioembolization with Yttrium-90 microspheres. Within 36 hours after
      radioembolization, patients undergo PET/CT imaging.

      Available imaging, clinical, interventional and surgical follow-up data for 2 years after
      completion of enrollment in the study will be obtained.

    <description>Non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank testing will be used to compare the 99mTc MAA and 90Y microsphere shunt fractions. Alternatively, a natural log transformation of the hepatopulmonary shunt fractions may be used to normalize these data for subsequent parametric paired t-test analysis.</description>
