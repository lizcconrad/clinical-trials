  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of two dose
      regimens of recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) eye drops solution administered
      over 6 months versus a vehicle control in patients with typical retinitis pigmentosa. The
      secondary objective of this study is to attempt to show a dose response by assessing the
      potential efficacy of the rhNGF dose regimens for improving or slowing the deterioration of
      visual function outcomes at 3 and 6 months. During a 6 month follow-up period patients will
      be monitored to determine if there is evidence of a persistent biological effect after
      discontinuation of the study treatment.

             the retinal vessels), reduced and delayed ERG responses, visual field constriction
