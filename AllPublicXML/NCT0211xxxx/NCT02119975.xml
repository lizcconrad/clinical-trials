  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dysfunctioning executive functioning, including working memory (WM), is related to
      rumination. Findings show that working memory capacity (WMC) can be increased by training.
      The current study explored by means of a double-blind randomized controlled trial whether an
      adaptive WM training could reduce rumination, anxiety and depression in a sample of 98
      depressed and anxious individuals.

    <description>The Digit Span (Lumley &amp; Calhoun, 1934), which consist of two parts: the forward and backward span, with 14 trials each. The forward Digit Span is a frequently used measure for short term memory, an important subcomponent of the memory system (Shipstead et al., 2012) and the backward version measures WM.</description>
