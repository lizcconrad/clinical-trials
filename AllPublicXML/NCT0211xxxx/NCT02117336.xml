    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I/Ib trial with a dose escalation phase, followed by a dose
      extension phase. The objective of the dose escalation phase is to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and MTD of P1446A-05 in relapsed/refractory CLL and the objective of
      the dose extension phase is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacodynamics of
      P1446A-05 in 14 patients at the MTD level.

    <description>The study have dose escalation phase, followed by a dose extension phase.
Dose escalation phase: five Dose Levels will be evaluated in the 'dose escalation' phase. The Dose Levels selected are 50 mg (Dose Level 1), 75 mg (Dose Level 2), 125 mg (Dose Level 3), 200 mg (Dose Level 4) and 275 mg (Dose Level 5), once daily. If required, a 25 mg once daily dose (Dose Level -1) will also be studied. For Dose Levels 1, 2 and 3 there will be 2- dosing periods: Single Dose and Continuous Dose. At least 3-patients will be enrolled at each Dose Level. Dosing regimens planned for Dose Level 4 and 5 are 200 and 275 mg once daily. In the continuous dose period, patients will receive P1446A-05 on a 28-day cycle, until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Dose Extension Phase: Up to a total of 14 patients will be treated at the MTD of P1446A-05, determined in the dose escalation phase, until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or death.</description>

             highly protein bound and a competitive inhibitor of CYP2C9 at higher concentrations
             and thus may potentiate the action of warfarin in patients

             contraception and men must agree not to donate sperm during the study and for at least
             4 weeks after receiving the last dose of study treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

             require immediate chemotherapy (history of Richter's transformation is not an
             exclusion); patients with prolymphocytic leukemia (prolymphocytes in blood &gt;55%)

          8. Patients with clinically significant medical condition of malabsorption, inflammatory

             patients receiving routine IVIG have core antibody or surface antigen positivity
             without evidence of active viremia (negative hepatitis B DNA) they may still
             participate in the study, but should have hepatitis serologies and Hepatitis B DNA
             monitored periodically by the treating physician.

             arrhythmia; transient ischemic attack or pulmonary embolism during the previous 1
             month or psychiatric/social situations that would jeopardize compliance with study
             requirements.
