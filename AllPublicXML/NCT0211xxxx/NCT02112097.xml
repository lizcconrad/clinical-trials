    <textblock>
      AUTOMATIC SUBDERMAL INJECTOR SYSTEM (ASIS) Corporation has developed and patented the only
      automatic injection system for delivery of injectable products to the optimum spot, just
      outside of the fascia, which exists subdermally (between the skin and muscle) or interfascial
      (between the deeper muscles). ASIS device creates that bloodless space, enhancing Enbrel's
      efficacy and preventing unnecessary distant spread and adverse reactions. This space remains
      bloodless as long as the skin is lifted up or filled with an injectable product. Although
      ASIS device was initially designed to best administer BOTOX for such muscular conditions as
      Upper limb Spasticity, Cervical Dystonia, Chronic Migraine, Strabismus, Blepharospasm, and
      Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis, the technology will also benefit other injectable products,
      including: GAMMAGARD for Primary Immunodeficiency (PI) and Insulin for Diabetics, etc.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 6 months, Aim 1 will demonstrate that ASIS device consistently delivers an injectable
      product (e.g. Gadolinium) into that subdermal bloodless space. MRI is the most simple and
      logical imaging choice, preferred because with ultrasound, air is injected, which will
      dissipate too quickly out of bloodless space to allow measurements. Since there isn't a way
      to measure the level of Gadolinium within that subdermal bloodless space, at least the
      Prolongation of Gadolinium may be approximated by its greater or longer Persistent % on MRI.
      Also, since we can't assume that bloodless space for patients with a particular disease will
      behave the same way as normal patients or patients with different diseases, this
      approximation only works if the variables are minimized to the same particular skin affected
      by Plaque Psoriasis. Case in point, patients with Plaque Psoriasis tend to have thicker skin,
      so expectantly will have prolonged Gadolinium subcutaneously Persistent %, which may be very
      different from the other diseases and certainly from the skin of normal patients, while the
      Gadolinium subdermally Persistent % should remain the same. Therefore, the Relative
      Prolongation Ability Score or total Persistent % subdermally over total Persistent %
      subcutaneously, will be different and very specific for the particular skin affected by
      Plaque Psoriasis. However, they are valuable indicators that will help us modify the Enbrel
      dosage and duration to inject into that &quot;unknown&quot; subdermal space for Aim 2, from the &quot;known&quot;
      typical Enbrel dosage and duration for Plaque Psoriasis patients. For example, if Aim 1 found
      the Relative Prolongation Ability Score for the Plaque Psoriasis skin to be (2.00), then the
      typical subcutaneously Enbrel 50mg every 3 days, should be 25mg every 6 days subdermally.

      Over 12 months, Aim 2 will again demonstrate the advantages of ASIS device injecting
      subdermally versus subcutaneously, but using Enbrel instead of Gadolinium on the particular
      skin affected by Plaque Psoriasis. Once we have shown ASIS device's consistent performance in
      Aim 1, then we may assume will deliver another product (Enbrel) into that bloodless space
      without the need to measure Enbrel's existent in that bloodless space. Using Enbrel instead
      of Gadolinium, we'll demonstrate the advantages of injecting subdermally over intramuscularly
      for the same affected skin sites in the same 60 adult subjects.

    <description>Gadolinium will be injected with ASIS subdermally (30) or conventional subcutaneous (30) for 60 adult subjects with Plaque Psoriasis (involving at least 10% of body surface and a minimum Psoriasis Area &amp; Severity Index (PASI) score of 10), just for the particular plaque skin area. The first MRI taken promptly after Gadolinium injection for each patient would be his or her reference of 100% Persistent, to which his or her subsequent MRI taken @ 6 hr, @ 12 hr, and @24hr later will be compared for Persistent %.This approximation can only work if the variables are minimized to the same population with Plaque Psoriasis, and the particular plaque skin area. The Relative Prolongation Ability Score or total Persistent % subdermally over total Persistent % subcutaneously, Plaque Psoriasis will be very valuable indicators for us to modify the Enbrel dosage and duration for testing with that &quot;unknown&quot; subdermal bloodless space in Aim 2.</description>

    <measure>Efficacy of Enbrel subcutaneously vs. subdermally in Plaque Psoriasis.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Hypothetically, if that subdermal bloodless space in patients somehow failed to show prolongation of half-life for Gadolinium in Aim 1, we can still proceed with Aim 2, because Enbrel's Pharmacokinetics will be studied anyway, by following tumor necrosis factor, then comparing the Mean tumor necrosis factor receptor : Fc. However, the Pharmacokinetics of subdermally injected Enbrel will be just dependent on Enbrel's diffusion out of that subdermal bloodless space. Therefore, if Enbrel getting into the bloodstream becomes so severely inhibited, then we can just change the osmolality of Enbrel in the end. Response to treatment will be assessed after 3, 6 and 9 months of therapy, and defined as the patients who achieved a reduction in score of at least 75% from baseline by the PASI.8 Other therapeutic advantages of ASIS device subdermally over subcutaneously will also be studied by comparing the reduction of adverse reactions and injection site pain.</description>
