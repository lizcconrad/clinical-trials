  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic musculoskeletal pain is an important problem, and treatments are often prescribed in
      a &quot;trial and error&quot; fashion. Clinicians prescribe a treatment to a patient and then wait and
      see if the treatment is successful. If the treatment is unsuccessful, they will try a
      different treatment. The disadvantage to this method is that it may take a long time to find
      a successful treatment.

      The purpose of the PREEMPT Study is to test whether using a mobile phone application
      (&quot;Trialist app&quot;) that allows patients and their health care providers to run personalized
      experiments comparing two pain treatments is more effective than usual care. Patients
      download the app, and working with their clinicians, set up a personalized trial that makes
      sense for them. Every day they answer questions to track levels of pain and side effects of
      treatment, such as fatigue and constipation. Once the personalized trial has ended, the
      responses to these daily questions on each treatment will be compared. During a regular
      clinic visit, the patient and the clinician will review visual displays of the results to
      facilitate treatment decision-making. Approximately 250 patients will be enrolled in the
      study. Half the patients will use the app and review results with the clinician, and half the
      patients will continue with their regular care (i.e., will not use the app). The two groups
      will be compared to see if using the app is successful in improving long term pain outcomes.
      The goal of the intervention using the Trialist app is to help patients engage actively and
      collaboratively with their clinicians and identify effective treatments more quickly.

    <description>Global health measured with 10 item Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health scale at baseline and 52 weeks, representing physical and mental health components. Global mental health measures mental health, quality of life, satisfaction with social activities and emotional problems. The final mental health score is represented by the T-score, a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Global mental health scores range from 0 - 100, and higher scores indicate better mental health. Data table measures show change over time with positive numbers indicating improvement in global mental health and negative numbers indicating declines in global mental health.</description>

          <title>Longitudinal Change From Baseline up to 52 Weeks Follow-up in Pain Intensity on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Scale</title>
          <description>Pain intensity measured with Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 3a short form at baseline, 13 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks which measures self-reported estimate of how much a person hurts. The final score is represented by the T-score, a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Pain intensity scores range from 0 - 100. For pain intensity, higher scores indicate greater pain intensity. Data table measures show change over time with negative numbers indicating improvement (decreases) and positive numbers indicating increases in pain intensity.</description>

        <description>Four questions from the Pain Medication in Primary Care Patient Questionnaire measured adherence to medications at baseline, 13 weeks, 26 weeks, 52 weeks. Two questions comprised a subscale assessing underuse of medications. Underuse scores range from 0-100. Higher scores indicate greater adherence and less underuse of medication. Data table measures show change over time with positive numbers indicating greater adherence (less underuse of medications) and negative numbers indicating less adherence.</description>

        <description>The Pain Treatment Satisfaction Scale consists of 18 items assessing patient satisfaction at baseline, 13 weeks, 26 weeks, 52 weeks, creating three subscales. Satisfaction with medical care is a subscale that includes 5 questions assessing medical care for pain. Satisfaction with medical care scores range from 0 - 100. Higher scores indicate greater patient satisfaction with medical care. Data table measures show change over time with positive numbers indicating increases in satisfaction with medical care and negative numbers indicating declines in patient satisfaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) PHYSICAL Global Health Scale at 26 Weeks</title>
        <description>Global health measured with 10 item Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health scale at baseline and 26 weeks, representing physical and mental health components. Global physical health measures overall physical health, physical function, pain and fatigue. The final physical health score is represented by the T-score, a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Physical global health scores range from 0 - 100, and higher scores indicate better physical health. Data table measures show change over time with positive numbers indicating improvement in global physical health and negative numbers indicating declines in global physical health.</description>

          <description>Pain intensity measured with Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 3a short form at baseline and 13 weeks, which measures self-reported estimate of how much a person hurts. The final score is represented by the T-score, a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Pain intensity scores range from 0 - 100. For pain intensity, higher scores indicate greater pain intensity. Data table measures show change over time with negative numbers indicating improvement (decreases) and positive numbers indicating increases in pain intensity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pain Intensity on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Scale at 52 Weeks</title>
        <description>Pain intensity measured with Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 3a short form at baseline and 52 weeks, which measures self-reported estimate of how much a person hurts. The final score is represented by the T-score, a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Pain intensity scores range from 0 - 100. For pain intensity, higher scores indicate greater pain intensity. Data table measures show change over time with negative numbers indicating improvement (decreases) and positive numbers indicating increases in pain intensity.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Analgesic Adherence (Underuse) on the Pain Medication in Primary Care Patient Questionnaire at 52 Weeks</title>
          <description>Four questions from the Pain Medication in Primary Care Patient Questionnaire measured adherence to medications at baseline and 52 weeks. Two questions comprised a subscale assessing underuse of medications. Underuse scores range from 0-100. Higher scores indicate greater adherence and less underuse of medication. Data table measures show change over time with positive numbers indicating greater adherence (less underuse of medications) and negative numbers indicating less adherence.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Participatory Decision-making on the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Surveys at 52 Weeks</title>
          <description>Four questions from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey assessed patient-provider discussions on starting/stopping medications and comprise medication related shared decision making. Scores were computed only for patients who reported discussing medications with their clinician in the past 12 months. Medication related shared decision making scores range from 0-100. Higher scores indicate more shared decision making.</description>
