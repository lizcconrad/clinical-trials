      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose
      of Urelumab in combination with Cetuximab in patients with Advanced/Metastatic Colorectal
      Cancer or Advanced/Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck.

    <time_frame>Approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>As determined by medical review of adverse event reports, vital sign measurements, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and results of physical examination and laboratory tests During a 3 week cycle, safety labs are done on Days 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 15. Starting on Cycle 3, Day 1, Chemistry (excluding Liver function test (LFTs)) are to be performed on Day 1 and Day 15 of each cycle thereafter. Physical exams are done on Day 1 of each cycle. Vital signs are done on Days 1, 2, 8, and 15 at Cycle 1 and then on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle thereafter. Adverse events are collected from screening to 60 days after last dose of Urelumab</description>
