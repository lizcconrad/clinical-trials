  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to develop a treatment protocol to be used in trials studying
      internet-delivered CBT for children with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). The
      study size is not based on power calculations but the estimated sample necessary to develop a
      treatment protocol. This study will include 20-30 children with FGID and their parents who
      will be treated individually (face-to-face). The treatment consists of 10 weekly sessions of
      exposure-based CBT. The study uses a pre- post-design with no control group.
