  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The symptoms and severity of arterial disease is secondary to perfusion deficit. The specific
      alteration of the mitochondrial function of ischemic skeletal muscle plays an important role,
      and therapeutic enhancing mitochondrial function are associated with a clinical improvement
      with increase in the walking distance of the patient.

      In severe ischemia, reperfusion required is accompanied by a deleterious episode through a
      worsening of endothelial dysfunction (impaired pathway of nitric oxide (NO)), majorant
      alteration of cellular energy and the hormonal and inflammatory responses. This is
      reperfusion syndrome, which can lead to grave consequences. Our goal is to limit
      mitochondrial and endothelial dysfunction (increased by the reperfusion) by stimulating the
      NO pathway by in situ addition of its precursor, L-arginine. Our working hypothesis is that
      this cellular improvement will be accompanied by an increase in systolic pressure index and
      an improvement in the walking distance.

      Method: This is a trial with direct individual benefit, comparative, randomized, prospective,
      single-center, double-blind, versus placebo.

      2 groups of 30 patients with severe lower limb ischemia requiring femoropopliteal bypass
      revascularization participate in the study. The control group (placebo isoosmotic saline)
      will be compared to the treated group (femoral arterial infusion of 2 g L-Arginine for 30
      min).

      Heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature will be monitored continuously. The
      gastrocnemius muscle is biopsied before and 30 minutes after revascularization to analyze
      mitochondrial respiration and its control. Both femoral and brachial concomitant venous
      samples will judge the importance of muscle damage (lactate, muscle enzymes) and released
      mediators (cytokines, NO and endothelin) on the local and general.

      Main clinical implications: L-arginine supplementation in atherosclerotic patients requiring
      femoropopliteal bypass to limit the initial deleterious effects of reperfusion and improve
      their walking distance and therefore their quality of life. Then extending this treatment to
      other patients with peripheral arterial disease.
