      The aim of this study is to assess the clinical, radiographic and patient-reported outcome
      measures (PROMs) after total knee replacement with Physica KR, define the survivorship of the
      implants and identify possible risk factors that may lead to failure.

          2. Previous partial knee replacement (unilateral, bicompartimental or patellofemoral

         16. Patients who have significant neurological or musculoskeletal disorders or disease
             that may adversely affect gait and compromise functional recovery and evaluation

         17. Patients who have neuromuscular or neurosensory deficit which would limit the ability
             to assess the performance of the device

         18. Patients with systemic or metabolic disorders leading to progressive bone
             deterioration
