  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety and depression are both associated with impairments in executive functions, including
      working memory (WM) which is needed to maintain and manipulate goal-relevant information. Due
      to these WM impairments anxious and depressed individuals have difficulties inhibiting and
      shifting from irrelevant (negative) information and updating goal relevant information. This
      study explored whether training WM decreases these impairments and reduces clinical symptoms
      and rumination. Eighty-four individuals diagnosed with major depression and forty-nine
      individuals with an anxiety diagnosis executed WM or control tasks three times a week, during
      four weeks. Before, after training and at a two months follow-up measurement depression and
      anxiety symptoms, WM capacity and rumination behaviour were assessed. Training WM did only
      result in a reduction of anxiety symptoms in the depression group. These findings are
      inconsistent with promising results of individual studies showing training WM result in an
      enlarged WM capacity and a decrease of psychopathological symptoms. However, our results are
      in line with recent meta-analyses and reviews which show that WM training do not lead to
      generalized effects and therefore, doubt the clinical relevance of WM training programs.

    <description>The WM consisted of two tasks; the Number-letter task (Rogers &amp; Monsell, 1995) and an Updating task. The Number-letter task trains the ability to shift between task relevant stimuli. Participants need to shift between four categories. In the Updating task participants receive a set of three words in which they have to compare the two consecutive words on emotional valence (positive or negative) to train their updating skills. Participants executed the training three times a week during four weeks.</description>

    <description>Both the WM and the placebo training consisted of two tasks; the Number-letter task (Rogers &amp; Monsell, 1995) and an Updating task. To prevent training WM the placebo training was a simplified version of the Number-letter task in which shifting was not required. In the Updating task the placebo group only had to count the number of positive or negative words. Participants executed the training three times a week during four weeks.</description>
