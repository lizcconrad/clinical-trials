  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of diabetes has been growing rapidly in developing countries causing a
      devastating economic burden and increasing demands on healthcare systems. Therefore, there is
      an urgent need to find cost-effective and multi-faceted approach for diabetes care. Peer
      support models provide a potentially low-cost, flexible means that is complimentary to the
      current existing health care services. Trained peer leaders can become qualified extenders to
      a formal healthcare system, thereby, assisting with the education delivery and bolstering the
      efforts of the professional staff. To implement a culturally- specific peer support program
      and determine whether it is acceptable, cost-effective in China is important. This study aims
      to implement and evaluate biophysical and psychosocial outcomes of a peer support program and
      to explore it's feasibility and sustainability in China

    <description>Patients are divided into small groups and assigned with peer leaders for twelve months according to their residence. Besides the same training and follow-ups as the control arm, patients from intervention groups are suggested and encouraged to take part in the group activities with the peer leaders per month. And if possible, casual activities (such as phone call, chatting, short message; physical exercise, group member family visitingï¼Œgoing to supermarket together, etc.)are also recommended</description>

    <description>Patients attend the usual self-management education and communicate with the professionals every two months, getting the information on diabetes diet, exercise, glucose monitor, etc. besides that the group members should attend three follow ups at baseline,6 and 12 months.</description>
