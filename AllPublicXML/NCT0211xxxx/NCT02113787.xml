      The purpose of the study is to prove the bioequivalence of brand and generic topiramate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Generic antiepileptic drugs (AED) achieve blood concentration similar to the brand AED.
      However, controversies exist about efficacy and safety of substituting generic AEDs. Because
      even minor absorption and kinetic differences can elicit a breakthrough seizure in patients
      who are changed to a generic AED from brand AED. Therefore, more ideal evaluation of
      interchangeability from the brand AEDs to generic formulation of the same drug is three-way
      or four-way crossover study, which can evaluate within-subject variability in pharmacokinetic
      and pharmacodynamic. Investigator designed four-way crossover study aimed to assess
      bioequivalence of brand and generic topiramate, to measure trough serum level , and to
      evaluate efficacy, tolerability and side effect of generic topiramate.
