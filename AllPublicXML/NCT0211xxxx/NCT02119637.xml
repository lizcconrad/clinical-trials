      Background:

      - Different parts of the brain are involved in feeling touch. Researchers want to study
      whether repetitive magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the sensory cortex affects how sensation
      feels. rTMS is a repeated magnetic pulse that interferes with brain activity. It affects a
      small part of the brain beneath the scalp. Researchers want to find out the role of sensory
      cortex in sensing different types of touch.

      Objectives:

      - To find out the role of sensory cortex, a brain area, in sensing different types of touch.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy adults ages 18 45.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be pre-screened with a telephone interview. Then they will be screened
           with physical and psychological exams and a urine test.

        -  In Session 1, participants will have an MRI brain scan and fill out questionnaires.

        -  For MRI, a magnetic field and radio waves take pictures of the brain. Participants will
           lie on a table that slides in and out of a metal cylinder. A coil will be placed over
           their head. They will perform a task during the scan. The scanner makes loud knocking
           noises. Participants will get earplugs. They will be in the scanner for up to 60
           minutes.

        -  In Sessions 2 and 3, participants will take Breathalyzer and urine tests. Their
           perception of touch will be measured. Then rTMS will be used to stimulate their sensory
           cortex and scalp for about 20 minutes. Their perception of touch will be measured again.

        -  For rTMS, a wire coil is held on the scalp. A brief electrical current passes through
           the coil and creates a magnetic pulse that affects activity in the brain.

      This study will test how parts of sensory cortex relate to different aspects of touch
      sensation. 24 healthy male and female adults (ages 18-45) will be enrolled. We will use low
      frequency repetitive transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to temporarily reduce
      activation in parts of the sensory cortex and will examine the effect of this procedure on
      perception of touch stimuli. After screening, participants will undergo three testing
      sessions. Session 1 will involve questionnaires and anatomical and functional MRI scans
      (non-invasive brain imaging) that will be used for localizing the correct regions to
      stimulate with the rTMS. Sessions 2 and 3 will involve active and control rTMS and testing of
      gentle (non-painful) touch sensation.

        EXCLUSION CRITEIRA:

          1. Has a dermatological condition such as scars, burns, callouses, or tattoos that might
             influence cutaneous sensibility on the hands

          2. Has had recent or permanent injury of upper limbs or amputation or use of prosthetic
             arm or leg

          3. Used recreational drugs within the past month

          4. Is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          5. Has a current chronic pain condition or has had chronic pain in the past (painful
             condition lasting more than six months).

          6. Has a major medical condition, such as kidney, liver, cardiovascular, autonomic,
             pulmonary, or neurological problems (including blindness or deafness) or a chronic
             systemic disease (e.g. diabetes).
