  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide evidence that Enhanced Medical Rehabilitation is an
      effective treatment for older adults after disabling medical events.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention involves physical and occupational therapy for patients who have been
      admitted to a skilled nursing facility for therapy following a disabling medical event.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either Enhanced or standard
      of care therapy, meaning they will either receive their PT (Physical Therapy)&amp;
      OT(Occupational Therapy) from therapists who have been specially trained in the study
      intervention or from therapists with normal training. Participants will be assessed at
      baseline, 30, 60, and 90 days after baseline, and at the date of their discharge from the
      skilled nursing facility.
