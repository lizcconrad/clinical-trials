  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory registry that will include subjects who have been randomized to
      receive JVS-100 treatment (at one of multiple doses) or placebo by one of a number of
      delivery systems (e.g. endomyocardial injection, retrograde infusion) in a previous Juventas
      clinical trial.

      This Registry will assess the ongoing safety of subjects including morbidity/mortality
      parameters as they relate to heart failure and track any newly diagnosed malignancies. The
      logistics of the study are as follows: to be eligible, subjects must have actively
      participated in a Juventas sponsored trial under IND 14203. After consent, subjects will be
      followed for up to three years post receipt of investigational product during which time they
      will receive phone calls (every 3 months) from the study site asking about their health.
      Questions will be aimed at cardiovascular related events including:

        -  Hospitalizations

        -  ER Visits

        -  Unscheduled visits with Cardiologist

        -  Newly diagnosed malignancies Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will not be reported in this
           study; however, data pertaining to such events will be captured (i.e. date of admission
           and diagnosis.). Data will be captured on paper CRFs, collected by Juventas (or their
           designee) and will be entered into a clinical database for analysis.

        The patient population eligible for the proposed Registry will be subjects who have
        completed a Juventas sponsored heart failure study under IND 14203. The patient population
        will primarily be comprised of symptomatic systolic heart failure patients due to ischemic
        etiology.
