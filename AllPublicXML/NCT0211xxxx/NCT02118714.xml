          -  Type 1 or 2 diabetes and receiving treatment with at least one anti-hyperglycemic
             medication and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/angiotensin receptor
             blockers (ARB) (renin-angiotensin system [RAS] inhibitor)

          -  Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) equal to or greater than 35 mL/min with
             the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) Formula and Urine
             Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (UACR) equal to or greater than 30 and less than 5,000
             mg/g creatinine.

          -  Able to provide a semen specimen at the required intervals.

          -  Baseline sperm concentration equal to or greater than 30 million per mL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with hormone suppressive agents or cancer chemotherapy within the past 6
             months or planned during the study.

          -  History of severe peripheral edema or facial edema unrelated to trauma or history of
             myxedema in the prior 4 weeks prior to screening.

          -  History of pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis or any lung disease requiring
             oxygen therapy.

          -  Documented diagnosis of heart failure, previous hospitalization for heart failure or
             current or constellation of symptoms (dyspnea on exertion, pedal edema, orthopnea,
             paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea) felt to be compatible with heart failure, that was not
             explained by other causes, and for which there was a change in medication or other
             management directed at heart failure.

          -  Currently receiving or has received hormone replacement therapy within 6 months prior
             to screening.
