        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unwilling or unable to give informed consent.

          2. As a result of the medical screening process, the study physician considers the

          7. For subjects with renal impairment: No clinically significant change in disease status
             within at least 1 month prior to study entry, as determined by the investigator.

          8. The subject had donated a unit of blood (450 mL) within the 3 months before dosing, or
             intends to donate in the month after the last scheduled visit.

          9. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational drug or device within
             the last month.

         15. Subjects who have received any prescribed systemic or topical medication within 4
             weeks prior to dosing (excluded are those drugs the renally impaired subject is
             currently taking for treatment of the renal or concomitant disease).

         16. Immunocompromised patients (patients after solid organ or bone marrow transplant;
             patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment).

         17. Subjects with known or suspected Pseudomonas infection or colonization (e.g. patients
             with cystic fibrosis).

         18. Subjects with significant liver function abnormalities

         19. Subjects with acute myocardial infection or unstable angina pectoris
