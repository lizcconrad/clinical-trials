  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to analyze the effect of a 12-week specific jump training
      compared with conventional therapy in patients with chronic functional instability of the
      ankle. It is to be evaluated to what extent the symptoms in of chronic functional instability
      of the ankle can be influenced in everyday life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for;

        1. more homogeneous sub- groups with chronic functional instability of the ankle.

        2. Studies are needed that older patients (up to 50 years) and also take into account
           women.

        3. In addition, studies should be performed in a clinical environment and also at the same
           time clinically adapted test can be used as a form measurement.

    <description>Participant could enter any new ankle sprain into this calendar. As soon as possible after new ankle sprain the participant had to fill in the date, its cause, and sprain-related injuries. The calendar pages contained questions about the circumstances surrounding the new ankle sprain, including how and where it happened, activity performed, possible injury symptoms, time to recover and whether medical assistance or physical therapy was needed. Participants are also requested to record direct medical costs (e.g. physiotherapy, visits to general practitioners and medical specialists, nursing care, and medication) and indirect cost (e.g. disability related loss) using the &quot;personal calendar&quot;. At the end of 2 month, a calendar page was sent by each patient to the investigators</description>

    <description>Physical therapy with a focus on specific jumping exercise. The jumping exercise will be performed for 12 weeks (3x/week), with a break of day between workouts. The 40-minute workout is completed 2 times under supervision in the clinic's internal training group for outpatients. 1 time they train on their own at home, based on a defined training program. The training process is documented by the training protocol.
The incipient exercise intensity is taking personal performance into account. The exercise intensity is increased by a progressive scheme.</description>

    <description>Physical Therapy with a focus on stability and strength exercise. Strength exercise arm has also same duration of 12 weeks with comparable intensity. The program is according to a predetermined program. The 60-minute training is completed twice under supervision in the clinic's internal training group for outpatients.There is no contact with participants of other group.
Between the two exercise sessions there is a training free day. The training process is documented by the training protocol. The incipient exercise intensity is considering personal performance. The intensity is increased after workout usual principles. The exercises are described with clear image and load parameters. The training exercises are regularly monitored.</description>
