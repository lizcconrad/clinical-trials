      A double-center, randomized, double-blinded, 2-way crossover, placebo-controlled Study:
      Comparison of single oral dose 400mg Moxifloxacin-induced QT prolongation between healthy
      Chinese volunteers and Caucasian Volunteers Study Objective:Primary Objective:To compare the
      difference of ΔΔQTcF (Baseline-adjusted, placebo-corrected effect on QTcF) between Chinese
      group and Caucasian group under the same exposure (Cmax) of Moxifloxacin.Secondary
      Objectives:1)To compare the difference of ΔΔQTcF, heart rate, PR, RR, QRS and Moxifloxacin
      plasma concentration between Chinese group and Caucasian group.2)To compare slopes of
      Moxifloxacin plasma Concentration/QTcF value between healthy Chinese volunteers and Caucasian
      Volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total 80 healthy subjects will be enrolled in both sites, both male and female, age 18-45
      years old. Half of them will be healthy Chinese volunteers, both male and female; will be
      recruited to obtain at least 36 evaluable volunteers in Chinese site of CTC, PUTH. The other
      half will be healthy Caucasian volunteers, both male and female; will be recruited to obtain
      at least 36 evaluable volunteers in the U.S. site of Spaulding Clinical Research LLC. An
      evaluable subject is defined as a volunteer completing all study procedures from the
      screening period to the final ECG nominal time-point for QTc interval measurement and final
      blood sampling for plasma levels of Moxifloxacin on the last study day (Day 2 of the second
      period).

      Study Objective:Primary Objective:To compare the difference of ΔΔQTcF (Baseline-adjusted,
      placebo-corrected effect on QTcF) between Chinese group and Caucasian group under the same
      exposure (Cmax) of Moxifloxacin.Secondary Objectives:1)To compare the difference of ΔΔQTcF,
      heart rate, PR, RR, QRS and Moxifloxacin plasma concentration between Chinese group and
      Caucasian group.2)To compare slopes of Moxifloxacin plasma Concentration/QTcF value between
      healthy Chinese volunteers and Caucasian Volunteers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy Chinese subjects, male and female, 18 to 45 years of age, inclusive, and in
             good health as determined by past medical history, physical examination, vital signs,
             electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests at screening.(only for PUTH site) Or, healthy
             non-Hispanic Caucasian subjects, male and female, 18 to 45 years of age, inclusive,
             and in good health as determined by past medical history, physical examination, vital
             signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests at screening (only for SCR site).

          2. At Screening and baseline day, vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and
             heart rate rate) will be assessed in the sitting position after the subject has rested
             for 5 minutes. All of vital signs should be within normal ranges:
