    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea (CSA) and heart failure (HF) are states of
      metabolic demand and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation. In patients with sleep
      apnea and HF, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) initially may reduce left
      ventricular (LV)stroke volume (SV) but subsequently improves and LV function. This may relate
      to an early beneficial effect on myocardial energetics through early reduction in metabolic
      demand that subsequently leads to improved efficiency of LV contraction. However, it is not
      clear whether long-term adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) favorably affects cardiac
      energetics. Any such benefit may also relate to reduced sympathetic nervous system (SNS)
      activation. However its effect on myocardial SNS function is also not well studied.

      In a pilot study we demonstrated early (6 week) beneficial effects of CPAP in patients with
      OSA and HF. The current proposal (AMEND) is a unique substudy of the recently funded
      ADVENT-HF trial (Adaptive Servo Ventilation for Therapy of Sleep Apnea in HeartFailure)
      (NCT01128816; CIHR; D. Bradley, PI).

      We propose to evaluate the long-term (6 month) effects of ASV on daytime 1) oxidative
      metabolism; 2) the work metabolic index (WMI) as an estimate of mechanical efficiency; 3)
      myocardial sympathetic nerve (SN) pre-synaptic function; and 4) heart rate (HR) variability
      in patients with HF and coexisting OSA or CSA. In conjunction with echocardiographic measures
      of LV stroke work, positron emission tomography (PET) derived [11C] acetate kinetics will be
      used as a measure of oxidative metabolism, to determine the WMI. [11C] hydroxyephedrine (HED)
      retention will be used to measure cardiac SN pre-synaptic function.

      Primary Hypotheses: In patients with chronic stable HF and CSA or OSA without excessive
      daytime sleepiness (EDS), long-term (6-month) ASV therapy yields:

        1. Beneficial effects on daytime myocardial metabolism leading to a reduction in the rate
           of oxidative metabolism as measured by [11C]acetate kinetics using PET imaging;

        2. Improvement in energy transduction from oxidative metabolism to stroke work as measured
           by an increase in the daytime work-metabolic index.

      DEFINITIONS Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by: episodes of partial or
      complete pharyngeal collapse leading to obstructive hypopnea and apnea during sleep. OSA
      often coexists with HF.

      Central sleep apnea (CSA) is characterized by: reductions in central respiratory drive during
      sleep that leads to episodes of partial or complete cessation of airflow. CSA often co-exists
      with HF.

      Continuous positive airway pressure(CPAP) delivers air through a nasal or oral interface to
      preserve upper airway patency. It is a treatment for symptomatic OSA or some patients with
      CSA.

      Adaptive Servoventilation (ASV) is effective in alleviating OSA and CSA. It provides
      expiratory positive pressure to alleviate OSA, and inspiratory positive airway pressure to
      eliminate CSA.

      Oxidative metabolism: utilization of substrates via the tricarboxylic acid cycle for
      Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production; it is linked to myocardial oxygen consumption and
      can be measured with [11C]acetate PET.

      The work-metabolic index (WMI) is the external work (minute-work) of the left ventricle
      corrected for the rate of oxidative metabolism and is an estimate of mechanical efficiency.

      Myocardial sympathetic neuron (SN) presynaptic function is the measure of uptake and storage
      of neuronal catecholamines in the heart measured by [11C]hydroxyephedrine (HED) PET.

This substudy is a clinical physiologic proposal designed to determine the effects of long-term (6 months) ASV on cardiac energetics and SN function in patients with chronic stable HF and sleep apnea extending our previous evaluation of short-term CPAP in patients with OSA and HF.
All subjects consenting to the ADVENT primary trial will be eligible to participate in the substudy.
Substudy consenting patients will have [11C]acetate and [11C]HED PET imaging; HR variability; plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels, urine normetanephrine levels within 2 weeks of the sleep study. Baseline measurements will be repeated after 6 months in all patients.</description>
