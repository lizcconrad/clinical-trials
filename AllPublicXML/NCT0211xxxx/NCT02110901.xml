      This research study is designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of an experimental
      drug called PRT-201 in patients both receiving or expecting to receive dialysis who have
      chronic kidney disease and who are undergoing surgery to create a new access point to their
      bloodstream for hemodialysis. PRT-201 is a protein that has been shown in previous research
      studies to help keep vessels patent when applied to the outside surface of the blood vessels
      (arteries and veins) in patients who undergo surgery to create an arteriovenous fistula
      (AVF). The purpose of this study is to determine whether PRT-201 when applied to a limited
      segment of your blood vessel (about 2 inches) immediately after surgery is safe and improves
      the patency of your AVF.
