      The purpose of this study is to understand how carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or percutaneous
      carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) affect memory and thinking resulting in improving or
      worsening of thinking or memory. There have been many studies on this subject, some finding
      that certain patients gain improvement in their brain function and others might get worse.
      The goal of this study is to discover which patients are more likely to have improved
      cognitive functioning. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and percutaneous carotid angioplasty and
      stenting (CAS) are not investigational and are an accepted treatment for your condition. In
      addition, subjects that choose not to undergo surgery will also be included in this study.

      At the present time, large multi-center clinical trials support the use of carotid
      revascularization for symptomatic carotid stenosis and for asymptomatic carotid stenosis
      (greater than 60%) to prevent stroke. Guidelines supporting the use of carotid endarterectomy
      for asymptomatic stenosis are based largely on the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study
      (ACAS) which reported a 47% relative risk reduction for ipsilateral stroke or death in
      patients randomized to surgery compared to best medical management over 5 years. These data
      were further substantiated by the recent publication of the Medical Research Council
      Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery (ACST) trial results (1); however, both trials estimated that at
      least 40 operative procedures were required to prevent a single disabling stroke or death in
      one patient after 5 years (2). These data underscore the importance of understanding the
      cognitive risks of carotid revascularization and developing strategies to limit factors that
      contribute to this risk especially in asymptomatic patients.

      The purpose of this study is to better understand the effect of carotid revascularization
      (using either carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or percutaneous carotid angioplasty and stenting
      (CAS)) on cognitive outcome by prospectively collecting cerebral blood flow data and
      cognitive testing data prior to and after carotid revascularization procedures.

        Patients with unilateral, asymptomatic, significant carotid artery stenosis who are ≥18
        years of age who do not present with past or current significant cerebrovascular and
        neuropsychological disease.

          -  Patients with asymptomatic (defined as no symptoms in past 6 months) carotid stenosis

          -  Patients with hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenosis (according to CREST
             criteria: ≥ 60% by angiography, OR ≥ 70% by ultrasound, OR ≥ 80% by CTA or MRA)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with prior large vessel infarct

          -  Patients with intracranial stenosis

          -  Patients with major depression

          -  Patients with Alzheimer disease (clinically defined or Wechsler IQ &lt;80)

          -  Patients who have had previous ipsilateral carotid surgery

          -  Patients with baseline dementia defined as: Mini-Mental Status Examination score &lt; 21
             OR Mini-Mental score ≥21 AND Baseline HVLT scores more than 3 standard deviations

             sundowning, getting lost while driving).

        as above, but elect to have their condition followed rather than undergo revascularization.
