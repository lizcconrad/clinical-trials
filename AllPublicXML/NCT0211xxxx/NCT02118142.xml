  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with poor insulin sensitivity do not respond normally to elevations in blood sugar.
      This may increase their risk of developing diabetes in the future. The purpose of this
      research study is to determine if the nutrient betaine, found in beets, spinach and wheat
      products, can enhance the production of fetal growth factor 21 (FGF21), a molecule that is
      believed to promote insulin sensitivity.

      AIM: To determine if betaine is a modulator of FGF21 in humans. Low plasma betaine is
      associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, but the mechanisms modulating this
      correlation are poorly delineated. Betaine bioavailability in humans is determined by dietary
      intake and genetic polymorphisms that influence betaine metabolism. Therefore, moderating
      betaine levels could be particularly beneficial for some individuals. FGF21 is elevated in
      response to insulin insensitivity and is under active investigation as a therapeutic
      modality. The mechanisms of action of FGF21 and betaine on insulin sensitivity in humans are
      incompletely understood. This study tests the hypothesis that betaine induces FGF21 secretion
      and insulin sensitizing actions in humans by measuring plasma FGF21, betaine, choline
      (betaine precursor), glucose, insulin and adiponectin in response to betaine supplementation
      over a 24 hour time course in 20 healthy, lean individuals. This pilot nutrition intervention
      will provide key preliminary evidence for understanding whether and how betaine exerts
      metabolic benefit in humans and will inform a future study to investigate the novel
      betaine-FGF21-insulin sensitivity axis in a larger cohort.
