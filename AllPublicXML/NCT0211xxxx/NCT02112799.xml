  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 trial will assess the dose-related safety and PK profile of different doses of
      NVR 3-778, first in healthy volunteer subjects (part I) and subsequently in patients with
      chronic hepatitis B (part II). Additionally, in Part II, changes in patients' serum HBV DNA
      levels and other virologic efficacy parameters will be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Part I (Phase 1a) assessments of the dose-related safety and PK of NVR 3-778 in
      volunteers will be conducted an established Phase 1 unit, which will facilitate the overnight
      confinements and frequent safety assessments and blood sampling required for the Part I
      evaluations. The Part II (Phase 1b) assessments of the dose-related safety, PK, and initial
      antiviral efficacy of NVR 3-778 in hepatitis B patients will also be conducted at
      approximately 14 different sites to meet enrollment goals of 54-84 chronic hepatitis B
      patients.

      To promote objective safety and tolerance assessments during this trial, study subjects, and
      site personnel administering the study drug and performing the clinical assessments on the
      subjects, will be blinded to individual subjects' treatments assignments (active NVR 3-778 or
      placebo doses), for all treatment cohorts in the study. Study advancement to subsequent
      volunteer cohorts in Part I and subsequent patient cohorts in Part II will require
      satisfactory interim reviews of available cumulative safety data by the Part I and Part II
      Safety Review Committees (SRCs), using the safety criteria and review procedures described in
      the protocol. Also, there will be two interim reviews of safety data by an independent Safety
      Monitoring Board (SMB), as described in the protocol.
