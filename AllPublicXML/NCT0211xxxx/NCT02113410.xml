  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is a randomized controlled clinical trial to test the feasibility of
      recruiting, randomizing, and having older adults with osteoarthritis (OA) adhere to and
      safely complete the Sit 'N' Fit Chair Yoga program and the HEP program (primary objective).
      Secondary objectives of the study are to determine the effect of the Sit 'N' Fit Chair Yoga
      Program to reduce levels of pain; improve physical function, psychosocial function, and life
      satisfaction in adults over 65 years of age who are unable to participate in standing
      exercise. Participants at two sites will be randomly assigned to either the intervention
      group (Sit 'N' Fit Chair Yoga) or attention control group (Health Education Program). Data
      collectors will be blinded to group assignments. Data will be collected prior to the
      intervention (baseline), after 4 weeks, and after 8 weeks. Follow-up data will be collected
      after 1 month and after 3 months after completion of the intervention to measure the extent
      to which effects of the intervention continue. Evaluations will include physical measures and
      self-report measures.

      Consenting Procedure Informed consent will be obtained from the participants, followed by
      screening for eligibility. Only one consent procedure will be completed, describing both the
      screening and study procedures. The Project Directors, the PIs, or data collectors will
      discuss the project and obtain the informed consent. At the two study sites, all participants
      live independently and are able to sign informed consent. If changes to the study design or
      program are made, new consents will be obtained from all participants after IRB and National
      Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) approval. One copy of the consent
      will be provided to the participant and one copy will be kept in a file in the PIs' office in
      a locked file cabinet. An ID number will be assigned to each participant and placed on the
      second copy of the consent form.

      Randomization: Each participant who meets the eligibility criteria and who signs informed
      consent will be given an ID number from that list. An overall list of participants with ID
      numbers will be created by the Project Director as participants are enrolled. Participants
      have been enrolled, the outside statistician will send the variable permuted block
      randomization pattern to the Project Director. The Project Director will match the
      randomization pattern with the list of participants to determine to which arm of the study
      each participant is assigned.

      The study statistician, the two PIs, and the two Project Directors will be responsible for
      data management. Dr. Newman and the two PIs will review all data collection forms on an
      ongoing basis for data completeness and accuracy, as well as for protocol compliance. They
      will supervise the Project Directors at each site. All the research members including PIs,
      Project Directors, data collectors, and yoga and HEP instructors will complete safety
      training. All completed forms, including demographic information, will be secured in a locked
      cabinet in primary statistician office at FAU.

      The statistician and his research assistant will enter data independently (double data entry)
      using password-protected access to the SPSS data entry system after data collection period
      (baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 1 month and 3 months after intervention). They will compare
      the databases for data entry error and will check the error rate. All data will be backed up
      on FAU secure servers. The primary statistician will clean the data, randomly selecting 10%
      of all cases in each data entry batch to check for data entry error. An examination of each
      statistical model will be conducted to examine the normality of the residuals and to look for
      outliers and overly-influential data points. Non-normal residuals will require modification
      of the data analysis techniques to allow non-normal distributions to be used. Outliers and
      influential data points will be examined to determine whether they reflect errors in data
      entry. Errors will be corrected or designated as missing if not correctable. Outliers and
      influential data points that are not errors will be noted and discussed in the results. The
      PIs will meet with the primary statistician, the Project Directors, and the RAs on a regular
      basis to discuss progress in data entry and other issues related to data management.

      SAFETY ASSESSMENTS Study progress and safety will be reviewed quarterly. The study
      statistician, PIs, Project Directors, and Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will
      review AE rates. Progress reports, including participant recruitment, adherence and
      retention/attrition, will be provided to the DSMC following each quarterly review. The
      quarterly report will include a list and summary of adverse events (AE), using ID numbers
      only. The report will be sent to the DSMC of independent monitors and forwarded to the IRB
      and NCCIH. The IRB will review progress of the study annually. The PIs will send copies of
      signed recommendations and comments from the DSMC to the NCCIH Program Officer after each
      quarterly review.

      An adverse finding from attending the Chair Yoga session could include increased pain, muscle
      ache/cramping, fatigue, or any combination of these.

      A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that results in one or more of the following outcomes
      regardless of relationship to study intervention:

        -  A life-threatening event

        -  Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization

        -  A persistent or significant disability/incapacity

        -  An important medical event, based on appropriate medical judgment

      All written reports will be in the format required by the FAU IRB and participants, and
      whether changes to the informed consent are necessary. SAEs that are unanticipated, serious,
      and possibly related to the study intervention will cause a discontinuation of the
      intervention for the participant until the PIs or the two Project Directors (one at each
      site) receives a note from the participant's physician allowing the participant to re-enter
      the intervention. Anticipated or unrelated SAEs will be handled in a less urgent manner but
      will be reported to the DSMC, IRB, and NCCIH in accordance with their requirements. In the
      annual AE summary, the DSMC will confirm that they have reviewed all SAE reports.

      Sample Size and Randomization: The purpose of this feasibility study is to compare the effect
      of the intervention on a sample of the studied population in preparation for a larger
      clinical trial and future research. Determining effect size of this intervention will enable
      an accurate calculation of sample size in future research studies. Although this is not a
      dosage study, it may be possible, depending on adherence, to explore the effect of attendance
      on outcomes, which could be useful in future research.

      Based on similar studies of exercise interventions on community-dwelling older adults, it is
      estimated that a sample size of 100 would be acceptable to address the primary objective and
      establish an accurate effect size for the Sit 'N' Fit Yoga intervention. In order to
      oversample by 10% to allow for participant dropout, 120 participants will be recruited: 60
      participants (30 HEP and 30 Yoga) at each of two sites. Assignment will create three groups
      of 10 participants for yoga and three groups of 10 participants for HEP at each site.

      Measurement Tools:

      Ten measurement tools will be used to determine the effect of the Sit N Fit Chair Yoga
      program and the Health Education Program on the study outcome measures. These tools are:

      Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) PROMIS Pain Interference
      Scale Gait Speed Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) Berg Balance Scale PROMIS Physical Function
      Short Form PROMIS Fatigue Scale Short Form Life Satisfaction Index for Third Age, Short Form
      (LSITA-SF) PROMIS Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities Short Form PROMIS
      Emotional Distress-Depression Short Form

      Data Analyses

      The primary feasibility outcomes will be assessed using means, frequencies, and percentages,
      as well as contingency tables, to investigate potential retention and adherence differences
      across or between groups.

      The exploratory analysis of the secondary objectives will be conducted in two main stages:
      (a) preliminary analysis, including descriptive statistics, management of missing data, and
      testing covariates; and (b) hypothesis testing. The preliminary analyses will use descriptive
      statistics to investigate the normality of the data. Correlations and multiple linear
      regression (MLR) will be used to investigate the simple and multiple relationships between
      groups on levels of physical functioning and psychosocial well-being and on assumptions of
      homogeneity of variance and independence of error that are required for more sophisticated
      analytical techniques. Both outliers and multicollinearity will be investigated using Cooks
      Distance, Variable Inflation Factor (VIF), and Tolerance. Full and restricted regression
      models will be used as appropriate.

      Missing Data: With all research studies there is the potential of missing data, especially
      when data are collected across multiple time points. This study will use the Missing Value
      Analysis (MVA) function in SPSS to ascertain the extent, randomness and pattern of missing
      data. This program allows one to investigate the mechanisms of the missing data by assign 1
      or 0 to a vector R for each variable that tests whether the data are missing completely at
      random (MCAR), missing at random (MRM), or missing not at random (MNAR). This analysis will
      use Maximum Likelihood Estimated and the EM algorithm to test the relationship between
      missing values across variables. Patterns of missing data will be displayed in tables and
      figures to facilitate the description of the patterns. Based on the patterns and reasons for
      the missing values, data will be imputed using multiple imputation, which is widely accepted
      as superior to single or simple imputation, usually with empirical Bayesian method or
      stochastic regression imputation. The approach adds a randomly sampled residual term from the
      normal (or other) distribution to each of the imputed values. By default, that procedure adds
      a bit of random error to each substitution. After imputation, the data will be analyzed with
      the completers only and with the imputed data for the ITT. Next, a comparison between the
      regression slopes of the complete and imputed data will be conducted to determine any
      differences. These differences will be described and primary analysis with the ITT group will
      use the imputed data.

        What season of the year is this? 8. What month are we in now? 9. How did you get here
        today?

        Screening Evaluation

        All participants must have OA. As diagnostic criteria for OA, the participant must exhibit
        at least three of the following upon history or physical examination to be considered to
        have a diagnosis of OA and thus to be eligible to participate in the study:

          -  Pain in the affected joint

          -  Morning stiffness that is relieved as the day progresses

          -  Crepitus on active motion

          -  Bony tenderness

          -  Bony enlargement

          -  Decreased range of motion of joint

          -  Joint instability upon standing or bending

          -  Increased pain and fatigue with walking or standing

          -  The participant must ambulate at least 30 feet without assistance from another person
             (may use cane, walker, or wheelchair). Those who require personal assistance to
             ambu-late 30 feet (such as needing to hold an arm or to have someone walk behind for
             safety) will be excluded because they would not be able to complete the 6-Minute Walk
             or Gait Speed Test. We will not provide assistive devices nor train project staff on
             the safe use of such devices.

        During the screening of potential participants each person will be asked whether he or she
        is able to participate in standing exercise programs or regular yoga programs. The
        following questions will be asked and people will be eligible if they identify any two of
        the following:

        Please check any of the following that you feel unable to do because of balance, pain, fear
        of falling, fatigue or strength

          -  Standing for 30-45 minutes

          -  Bending over toward your toes

          -  Bending side to side

          -  Squatting

          -  Standing on one foot

          -  Standing, holding your arms outstretched above your head

          -  Twisting your body side to side
