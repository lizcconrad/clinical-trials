    <textblock>
      Gatekeeper training is where people in the community are trained to recognize and identify
      those who are at risk for suicide and assist them in getting care. Gatekeeper training has
      been widely implemented around the world. There are two types of gatekeepers: 1) Designated
      gatekeepers - individuals who have been trained in helping professions (medicine, psychology,
      social work, nursing), and 2) Emergent gatekeepers - individuals who are not in caregiving
      roles (family members, police, teachers, clergy). Applied Suicide Intervention Skills
      Training (ASIST) has been implemented in Manitoba. However, a recent randomized controlled
      trial in First Nations community members (emergent gatekeepers) from the Swampy Cree Tribal
      Council (Northwestern Manitoba) demonstrated that the training had no positive impact on
      self-reported gatekeeper skills or behavior. Also, compared to a resilience retreat, the
      ASIST training was associated with a slightly higher likelihood of reporting suicidal
      ideation. The demonstrated lack of efficacy and the possibility of adverse effects associated
      with this training program in this vulnerable group have raised concerns about the safety and
      efficacy of ASIST. There were several key limitations of the previous study. First, the study
      only recruited community members (emergent gatekeepers), therefore findings may not be
      generalizable to designated gatekeepers (clinicians, nurses, counselors). Second, the study
      had a small sample size (n=55) and may have not been large enough to detect small effects
      that are often associated with educational interventions. Finally, the increase in distress
      in the ASIST trained group may not have been directly related to the training. To overcome
      the above limitations, we aim to conduct a larger evaluation of the safety and effectiveness
      of gatekeeper training that is occurring in Manitoba First Nations, Inuit and Metis
      communities. Based on previous work that suggests designated gatekeepers are more likely to
      benefit from gatekeeper training than emergent gatekeepers, we will examine these groups
      separately.

      Hypotheses: 1) ASIST will be associated with an increase in gatekeeper skills and behaviors;
      2) ASIST will have a stronger impact on designated gatekeepers than emergent gatekeepers; 3)
      ASIST will not be associated with an increase in suicidal ideation or distress.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of people asked about suicidal thoughts</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This measure asks how many people the respondent asked about suicidal thoughts in a 6 month time frame. The measure asks about 3 different life domains: in their personal life (e.g., friend or family member), in their professional life (e.g., client or work colleague), or other (person not work related or family/friend). Respondents provide a response to the number of people in each of these three domains. The total score will be the sum of the number of people asked across all 3 life domains.</description>

    <measure>Two-item Conjoint Screen (TICS) for alcohol and drugs</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Two-Item Conjoint Screen (TICS) has been used in primary care to identify patients with current alcohol or other drug problems [Brown RL et al, 2001]. At least one positive response to the TICS in the last year detected current substance use disorders with nearly 80% sensitivity and specificity. The scale is composed of two-items which have yes/no responses.</description>

    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a multipurpose instrument for screening, diagnosing, monitoring and measuring the severity of depression. PHQ-9 scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represents mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe depression. The PHQ-9 is comprised of 10 items with questions 1-9 being scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Question 10 is answered only if the individual score 1 or higher on any of questions 1-9 and is scored from 0 (not at all difficult) to 3 (extremely difficult). To determine severity, the individual must score a 2 or 3 on either of questions 1 or 2 and question 10 must score 1 or higher. Total severity is determined from adding scores from questions 1-9.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>How often asked a person about suicidal thoughts</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Respondent was asked how often in the past 6 months that they asked a person about suicidal thoughts in four situations: 1) When the person said something about ending their life, 2) when the person seemed depressed, 3) when the person experienced a stressful life event, 4) when they had a feeling that there was something wrong. Responses options are a 5-point Likert scale ranging from never (0) to always (4). The total score was calculated based on the sum of scores across the four situations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of suicidal people identified</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The respondent is asked to give a count of the number of people who endorsed feeling suicidal when they were asked which gives an estimate of the number of suicidal people identified by the respondent (gatekeeper). Three life domains are assessed (personal life, professional life, and other). The total score is the sum of counts across the 3 life domains.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of suicidal people treated</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The respondent is asked to give a count of the number of people who sought help for suicidal thoughts after they had asked them, providing some idea of how the gatekeeper model operated in getting people to care. Three life domains are assessed (personal life, professional life, and other). The total score is the sum of counts across the 3 life domains.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of respondents who did not ask someone about suicidal thoughts in past 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The question asks: In the past 6 months were you ever unable or chose not to talk to someone directly about their suicidal thoughts even though you were concerned? Respondents can say yes or no. The total number of people who said yes at both time points will be reported.</description>

    <description>The ASIST workshop will be offered to participants who refuse to be part of the waitlist control arm. This is due to the reality in gathering data in these communities. Many times it is not possible for participants to be waitlisted, and therefore we would still want to gather data on those that refuse to participate in the RCT design and will collect uncontrolled data on these participants only.</description>

    <description>Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training is a 2-day, 14-hour intensive, interactive and practice-dominated course aimed at enabling people to recognize risk and learn how to intervene immediately to prevent suicide. The ASIST program has five learning sections: 1) Preparing - Sets the tone, norms, and expectations of the workshop; 2) Connecting - allows participants to explore their own attitudes towards suicide and creates an understanding of the impact that attitudes have on the intervention process. 3) Understanding - Describes the intervention needs of a person at risk. 4) Assisting - Presents a model for suicide intervention. 5) Networking - Generates information about resources in the local community.</description>
