  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a very common problem that impairs the quality of life of about
      17% of adult population in USA above the age of 40. The issues becomes more prominent with
      getting older. OAB was determined by International Continence Society as urgency (immediate
      desire to urinate that could not be postponed) with or without incontinence usually
      associated with increased frequency and nocturia (urination at night). In 2012, American
      Urologic Association published clinical guidelines for the treatment of OAB of non neurogenic
      origin. Neuromodulation was proposed as the third line of treatment and two treatments were
      recommended: sacral nerve neuromodulation (SNM) and posterior tibial nerve stimulation
      (PTNS). Each of above mentioned procedures are invasive. SNM involves lead implantation in
      operating room using X-ray guidance and anesthesia. PTNS involves needle insertion on the low
      extremity.

      The investigators would like to examine the efficacy of transcutaneous nerve stimulation
      (TENS) in refractory to the first two lines of OAB treatment patients.
