  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with externalizing problem behaviour are at risk of developing educational
      impairment, because of their problems in rule following, social behaviour and attention. This
      behaviour represents a great challenge for teacher. In addition, time pressures and conflicts
      with colleagues are the most common sources of stress for teachers. Till now teachers receive
      no evaluated training which in particular regards externalizing problem behaviour. Therefore
      we develop and evaluate an indicated prevention program for elementary school teachers with
      children with externalizing problem behaviour. All teachers of a participating school are
      given a general overview of externalizing problem behaviour (etiology, diagnosis) and
      information on evidence-based treatments for children with externalizing problem behaviour in
      school settings. Single teachers will then participate in a 12 week coaching in which they
      learn to apply classroom management techniques, strategies to improve their relationships
      with children, behaviour modification techniques and cognitive interventions to specific
      target children. The coaching intervention is based on functional behavioural analysis and
      provides teachers with evidence-based strategies which focuses on one target child.

      Longitudinal data will be collected in a within-subject control group design. Dependent
      measures include teacher and observer reports.
