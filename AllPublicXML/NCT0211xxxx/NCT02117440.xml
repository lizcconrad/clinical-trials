  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to apply various scans such as functional imaging,
      Fluorodeoxyglucose_Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET), 62Cu-ETS (Copper) PET,
      Ventilation/Perfusion Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (V/Q SPECT), cardiac
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT/CT, and pulmonary function tests before,
      during and after treatment to see if it predicts how well the treatment works for your cancer
      and how well your lungs function during treatment. A Computerized Tomography (CT) will also
      be performed along with both of these procedures to help the researchers see clearly where
      your cancer or your healthy lung is located. The researchers also perform blood tests in this
      study to look for markers in your blood to see if it helps them determine your risk of
      developing side effects from radiation to the lungs. They will also measure your
      health-related quality of life before, during and after treatment. The researchers hope that
      this study will help them in the future to design radiation treatment plans that provide the
      best treatment for each individual patient.

      Primary aims:

        1. To determine if tumor metabolic activity plus volume measured by 18F-FDG PET/CT and
           tissue/tumor perfusion measured by 62Cu-ETS-PET before and during treatment predicts CT
           tumor response 3 months after completion of treatment and 1 and 2 year local-regional
           progression-free survival.

        2. To determine if functional imaging based lung dose-volume histograms (DVH) more
           accurately predict changes in diffusion capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO)
           compared to the DVH based on simulating CT. Degree of lung toxicity will also be
           documented by functional scans such as Tc-99m HMPAO imaging.

        3. To determine if baseline level, or changes in blood markers such as TGFÃŸ1 measured
           during the course of radiation, predict changes in DLCO.

        Potentially eligible patients include all patients with stage I to IV lung cancer. Patient
        cannot have started systemic treatments or radiation treatments prior to enrollment on the
        study. Informed consent will be obtained in writing prior to initiating the study using a
        consent form approved by the local IRB.

        Inclusion criteria

          -  Histologically confirmed lung cancer, or clinically diagnosed lung cancer.

          -  AJCC stage I to IV lung cancer requiring radiation therapy (3D conformal or
             stereotactic) or systemic therapy, with or without surgery.

          -  Patients participating treatment trials including targeted therapy, experimental
             therapy or immunotherapy are also eligible.

          -  Patients with a locoregional tumor recurrence following surgery will be eligible
             provided they meet other eligibility criteria.

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older and able to lie flat to obtain the
             functional scans or have blood access for blood samples

          -  Female patients with reproductive capability must be willing to use effective
             contraception.

          -  Patients must be willing and able to be compliant with all procedures and visits
             required for this protocol (pre-treatment, during treatment, and optionally throughout
             follow-up period).

          -  Patients must sign an informed consent form for study.

          -  Patients must be willing and able to adhere to a special low-carb diet 24-48 hours
             prior to and fast 8-12 hours prior to every 18F-FDG PET scan

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Pregnancy if the patient is receiving radiation therapy

          -  Lactation if the patient is receiving radiation therapy
