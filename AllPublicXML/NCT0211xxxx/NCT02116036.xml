  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is a syndrome associated with excessive blood
      clotting (thrombosis). APS is among the most common cause of heart attack and stroke in
      patients under the age of 50 and is particularly prevalent in patients with autoimmune
      conditions. Patients with APS and prior thrombosis require lifelong anticoagulant therapy to
      prevent recurrent clots; such therapy is currently provided with warfarin. Warfarin requires
      frequent bloodwork monitoring, and many medications or foods can alter its effect, which can
      put people either at increased risk for clotting or bleeding. Rivaroxaban is a new mediation
      that prevents blood clots that does not require bloodwork monitoring and that has fewer
      interactions. This study is a pilot feasibility study which will: 1) examine our ability to
      identify 150 eligible APS patients; 2) measure our ability to obtain consent from 135 of
      these patients; and 3) test our hypothesis that we can obtain 95% compliance with daily
      rivaroxaban administration. The investigators propose to treat eligible patients with
      rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily. Patients will be followed for a minimum of one year and their
      rates of bleeding and thrombosis will be monitored as secondary outcome measures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior objectively-confirmed venous thrombosis, irrespective of history of arterial
             thrombosis

          -  Two or more prior positive APS serological evaluations at least 12 weeks apart

          -  Current treatment with warfarin administered to achieve an INR of 2.0 to 3.0,
             rivaroxaban or dabigatran at any dose currently used for secondary prophylaxis of
             thrombosis, or short term therapeutic dose LMWH (for example, for the treatment of
             recently diagnosed deep vein thrombosis). Patients not currently receiving
             anticoagulation but in whom anticoagulation is mandated, may also be enrolled if a 20
             mg rivaroxaban dose would be appropriate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior recurrent thrombosis while taking warfarin with a demonstrated INR of 2.0 to
             3.0, or prior recurrent thrombosis while receiving dabigatran or rivaroxaban

          -  History of isolated arterial thrombosis (no history of venous thrombosis) pending CTA
             approval by Health Canada

          -  Need for continued treatment with both aspirin (irrespective of dose) AND clopidogrel

          -  Pregnancy or planned pregnancy during the study period; women who may become pregnant
             will be required to utilize reliable contraceptive measures while on study drug

          -  Chronic kidney disease with calculated GFR &lt; 30mL/min

          -  Geographic inaccessibility

          -  Age &lt; 18 years

          -  Inability or failure to provide informed consent
