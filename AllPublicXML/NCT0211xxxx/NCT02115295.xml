    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of cladribine,
      idarubicin, and cytarabine can help to control AML, high risk MDS, and/or CML in blast phase.
      The safety of these drugs will also be studied.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive treatment in 2
      different parts: the Induction Cycle and the Consolidation Cycles. You will have 1 cycle of
      induction therapy first, followed by up to 5 cycles of consolidation therapy. Your doctor
      will tell you how many cycles you will have. This will be based on any response you may have
      to the therapy.

      Each cycle is 28 days.

      During the Induction Cycle, on Days 1-5, you will receive cladribine and cytarabine by vein
      over 1-2 hours. On Days 1-3, you will receive idarubicin by vein over 30-60 minutes.

      During the Consolidation Cycles, on Days 1-3, you will receive cladribine and cytarabine by
      vein over 1-2 hours. On Days 1-2, you will receive idarubicin by vein over30-60 minutes.

      If the disease has not started to get better after the first cycle, you may receive an
      additional induction cycle, followed by 4 consolidation cycles.

      Study Visits:

      At the beginning of every cycle, you will have a physical exam.

      Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests at least 1 time a week. If the
      disease starts to get better, the blood draws will happen every 2-4 weeks while you are
      taking the study drug. After your last dose of study drug, the blood draws will happen every
      4-8 weeks as long as you are on study.

      On Day 21 (+/- 7 days) of the first cycle you will have a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate
      to check the status of the disease. You may have another bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate
      later in the study if your doctor thinks it is needed.

      During treatment, you will come to the clinic at least 1 time each week for the first month
      and then at least 1 time a month after that until you stop treatment. If the study doctor
      thinks it is needed, you may have additional clinic visits after you stop treatment.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for up to 6 cycles. You will no longer be able to
      take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you
      are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over when you have completed follow-up.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      After your last dose of study drug, you will be called every 6 -12 months by a member of the
      study staff to ask about any side effects you may be having. The phone call should take about
      5-10 minutes. You will continue to be called for as long as possible.

      You will continue to have blood (about 2 tablespoons) drawn for routine tests every 4-8 weeks
      while you are on study. You may also need to have additional blood draws as part of your
      standard of care.

      This is an investigational study. Cladribine, cytarabine, and idarubicin are all FDA approved
      and commercially available for the treatment of different kinds of leukemia. It is
      investigational to use these drugs in combination with each other. The study doctor can
      explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 308 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <description>Patient's classified as achieving a complete response if they have complete remission (CR) or complete remission without platelet recovery (CRp). Patients who do not have evidence of a complete response considered not to have a complete response, regardless of the reason, including early withdrawals for any reason.
Complete response rate (CR) defined as disappearance of all clinical and/or radiologic evidence of disease, including extramedullary leukemia. Neutrophil count ≥ 1.0 x 109/L and platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L, and bone marrow differential showing ≤ 5% blasts. Response Criteria according to revised recommendations of the International Working Group Response Criteria (IWGRC) in acute myeloid leukemia.</description>

    <description>Overall response defined as complete remission (CR), complete remission without platelet recovery (CRi), or partial remission (PR). Patients who do not have evidence of overall response considered to not have an overall response, regardless of the reason.
Complete remission without platelet recovery (CRi) defined as participants meeting all criteria for CR, except for either residual neutropenia (ANC &lt; 1.0 x 109/L) or thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 100 x 109/L).
Partial remission (PR) defined as blood count recovery as for CR, but with a decrease in marrow blasts of at least 50% and not more than 6 to 25% abnormal cells in the bone marrow.
Complete remission (CR) defined as disappearance of all clinical and/or radiologic evidence of disease, including extramedullary leukemia. Neutrophil count ≥ 1.0 x 109/L and platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L, and bone marrow differential showing ≤ 5% blasts.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a diagnosis of AML, Acute Biphenotypic Leukemia, or high risk MDS (&gt;/=

             allowed. Patients with secondary AMLwho have been treated for their antecedent myeloid
             neoplasm will be enrolled into the separate Secondary AML cohort.

          3. For Salvage cohort: Patients with previously treated, relapsed or refractory AML,
             Acute Biphenotypic Leukemia, or CML in Myeloid Blast Phase are eligible.

          4. Age &lt;/= 65 years.

          5. Adequate organ function as defined below: liver function (bilirubin &lt;/=2mg/dL, AST
             and/or ALT &lt;/=3 x ULN- or &lt;5 x ULN if related to leukemic involvement), kidney
             function (creatinine &lt;/=1.5 x ULN ), known cardiac ejection fraction of &gt; or = 45%
             within the past 6 months

          6. ECOG performance status of &lt;/= 2.

          7. A negative urine pregnancy test is required within 1 week for all women of
             childbearing potential prior to enrolling on this trial.

          8. Patient must have the ability to understand the requirements of the study and signed
             informed consent. A signed informed consent by the patient or his legally authorized
             representative is required prior to their enrollment on the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the agents used in this study have
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is a potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             the chemotherapy agents, breastfeeding should also be avoided.

          2. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to active uncontrolled
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV), unstable
             angina pectoris, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          3. Patient with documented hypersensitivity to any of the components of the chemotherapy
             program.

          4. Men and women of childbearing potential who do not practice contraception. Women of
