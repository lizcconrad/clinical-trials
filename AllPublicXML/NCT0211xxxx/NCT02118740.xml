  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a observational study in which healthy found volunteers are recruited to donate 50 ml
      of bone marrow aspirate to enable preclinical studies to obtain proof of concept and safety
      of a bone marrow derived stem cell preparation named AMARCELL. The prepared AMARCELL is only
      for animal studies and after completion of the preclinical program, the intention of AMARCELL
      is to treat humans with a traumatic Spinal cord injury.
