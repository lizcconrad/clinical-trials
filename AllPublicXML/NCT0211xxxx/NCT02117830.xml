    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single-site, randomized, double-blinded, double-dummy, placebo- and
      positive-controlled, 4-period crossover study to evaluate the effect of two dose levels of
      Androxal on cardiac repolarization. Baseline ECGs will be obtained prior to dosing in each
      Period and ECGs will be obtained during expected peak plasma concentrations of Androxal and
      the positive control.

      In each Treatment Period subjects will be admitted to a Clinical Research Unit where study
      drug will be administered as three (3) daily single doses. Treatment Periods will be
      separated by a washout of at least 7 days between Periods.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Generally healthy males as determined by history and physical examination

          2. Between the ages of 18 and 60, inclusive

          3. Clinical laboratory test results within the normal reference ranges for the
             investigative site or results with acceptable deviations that are judged by the
             principal investigator to be not clinically significant

          4. Vital signs (after 5 minutes resting in a supine position)

               -  Systolic blood pressure (SBP) 90-140 mmHg, and

               -  Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 50-90 mmHg, and

               -  Pulse 45-100 bpm Note: subjects with vital signs outside the above ranges may be
                  eligible for the study if the Investigator feels that the results are not
                  clinically significant and will not impact study conduct.

          5. Body mass index (BMI) ≥25 to ≤42 kg/m2 at Screening

          6. Are reliable and willing to be available for the duration of the study, abiding by the
             policies and procedures of the clinical trials unit

          7. Have given written informed consent

          8. Subject must be able to speak, read and understand English or Spanish and be willing
             and able to provide written informed consent in English or Spanish on an Institutional
             Review Board (IRB)-approved form prior to the initiation of any study procedures.
             Subject must have signed and dated a written informed consent form (ICF) before
             undergoing any study related activities, including discontinuation of any prohibited
             medications.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             longer, prior to Screening

          3. Known hypersensitivity to Clomid

          4. Known allergy to moxifloxacin

          5. Abnormal electrocardiogram that, after the option of repeating any such findings, in
             the opinion of the Investigator and/or Sponsor may interfere with any aspect of study
             conduct or interpretation of results including:

               -  QRS &gt; 110 msec

               -  abnormal T wave morphology that will impair the ability to measure the QT
                  interval reliably

          6. History of congenital long QT syndrome or known history of QTc interval prolongation
             or family history of congenital long QT syndrome

          7. Evidence of significant cardiac disease, for example, arrhythmia or unexplained
             syncope within the last year

          8. History of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, symptomatic heart failure,
             ventricular dysrhythmia,

          9. History of thrombophlebitis, thromboembolic disorder or cerebrovascular accident

         10. Evidence of significant respiratory or hepatic disease

         11. Use of cigarettes or any tobacco product within 2 weeks prior to Screening and while
             participating in the study
