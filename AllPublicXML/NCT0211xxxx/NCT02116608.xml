  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about the different ways used to treat tracheostomy
      granulomas. Investigators want to see which standard of care method (steroid application,
      silver nitrate, or betadine) is more successful in treating tracheostomy granulomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon joining the study patients will be assigned to one of the three treatment groups
      (steroid application, silver nitrate, and betadine). These three treatments are standard of
      care and patients would have been treated with one of them anyway. Patients will be followed
      for an observation period of six weeks with follow-up appointments, per standard of care,
      every two weeks (+/- 3 days) in order for a physician to evaluate if the treatment method is
      working. If during a follow-up visit, the physician determines the treatment method is not
      working, the follow-up period will end and participation in the study will be complete. In
      addition, if a patient is given a different form of treatment during the observation period,
      such as in the emergency department or through their primary care physician, the follow-up
      period will end and participation in the study will be complete.

    <description>Definition of success: The investigators are defining successful treatment of tracheostomy granulomas as a decrease in the frequency of granulomas over a six week observation period using the assigned treatment or partial or complete resolution of the granuloma. Partial resolution is defined as 25-75% resolution and complete resolution is defined as greater than 75% resolution.
Definition of failure: The investigators are defining a treatment as a failure if during the six week observation period of using the assigned treatment, there is either no improvement in the resolution or there has been an increase in size or frequency of tracheostomy granulomas.</description>
