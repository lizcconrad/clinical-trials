  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain control is a common and serious problem in cancer patients. Although WHO has developed a
      three-stage model of cancer pain management, 80% cancer patients still suffer moderate to
      severe pain in their daily life. When patients are with acute exacerbation or aggravate of
      pain, they usually visit the emergency department for more help.

      Acupuncture is a safe, low-invasive and economic treatment. And it has been world-wide used
      as a complementary therapy among patients with cancer. It can not only relieve pain in cancer
      patients, but also can reduce some of the side effects caused by some treatment.

      This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in cancer patient with
      acute pain onset through emergency department with objective Traditional Chinese Medicine
      assessment.

    <description>Autonomic nervous dysfunction plays a role as a consequence of pain. Recording the heart rate variability (HRV) in an easy non-invasive methods to investigate autonomic balance.
HRV would be measured and compared before and after intervention</description>

    <measure>Tongue diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Tongue diagnosis plays an important role in TCM. In clinical practice Practitioners observed tongue characteristics, such as the color and shape, and the amount of saliva before deducing the primary ailment of a patient.
We would take photos of tongue before and after intervention to compare the clinical changes.</description>

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was made by Pain Research Group in order to measure the pain score of cancer patients.
We would do the questionnaire before and 7 days after intervention to investigate if there's a long-term effect.</description>
