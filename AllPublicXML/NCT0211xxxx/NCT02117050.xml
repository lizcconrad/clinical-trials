    <measure>Change From Baseline in Treatment Satisfaction Score Determined by the Global Satisfaction Sub-scale of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM [Version II]) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The TSQM (Version II) is a validated tool that measures patient satisfaction with medical treatments using a 100-point scale. Global satisfaction sub-scale of TSQM was to be used to measure overall satisfaction with medication using a 100-point scale. Subject were to respond about their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with medication they are taking on a scale ranging from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated greater satisfaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient-Determined Disease Steps Questionnaire (PDDS) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>PDDS questionnaire was to be used to assess the walking ability of subjects. Subjects were to describe their walking ability on scale ranging from 0 to 8, where 0 indicated normal walking and 8 indicated subject's condition as bedridden. Lesser score indicated better walking ability.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQoL-54) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The MSQOL-54 is a multidimensional health-related quality of life measure that combines both generic and MS-specific items into a single instrument. MSQoL-54 is a 54 item questionnaire which covers 12 sub-scales along with two summary scores, and two additional single-item measures. The 12 sub-scales are: physical function, role limitations-physical, role limitations-emotional, pain, emotional well-being, energy, health perceptions, social function, cognitive function, health distress, overall quality of life, and sexual function. The 2 summary scores are the physical health composite summary and the mental health composite summary. The 2 additional single item measures are satisfaction with sexual function and change in health. Each of the 12 sub-scale scores, the 2 summary scores and 2 single item measures were to be converted into an overall Total Score ranging from 0-100, where higher scores indicated better health status.</description>

    <description>The TSQM (Version II) is an 11-item validated tool that measures patient satisfaction with medical treatments using a 100-point scale. Total TSQM score was the average of individual sub-scale scores (effectiveness, side effects, convenience and global satisfaction) and ranged from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated greater satisfaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQoL-54) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The MSQOL-54 is a multidimensional health-related quality of life measure that combines both generic and MS-specific items into a single instrument. MSQoL-54 is a 54 item questionnaire which covers 12 sub-scales along with two summary scores, and two additional single-item measures. The 12 sub-scales are: physical function, role limitations-physical, role limitations-emotional, pain, emotional well-being, energy, health perceptions, social function, cognitive function, health distress, overall quality of life, and sexual function. The 2 summary scores are the physical health composite summary and the mental health composite summary. The 2 additional single item measures are satisfaction with sexual function and change in health. Each of the 12 sub-scale scores, the 2 summary scores and 2 single item measures were to be converted into an overall Total Score ranging from 0-100, where higher scores indicated better health status.</description>
