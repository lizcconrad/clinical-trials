  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to evaluate clinical significance of measuring maternal
      blood estriol levels, after the administration of antenatal corticosteroids to enhance lung
      maturity. The investigators will test for associations of the change in maternal estriol with
      the development of respiratory distress syndrome. The investigators are also interested in
      determining whether salivary estriol is a valid surrogate to estriol blood assays. In
      addition the investigators will correlate these changes to pharmacokinetic (PK),
      pharmacodynamics (PD), and pharmacogenetic measures of betamethasone administration and fetal
      respiratory outcome

    <textblock>
      We will obtain serum and saliva for estriol measurement before or within 2 hours of antenatal
      corticosteroid administration and about 24 hours after each dose is given.

      Women who consent to an optional PK portion of the study will have plasma samples obtained
      pre-dose and then on a schedule of approximately 0.5-2, 4-8, 10-15, 22-24 hours after the
      first dose and then 6-8, 24, and 48 hours after the 2nd dose. One sample will be collected in
      each of these times.

      A sample of whole blood will be obtained for DNA isolation. At the time of delivery,
      umbilical cord blood will be collected before being discarded for DNA and plasma. If we are
      unable to obtain umbilical cord blood, a buccal swab will be collected from the baby for DNA
      extraction.

    <description>Serum Estriol measurement via different assays is complex, expensive, labor intensive, time consuming, and generally performed at specific reference labs. Salivary Estriol level is an ideal potential surrogate for serum Estriol. It is convenient, non-invasive, and expedient. It may not, however, be as sensitive as serum estriol concentrations at detecting the association with glucocorticoid response. This study will collect both samples to determine which one is better suited for clinical use in this condition.</description>
