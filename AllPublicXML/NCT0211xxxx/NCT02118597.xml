  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, national, multicenter, non-interventional study examined the use of triple
      combination therapy with boceprevir, pegylated interferon (peginterferon) alfa-2a and
      ribavirin in re-treating participants with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection.
      Dosing and treatment duration were at the discretion of the investigator in accordance with
      local clinical practice and local labeling. Participants were to be observed for the duration
      of their triple combination therapy and for up to 24 weeks thereafter.

    <measure>Sustained Virological Response 24 (SVR24) Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks after end of treatment (EOT) at Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>The SVR 24 rate is defined as percentage of participants with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) less than 15 international unit/milliliter (IU/mL) after the 24-weeks follow-up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Virological Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Virological response is defined as HCV RNA &lt;15 IU/mL.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Virological Breakthrough</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Virological breakthrough is defined as either HCV RNA &gt;=15 IU/mL in participants with prior virological response or as an increase in HCV RNA &gt;/=1 log10 above nadir.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Virological Relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 49 up to Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>Virological response is defined as HCV RNA &gt;/=15 IU/mL during the treatment free follow-up period in participants with virological response at the end of treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Discontinuation Due to Futility</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment discontinuation due to futility is defined as HCV RNA drop &lt;3 log10 at Week 8, HCV RNA &gt;/=100 IU/mL at Week 12, or HCV RNA &gt;/=15 IU/mL at Week 24.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Discontinuation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment discontinuation is reported by sub-categories of reasons for treatment discontinuation. Futility rule is defined as HCV RNA drop &lt;3 log10 at Week 8, HCV RNA &gt;/=100 IU/mL at Week 12, or HCV RNA &gt;/=15 IU/mL at Week 24.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 72 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Positive Predictive Value of Participant Demographics for SVR Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening (before Week 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Demographic characteristics recorded were age and gender. Predictive value of these characteristics for SVR rate was to be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Positive Predictive Value of Liver Fibrosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening (before Week 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The following sub-categories of liver fibrosis were determined in this study: 1) no cirrhosis, 2) bridging fibrosis and 3) cirrhosis. Predictive value of these sub-categories of liver fibrosis for SVR rate was to be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Predictive Value of HCV Disease Characteristics</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening (before Week 1)</time_frame>
    <description>HCV disease characteristics evaluated were HCV genotype (subtype), including HCV 1(a) and HCV 1(b). Predictive value of these disease characteristics for SVR rate were to be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Positive Predictive Value of Previous Virological Response (Null-response, Partial Response, or Relapse)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 72 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Previous virological response was sub-categorized into the following categories: null-response, partial response, or relapse. Predictive value of these sub-categories for SVR rate were to be assessed.</description>

          <population>Due to the early termination of the study follow-up of the vast majority of the participants was not possible and data were not collected. Therefore, results for this outcome measure are based on one participant.</population>

An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>
