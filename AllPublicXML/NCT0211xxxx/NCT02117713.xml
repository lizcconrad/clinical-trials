    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, extension study of LUM001 in children diagnosed with Alagille Syndrome
      who have completed participation in a core LUM001 treatment protocol. The primary objective
      is to evaluate long-term safety and tolerability of LUM001. Efficacy will be assessed by
      evaluating the effect of LUM001 on the biochemical markers and pruritus associated with
      Alagille Syndrome.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Experienced an adverse event or serious adverse event (SAE) related to the study drug
             during the LUM001-301 protocol that led to the discontinuation of the subject from the
             core study.

          2. Any conditions or abnormalities which may compromise the safety of the subject, or
             interfere with the subject participating in or completing the study.
