  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      vWF is stored in weibel-palade-bodies of endothelial cells as well as alpha-granula of
      platelets and is released upon their activation. Endothelial cell dysfunction as well as
      platelet activation often occur in liver disease and portal hypertension, which may lead to
      an increase in circulating vWF levels. Indeed, multiple studies have reported that liver
      disease is associated with increased circulating vWF- antigen (vWF-Ag). Furthermore,
      increased circulating vWF -Ag Levels have been shown to be associated with increased
      mortality rates in patients with chronic liver disease. Within a prospective evaluation
      cohort, the investigators were able to document that patients with increased vWF-Ag levels
      prior to liver resection suffered from an increased incidence of postoperative liver
      dysfunction and morbidity. Within this prospective multicenter validation study, the
      investigators now aim to prospectively validate that circulating vWF-Ag prior to liver
      resection is a valuable marker to predict postoperative clinical outcome.
