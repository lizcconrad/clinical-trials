  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a fibre rich health food drink on
      the post prandial glucose and triglyceride peak in healthy overweight adults with impaired
      fasting glucose (IFG). The study is randomised, stratified, double blind, two treatments, two
      period cross over study.
