  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptor and proteinase-activated receptor 2
      (PAR2) have been implicated in the mechanism of acid induced inflammation in gastroesophageal
      reflux disease (GERD). We aimed to evaluate TRPV1 and PAR2 mRNA expression levels in the GERD
      patients and their relationship with endoscopic findings and reflux symptoms.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the subjects receive upper GI endoscopy and completed questionnaires about GERD symptoms
      under the supervision of a well-trained interviewer. Subjects are excluded if there was a
      history of gastrointestinal surgery, Barrett's esophagus, esophageal motility disorder,
      duodenal ulcer, benign gastric ulcer or gastroduodenal cancer and if he or she had any
      history of systemic disease requiring chronic medication (except for hypertension and
      diabetes mellitus).

      The subjects are classified into 3 groups after upper GI endoscopy and completing
      questionnaires about GERDsymptoms ; ERD(erosive reflux disease), NERD(nonerosive reflux
      disease) and control group.

    <description>The primers used in real-time qPCR were designed using PrimerExpress Software V2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) based on sequence information from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. Real-time qPCR was performed in triplicate by using a StepOnePlus Real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems) with SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) according to manufacturers' instructions and protocols. Thermal cycling was performed as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10s followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 33s. Homo b-actin was used as a reference; i.e. each sample was normalized on the basis of its b-actin content. The relative change in all target genes expression was determined by the fold-change analysis.</description>

        <description>The primers used in real-time qPCR were designed using PrimerExpress Software V2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) based on sequence information from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. Real-time qPCR was performed in triplicate by using a StepOnePlus Real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems) with SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) according to manufacturers’ instructions and protocols. Thermal cycling was performed as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10s followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 33s. Homo b-actin was used as a reference; i.e. each sample was normalized on the basis of its b-actin content. The relative change in all target genes expression was determined by the fold-change analysis.</description>
