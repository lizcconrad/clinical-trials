    <textblock>
      Parkinson disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy
      (PSP) are neurodegenerative disorders. PD and MSA are alpha-synucleinopathies, which are
      characterized by the abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein, while tau protein accumulates
      in PSP. The development of biological markers for the diagnosis and prognosis in PD, MSA and
      PSP remains an unmet need. Such biological markers are crucial for future
      disease-modification and neuroprotection trials. Alpha-synuclein has a high potential for
      biomarker development since it constitutes the pathological hallmark feature in PD and MSA.
      The oligomeric alpha-synuclein seems to be particularly involved in abnormal protein
      aggregation in alpha-synucleinopathies.

      The main objective is to compare oligomeric alpha-synuclein CSF levels between PD, MSA and
      PSP patients. PD and MSA patients will receive Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and blood sampling
      at two study visits (baseline and after 12 months). Major secondary objectives are (i) to
      assess potential associations between the biomarker and clinical measures of disease severity
      and progression in MSA and PSP, and (ii) to assess the variation of the biomarker and its
      correlation to disease severity and progression in PD, MSA and PSP.

    <textblock>
      The differential diagnosis between Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and
      progressive supranuclear palsy can be very difficult in early disease. PD, MSA and PSP are
      neurodegenerative disorders. PD and MSA belong to the alpha-synucleinopathies, which are
      characterized by the abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein. Alpha-synuclein accumulates in
      intraneuronal Lewy bodies in PD patients and as intracytoplasmic glial inclusions in MSA. In
      PSP, tau protein accumulates in neurons and glia cells while alpha-synuclein deposits are
      only found to a small extend.

      The development of biological markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of PD, MSA and PSP
      remains an unmet need. Beyond guiding clinical decision-making, such biological markers are
      crucial for future disease-modification and neuroprotection trials.

      Alpha-synuclein has a high potential for biomarker development since it constitutes the
      pathological hallmark feature of PD and MSA. The oligomeric alpha-synuclein fraction whose
      CSF levels are increased in PD seems to be particularly involved in abnormal protein
      aggregation in alpha-synucleinopathies.

      The main objective of the study is to compare oligomeric alpha-synuclein CSF levels between
      PD, MSA and PSP patients. Secondary objectives are (i) to compare total alpha-synuclein
      levels and the index total/oligomeric alpha-synuclein between PD, MSA and PSP, (ii) to study
      the correlation and concordance between CSF and plasma levels of total and oligomeric
      alpha-synuclein, (iii) to assess potential associations between the biomarker and clinical
      measures of disease severity and progression and (iv) to assess the variation of the
      biomarker over time and its correlation to disease severity and progression.
