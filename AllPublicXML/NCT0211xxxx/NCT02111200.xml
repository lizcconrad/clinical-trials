  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will study and compare how effectively sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium
      benzoate, and a combination of the two, help excrete nitrogen in healthy volunteers. Subject
      participation will require three, separate, four-day study periods at least one week apart.
      During one study period (also called a treatment arm), subjects will take sodium
      phenylbutyrate; during another they will take sodium benzoate; during another they will take
      a combination of the two medications.

      We expect to find that phenylbutyrate is more effective at removing nitrogen than benzoate or
      a combination of the two.

    <description>The objective of this protocol is to directly compare the efficacy of benzoate, phenylbutyrate and a combination of the two, to conjugate nitrogenous compounds in healthy volunteers. The nitrogenous compound of interest in each arm would be based on the medication used. This would be hippuric acid in the benzoate arm, phenylacetylglutamine in the phenylbutyrate arm, and hippuric acid AND phenylacetylglutamine in the MIX arm. The mean hippuric acid levels in the phenylbutyrate arm would thus be 0.</description>

        <description>The objective of this protocol is to directly compare the efficacy of benzoate, phenylbutyrate and a combination of the two, to conjugate nitrogenous compounds in healthy volunteers. The nitrogenous compound of interest in each arm would be based on the medication used. This would be hippuric acid in the benzoate arm, phenylacetylglutamine in the phenylbutyrate arm, and hippuric acid AND phenylacetylglutamine in the MIX arm. The mean hippuric acid levels in the phenylbutyrate arm would thus be 0.</description>
