        The study will enroll subjects undergoing one of the following surgical procedures:

          -  Vascular Surgery

          -  Hepatic surgery

          -  Soft tissue surgery

          -  Renal surgery

          -  Spinal surgery

        Inclusion Criteria (pre-surgery):

          1. Age is ≥36 weeks gestational age at birth (for infants) through &lt;18 years of age at
             time of treatment

          2. Subject's legal representative (parent or guardian) has signed an institutional review
             board (IRB)-approved informed consent document

          3. If a subject is ≥ 7 years old, or appropriate age as defined by local regulations, the
             subject may be required to have signed an IRB-approved assent document

          4. Subject is scheduled to undergo one of the surgical procedures described above

          5. If female and of child-bearing potential, subject has negative pregnancy test on the
             day of surgery (baseline)

          6. If subject is a sexually active male or a sexually active female of child-bearing
             potential, subject agrees to use a medically accepted form of contraception from the

          8. Target Bleeding Sites surface area of ≤100 cm2

          9. Has not received any whole blood, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate, or
             platelets within 24 hours prior to study drug. Packed red blood cell (PRBC)
             transfusions are allowed

         10. No complication during surgery other than bleeding which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may interfere with the assessment of efficacy or safety

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Gestational age of &lt;36 weeks at birth (for infants less than 6 months of age)

          2. Any clinically-significant congenital coagulation disorder (e.g., hemophilia A or B)
             that may interfere with the assessment of efficacy or pose a safety risk to the
             subject according to the Investigator

          3. Baseline abnormalities of international normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 2.5 or activated
             partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) &gt; 100 seconds during screening that are not
             explained by current drug treatment (e.g., warfarin, heparin) or chronic disease state
             necessitating surgery (e.g., end stage liver disease).

          4. Aspartate Aminotransferase (ASAT/AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALAT/ALT) &gt; 3 x
             upper limit normal range during screening, except for subjects undergoing liver
             resection surgery or with a diagnosis of liver disease where there is no upper limit
             for these analytes due to nature of their disease

          5. Subject is unwilling to receive blood products or products derived from human blood

          6. Platelets &lt; 100 x10ᴧ9 PLT/L during screening unless due to chronic disease state,
             e.g., liver disease/failure, necessitating surgery

          7. Subject has known antibodies or hypersensitivity to Raplixa or any of it's components,
             other thrombin preparations or coagulation factors

          8. Known allergy to porcine gelatin

          9. Medical, social, or psychosocial factors that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             could impact subject safety or compliance with study procedures

         10. Subject is; 1) currently participating in another clinical study or 2) has
             participated in another clinical study within 30 days of screening or 3) plans to
             participate in a clinical study prior to completion of the 30-day follow-up period
