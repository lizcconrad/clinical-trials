  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mass in Motion Kids is a whole-of-community intervention in Fitchburg and New Bedford,
      Massachusetts that incorporates evidence-based interventions across multiple sectors and at
      multiple levels. The overall goal of the study is to examine the extent to which the
      comprehensive, systematic intervention reduces childhood obesity among underserved children.

      The clinical intervention implements evidence-based interventions each city's
      federally-qualified community health center. Intervention components aim to improve primary
      and secondary prevention of childhood obesity and implement changes at four levels:
      clinician; parent-family; organizational; and environmental. We additionally provide training
      and educational materials to other pediatric clinicians in the two communities. The clinical
      intervention components include (1) advanced training on clinical quality improvement and
      obesity prevention, assessment, management; (2) computerized, point-of-care decision support
      tools for clinicians; (3) implementation of multi-disciplinary weight management programs
      within the community health centers, e.g. Healthy Weight Clinics (HWC); (4) integrating
      community health workers into the primary care and HWC teams; and (5) health center
      environmental changes to support behavior change modification.
