  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide and trabeculectomy is the most
      commonly performed operation to slow-down the disease progression. In this study, we compare
      the effect of topical cyclosporine A and betamethasone eye drops on the postoperative course
      and surgical success of trabeculectomy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trabeculectomy is still the most popular filtering surgery for glaucomatous patients. In this
      type of surgery, postoperative care and management is highly important for surgical success.
      A principle component of postoperative regimen is anti-inflammatory medications. However,
      corticosteroid eye drops, the most frequently used agents, have some side effects, including
      raising intraocular pressure.

      Cyclosporine A could be an interesting alternative, because not only it has acceptable
      anti-inflammatory effect and could reduce some ocular surface problems, but also it has
      minimal direct effect on intraocular pressure. In this study, we will compare the effect of
      topical cyclosporine A and betamethasone on surgical outcome and postoperative course of
      trabeculectomy patients.

      The study is a prospective study to compare the effect of topical betamethasone and
      cyclosporine A on postoperative findings of glaucoma patients, undergoing trabeculectomy
      surgery.

      In this study, trabeculectomy patients, who fulfill the study criteria, will be randomized to
      either study group and follow-up visits will be done in a masked fashion. In each visit, a
      detailed history taking and eye examination will be done by an examiner unaware of study
      group. A third party would do data control for patient safety. At the conclusion of the
      study, the data of the two groups would be compared. All human research ethical codes are
      strictly respected and the Ethical Committee of the University has an ongoing inspection on
      all study steps.

      We hypothesize that cyclosporine A could provide better inflammation and intraocular pressure
      control and may enhance surgical success rate. However, our null hypothesis is that the
      result in study groups will not differ statistically significantly.
