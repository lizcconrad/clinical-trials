  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT will be performed 1-2 weeks after allogeneic stem cell
      transplant, and radiographic evidence of mucosal inflammation will be correlated with the
      subsequent development of acute graft versus host disease. The primary endpoint is the
      feasibility and safety of contrast-enhanced abdominal CT in the early post-transplant period,
      as defined by the risk of contrast-related nephropathy or allergic reaction.

    <time_frame>Baseline through 72 hours after intravenous contrast administration</time_frame>
    <description>Contrast related nephropathy is defined as &gt;25% increase in serum creatinine from baseline (day of CT) or 0.5 mg/dL increase in absolute value, within 48-72 hours of intravenous contrast administration.
Assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.0.
The proportion of patients who develop contrast nephropathy will be recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between CT risk scores and occurrence of acute GVHD</measure>
    <time_frame>180 days</time_frame>
    <description>Images will be reviewed for presence of abnormal mucosal enhancement along the gastrointestinal tract including gallbladder and biliary system, bowel wall thickening, engorgement of vasa recta, mesenteric edema, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, bowel wall thickening, and periportal edema. Abnormal GI mucosal enhancement, if present, will be characterized by relative intensity (mild, moderate, severe), number of involved segments (single segment, two segments, or three segments or more), and location of involved segments. Other findings listed above will provide binary data. All data points will then be used for patient risk stratification for developing GvHD.</description>

    <description>To optimize visualization of bowel mucosal, patient will be given 1350 ml, or as much as can be tolerated, of negative oral contrast to distend the small bowel one hour prior to scanning. A weight-based volume of Optiray-350 will be injected at a rate of 4 cc/sec followed by 50 cc of saline flush also at 4 cc/sec.</description>
