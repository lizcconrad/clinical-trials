    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to compare measurements in knowledge of decision options,
      support for decision making, uncertainly in decision making, and clarity of values important
      to decision making among two groups of type 2 diabetes patients, those who receive a Patient
      Decision Aid and those who receive usual care.

    <textblock>
      This study uses a randomized, controlled trial design to compare knowledge of decision
      options, support for decision making, uncertainly in decision making, and clarity of values
      important to decision making among patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes who are only
      taking metformin medication. The intervention is a Patient Decision Aid (PDA) video delivered
      via the internet.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint for this investigation is the knowledge total score at final followup 4- 6 weeks after randomization between the PDA versus usual care groups. Questions are about available treatments and specific to the information on medication options available to people with type 2 diabetes when metformin alone does not achieve adequate glycemic control.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional conflict</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by using the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). Scale will measure domains including: (1) uncertainty in choosing among alternatives; (2) modifiable factors contributing to uncertainty such as feeling uninformed, unclear about values and unsupported in decision making; and (3) perceived quality of decision making. Global decision conflict score and perceived effective decision sub-score will be summarized descriptively following decision and will be compared between arms. Sub-scores are: Uncertainty, Informed, Values clarity, and Support.</description>
