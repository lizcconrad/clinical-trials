  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find patients's response to terlipressin and octreotide during
      hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement by observing portal and systemic hemodynamics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal variceal bleeding is one of the main causes of death in cirrhosis patients.
      Prevention of bleeding events, including primary and secondary prophylaxis, is very important
      for reducing the mortality of variceal bleeding. Terlipressin and octreotide can effectively
      control bleeding with few side effects, which has been recommended by Baveno V in treatment
      of acute variceal bleeding. Terlipressin and high dose octreotide will be administered to the
      patients with cirrhosis related esophageal varices when they undergo hepatic venous pressure
      gradient measurement. Changes from portal and systemic hemodynamics will be observed to
      evaluate the safety and effects of terlipressin and high dose octreotide as well as to
      determine wether patients respond to them. The results can be served as clinical evidence for
      preventing re-bleeding through long-acting terlipressin and octreotide in the future.

    <description>Terlipressin or octreotide will be administered to a patient once after the bottom line of his/her mean arterial pressure and heart rate, as well as HVPG, are determined. We observe the changes of MAP and HR after administration to find out the effects of terlipressin or octreotide on systemic hemodynamics.</description>

    <description>We intend to set incidence rate of complications associated with terlipressin or octreotide, to be specific, which include hypertension, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, transient arrhythmia and vertigo. Participants will be followed for up to 24h starting from the moment of administration.</description>
