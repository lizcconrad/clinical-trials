  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to show that the multidisciplinary review of drug
      prescriptions changes the adverse drug event (ADE) geriatric risk score (according to
      Trivalle and Ducimetière 2013) for patients living in the Nîmes University Hospital Residence
      for Dependent Elderly.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to assess and compare the following criteria
      before and after multidisciplinary review of drug prescriptions for patients in the Nîmes
      University Hospital Residence for Dependent Elderly:

      A. the number of patients with at least one potentially inappropriate drug prescribed

      B. the number of hospitalizations

      C. death rate

      D. the number of falls per patient and the rate of fallers

      E. qualitative criteria describing the drug review

      F. associated care costs

    <description>The before-after study is composed of a first observational phase followed by a proactive phase, and then finally by a second observational phase.
The first observational phase corresponds to retrospective data-collecting for the information necessary for calculating the baseline ADE geriatric risk score.
The proactive phase corresponds to a multidisciplinary review of drug prescriptions (especially long-term drugs) for all included patients in the residence.
During the second observational phase, the same data as in the first observational phase will be collected a second time.</description>
