  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robotic-assisted surgery is becoming more prominent within the specialty of Gynecologic
      surgery with little direct evidence that it is if not better than traditional laparoscopic
      surgery, at least equivalent. We designed a randomized-controlled trial to compare operative
      times, length of hospital stay, estimated blood loss, and post-operative complications
      associated with these two methods of minimally invasive hysterectomy.

      The proposed study will be a non-blinded randomized control trial. Patients will be
      randomized into each group Conventional Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (Group #1) and
      Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (Group #2) using a random number generator. Data
      collection will occur during the following points of patient interaction: pre-operative
      appointment, the surgical procedure, the patient's hospitalization, first post-operative
      appointment, and final post-operative appointment.

      The care for the patients enrolled in this study will not deviate from the standard care of
      patients who are currently undergoing laparoscopic and robot-assisted laparoscopic
      hysterectomy. The patients who present to the office for pre-operative history and physical
      examination for laparoscopic hysterectomy will be counseled about participation in this
      study. Basic data collection will commence at the pre-operative visiting, including: patient
      demographics, past medical history, past surgical history, physical exam findings, and
      imaging results. The pre-operative appointment will occur between one to thirty days prior to
      surgery. Intra-operative and immediate post-operative data will be collected by the surgical
      assistant (resident or fellow) and will include surgical procedure (conventional laparoscopic
      or robot-assisted), operative time, hematocrit, estimated blood loss, length of stay, and
      complications.
