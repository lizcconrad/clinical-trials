      This study assesses the Hand Held Nitrous Oxide Deliver Device which is intended to be used
      in nitrous oxide sedation systems by delivering a limited 16 grams of nitrous oxide over a
      total of 120 seconds of inhalation time.

      The device creates short term minimal sedation by delivering a maximum 72% USP grade nitrous
      oxide / 28 % ambient air combination which quickly drops to under 33% nitrous oxide / 67%
      ambient air in 60 seconds and stays steady until all the gas is expelled.
