  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) is an evidence based intervention for
      tic disorders. A recent scientific review of research priorities completed by the Tourette
      Syndrome Association recommended widespread dissemination of CBIT as an important next step
      in services delivery research. Given early evidence that occupational therapists can deliver
      CBIT effectively, a dissemination strategy using occupational therapists may improve
      accessibility to this treatment, at lower cost and with decreased stigma. Thus the goal of
      this study is to develop and test a training and dissemination model with occupational
      therapists (OTs) using an expert, multi-disciplinary team at Weill Cornell/New York
      Presbyterian Hospital (WC/NYPH) and University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). The
      investigators have adapted CBIT, the gold-standard behavioral intervention program for
      children with tic disorders (Woods et al, 2008a,b), for eventual use in OT programs across
      the country.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CBIT training materials designed by the study team have been used to train occupational
      therapists (OTs) at WC/NYPH and UAB to deliver CBIT, and data has been collected to measure
      training acceptability.

      OTs will be supervised in the practice of CBIT with youth in the New York City and Birmingham
      areas. Pre- and post-treatment assessment measures will be collected from 16 families (8 from
      each site) to evaluate intervention acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity. Patient and
      parent satisfaction of CBIT-OT will also be documented. The investigators will look within
      subjects to ascertain change in reported tic severity.

      This study is designed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of treatment,
      feasibility of research design, as well as demonstrate the ability to disseminate the study
      protocol to a new care discipline in methodologically rigorous fashion across multiple sites.

    <description>CBIT is a highly structured therapy that typically takes place on a weekly basis. The patient is taught to perform a specific behavior that makes the tic more difficult to do, as soon as the tic or urge appears. This &quot;competing response&quot; helps to reduce, and in some cases, even eliminate the tic. The functional intervention (FI), is based on the fact that certain situations or reactions to tics can make them worse than they might otherwise be. The goal of FI is to identify these situations and have the patient and family attempt to change them so the tics aren't made worse unnecessarily.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 7-17

          -  Presence of motor and/or vocal tics for at least 6 months

          -  Tics are of at least moderate clinical severity as evidenced by a Clinical Global
             Impressions Severity (CGI-S) score of 4 or higher (tic symptoms clearly noticeable to
             family and occasionally to families and associated with at least some minimal level of
             distress and/or interference.

          -  IQ estimate of 70 or higher

          -  Comorbid disorder (e.g., ADHD, OCD,ODD) will be allowed provided that the tic symptoms
             are of primary concern to parents and comorbid symptoms are not of sufficient severity
             to require immediate treatment other than that provided by the current study.

          -  Pre-existing stable medication, tic or otherwise, will also be allowed provided the
             family agrees to refrain from med changes over the course of the study if at all
             possible.
