  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shared Decision Making (SDM) is defined as a process where healthcare professionals and
      patients make decisions together, using the best available evidence. SDM, as a communication
      and decision method, can be used also with persons suffering from dementia. Yet, SDM with
      persons with dementia or even with their family caregivers is not widespread.

      The present research project aims to develop and evaluate an SDM framework in care planning
      to be implemented in long-term care facilities, in order to obtain a constantly developing
      care plan that focuses not only on the medical, physical, psychosocial and spiritual needs of
      the resident, but that considers and documents his preferences and the actions taken by
      caregivers to meet them.

      The current project is a controlled exploratory study. Case studies that involve a triad in
      each case, composed by the resident with moderate or severe dementia, his family caregiver
      and the professional usually taking care for the resident, will be used (n=16 professionals;
      n=40 residents; n=40 family caregivers). Professional caregivers of two nursing homes, one
      located in Italy and one in the Netherlands, will receive a specific training in SDM
      principles and will guide the SDM interview within the triad. Primary outcome will be the
      proportion of residents whose preferences and needs, together with the related actions to
      meet them, are known, documented and satisfied in their 'life-and-care plans'. Secondary
      outcomes are the residents' and family caregivers' quality of life; the family caregivers'
      sense of competence and the healthcare professionals' job satisfaction. Semi-structured
      interviews and focus group interviews will be performed to assess satisfaction with the
      intervention and barriers and facilitators to its implementation. Assessments are performed
      at baseline and six months after the intervention.

      We hypothesize that the use of the SDM process in care planning will increase the number of
      met needs and will improve the residents' and family caregivers quality of life, the family
      caregivers' sense of competence and the healthcare professionals' job satisfaction.

      The key element of this study is that it will contribute to our knowledge about the efficacy
      and feasibility of an SDM framework in care planning in long-term care facilities with
      persons with moderate to severe dementia.
