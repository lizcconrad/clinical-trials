    <description>ISGA assessed the severity of AD (except scalp) on a 5-point scale ranged from 0 (clear) to 4 (maximum severe), where higher scores indicate higher degree of AD. Grades for classification of severity: 0= clear (minor residual hypo/hyper pigmentation, no erythema or induration or papulation, no oozing or crusting), 1= almost clear (trace faint pink erythema, with barely perceptible induration or papulation and no oozing or crusting), 2= mild (faint pink erythema with mild induration or papulation and no oozing or crusting), 3= moderate (pink-red erythema with moderate induration or papulation with or without oozing or crusting) and 4= severe (deep or bright red erythema with severe induration or papulation and with oozing or crusting). Treatment success was defined as an ISGA score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) with at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>The DFI was a 10-item disease questionnaire that measures the impact of having a child with AD on family quality of life. It was completed by parent/legal guardian of the child (affected by AD), based on recall over the past week. Each question was scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (good) to 3 (worst), where higher scores indicated worst quality of life of family. The DFI total score was the sum of individual scores of the 10 questions and ranges from 0 (good) to 30 (worst), where higher DFI scores indicated worst quality of life of family.</description>

        <description>ISGA assessed the severity of AD (except scalp) on a 5-point scale ranged from 0 (clear) to 4 (maximum severe), where higher scores indicate higher degree of AD. Grades for classification of severity: 0= clear (minor residual hypo/hyper pigmentation, no erythema or induration or papulation, no oozing or crusting), 1= almost clear (trace faint pink erythema, with barely perceptible induration or papulation and no oozing or crusting), 2= mild (faint pink erythema with mild induration or papulation and no oozing or crusting), 3= moderate (pink-red erythema with moderate induration or papulation with or without oozing or crusting) and 4= severe (deep or bright red erythema with severe induration or papulation and with oozing or crusting). Treatment success was defined as an ISGA score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) with at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline.</description>

Clinical significance of change from baseline value was determined by investigator.</description>
          <population>Safety population included all randomized participants who had at least 1 confirmed dose of study drug, and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment.</population>

        <description>Time to improvement in pruritus was defined as the time interval between the administration of first dose of study drug till the first documentation of improvement in pruritus. Improvement in pruritus was defined as achieving none (0) or mild (1) score with at least a 1- grade improvement from baseline. Severity of pruritus was assessed on 4-point numeric scale ranges from 0 to 3, where 0= none (no itching), 1= mild (occasional, slight itching/scratching), 2= moderate (constant or intermittent itching/scratching which is not disturbing sleep) and 3= severe (bothersome itching/scratching which is disturbing sleep). Higher scores indicated more severe condition. It was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <description>The CDLQI was a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on children’s (aged 2-15 years) quality of life. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The CDLQI total score was the sum of individual scores of question 1-10 and ranges from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the children’s life; 2-6 = small effect on the children’s life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the children’s life; 13-18 = very large effect on the children’s life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the children’s life.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dermatitis Family Impact Questionnaire (DFI) Score at Day 29</title>
        <description>The DFI was a 10-item disease questionnaire that measures the impact of having a child with AD on family quality of life. It was completed by parent/legal guardian of the child (affected by AD), based on recall over the past week. Each question was scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (good) to 3 (worst), where higher scores indicated worst quality of life of family. The DFI total score was the sum of individual scores of the 10 questions and ranges from 0 (good) to 30 (worst), where higher DFI scores indicated worst quality of life of family.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Local Tolerability Symptoms at Day 29</title>
        <description>Local tolerability symptoms (burning/stinging) were assessed in participants at sites of study drug application. Symptoms were assessed on 4-point scale which ranges from 0 to 3, where 0 = none (no stinging/burning), 1 = mild (slight warm, tingling sensation); 2= moderate (definite warm; tingling/stinging sensation that is somewhat bothersome and severe); 3= severe (hot, tingling/stinging sensation that caused definite discomfort). Higher scores indicate high severity of symptoms. Percentage of participants with each level of local tolerability (none, mild, moderate, severe) symptoms were reported.</description>
