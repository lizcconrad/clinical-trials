      Postoperative handovers to the post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) in adult anaesthesia are
      described as incomplete and unstructured, although their relevance for the patient safety is
      well known. It must be assumed that for children, this handover is at least comparable
      important.

      With a self-developed checklist information transfer during postoperative handovers will be
      documented and subsequently compared with patient information in anaesthesia records.
