  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well photodynamic therapy with HPPH works in
      treating patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. Photodynamic therapy uses
      HPPH that becomes active when it is exposed to a certain kind of light. When the drug is
      active, cancer cells are killed. This may be effective against squamous cell carcinoma of the
      oral cavity.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the non-inferiority of photodynamic therapy (PDT) to standard of care surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine improvement in quality of life (QoL) using the University of Washington
      Quality of life questionnaire version 4.

      II. To assess the toxicity using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) National Cancer
      Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0).

      III. To explore progression-free survival in this patient population treated with HPPH
      mediated PDT.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Immune markers (T cells). II. To investigate the correlation of the tri-modal optical
      spectroscopy with tumor response to PDT.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatments arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo standard of care surgery on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive HPPH intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 0. Approximately 24 hours
      later, patients undergo photodynamic therapy on day 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 3-4 months for 1 year, 3-6
      months for 1 year, 4-8 months for 1 year, and once a year for 2 years.

    <measure>Objective tumor response assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Objective tumor response will be tabulated overall. Tumor response will be determined by comparing photographs of the treated site (with reference ruler) before and after PDT. Efficacy (e.g., tumor response) will be estimated using simple relative frequencies. The corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the estimated probabilities will be computed using the method proposed in Clopper and Pearson.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in quality of life evaluated by the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire version 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>In the analysis of QoL simple data analyses will initially take place including individual patient level profile plots and overall mean plots used to examining the mean structure. Formal statistical examination of longitudinal patterns will be done through the use of a mixed model. All tests will be two-sided and tested at a 0.05 nominal significance level. Standard diagnostic plots will be used to assess model fit and transformations of variables may be considered in order to meet statistical assumptions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of toxicity graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency of toxicities will be tabulated by grade across all cycles. The safety of the interventions will be assessed through the evaluation of grade 3 or higher toxicities deemed possibly related to treatment. Toxicity rates will be estimated using simple relative frequencies. The corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the estimated probabilities will be computed using the method proposed in Clopper and Pearson.</description>
