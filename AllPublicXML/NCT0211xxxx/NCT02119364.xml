  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disability in childhood (2-3 per 1000 live
      born), and is frequently accompanied by cognitive impairments and behavioural problems. The
      present study is a controlled clinical trial, a multicenter-study involving three health
      regions, as well as the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Its primary
      research goal will be to evaluate the effects of computer-based cognitive training in
      children with CP. In addition, this study will be the first to conduct a comprehensive
      neuropsychological examination to improve our understanding of cognitive impairments as well
      as cognitive resources in CP children in Norway to aid in intervention planning.

    <description>The child will use the computer program at home under parental supervision for 25 sessions, each lasting 30-45 minutes and the family has 6 weeks to complete the training. Each session consists of 8 different tasks presented by an animated robot. The tasks all require the child to hold information in working memory and to manipulate the information.</description>
