  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is an episodic disorder which can result in recurrent seizures often associated with
      hypertonia (muscle stiffening) and myoclonia (involuntary muscle jerking). Hypertonia can
      often occur before full expression of the seizure and so detection of hypertonia could act as
      an alarm to epilepsy patients and carers in order to prepare for a seizure event. Secondly, a
      recording device for seizure frequency and duration is a valuable clinical tool for
      collecting data for clinicians who manage the disorder in primary and tertiary care. The
      investigators have developed a portable prototype for hypertonia detection using a
      non-invasive, muscle activated, sensor that records seizure activity. The investigators now
      want to test this sensor system in patients identified by Consultant Clinician Custodians
      within the Wales Epilepsy Research Network (WERN). The Epidetect® prototype has been
      developed by VIKEL LTD™ in collaboration with WERN - a Welsh Assembly funded network.

    <description>Testing of Epidetect:
Adult Patients with difficult to control tonic-clonic (convulsant) epilepsy undergoing hospitalised video telemetry monitoring. Patients will be hospitalised as part of their normal investigation of the epilepsy and patients will be consented 1 week before hospitalisation. Epidetect will be used in conjunction with the normal EEG monotoring and video telemetry. The patient will be fitted with the topical sensors at the start of monotoring and then depending on the seizure activity will wear the sensors until enough data is gathered. Hospitalisation under these circumstances typically lasts no more than five days, so monitoring with the topical sensor will be no longer than this.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Patient Group 2</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Testing of Epidetect:
Paediatric patients (over 7 years) where parental consent will enable the epilepsy monitor to be used at home for 1 week and brought back in for analysis along with video evidence. This will not constitute any change in normal care or treatments, and the video evidence provided represents enhanced care through accurate seizure diary reporting. Suitable families and children will be selected and consented through scheduled clinics in paediatric neurology.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Patient group 3</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Testing of Epidetect:
Patients where the epilepsy is suspected to be psychogenic (pseudo-seizures) rather than organic epilepsy. We will test whether the epilepsy monitor will be able to differentiate between epilepsy and psychogenic seizures in the medical setting when patients are hospitlised for seizure investigation. Suitable patients will be selected and consented through scheduled clinics in paediatric neurology (under 16) and adult neurology.</description>
