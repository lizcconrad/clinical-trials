  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study to assess the safety and antitumor activity
      of MEDI4736 as Monotherapy or in Combination with Tremelimumab with or without Azacitidine in
      Subjects with myelodysplastic syndrome after treatment with hypomethylating agents
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of MEDI4736 (a monoclonal antibody that targets
      programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 [PD-L1]) to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, IM, and
      antitumor activity of MEDI4736 as monotherapy or in combination with Tremelimumab with or
      without Azacitidine in adult patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.
