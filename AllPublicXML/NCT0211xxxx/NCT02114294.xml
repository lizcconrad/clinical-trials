  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) regarding conservative treatment of
      Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS). Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) is a very common
      cause of knee pain in young active adults with a high rate of recurrent and/or chronic
      occurrence. PFPS is notoriously difficult to treat and has been referred to as &quot;one of the
      most vexatious clinical challenges in rehabilitative medicine&quot;. Its etiology is unclear but
      is commonly thought to be related to pathomechanics in the patellofemoral joint (PFJ). There
      are many factors that can influence PFJ mechanics. Among these, quadriceps strength and
      timing has been shown to be important. As such, treatment of PFPS has traditionally been
      based on correction of pathomechanics through influencing quadriceps strength and timing.
      However, a growing body of evidence is revealing the importance of strength and control of
      hip abduction and external rotation in PFPS. Hip strength in ab/adduction and rotation is
      thought to influence femoral positioning in the patellofemoral joint, thereby affecting PFJ
      mechanics. Several cohort and smaller RCT studies within the last 7 years have shown that
      additional exercises for hip strength and control give an improved effect in pain and
      function compared with quadriceps based training alone. A smaller RCT from 2012 compared
      isolated hip strengthening exercises to a control group and found surprisingly good results
      on pain in function in the hip strengthening group. The investigators plan a RCT in which
      isolated hip strengthening will be compared to traditional quadriceps training and a control
      group which will receive no structured training. Primary outcomes will be pain and function.
      This high-quality study will include 40-50 patients in each group, making it one of the
      largest of its kind on conservative treatment for PFPS. In contrast to the vast majority of
      studies of this type, this study will also include men, which will potentially help to fill a
      significant gap in the literature on this subject. The investigators study will therefore be
      an important contribution to elucidating the etiology of PFPS and improving treatment options
      for both men and women in the future. As well, the role of psychometric parameters will be
      examined and a standardized clinical test for hip abduction endurance will be developed.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Anterior Knee Pain Score (AKPS) is a measurement of subjective symptoms and functional limitations in patellofemoral pain, and has been validated for use in this patient population. The AKPS consists of a 13-point questionnaire with categories related to different levels of function in the knee. The categories within each question are weighted, and the responses are summed for an overall index where 100 represents perfect function. The mean clinically important difference (MCID) has been determined to be 10 points. This questionnaire will be translated to Norwegian and validated according to standard scientific procedures with approval from Kuala et al.</description>
