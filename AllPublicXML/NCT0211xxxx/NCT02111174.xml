  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if Scrambler Therapy with the Calmare MC5-A machine will
      relieve chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).

      Scrambler Therapy is a method of pain relief given with common electrocardiography (ECG) skin
      electrodes. The electrodes are placed on the body in pairs, and the Scrambler Therapy machine
      directs electrical signals across the field to simulate non-pain information.

      Based on other studies, we think that we relieve pain with the Scrambler therapy device, but
      it has not been tested in a setting such as this one. This means that some of the pain relief
      could be due to placebo effect, or the CIPN pain going away on its own. In this study we want
      to compare the Scrambler Therapy with the sham therapy (the therapy that does not use the
      electrical signals). We hope that this study will help us determine if the Scrambler device
      really helps patients with CIPN.

      Cancer patients with chronic, chemotherapy-related pain of 4 or more (on a 0-10 scale) for at
      least 3 months may be eligible to join this study.

    <description>The device is a cutaneous electrical stimulator that uses electrodes placed on the skin similar to an electrocardiogram (EKG) machine, feeling similar to a tingling or bee-sting like sensation during the therapy.
