  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a single-center, non-randomized, single-arm study at the Barrow
      Neurological Institute/St. Joseph's Hospital for recurrent glioma. The 5-ALA for recurrent
      glioma study will correlate presence of fluorescence in tumor tissue with pathological
      findings. This will be done using three cohorts in dose escalation. The investigators'
      hypothesis is that (for both low- and high-grade gliomas,) a lower dose of 5-ALA will result
      in less false positive fluorescence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to determine the dose of 5-ALA which promotes the lowest volume of residual
      disease after resection of recurrent high grade glioma without compromising the demarcation
      between recurrent high grade glioma and postoperative bed normal tissue.

      Sub-goals:

        1. To determine the impact of the dose of 5-ALA in improving volumetric extent of resection
           in patients with recurrent high grade gliomas

        2. To determine the impact of the dose of 5-ALA in improving overall survival of recurrent
           high grade glioma patients

        3. To determine the impact of the dose of 5-ALA in improving progression-free survival of
           recurrent high grade glioma patients

        4. To determine the impact of the dose of 5-ALA on the neurological morbidity of recurrent
           high grade glioma patients.

      Patients with presumed recurrent glioma will be entered into the trial. Those with recurrent
      disease will receive study drug (5-ALA) in one of three dose-escalated cohorts (5 mg/kg; 10
      mg/kg; 20 mg/kg). Intraoperatively, patients will undergo resection with combined
      fluorescence microscopy and confocal microscopy. Resected tissue specimens corresponding to
      the presence of fluorescence will be sent to pathology for examination. Postoperatively,
      patients will have an MRI with and without contrast within 48 hours of surgery. Subsequent
      analysis of each patient will include assessment of the primary endpoint (volume of residual
      disease) by volumetrically quantifying the tumor before and after surgery using T1-weighted
      contrast-enhancement. Similarly, volumetric extent of resection will also be measured.

    <description>A postoperative MRI with contrast will be acquired within 48 hours of surgery. Volumetric analysis of contract T1-weighted images (for low grade gliomas) will be compared to the preoperative sequences to calculate the volume of residual disease. Slice-by-slice assessment of pre- and postoperative tumor volume will be quantified by sequentially measuring the area of tumor on each slice and then integrating the combined measurements. This methodology has been previously reported (Sanai et al., Journal of Neurosurgery, 2010; Sanai et al, The New England Journal of Medicine, 2008)</description>
