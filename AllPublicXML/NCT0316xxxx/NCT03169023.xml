  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal will pilot a weight management program for patients with endometrial cancer,
      the cancer most associated with obesity. If successful, this pilot could be expanded to
      include obese women with other gynecologic cancers (ovarian and cervical) and could be
      expanded and adapted for use not only upon completion of treatment, but during chemotherapy
      or radiation. Furthermore, other obstetricians and gynecologists could use this strategy for
      obese women as a practical cancer prevention strategy for obesity-associated cancers.
