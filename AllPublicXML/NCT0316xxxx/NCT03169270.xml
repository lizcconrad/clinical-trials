  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current protocol is developed in the context of a large Research and Innovation (R&amp;I)
      program aiming the promotion of daily life physical activity in chronic patients registered
      at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02976064) and approved by the ethical committee of the Hospital
      Clinic de Barcelona (HCB/2016/0883). The project is partly supported by the Smart Innovation
      Strategies promoted by the EU Commission (COMRDI15-1-0016). Specifically, the protocol uses
      retrospective information collected between 2005-2008 as part of the EU project Biobridge
      (LSHG-CT-2006-037939).

      The aims of the current analysis of the retrospective information are 1) to assess
      training-induced changes in muscle oxygen saturation (StO2) assessed by near-infrared
      spectroscopy (NIRS) during constant-work rate cycling exercise (CWRE) as a useful marker of
      the effects of training at limb muscle level in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD), and 2) to further explore underlying mechanisms of skeletal muscle
      dysfunction as a characteristic systemic effect of COPD, potentially modifiable with
      preventive interventions as endurance muscle training.

      Methods: Incremental exercise (VO2 peak) and CWRE at 70% baseline peak work rate, before and
      after 8-week of endurance exercise training, were done in healthy sedentary subjects and COPD
      patients. NIRS was used to assess StO2 in the left &quot;vastus internus&quot; during the CWRE (before
      an after training program) (objective 1); and blood samples and muscle biopsies of the
      quadriceps were obtained at rest (before an after training program) (objective 2).

    <description>COPD were required to be clinically stable at the time of study without episodes of exacerbation or oral steroid treatment in the previous four months. All COPD patients were on bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids. No patient presented severe co-morbidities. The intervention consists in an 8-week programe of exercise training.</description>

    <description>All subjects performed a supervised 8-week, 5 days-week of endurance exercise training program in cycle-ergometer Each session included 5 minutes of warm-up and cool-down pedalling at 30% of peak work-rate (WR) and 50 minutes of interval training. The interval training combined 2 minutes of high-intensity pedalling and 3 minutes of active rest. Work-rate progress during the 8-week period was tailored on individual basis, according to subjects' symptoms, to maximize the training effect. During the first 2 weeks, high intensity pedalling interval was at least 70% of peak WR and active rest interval was at least 40% of peak WR. Thereafter, work-rate was increased by approximately 5% every week up to a maximum of 100% of peak WR during the last 2 weeks for the high intensity period and 50% of peak WR for the active rest. The cycling rate during the sessions was maintained at 60-70 rpm.</description>
