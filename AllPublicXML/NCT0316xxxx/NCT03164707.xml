  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death worldwide. Diabetes mellitus is
      associated with increased prevalence of coronary artery disease

      Increased plasma glucose is a common feature in the acute phase of myocardial infarction,
      even in patients without diabetes. Patients with stress hyperglycemia, but without previous
      diagnosis of diabetes, were at increased risk of congestive heart failure, arrhythmia and
      cardiogenic shock as well as increased both in-hospital and long-term mortality . Previous
      studies have demonstrated larger infarct size and poorer prognosis inpatients with
      hyperglycemia upon hospital admission compared with patients without hyperglycemia

      It has been reported that stress hyperglycemia impairs microvascular circulation and may lead
      to no-reflow phenomenon. No reflow phenomenon was significantly more frequent among patients
      with hyperglycemia and increased progressively with increasing admission blood glucose in
      patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction . Furthermore, patients with high admission glucose
      are more likely to develop restenosis and require repeat revascularization procedures
      compared with those with normal admission glucose and are also at increased risk for repeated
      Myocardial Infarction, stent thrombosis and death.
