  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Total Therapy treatment regimens developed at the Myeloma Institute have demonstrated
      great improvement in treatment outcomes for multiple myeloma patients. However, some patients
      still relapse early during maintenance treatment meaning that better options are still
      needed. This study will evaluate a treatment regimen that alternates two different 3-drug
      regimens every eight weeks for patients that have previously completed autologous stem cell
      transplant. The two regimens are bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRD) which will
      be alternated with Elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (Elo RD). Effectiveness will
      be measured by the depth of response (i.e., whether or not minimal residual disease (MRD)
      negative status is achieved). The rate of MRD negativity from this study will be compared to
      historical control data from the Total Therapy 4 trial which used continuous VRD maintenance
      therapy after stem cell transplant(s).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age and not older than 75 years of age at the
             time of enrollment.

          -  Patients must have completed a stem cell transplant regimen for newly diagnosed
             multiple myeloma (MM) consisting of (at least) induction chemotherapy and single or
             tandem autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) within eight months of study enrollment.
             The completed regimen may have included post-transplant consolidation therapy, but
             post-transplant consolidation is not required.

          -  Patients must have achieved at least a partial response (PR) (according to
             International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria) in response to the completed
             transplant regimen.

          -  ECOG ≤ 2 (ECOG of 3 allowed if solely due to symptoms of MM-related bone disease).

          -  Patients must have absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/mm3 and a platelet count of
             ≥ 75,000/μL.

          -  Patients must have a baseline serum creatinine level of &lt; 3 mg/dL and baseline alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 3x Upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Toxicities related to prior therapies must be resolved to ≤ Grade 2 according to NCI
             Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.

          -  Female patients must be:

               -  Postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR

               -  Surgically sterile, OR

               -  If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 simultaneous effective
                  methods of contraception, from the time of signing the informed consent form
                  through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, OR

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods
                  of contraception.)

          -  Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (ie, post-vasectomy) must agree to one of
             the following:

               -  Practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period
                  and through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, OR

               -  Practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual
                  lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation,

             program for more information.

          -  History of poorly controlled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, active or uncontrolled
             hepatitis, or other serious medical or psychiatric illness that could potentially
             interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol, or that in the
             opinion of the investigator would constitute a hazard for participating in this study.

             physician including cardiac amyloidosis.
