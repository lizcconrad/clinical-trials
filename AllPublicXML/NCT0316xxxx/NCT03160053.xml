    <description>Keloids that were randomized to the treatment group, were exposed to Narrowband-UVB (NB-UVB). Targeted UVB will be delivered to the keloid for up to 16 weeks using the Lumera UVB light phototherapy device (Daavlin, Bryan OH, USA).The affected skin will be irradiated using a hand-held fiber optic cable with an adjustable aperture.</description>

    <intervention_name>NB-UVB</intervention_name>
    <description>NB-UVB has an emission spectrum in the ultraviolet B range of 290-320 nm. The system consists of a light source, a spot handpiece, and a light guide that connects the handpiece to the light source. The light source has a Start/Stop switch for light beam activation. Activation can also be controlled remotely with a foot switch. The light source has a timer and an output level control to adjust the intensity of the ultraviolet light. This will be calibrated using a manufacturer-provided UV meter prior to every treatment to ensure accurate doses of ultraviolet light.</description>
