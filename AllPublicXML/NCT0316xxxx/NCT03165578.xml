      The objective of the present study is to identify brain networks in patients that contribute
      to successfully learning self-regulation with real-time fMRI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurofeedback has been established as a promising non-pharmacological therapeutic approach.
      However, patients differ in their ability to learn control over their own brain activity with
      neurofeedback. It is thus crucial to understand the brain networks that mediate learned
      self-regulation with real-time fMRI. The objective of the present study is thus to identify
      brain networks in patients that contribute to successfully learning self-regulation with
      real-time fMRI. To achieve this goal, patients suffering from depression, post-traumatic
      stress disorder, and nicotine addiction will be trained to improve their self-regulation
      skills using established real-time fMRI neurofeedback protocols.

    <measure>maintenance of learned self-regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>An assessment of learned self-regulation (i.e. increase of the feedback signal in up-regulation compared to baseline blocks) in follow-up scanning sessions that will take place 6 months and 1 year after neurofeedback training. This will be a measure of how well learned self-regulation can be maintained.</description>
