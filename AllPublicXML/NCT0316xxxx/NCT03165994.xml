  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies the side effects of CD40 agonistic monoclonal antibody
      APX005M (APX005M), chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, and to see how well they work when
      given before surgery in treating patients with esophageal cancer or gastroesophageal cancer
      that can be removed by surgery. APX005M is intended to stimulate the body's own immune system
      so that the immune cells can more effectively invade and destroy the tumor, adding to the
      benefits of the chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
      Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving
      APX005M, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and
      reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the safety and feasibility of combining APX005M with standard-of-care
      chemoradiation (external beam radiation in daily fractions, with concurrent weekly low-dose
      carboplatin/paclitaxel) in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with resectable esophageal
      and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of this novel combination, as measured by the pathologic complete
      response (pCR) rate.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive APX005M intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes during weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10,
      radiation therapy once daily (QD) for 5 days per week during weeks 3-8, and paclitaxel IV
      over 60 minutes and carboplatin IV over 60 minutes once weekly (days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29)
      during weeks 3-8 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      then undergo surgery 1-7 weeks after last dose of APX005M.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months.
