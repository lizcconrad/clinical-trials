  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Defining the origin of a seizure remains a difficult diagnosis. The presence of witness is
      not systematic, the clinical examination can be little contributory, and the delay
      recommended by the FSN is often surpassed for the realization of Creatine kinase (4h). In the
      event of a suspected seizure, an initial blood test with Creatine kinase and Lactates is
      often done on admission of the patient in other words before the 4hours delay.

      It seems interesting to harmonize the practices, to limit the patient wait in the emergencies
      for a deferred dosage of CK at 4 hours from the seizure and to identify an early biological
      marker.

      Objectives:

      To evaluate the value of blood CK and Lactate dosage in emergency procedures in the diagnosis
      of generalized seizures.

      We propose to carry out a prospective, observational, monocentric study at the CHU of
      Clermont-Ferrand. This is a descriptive analysis of the kinetics of the Creatine kinase and
      Lactates rates collected at the admission of a patient consulting for strong suspicion of
      convulsive seizure, and at 4 hours from the generalized seizure.

      A patient consulting the emergency department for suspected seizure will have an usual blood
      test at the admission in this context with notably ionogram, fasting glucose, venous
      gasometry. As the CHU purchased a venous and arterial gasometry reader for the emergency
      department, blood ionogram, Hb, lactates, HCO3-, pH are collected without delay.

      The Creatine kinase dosage will be collected in the usual way as a &quot;tube bottom&quot;.

      As recommended by the French Society of Neurology, a new sample will be collected at 4 hours
      of seizure for a dosage of Creatine kinase. The determination of the lactates will be based
      on a &quot;tube bottom&quot;.

      It is the emergency practitioner who will decide whether or not to include the patient in the
      descriptive study, assisted by a standardized survey, enumerating the high probability of
      generalized seizure orientation characteristics (patient history, treatments including
      antiepileptics, anamnesis, witnesses presence, evocative clinic) The study only recruited
      cases of strong suspicion of generalized seizure, beginning less than 4 hours to compare the
      kinetics of Creatine kinase and Lactates at admission and 4 hours of the generalized seizure.
