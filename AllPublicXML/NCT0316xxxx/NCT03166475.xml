  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized controlled trial of 30 patients from the Faculty of Dentistry of the
      UFJF was conducted. It was included patients who presented indication of extraction of
      premolars, canines or incisors. All the thirty patients underwent dental extraction and were
      randomly divided into three groups according to the study methodology. Plaster casts and
      Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) exams were performed for comparative analysis between
      sample groups and between study times ( imediate postoperative and four months later).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty consecutive patients who presented at the Dentistry College of Federal University of
      Juiz de Fora (Brazil) were selected, requiring a single-tooth extraction of premolar, canines
      or incisors in maxilla. All of the patients included at this study signed a free and informed
      consent form, agreeing to participate voluntarily in this research. The study was approved by
      the Research Ethical Committee of the University of Juiz de Fora under the form 1.731.395.

      The patients were randomly allocated in three groups according the following treatments:

        -  Group 1: Closure of the socket by primary intention through a palatal pedicle
           subepithelial connective tissue flap by the technique of Khoury &amp; Happe (2000) (Figure
           1);

        -  Group 2: Filling the socket with a synthetic bone substitute of biphasic calcium
           phosphate (Bone Ceramic®, Straumann) and covering it with a palatal pedicle flap by the
           technique of Khoury &amp; Happe (2000) (Figure 2);

        -  Group 3: Sealing of the socket with a provisional ovoid pontic of acrylic resin (Figure
           3).

      As response factors were performed evaluations of study casts and tomographic analysis for
      dimensional stability evaluation of the sockets at immediate postoperative and after four
      months of the surgical procedures.

    <arm_group_label>Palatal pedicle flap (Group 1)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>On patients of this group were performed the palatal pedicle subepithelial connective tissue flap after the extraction, following the technique described by Khoury &amp; Happe (2000), which consists of total detachment of the palatal flap followed by division of the flap to release the connective tissue, maintain a pedicle and sliding it to cover the fresh socket by primary intention. The sutures were removed seven to ten days of postoperative.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>On patients of this group were performed the palatal pedicle flap like the group 1, however, the sockets were previously filled with a graft of synthetic bone substitute (Bone Ceramic®, Straumann, Switzerland) and then recovered with the connective flap and sutured by primary intention. The sutures were removed seven to ten days of postoperative.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>On patients of this group, after the extraction of the tooth, were made a provisional ovoid pontic with acrylic resin or with the crown of the removed tooth itself, cut and sealed with composite resin. The pontics were placed to seal the entire gingival margin of the socket and penetrating 2 to 3 mm into it, stabilized laterally by the adjacent teeth with orthodontic and composite resin or acrylic resin. No sutures were made.</description>
