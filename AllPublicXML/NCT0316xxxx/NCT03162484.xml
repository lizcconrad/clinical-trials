  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most individuals who have survived an acquired brain injury (ABI) present consequences
      affecting the sensorimotor, cognitive, affective or behavioural components. The conditions
      can vary from mild to extreme. The consequences of an ABI may have a considerable impact on
      their functioning, and secondary conditions like depression or sedentary behaviours, so they
      suffer changes in their Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL).

      The purpose of this project is to determine the effect of a physical activity group program
      on HRQoL. As well as to identify factors that facilitate or act as a barrier to practice
      physical activity.

      This study is a quasi experimental pre-post test with nonequivalent group design. There were
      two groups: 30 subjects with chronic ABI took part in a physical activity group program
      designed by a Sport Club in Madrid, Spain; and 30 subjects with chronic ABI which did not
      practice physical activity.

    <description>The intervention consisted in doing physical activities two to four times per week, each session last 60 minutes. The program includes different activities: swimming, paddle tennis, football and aerobic exercises into the swimming-pool.
Each session starts with a warm up. The main part of the session is divided into two sections. The first section includes different exercises to improve balance, mobility and coordination. The second section is comprised of communicative and cooperative games. The session finishes with a cool-down.</description>
