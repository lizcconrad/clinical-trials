      This study proposes to recruit patients with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) seeking treatment into
      our program of outpatient detoxification and naltrexone induction followed by a
      relapse-prevention treatment with Extended release-naltrexone (XR-NTX) . Eligible
      participants will be randomly assigned to adjunctive treatment with lorcaserin (N = 40), or
      placebo (N = 20) with weekly therapy.

      The study proposes to recruit patients with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) seeking treatment into
      our program of outpatient detoxification and naltrexone induction followed by a
      relapse-prevention treatment with Extended release-naltrexone (XR-NTX) . Eligible
      participants will be randomly assigned to adjunctive treatment with lorcaserin (N = 40), or
      placebo (N = 20) with weekly therapy. Lorcaserin or placebo 10 mg bid will be started on Day
      1 of the study to address acute withdrawal, then maintained over the next 5 weeks, and
      stopped after the second XR-naltrexone is administered. Patients will be seen twice weekly
      for monitoring and offered two injections of naltrexone; at the end of oral naltrexone
      induction (end of week 1) and four weeks later (week 5). The primary outcome measure will be
      the proportion of patients successfully retained to receive the second naltrexone injection.
      Patients retained to this point tend to stay on treatment and do well long term, hence this
      is the most clinically relevant outcome to evaluate treatment initiation.
