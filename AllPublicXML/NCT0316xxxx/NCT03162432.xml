    <textblock>
      The goal of this study will be to assess the safety and efficacy of high-dose interval
      Vitamin D3 therapy in children and young adults with Inflammatory Bowel Disease being treated
      with serial Remicade infusions.

      Study subjects will receiving 50,000 units of Vitamin D3 if they receive Remicade infusions
      every 4-6 weeks. Study subjects will receiving 100,000 units of Vitamin D3 if they receive
      Remicade infusions every 6-8 weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ability of intervention to maintain 25-OH Vitamin D levels in the 35-80 range</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will continue to receive oral Vitamin D therapy for one year. We will be assessing the efficacy of oral Vitamin D therapy, in this dosing schema, to result in 25-OH Vitamin D levels during and at the conclusion of this one-year study.</time_frame>
    <description>The study will involve measuring serum 25-OH Vitamin D levels after the initiation of open-label therapy. This will be done approximately one month after starting therapy, at the end of the study interval (one year), and as clinically indicated over the course of the year. Serum 25-OH Vitamin D levels are the most robust metric for assessing Vitamin D sufficiency.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess risk of kidney stones development in patients treated with high-dose interval Vitamin D</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will be monitored for urinary symptoms and complete serial urine assessments as outlined in the protocol. The impact of oral Vitamin D administration on calcium excretion will be evaluated during and at the conclusion of this one-year study.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will provide a spot urine collection the day prior to their Remicade infusion. A second spot urine collection will be collected on the day of the infusion. Urinary calcium excretion will be assessed. Changes in urinary calcium excretion will be used to identify subjects at risk for the development of renal stones.</description>
