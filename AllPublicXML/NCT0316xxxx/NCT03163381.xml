      The treatment of bone and soft tissue sarcomas are usually surgery and chemotherapy,advanced
      cases cannot be removed through surgical method for multiple metastasis,advanced cases Most
      advanced cases with chemotherapy is given priority to, but the effect is not ideal.Apatinib
      main through inhibit VEGFR to give play to Anti-angiogenesis effect to treatment of malignant
      tumor.
