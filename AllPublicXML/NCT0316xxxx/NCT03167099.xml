  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine if immediate weight bearing on a distal femur fracture
      fixed with a primary locking plate, either a distal condylar locking plate or a LISS (less
      invasive stabilization system), is safe and promotes more rapid fracture healing than partial
      weight bearing, which is standard of care.

      This study is designed to examine if immediate weight bearing on a distal femur fracture
      fixed with a primary locking plate, either a distal condylar locking plate or a LISS (less
      invasive stabilization system), is safe and promotes more rapid fracture healing than partial
      weight bearing, which is standard of care. Historically and currently patients are kept
      partial weight bearing after fixation of these fractures for 6-12 weeks until callous
      formation is observed on radiographs. The hypothesis is that participants allowed to bear
      weight immediately will heal at least as quickly as those who have weight bearing status
      protected with the added benefits from early mobilization. Fracture healing will be monitored
      closely by follow up appointments and complications will be documented.
