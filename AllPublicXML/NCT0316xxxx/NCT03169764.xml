  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of metronomic combination
      therapy in subjects with HNSCC who have progressed on or after previous chemotherapy and
      anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.

      Treatment will be administered in two phases, an induction and a maintenance phase. Subjects
      will continue induction treatment for up to 1 year or until they experience progressive
      disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity (not correctable with dose reduction), withdraw
      consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to
      continue treatment. Those who have a complete response (CR) in the induction phase will enter
      the maintenance phase of the study. Subjects may remain in the maintenance phase of the study
      for up to 1 year. Treatment will continue in the maintenance phase until the subject
      experiences PD or unacceptable toxicity (not correctable with dose reduction), withdraws
      consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to
      continue treatment.

             treatment-related complications.

          4. Systemic autoimmune disease (eg, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Addison's
             disease, and autoimmune disease associated with lymphoma).

          5. History of organ transplant requiring immunosuppression.
