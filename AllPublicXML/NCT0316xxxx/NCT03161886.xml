      This prospective, interventional study aims this to determine the efficacy and safety of a
      PCE-based treat-to-target strategy in order to achieve Mucosal Healing (MH) and deep
      remission (DR) of pediatric Crohn's Disease (CD) over 52 weeks.

      This first prospective study on mucosal healing (MH) and deep remission (DR) in pediatric
      Crohn's Disease aims to evaluate:

        -  The ability of Pan-enteric capsule endoscopy (PCE) to assess MH and DR rates at three
           time points and to guide a treat-to-target strategy was the primary outcome sought.

        -  The efficacy of a &quot;treat-to-target&quot; strategy to MH and DR rates over 24 and 52 weeks was
           evaluated as a secondary outcome;

        -  Comparison between PCE, biomarkers, Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) and Small
           Intestine contrast ultrasonography (SICUS) in evaluating intestinal inflammation.

    <description>Evidence of active disease by PCE prompted a change in therapy at the discretion of the treating clinician and according to current available pediatric guidelines. The definition of medical treatment adjustment after evidence of inflammation was: the introduction of steroids or enteral nutrition, the introduction or optimization of immunosuppressives; the introduction, optimization of biologics; or the introduction of both immunosuppressive agents and biologics. In case of a negative PCE and presence of symptoms, the magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) could help in guiding therapeutic decisions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  diagnosis of Crohn's Disease made at least 3 months before the enrolment;

          -  subject was referred for endoscopic and imaging follow-up in Crohn's Disease

          -  signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has dysphagia

          -  Subject has renal insufficiency

          -  Subject is known structuring Crohn's Disease identified by magnetic resonance
             enterography (MRE) or small intestine contrast ultrasonography (SICUS).

          -  Subject has had prior abdominal surgery of the gastrointestinal tract other than
             uncomplicated procedures that would be unlikely to lead to bowel obstruction based on
             the magnetic resonance enterography findings and clinical judgment of the
             investigator.
