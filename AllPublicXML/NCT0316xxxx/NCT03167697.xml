  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study centres around a new one-a-day phenylalanine-free protein substitute for
      phenylketonuria patients. Fifty eligible adults (≥ 16 years) with proven phenylketonuria or
      hyperphenylalaninemia will be recruited and randomly allocated to one of two intervention
      arms (n = 25 per arm). Following a 3-day baseline period, and in addition to routine
      nutritional management, patients will receive either one sachet of the new protein substitute
      daily (intervention) or continue their usual dietary and/or protein substitute regimen
      (maximum of 1 protein substitute per day (equal to 20g protein equivalent) control) for 28
      days.

      This study centres around a new one-a-day phenylalanine-free protein substitute for
      phenylketonuria patients. In particular, this randomised controlled trial aims to evaluate
      the efficacy (changes relating to nutritional status and metabolic control) of this new
      protein substitute, while also capturing data pertaining to tolerance, compliance, safety and
      acceptability. Designed for poorly compliant adult patients with proven phenylketonuria or
      hyperphenylalaninemia, this new protein substitute is composed of an adapted mixture of other
      essential and non-essential amino acids, carbohydrates, vitamins and selected minerals and
      trace elements and enriched with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Fifty eligible adults (≥ 16
      years) will be recruited and randomly allocated to one of two intervention arms (n = 25 per
      arm). Following a 3-day baseline period, and in addition to routine nutritional management,
      patients will receive either one sachet of the new protein substitute daily (intervention) or
      continue their usual dietary and/or protein substitute regimen (maximum of 1 protein
      substitute per day (equal to 20g protein equivalent) control) for 28 days.

    <description>Compliance with the recommended intake of the patients previously prescribed protein substitute (during baseline in both groups, and during the study period in the control group) and with the study product during the intervention period will be assessed daily throughout the study. Patients will be asked to record how much of the protein substitute is taken compared to that recommended by their Health Care Professional. The daily amount prescribed by the Health Care Professional managing the patients care will be recorded at the start of the study and any changes to this prescription during the study will be noted. During the intervention period, protein substitute consumption patterns (e.g. timing and amount consumed) will be recorded daily and assessed b y a standardised questionnaire.</description>
