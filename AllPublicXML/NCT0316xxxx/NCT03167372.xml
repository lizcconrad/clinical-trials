    <textblock>
      This study compares the effect of two N-of-1 trials on study compliance with an N-of-1
      protocol and on satisfaction with participation in an N-of-1 trial. Using within-person
      analyses, the study also compares the effect of different types of light therapy on mood,
      fatigue, sleep, physical activity, and side effects within a mild to moderately depressed
      cancer survivor population. Twenty participants will be randomized to the bright white versus
      dim red light therapyN-of-1 trial, while the remaining 10 participants will be randomized to
      a dim white versus dim red light comparator N-of-1 trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue or low energy levels, trouble sleeping and feeling down are symptoms that represent
      some of the most important concerns in cancer survivors, across a range of cancer types.
      Despite the impact of these symptoms on quality of life, previous studies have shown that few
      cancer survivors are receiving adequate treatment for these symptoms.

      Light therapy involves the use of a light box (a box that lights up) in close proximity for a
      specified amount of time each day. There can be big differences in the way light therapy
      affects individual patients. Patients can learn whether this therapy is helpful to them by
      engaging in an N-of-1 trial. An N-of-1 trial is an experiment conducted with one individual
      (N refers to &quot;number of individuals in the trial&quot;). In an N-of-1 trial of light therapy, a
      patient can try light therapy to learn whether it is beneficial to them. All participants
      will receive two light boxes. The boxes will be labeled &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B.&quot; Each light box will emit
      a different intensity of light. An app will send reminder notifications to participants'
      smartphones each morning to remind them which light box they should be using, depending on
      the week. They will be asked to use Box A or Box B each morning for 30 minutes per day for 12
      weeks

      The purpose of this study is to empower cancer survivors with symptoms of fatigue, trouble
      sleeping or who are feeling down to learn whether light therapy is helpful for them.

    <intervention_model_description>This study aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a randomized trial comparing two N-of-1 trials of light therapy in cancer survivors with depressive symptoms. In the first N-of-1 trial, participants will compare bright white light with dim red light therapy. In the second N-of-1 trial, participants will compare dim white light with dim red light. Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either the N-of-1 bright white light vs dim red light experimental arm (N=20) or to a dim white vs dim red light therapy active comparator (N=10).</intervention_model_description>
