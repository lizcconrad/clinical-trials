  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a well-established modality for the treatment of advanced
      knee osteoarthritis with high satisfaction rate. However, the traditional cutting jigs for
      distal femur cutting inevitably violates the medullary canal of femoral bone. The process of
      intramedullary reaming for the insertion of distal femur cutting jigs stimulated the
      dissipation of marrow emboli that reported lead to increased risk of myocardial infarction or
      cardiac stress perioperatively. There are emerging refinements aiming to reduce the insult to
      the medullary canal of the distal femur as well as to improve the prosthetic alignment, such
      as navigation assisted TKA or robotic surgery.

      In addition to better prosthetic alignment, computer-assisted navigation TKAs also mitigate
      perioperative blood loss and systemic emboli. The publication previously published by the
      investigators showed that navigation TKAs can lead to lesser extent of elevation of
      endothelial injury markers than the traditional TKAs. However, the detrimental effects of
      intramedullary reaming seem to be multi-dimensional and the whole picture has not been
      elucidated clearly at present.

      Previous studies have shown that operative trauma can trigger marked immune responses.
      Operative procedures can simultaneously stimulate the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory
      response, with 80% of the leucocyte transcriptome being affected. Most studies of hip or knee
      surgery found that operation-triggered immune reactions are associated with postoperative
      recovery, infection, and even mortality.

      The navigation TKAs avoid the process of intra-medullary reaming, which is the mandatory part
      of conventional TKA for the distal femur cutting. The investigators hypothesize that the
      reaming process may exert substantial inflammatory response, which can be manifested by
      higher level of inflammatory markers in the serum and hemovac drainage samples obtained from
      the participants undergoing conventional TKAs.

        Patients necessitating TKA surgery due to advanced degenerative osteoarthritis of the knee
        visited the outpatient department initially and were then scheduled for admission for TKA
        surgery. The patients were self-separated into two groups when they visited the outpatient
        department. The patients visiting professor CJ Wang would undergo conventional TKA, and
        those visiting Dr. JY Ko would undergo navigation TKA. Both senior authors had performed
        more than 1,000 TKAs using the conventional and navigation method respectively before
        recruiting the patients of our study.
