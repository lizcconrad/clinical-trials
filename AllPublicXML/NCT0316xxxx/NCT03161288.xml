        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must fulfil all of the following criteria for entry into the study.

          1. Volunteer to participate in the clinical trial and provide signed informed consent.

          2. Male, aged 18 to 45 years.

          3. Subjects with a female spouse/partner of childbearing potential must agree to use
             effective birth control starting at screening and continuing throughout the clinical
             study period and for a period of up to 6 months after study completion.

          4. Cohorts 4 to 8: previous immunisation with tetanus toxoid (TT) but not within 6 months
             prior to the screening visit as reported by the volunteer.

          5. Cohorts 4 to 8: anti-TT immunoglobulin G (IgG) response &gt; 0.1 IU/mL and ≤ 50 IU/mL at
             screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects fulfilling any of the following exclusion criteria are not eligible for entry into
        the study.

          1. Experiencing a clinically significant, chronic or acute infection requiring treatment
             at screening or prior to first IMP administration.

          2. A body weight of ≤ 60.0 kg or ≥ 120.0 kg.

          4. History of disease of the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, kidney,
             liver, digestive system, respiratory system or metabolic/endocrine system or suffered
             from other disease that in the opinion of the principal investigator (or medically
             qualified designee) may make participation unsafe for the subject or interfere with
             trial evaluations or otherwise considered clinically significant.

          5. History of immunological abnormality (e.g., immune suppression, severe allergy or
             anaphylaxis) that in the opinion of the principal investigator (or medically qualified
             designee) may make participation unsafe for the subject or interfere with trial
             evaluations or otherwise considered clinically significant.

          6. History of malignancy, or known current malignancy.

         12. Taking or likely to take over-the-counter medication, including herbal medicines, that
             in the opinion of the principal investigator (or medically qualified designee) may

         13. Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus
             positive.

         14. History of or current drug or substance abuse considered significant by the principal
             investigator (or medically qualified designee) including a positive urine drug screen.

         15. Current smoker and/or regular user of other nicotine-containing products (e.g.,

         16. Average consumption of more than 14 units of alcohol/week.

         17. Clinically significant abnormal screening values in clinical (electrocardiograms
             (ECGs), vital signs, physical examination) and laboratory tests in the opinion of the
             principal investigator (or medically qualified designee).

         18. Cannot communicate adequately or cannot commit to full participation in all trial
             procedures.

               1. Confirmed previous exposure to immunocyanins, such as keyhole limpet haemocyanin
                  (KLH);

               2. Known allergy to thiomersal or other components of Tetanus vaccine or
                  Immucothel®;
