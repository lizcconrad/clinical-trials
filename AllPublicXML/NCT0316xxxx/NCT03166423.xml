    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the use of a formulation of
      snail slime and natural extracts, for the curative treatment of ulcer wonds in diabetic foot.

      The secondary objetives:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of the use of a formulation of snail slime Helix aspersa Müller
           and natural extracts (MU001) for the curative treatment of ulcer wonds in diabetic foot
           with respect to the standard of care, by means the application of patchs that containing
           the formulation in a treatment period of until 60 days.

        2. To determine the safety of the use of a formulation of snail slime Helix aspersa Müller
           and natural extracts (MU001) in diabetic individuals in a treatment period of until 60
           days.

    <textblock>
      Clinical Study of phase I-II, controlled, simple blind (in relation with biostatistical
      analysis), randomized, of formulation that containing snail slime Helix aspersa Müller
      (Cryptophalus aspersus), natural calendula extract, propolis and excipients (MU001).

      The formulation in study MU001 wil be added to the standard of care for healing in diabetic
      foot indicated. The period of recruitment estimated will be 4 month and the follow-up of the
      patients will be of until 60 days.
