  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present single-center prospective exploratory study, conducted at Heidelberg University
      Hospital, assesses the feasibility of introducing a concept for additional patient care based
      on a mobile application for patients undergoing radiotherapy. Patients presenting themselves
      for the irradiation of thoracic or pelvic tumors will be surveyed regarding general
      performance, treatment-related Quality of Life (QoL) and symptoms and their need to
      personally consult a physician on a treatment-daily basis by means of a mobile application.
      The primary endpoint of feasibility will be reached when 80% of the patients have
      successfully answered 80% of their respective questions scheduled for each treatment day.
      Furthermore, treatment-related patient satisfaction and diagnosis-related QoL is assessed by
      PSQ-18 and EORTC questionnaires at the end of radiotherapy and at the first follow-up.
