  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Normal testicular hormonal and spermatogenic function depends not only on the testis itself,
      but also on the integrity of the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary. Systemic diseases has
      been shown to influence male gonadal function in variety of ways, leading to reduced libido,
      erectile impotence, infertility, osteoporosis, and decreased physical stamina and muscle
      mass. The effect of systemic diseases may occur directly at the testicular level: reduced
      Leydig cell function will lead to androgen deficiency, while diseases affecting
      Spermatogenesis may lead to infertility. Alternatively, acute and chronic illness may
      interfere with the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and lead to reduced testicular function.

      Liver is thoroughly involved in proteins, cytokines and interleukins synthesis and
      destruction. Therefore, abnormal function of endocrine organs is expected in patients with
      liver cirrhosis.

      Hypogonadism is a frequent clinical feature in patients with liver cirrhosis. These patients
      have gynecomastia, decreased libido, signs of feminization, testicular atrophy and low
      testosterone level, as well as reduced Spermatogenesis. These features are more severe in
      patients with higher Child Pugh score.

      Several hormonal abnormalities are responsible for these clinical alterations.
      Estrogen/androgen ratio has been increased in cirrhosis while there is reduction in serum
      testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone level.

      Hyperprolactinemia is present in patients with cirrhosis and may involve in Hypogonadism by
      an inhibitory effect on gonadotropins.
