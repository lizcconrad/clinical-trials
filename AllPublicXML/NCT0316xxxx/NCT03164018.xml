  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fampyra, a voltage-dependent potassium channel blocker, is indicated for the improvement of
      walking in adult patients with multiple sclerosis with walking disability (EDSS 4-7). The
      medicinal product has been authorized under a so-called &quot;conditional approval&quot; scheme. This
      means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited and this study aims to
      assess the effect of Fampyra, administered according to standard clinical practice, on
      cognition, fatigue and quality of life in patients with MS.

      This clinical study is a multicenter, prospective, non-interventional, cohort study of MS
      patients receiving Fampyra in outpatient setting. Patients will be treated according to the
      local prescribing information of the study medication and routine medical practice in terms
      of visit frequency and types of assessments performed. The assignment of the patient to this
      therapeutic strategy is not decided in advance by the study protocol but falls within current
      practice and the prescription of Fampyra is clearly separated from the physician's decision
      to include the patient in the current study.

      Since this is purely non-interventional study, primary data -which will be obtained
      prospectively during the study visits through patients' interview and patient reported
      outcomes or as performed per standard clinical practice- will mainly be employed.

      The study will take place in Greece. Investigator's decision to prescribe Fampyra (according
      to the indication for treatment as defined in the summary of product characteristics, SmPC
      and the current clinical practice), should precede entry into the study.

    <description>The non-interventional design allows the observation of patients in a broad range of settings reflecting routine clinical practice. All decisions on therapeutic or diagnostic procedures, treatments and management of the disease will be at the full discretion of the treating physician without interference by a sponsor or study protocol.
