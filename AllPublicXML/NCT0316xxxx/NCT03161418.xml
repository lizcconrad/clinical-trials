  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of orally administered KSP-910638G, a
      topically administered li-cor IRDye800CW labeled heptapeptide specific for human epithelial
      growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IA study of the safety of an orally administered KSP-910638G heptapeptide for
      detection of neoplastic tissues in multiple areas of the gastrointestinal tract in humans.
      The investigators intend to enroll 25 evaluable subjects. The investigators expect to be able
      to enroll about 1-2 subjects per week, so the study should take about 4-6 months to complete.

      Interested, healthy subjects ages 25-100 who respond to recruitment advertising on
      UMHealthResearch.org and appear to be eligible based responses to inclusion/exclusion
      criteria questions will be scheduled for a study visit at MCRU. At the study visit, the
      subjects will review and sign the informed consent and eligibility will be confirmed. If
      eligible, subjects will provide a blood sample for clinical labs and a urine sample for
      urinalysis. A negative urine pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential is required
      to be eligible. Eligible subjects will consume the reconstituted KSP-910638G. After 5
      minutes, subjects will drink a minimum 4-8 ounces of tap water and vital signs will be taken.
      Subjects will remain in MCRU for observation for 30 minutes. Vital signs will be recorded
      after 30 minutes. Subjects are required to return to MCRU to have a repeat blood draw for
      clinical labs and urinalysis within 24 to 48 hours after KSP-910638G ingestion. The study
      team will conduct a verbal assessment for toxicity at this visit.

    <description>The first three subjects will receive lyophilized powder reconstituted with 5 mL of 0.9% NaCl, 0.4 mg of KSP-910638G total. For the first three subjects, 3.34 mL of KSP-910638G will be discarded. The 1.66 mL of KSP-910638G remaining in the syringe will be administered by squirting it into the mouth of the subject.</description>

    <description>Following a safety review of the first three subjects receiving 0.4 mg dose, the remaining 22 subjects will receive the full 1.2 mg dose of KSP-910638G reconstituted in 5 mL 0.9% NaCl. These 22 subjects will receive all 5 mL of the peptide solution in a syringe for administration. The agent will not be reconstituted until the subject is ready to squirt the peptide into his or her mouth via syringe. They will be asked to wait 5 minutes and then drink at least 4-8 oz of tap water.</description>
