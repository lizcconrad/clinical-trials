  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic cell transplantation (BMT), or commonly referred to as blood and marrow
      transplantation (BMT), is a potentially life-saving therapy for many malignant and
      non-malignant conditions. Despite advances over the past decade, which have led to improved
      outcomes, BMT remains an intense treatment modality often requiring prolonged
      inpatient--based care. While many patients endure the acute complications of the procedure,
      it is common for BMT patients and their caregivers to experience increased risk of financial
      and emotional burden, hospital readmission, and health service utilization. This highlights
      the importance of active involvement of BMT patients in their own health care
      (self--efficacy).

      Given the intense nature of BMT, however, caregivers also play a critical role in the process
      and are a necessary component of proceeding with transplant. As such, caregiver activation on
      behalf of the patient plays a critical role in effective patient--caregiver-provider
      partnerships, which is increasingly recognized as the optimal model for health care delivery,
      particularly for those facing life--altering medical treatments. It is essential to develop
      effective strategies to enhance this partnership. Health information technology (IT)-mediated
      tools offer the potential to overcome constraints in health care delivery limited by provider
      time, complicated health information, and financial pressures. Significant gaps in knowledge
      exist on the use of health IT tools using low- cost and well- accepted delivery platforms in
      routine inpatient care, especially for high- risk or critically ill populations. We
      hypothesize that a tablet--based tool displaying personal health information could provide a
      platform to promote caregiver activation and enhance health communication.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be recruited by BMT RN Coordinators and physicians prior to patient
             admission to the BMT Unit. Caregiver (age 18 years or older) of any patient eligible
             to undergo autologous or allogeneic BMT and any patient (age 18 years or older)
             eligible to undergo autologous or allogeneic BMT will be recruited during the
             &quot;Pre-Transplant Work-up&quot; stage in the outpatient setting.

          -  CAREGIVER PARTICIPANTS: Caregiver (age 18 years or older) of a patient who will be
             hospitalized to undergo first-time autologous (self) or allogeneic (alternative donor)
             BMT in the University of Michigan Mott Children's Hospital BMT Unit

          -  PATIENT PARTICIPANTS: Patients (age 18 years or older) who will be hospitalized to
             undergo first-time autologous or allogeneic BMT will be given the opportunity to
             assent/consent and participate in the study. With his/her permission, the patient will
             also be provided with their own iPad® BMT Roadmap information system to use.
             Qualitative interviews will be conducted in patients with their assent/consent.

          -  Ability to speak and read proficiently in English (the study's instruments have not
             been translated and validated in languages other than English)

          -  Willing and able to provide informed consent

          -  Willing to comply with study procedures and reporting requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not willing and able to provide informed consent

          -  Not willing to comply with study procedures and reporting requirements
