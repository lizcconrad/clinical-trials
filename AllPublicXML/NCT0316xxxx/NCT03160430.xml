  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, two-part study; Part A and Part B. Part A of the study is an
      open-label, single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation of 100 mg RVX000222 on dialysis and
      non-dialysis days in eight (8) End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients who receive
      hemodialysis as standard of care.

      Part B of the study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in up to thirty six (36) ESRD
      patients receiving hemodialysis using a sequential cross-over design with RVX000222 at a
      daily oral dose of 100 mg b.i.d. (200 mg per day) or matching placebo in combination with
      SoC.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate if treatment with RVX000222 in combination
      with standard of care (SoC) decreases plasma alkaline phosphatase in comparison to placebo
      and SoC.
