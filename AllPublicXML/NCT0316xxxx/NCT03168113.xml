  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single center, clinical mechanistic pilot clinical research study.
      Participants will not receive any investigational agent. The investigators will examine
      whether children with atopic dermatitis (AD) and food allergy have a different skin barrier,
      microbiome, epidermal transcriptome, and epidermal lipid composition than children with AD
      and no food allergy and non-atopic (NA) children. Participation involves a single study
      visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder in which the skin becomes
      extremely itchy and is susceptible to recurrent skin infections. AD is thought to occur from
      a combination of immunological, genetic, and environmental factors.

      Those with atopic dermatitis (AD) often have food allergy and Staphylococcus aureus (S.
      aureus) colonization of the skin. There is evidence suggesting that skin barrier dysfunction,
      measurable as increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL), is a predisposing factor to food
      sensitization and food allergy from epicutaneous penetration of environmental food allergens.
      Furthermore, the investigators for this study have identified that AD children with food
      allergy, especially peanut allergy, are colonized with Staphylococcus aureus. However, only
      half (50%) of children with AD have food allergy or S. aureus colonization, suggesting there
      are other factors accounting for food allergy. There have been no previous studies of TEWL
      or, microbial or molecular profiling of the skin in those with AD prone to food allergy
      versus AD without food allergy.

    <measure>The Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) Area Under the Curve</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>TEWL will be assessed on non-lesional skin prior to tape stripping (Basal) and repeated after 5, 10, 15, and 20 tape strips. TEWL is a noninvasive in vivo measurement of water loss across the stratum corneum. Skin tape strip method allows characterization of components of the epidermis, dermis, and immune cells present in the skin. Comparison between groups (e.g., atopic dermatitis [AD] children with food allergy, AD children without food allergy and Non-atopic children) will be evaluated.</description>

    <description>TEWL is a noninvasive in vivo measurement of water loss across the stratum corneum that is used to characterize skin water barrier function. Basal TEWL =baseline measure. Comparison between groups (e.g., atopic dermatitis [AD] children with food allergy, AD children without food allergy and Non-Atopic children) of basal TEWL on non-lesional and lesional skin will be evaluated.</description>

Sampling will involve the upper extremities. Skin tape strip method allows characterization of components of the epidermis, dermis, and immune cells present in the skin. Comparison between groups (e.g., atopic dermatitis [AD] children with food allergy, AD children without food allergy and Non-atopic children) will be evaluated.</description>

    <description>Microbial carriage as assessed by the presence of microbial sequencing reads. Skin swab samples will include defined non-lesional and lesional areas of the upper and lower extremities.

Skin swab samples will include defined non-lesional and lesional areas of the upper and lower extremities. The comparison using this methodology is between groups (e.g., atopic dermatitis [AD] children with food allergy, AD children without food allergy and Non-atopic children).</description>

Comparison between groups (e.g., atopic dermatitis [AD] children with food allergy, AD children without food allergy and Non-atopic children) for anti- Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) activity of CoNS cultured from skin will be evaluated. This is a functional assessment of antimicrobial activity.</description>

      <textblock>
        Children ages 4-17 years, inclusive. Enrollment will include 20 AD children with food
        allergy to peanut, 20 AD children without a history of food allergy, and up to 20 NA
        children. The study requires that AD participants with peanut allergy meet the 95% positive
        predictive value for skin prick test (â‰¥ 8 mm wheal) for peanut allergy. Food allergic AD
        participants will be allowed to have other food allergies in addition to peanut. A subset
        of children with AD whose disease is too severe to stop prohibited medications as defined
        in the protocol will be excluded. NA children will serve as a healthy control group for the
        AD study participants. Enrollment is to children since AD and food allergies are more
        prevalent among children, and adult onset AD and/or food allergy is a different phenotype.
