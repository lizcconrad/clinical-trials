  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 dose escalation study will evaluate the safety, pharmacology, and activity of
      ARQ 531 in subjects with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies dosed orally once
      per day beginning at 5 mg/dose for 4 weeks with the following cohorts treating at escalating
      doses until a dose limiting toxicity or a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) is reached.

      During the dose escalation period, intra-subject dose escalation will be permitted if the
      following criteria are met:

        1. The next higher dose for the regimen has demonstrated to be safe by at least 3 subjects
           and the last subject completed one cycle without experiencing any dose limiting toxicity
           (DLT).

        2. The subject who will receive the dose escalation has not experienced a DLT.

      Once the RP2D is determined, expanded cohorts studying specific malignancies (e.g., B-cell
      NHL, WM, CLL) at the RP2D will be opened to further explore the safety, pharmacology, and
      activity of ARQ 531 as monotherapy.

    <intervention_model_description>The dose escalation phase of the study follows the 3+3 dose escalation design. Dose escalation will continue until the MTD and/or RP2D is reached based on protocol-defined DLT.
During the dose escalation period, intra-subject dose escalation will be permitted if the following criteria are met:
The next higher dose for the regimen has demonstrated to be safe by at least 3 subjects and the last subject completed one cycle without experiencing any DLT.
The subject who will receive the dose escalation has not experienced a DLT.
Once MTD/RP2D is reached, expanded cohorts will be opened for specified malignancies (e.g., B-cell NHL, WM, and CLL).</intervention_model_description>
