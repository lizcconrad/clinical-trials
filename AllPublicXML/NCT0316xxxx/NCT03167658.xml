  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is great public and private interest in the use of workplace wellness programs to
      reduce health care spending, improve health outcomes, and enhance productivity for employees.
      However, there is little rigorous evidence on the effects of wellness programs. This study
      partners with a large multi-state U.S. employer (BJ's Wholesale Club) and an experienced
      wellness vendor (Wellness Workdays) to evaluate a multi-prong workplace wellness program,
      including components such as nutrition counseling, fitness challenges, and stress management
      workshops. The wellness program will be delivered by a team of experts and aided by
      innovative technologies, and will include financial rewards for participation. The program
      will be available to employees in 25 of BJ's 200 worksites. These sites have been randomly
      selected, allowing a randomized controlled evaluation of the effects of the wellness program.
      Data will be collected on a wide array of outcomes from multiple sources, including on-site
      biometric screenings and surveys, employment records, and health insurance claims for
      employees at both treatment and control sites.
