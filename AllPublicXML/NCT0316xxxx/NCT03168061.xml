  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to find the highest tolerated dose of NC-6300 that can be given to
      patients with advanced solid tumors or soft tissue sarcoma. The safety and tolerability of
      the drug will also be studied.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first part of the study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs), and the recommended Phase 2 (RPII) dose of NC-6300. The second part of the
      study will assess the activity and tolerability of NC-6300 in patients with soft tissue
      sarcoma.

    <description>In Part 1, patients will receive an intravenous infusion of NC-6300 at escalating doses starting at a fixed dose on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle. After enrollment of the initial patient, the first patient in each cohort will not be enrolled until all patients at the immediately lower cohort have completed at least 1 full 21-day cycle. In Part 1, patients will continue to receive treatment until they experience disease progression, experience unacceptable toxicity, or withdraw voluntarily.
Part 2 will begin after the RPII dose of NC-6300 is identified. All patients in Part 2 will receive NC-6300 at the RPII dose.</description>

          -  Have unresolved toxicity from prior radiation, chemotherapy, or other targeted
             treatment, including investigational treatment, with the exception of alopecia and
             ≤Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03. Clinical judgment by
             the investigator is allowed to determine if Grade 1 fatigue at screening is residual
             toxicity from prior treatment or is a symptom of the patient's general condition or
             disease. The investigator and Medical Monitor will discuss the eligibility of patients
             with baseline toxicity.

          -  Have a history of thrombocytopenia with complications including hemorrhage or bleeding
             of ≥Grade 2 per NCI CTCAE v4.03 that required medical intervention or have any

          -  Have known hypersensitivity to anthracycline compounds or any excipient in NC-6300.

          -  Have uncontrolled diabetes or have hypertension requiring more than 3 medications for

          -  Have signs or symptoms of organ failure, major chronic illnesses other than cancer, or
             any concomitant medical or social condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             make it undesirable for the patient to participate in the study or that could
             jeopardize compliance with the protocol.

          -  Have experienced any of the following within the 6-month period prior to screening:
             angina pectoris, coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident, transient
             ischemic attack, cardiac failure with known ejection fraction less than 40%, or severe
             uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia.
