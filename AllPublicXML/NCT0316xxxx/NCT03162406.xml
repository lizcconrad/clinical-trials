    <textblock>
      The subjects participating in the trial will be randomly allocated to either the group
      receiving the treatment under investigation (scaling and root planning (SRP) accompanied by
      administration of vitamin D) or to a group receiving standard treatment (SRP in conjunction
      with placebo) as the control. Random assignment of intervention will be done after subjects
      have been assessed for eligibility and recruited, but before the intervention to be studied
      begins. After randomization, the two groups of subjects will be followed in exactly the same
      way and the only differences between them will be the vitamin D/placebo that they will
      receive.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is likely that a chronically low intake of vitamin D and calcium may lead to a negative
      calcium balance, thus causing a secondary increase in calcium removal from bone, including
      the alveolar bone. Such bone loss may contribute to weakening of the tooth-attachment
      apparatus. In addition to its action on skeletal homeostasis, vitamin D, and, in particular,
      its hormonally active form, 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial
      effects via modulation of inflammatory cytokine production by immune cells and stimulated
      secretion of peptides with antibacterial action by cells of the monocyte-macrophage
      lineage.These multiple actions of vitamin D are potentially appealing for the management of
      patients with periodontal disease, whose pathogenesis is based on chronic bacterial-driven
      inflammation.

      Excess of vitamin D leads to a disturbance of the calcium in the body cycle. The symptoms
      experienced are: weakness, fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, polyuria,
      calciuria, dry mouth, nighttime urination, proteinuria, increased thirst, loss ofappetite,
      dizziness.

      In case of high blood calcium level for a prolonged period, calcium deposits (tissue
      calcinosis) may occur in the soft tissues, including the kidneys where they cause
      calculations and calcium deposits in the nephrons, blood vessels, heart, lung and skin. These
      effects are reversible if the intoxication is detected in time.
