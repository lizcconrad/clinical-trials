  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study evaluating the safety
      and efficacy of Atezolizumab when combined with immunogenic chemotherapy in subjects with
      metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Atezolizumab, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and
      cyclophosphamide are the Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is rarely curable after metastasis, and the therapeutic options for metastatic
      triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) are limited. The host immune response is strongly
      predictive for the effect of chemotherapy in patients with TNBC. In the present trial, we
      combine Atezolizumab, an inhibitory antibody against Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1), with
      chemotherapy. Thereby, we aim to release the brake on the chemo-induced immune response. The
      chemotherapeutic regime is a combination of anthracycline and cyclophosphamide, applied in a
      semi-metronomic fashion (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin every 2nd week and daily
      cyclophosphamide for 2/4 weeks). The investigators hypothesize that the semi-metronomic
      regime will induce immunological cell death and counter T regulatory cells, while maintaining
      the leukocyte counts and the ability of the effector immune cells to respond. The use of
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx) minimizes the adverse effects of anthracyclines on
      the heart and allows for continued treatment beyond the otherwise mandatory anthracycline
      limits.

    <description>Atezolizumab is a monoclonal antibody designed to target and bind to a protein called PD-L1 (programmed death ligand-1), which is expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells. PD-L1 interacts with PD-1 and B7.1, both found on the surface of T cells, causing inhibition of T cells. By blocking this interaction, Atezolizumab may enable the activation of T cells, restoring their ability to effectively detect and attack tumour cells.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Metastatic or incurable locally advanced, histologically documented TNBC (absence of
             human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), endocrine receptor (ER), and
             progesterone receptors (PR) expression). HER2 negativity is defined as either of the
             following by local laboratory assessment: In situ hybridization (ISH) non-amplified
             (ratio of HER2 to chromosome 17 centromere(CEP17) &lt; 2.0 or single probe average HER2
             gene copy number &lt; 4 signals/cell), or Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 0 or IHC 1+ (if more
             than one test result is available and not all results meet the inclusion criterion
             definition, all results should be discussed with the principal investigator to
             establish eligibility of the patient). ER and PR negativity are defined as &lt; 1% and
             &lt;10%, respectively, of cells expressing hormonal receptors via IHC analysis

          -  Adequate newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously
             irradiated. No anti-tumor treatment is allowed between the time point for biopsy and
             study entry. If a patient has undergone chemotherapy in the metastatic setting, a new
             biopsy must be obtained after this therapy

          -  Measurable disease according to Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid
             Tumors (irRECIST)

          -  Signed Informed Consent Form

          -  In patients that have received (neo) adjuvant treatment with anthracyclines or
             cyclophosphamide, a minimum of 12 months from treatment with anthracyclines or
             cyclophosphamide until relapse of disease is required

          -  A maximum of one previous line with chemotherapy in the metastatic setting

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 7 days prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the
             urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will
             be required

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential should agree to remain abstinent (refrain
             from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure
             rate of &lt; 1% per year, during the treatment period and for at least 5 months after the
             last dose of study therapy. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if
             she is postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months
             of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone
             surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of contraceptive
             methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male
             sterilization, proper use of hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation and
             hormone-releasing intrauterine devices (IUDs). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,
             ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
             methods of contraception

          -  Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with
             the first dose of study therapy through 5 months after the last dose of study therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Malignancies other than TNBC within 5 years prior to randomization, with the exception
             of those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death and treated with expected
             curative outcome (such as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal
             or squamous cell skin cancer)

          -  Known Breast Cancer gene (BRCA) mutation, unless the patient has already received
             carboplatin or for other reasons should not receive carboplatin treatment, according
             to own preferences or recommendations by the treating physician.

          -  Spinal cord compression not definitively treated with surgery and/or radiation, or
             previously diagnosed and treated spinal cord compression without evidence that disease
             has been clinically stable for &gt; 2 weeks prior to randomization

          -  Known central nervous system (CNS) disease, except for treated asymptomatic CNS
             metastases, provided all of the following criteria are met:

               1. Measurable disease outside the CNS

               2. No metastases to mesencephalon, pons, medulla oblongata, or spinal cord

               3. No evidence of progression after completion of CNS-directed therapy

               4. No ongoing requirement for dexamethasone as therapy for CNS disease

               5. No radiation of brain lesions within 14 days prior to randomization

               6. No leptomeningeal disease

               7. Patients with new asymptomatic CNS metastases detected at the screening scan must
                  receive radiation therapy and/or surgery for CNS metastases. Following treatment,
                  these patients may be eligible without the need for an additional brain scan
                  prior to enrolment, if all other criteria are met

             on a stable regimen at study entry. Symptomatic lesions (e.g., bone metastases or
             metastases causing nerve impingement) amenable to palliative radiotherapy should be
             treated prior to randomization. Asymptomatic metastatic lesions whose further growth
             would likely cause functional deficits or intractable pain (e.g., epidural metastasis
             that is not presently associated with spinal cord compression) should be considered
             for loco-regional therapy if appropriate prior to randomization

             years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxin, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment. Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus
