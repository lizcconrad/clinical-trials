  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease with an unknown
      cause and many challenges. Whilst corticosteroids and effective immunosuppressive therapy
      have transformed the management of patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus, one of
      the major causes of morbidity in Systemic lupus erythematosus patients is chronic,
      debilitating fatigue.

      Despite frequent occurrence of fatigue in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, to the best of our
      knowledge, no studies have been directly performed to examine fatigue-related changes in
      cortical motor function in Systemic lupus erythematosus. In this study, we hypothesized that
      Systemic lupus erythematosus patients with fatigue and depression versus Systemic lupus
      erythematosus patients without fatigue and depression would present an alteration of motor
      cortex excitability.

      Fatigue, is a multidimensional phenomenon that affects individuals physically, emotionally,
      cognitively, and behaviorally.It affects 80-90% of patients with systemic lupus
      erythematosus. It is likely multifactorial and may be caused by disordered sleep, anxiety and
      depression, pain, polypharmacy, comorbidities, and possibly disease activity.

      Additionally, fatigue is the most prevalent symptom in systemic lupus erythematosus, being
      present in up to 90% of patients. Moreover, fatigue has a major impact on the Health-Related
      Quality Of Life of Systemic lupus erythematosus patients through its impact on family life,
      work, social life, emotional wellbeing, and cognition. Therefore, every effort should be made
      to relieve fatigue in this population. Recommendations for the management of fatigue usually
      combine pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions; however, no speciÔ¨Åc drugs have
      proven useful for treating fatigue in Systemic lupus erythematosus.
