  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib study to look at the combination of an antibody immunization vaccine
      strategy using oregovomab and an investigational stage immune booster (poly ICLC / Hiltonol),
      both of which have previously been used in combination with other cancer treatments and
      demonstrated to be active in advanced cancer, but which have not previously been used
      together. This study will assess the approach as to whether these two drugs can safely add to
      the response seen with either drug alone, both of which have doses that are based on prior
      studies.

      Subjects with stable disease for whom a 12 week break from therapy for their persistent and
      progressive advanced ovarian cancer is appropriate, who have signed informed consent and for
      whom baseline clinical information is completed, will receive 4 cycles of oregovomab/Hiltonol
      immunization every three weeks (weeks 0, 3, 6, and 9). Blood will be obtained for to look for
      a CA125 specific T cell response at 12 weeks before initiating any additional therapy
      according to the best clinical judgment of the investigator. At week 16 the subjects will
      receive a final dose of the combination of oregovomab/Hiltonol and at week 17 will have an
      additional blood draw for analysis of T-cell response.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib evaluation of the combination of an antibody immunization vaccine strategy
      using oregovomab and an investigational stage immune adjuvant (poly ICLC / Hiltonol), both of
      which have previously been used in combination with other cancer treatments and demonstrated
      to be bioactive in advanced cancer, but which have not previously been combined together. The
      doses selected for each agent have been selected previously through human clinical study for
      use in immunization protocols as a well-tolerated and bioactive immune stimulatory dose. For
      immunization purposes a maximum tolerated dose is not a relevant pharmacologic objective.
      Rather this is an exercise in efficiently assessing a preliminary immunization protocol as a
      cost effective product development strategy assessing the ability of the combination to
      safely augment the immune signals measurable with either agent alone, both of which have been
      titrated to the current dose based on the principle of bell shaped dose response in
      immunization in prior studies.

      Subjects with stable disease for whom a 12 week break from cytotoxic therapy for their
      persistent and progressive advanced ovarian cancer is appropriate, who have signed informed
      consent and for whom baseline clinical information including laboratory, radiologic and
      physical documentation of their status is completed, will receive 4 cycles of
      oregovomab/Hiltonol immunization every three weeks (weeks 0, 3, 6, and 9). Blood will be
      obtained for the measurement of CA125 specific T cell immunity at 12 weeks before initiating
      continuing salvage therapy according to the best clinical judgment of the investigator. At
      week 16 the subjects will receive a final immunization with oregovomab/Hiltonol and at week
      17 an additional blood draw for analysis of T-cell immunity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subjects with CA125-associated, advanced ovarian cancer (FIGO Stage III/IV)
             previously treated and now presenting with recurrent or persistent disease.

          2. Must have a histological diagnosis of epithelial adenocarcinoma of ovarian, tubal or
             peritoneal origin that is persistent or progressive following multiple rounds of prior
             standard of care and experimental therapy.

          3. Must have had an elevated serum CA125 level twice the upper limit of normal (per
             reference lab normal range) measured within 4 weeks of enrollment.

          4. Must have measurable disease by radiographic or physical criteria suitable for
             evaluation according to RECIST v1.1 for documentation of disease response or
             progression.

          5. Must have a Functional Performance Status of less than or equal to 2 on the ECOG scale
             (Appendix VII).

          6. Must have reached legal age to consent.

          7. Must have medical assessment consistent with prognosis for an expected survival of at
             least 6 months and be clinically appropriate to receive a 12 week hiatus from any
             cytotoxic treatment according to the best clinical judgement of the treating
             investigator.

          8. Must have voluntarily agreed to participate and have signed the informed consent, and
             are willing to complete all study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Compromised hematopoietic function (hemoglobin &lt;8.0 g/dL; lymphocyte count &lt;300 mm3;
             neutrophil count &lt;1000 mm3; platelet count &lt;100,000 mm3).

          2. Hepatic dysfunction defined as a bilirubin &gt;1.5 times the upper normal limits, LDH,

          4. Pregnant or breast-feeding. (While pregnancy is unlikely in view of the disease and
             previous surgery, subjects whom the investigator considers may be at risk of pregnancy
             will have a pregnancy [beta-HCG] test and will be using a medically approved
             contraceptive method).

          5. Have an active autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, ulcerative
             colitis, Crohn's Disease, MS, ankylosing spondylitis) requiring continuing immune
             suppressive therapy.

          6. Known allergy to murine proteins or have had a documented anaphylactic reaction to any
             drug, or a known hypersensitivity to diphenhydramine or other antihistamines of
             similar chemical structure.

          7. Chronically treated with systemic doses of immunosuppressive drugs such as
