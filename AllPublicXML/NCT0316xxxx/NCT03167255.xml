    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multicenter, open-label, extension study of NS-065/NCNP-01 administered
      intravenously once weekly for an additional 72 weeks to boys with DMD who complete Study
      NS-065/NCNP-01-201. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical efficacy
      of NS-065/NCNP-01 at dose levels of up to 80 mg/kg/week administered by weekly IV infusion
      over an additional treatment period of 72 weeks.

      Patients who complete the Phase II Dose-finding Study NS-065/NCNP-01-201 are eligible to
      enroll.
