      The aim of this study is to analyze the efficacy of Diabeton 60 MR as intensive
      sugar-lowering therapy into routine clinical practice, in patients for whom the treating
      physician has already decided to prescribe this medication. This concerns untreated newly
      diagnosed patients uncontrolled by diet, and patients uncontrolled by metformin.
