  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic patients need to manage their glucose level, physical activity and food intake to
      successfully cope with their disease. Previous work has shown that reminders of the disease,
      be they informational or about ones' condition, can improve management of disease in
      diabetes.

      This trial focuses on delivering these reminders, via email, in attempt to improve the
      patients glycemic control (measured in Hemoglobin A1C)

      The study initially included 50 patients (men and women, over 18 years of age) who were prior
      diagnosed with DM2 and unbalanced in their glycemic values (HbA1c above 7%). The patient were
      sent via email , once every other week, a link to web-based pages which provides information
      on changing DM2 related such as general DM2 information, the importance of keeping a
      well-balanced diet, benefits of exercising regularly, drug related information and more.

      Furthermore, the patients were sent a questionnaire every other week which they were asked to
      actively reply to.

      Each participating patient was monitored for 6 months, during this time he/she was sent 12
      web-based information pages.

      During the course of the study, information regarding the patients' glycemic control (in the
      form of HgA1c levels) was collected.

      Additional variables (age, sex, BMI, time passed since diagnosed with DM2) were collected and
      used for statistical comparison.
