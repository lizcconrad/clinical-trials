  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A registry of consecutive patients who were admitted and diagnosed with acute myocardial
      infarction or acute cerebral infarction were conducted at the Guangdong General Hospital or
      the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Yue Bei People's
      Hospital, China, between January 2000 and December 2016. The adverse clinical outcomes,
      including all-cause mortality, were followed from the date of admission for acute myocardial
      infarction or acute cerebral infarction until study end (December 31, 2016). All-cause
      mortality, including the date of death, was identified from the electronic hospitalization
      data, phone follow-up, and confirmed by the household registration (HUKOU) system, a record
      of registration required by law in China. Baseline characteristics, including major treatment
      of acute myocardial infarction or acute cerebral infarction, estimated glomerular filtration
      rate (eGFR) and proteinuria, were collected. Demographic data were determined from the
      electronic hospitalization data and electronic hospital discharge records. All comorbid
      conditions were identified using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth
      Revision (ICD-10), coding algorithms applied to electronic physician claims and electronic
      hospital discharge records. Life style (smoking), treatment regimen at discharge, including
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), were
      determined from the electronic hospitalization data.
