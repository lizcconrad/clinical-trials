  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess whether the hospital-based, adaptive behavioral
      intervention strategy promotes treatment entry and reduces risk of additional
      substance-exposed pregnancies (SEPs), as well as HIV and HCV risks among substance-using NICU
      mothers. Additionally, to assess whether the intervention increases use of professional
      obstetrical/gynecological resources for contraception to reduce substance-exposed pregnancies
      (SEPs).
