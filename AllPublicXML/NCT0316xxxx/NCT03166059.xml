  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CaveoVasc Thrombolysis Protection System is intended to aid sheath access and reduce
      bleeding complications during catheter directed thrombolysis (CDT) in the treatment of limb
      ischemia. This device has been designed to protect the puncture site by stabilizing the CDT
      sheath with the double-balloons that are part of the CaveoVasc system. Also the device is
      designed to reduce bleeding at the puncture site during CDT.

      This study is designed to assess the safety and performance of the CaveoVasc Thrombolysis
      Protection System in twenty patients with limb ischemia undergoing treatment with CDT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Catheter directed thrombolysis (CDT) is a non-surgical option for many patients, which
      involves the insertion of an infusion catheter (via the femoral artery) into the thrombus
      allowing for slow delivery of a pharmacological thrombolytic agent. Insertion of the infusion
      catheter is performed in the catheterization laboratory. The patient is usually then
      transferred to the intensive care unit, with delivery catheter in place and the infusion
      running for at least 24 hours.

      The major complications reported with CDT include major and minor bleeding, and complications
      secondary to early termination of the CDT due to access site bleeding.

      CaveoMed developed the CaveoVasc® Thrombolysis Protection System, a vascular access
      protection device intended for use in thrombolysis procedures. Its function is to facilitate
      sheath access, and minimize risks of access site bleeding complications during lengthy
      catheter-directed thrombolysis procedures. Pressure balloons inflated outside the artery
      maintain a good seal throughout thrombolysis, which typically lasts up to 24 hours. The
      thrombolysis catheter is then removed, and hemostasis at the site is managed per the
      hospital's standard.

      The CaveoVasc® Thrombolysis Protection System design has important advantages for use during
      CDT procedures (which require long catheter dwell times). The system is intended to protect
      from intra-procedural bleeding at the arterial access site, which currently remains a major
      problem for patients with critical limb ischemia undergoing CDT treatment. This protection
      would lower the rate of bleeding events, and increase the rate of completed intended therapy,
      without interruption of the CDT treatment due to bleeding complications.
