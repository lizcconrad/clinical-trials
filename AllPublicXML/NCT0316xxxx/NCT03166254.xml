  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is incurable with current therapies, but due to
      mutations induced by cigarette smoke, typically expresses a large number of altered proteins
      that can be recognized as foreign by the immune system. This antigenicity is thought to
      explain the efficacy of pembrolizumab as either a first or second line treatment in this
      disease. For patients who receive chemotherapy as a first line therapy, there is sound
      rationale for combination treatment with immunotherapy and a therapeutic antitumor vaccine as
      a maintenance strategy. Regardless of PD-L1 expression in the tumor, monoclonal antibodies
      that block PD-1/PD-L1 interactions are effective second line therapies after chemotherapy. In
      addition, by targeting the immune system against tumor specific antigens using a peptide
      vaccine, the efficacy of pembrolizumab alone is expected to be enhanced, with an improved
      response rate and prolonged overall survival with no additional toxicity.

      This pilot study will provide a preliminary test of the feasibility of generating a
      personalized, tumor neoantigen-specific therapeutic vaccine and the safety of combining it
      with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.

    <measure>Overall response rate as measured by RECIST 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of treatment (estimated to be 2.25 years)</time_frame>
    <description>-The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS) as measured by RECIST 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years after completion of treatment (estimated to be 7.25 years)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
Progressive disease: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.</description>

    <description>-The association between response and genetic features in the pathway will also be assessed using contingency tables. Although data analysis will be primarily descriptive, permutation test will be used to rank the strength of association. Specifically, we first compute the observed test statistics for the differences between responders and non-responders. Then the null distribution of the test statistics will be generated by simulating 10,000 datasets where the status of response was randomly shuffled. The permutation p-values equal the proportion of simulations from the null distribution that exceed the observed test statistics.</description>

    <measure>Overall response rate as measured by immune-response related criteria (irRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of treatment (estimated to be 2.25 years)</time_frame>
    <description>-The overall response according to the irRC is derived from time point response assessments (Based on tumor burden) as follows:
irCR: complete disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not, and no new lesions); confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than 4 weeks from the date first documented
irPR: decrease in tumor burden ≥ 50% relative to baseline; confirmed by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks after first documentation
irSD: not meeting criteria for irCR or irPR, in absence of irPD; does not require confirmation
irPD: increase in tumor burden ≥ 25% relative to nadir (minimum recorded tumor burden); confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than 4 weeks from the date first documented</description>

6 weeks following enrollment (approximately 9 weeks following the last dose of systemic chemotherapy), a repeat CT scan will be done to document disease stability. Should disease progression be evident, patients will begin pembrolizumab until the personalized vaccine is available
All patients will begin treatment with pembrolizumab on a 21-day cycle for up to a maximum of 2 years of therapy 12 weeks after enrollment
Up to 2 doses of pembrolizumab can be given prior to vaccine preparation if there is a delay in vaccine formulation. Up to 20 personalized vaccine peptides will be administered
Vaccine administration will occur on Days 1, 4, 8, and 15 during Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 5, and 8
Patients in clinically stable condition who are considered by the investigator to be deriving clinical benefit may continue therapy after disease progression</description>
