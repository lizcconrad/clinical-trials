  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among advanced intubation equipment for difficult intubation, a lighted stylet (lightwand) is
      a widely used equipment in cervical immobilized patients. However, a lightwand, which is used
      blind, is difficult to make midline positioning and can increase airway complications and
      hemodynamic changes. In contrast, videolaryngoscope can view vocal cord indirectly through
      camera, however, it requires cervical movement. Therefore, investigator hypothesized that the
      combined use of video-laryngoscope and lightwand for intubation can improve the efficacy of
      intubation compared to the use of lightwand alone in cervical immobilized patients.

    <description>After anesthetic induction,the difficult airway is simulated by wearing a semi-hard neck collar. For intubation, video-laryngoscope is inserted into the oral cavity ntil the epiglottis tip was visible without lifting the epiglottic vallecula. Then, the endotracheal tube with lightwand is inserted toward the midline under the epiglottis and the intubation is performed looking the transilluminated light of lightwand.</description>
