  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with colorectal liver metastasis (CLM), the prospect of long-term survival
      relies on liver resection. Wistfully, more than 75 % of patients with CLM are initially
      unresectable, due to an insufficient future liver remnant (FLR) volume

      In order to increase FLR volume, most patients will first receive chemotherapy to reduce the
      tumor load (downsizing).

      When chemotherapy is insufficient to provide an adequate postoperative FLR, portal vein
      embolization (PVE) can be performed. About 50-70 % of patients undergoing PVE obtain a
      sufficient liver hypertrophy to allow liver resection.

      While PVE is recognised for its efficacy to induce liver hypertrophy, some studies expressed
      substantial concerns regarding the potential adverse effect of this intervention on
      pre-resection tumor progression, increased risk of cancer recurrence following resection and
      reduced overall survival following resection

      Those studies suggested that the need to perform PVE should be assessed thoroughly for each
      patient and that chemotherapy should be maintained during the whole hypertrophy process in
      order to contain the potential adverse effect of PVE on tumor progression.

      Other studies found no significant association between PVE and negative oncological outcomes.

      As mentioned in almost every study cited above, more data is needed to provide a clearer
      vision regarding the impact of PVE on tumor progression and cancer recurrence following liver
      resection.

      The aim of this study is to compare the overall and disease-free survival of PVE-requiring
      patients to the ones who underwent upfront surgery (NoPVE).

      As a secondary objective, the impact of several covariates (related to surgery, patient's
      condition and disease stage) on survival and cancer recurrence will be tested.

      Our hypothesis are that 1) PVE might be associated with a lower overall survival and a higher
      risk of cancer recurrence in univariate analysis but 2) this association will not remain
      significant when other covariates are included in the proportional COX hazard models.

    <description>Portal vein embolization (PVE) is a procedure that induces regrowth on one side of the liver in advance of a planned hepatic resection on the other side. The procedure is frequently used in primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) and colorectal liver metastases.
An interventional radiologist will place a needle percutaneously (through the skin) into the liver and identify the blood vessel on the side where the largest part of the tumor is being supplied. Tiny microspheres are then infused into the portal vein which supplies blood to the area, embolizing it by cutting off its blood supply.
This blockade of the blood supply induces the other side of the liver to regrow. After several weeks, the non-embolized side has grown enough so that surgery is now a viable option.
