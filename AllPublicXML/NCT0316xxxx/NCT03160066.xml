  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emerging evidence suggests that microorganisms acting via the Brain-Gut axis may have
      potential benefits for the management of stress-related conditions. The majority of studies
      have focused on animal models. Preclinical studies have identified the Lactobacillus
      Rhamnosus JB-1 strain as a putative psychobiotic with an impact on stress-related behaviours,
      physiology and cognitive performance. Whether such preclinical effects could be translated to
      healthy human volunteers remains unknown.

      30 healthy male volunteers will be recruited in a randomized single blind placebo controlled
      cross over trial. Study participation will involve a screening visit followed by a baseline
      cognitive test battery, EEG and stress visit (socially evaluated cold-pressor test). These
      measures will be repeated after 4 weeks of daily probiotic and placebo capsules.
