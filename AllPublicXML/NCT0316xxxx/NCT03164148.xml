  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have been reported that heart rate is known to be associated with prognosis
      in chronic diseases and acute diseases. For example, a decrease in heart rate following
      myocardial infarction may lead to a higher mortality rate. It is also known to predict heart
      failure, diabetic neuropathy, and even depression.

      The combined pituitary function test artificially induces hypoglycemia to observe the
      secretion of pituitary hormone. The degree of change in heart rate during hypoglycemia can
      predict the adequacy of the test, and heart rate can be changed according to the
      characteristic of the tumor. Also, the prognosis can be predicted based on this.

      In our study, we used a licensed device approved by KFDA (Korea Food and Drug Administration)
      to measure heart rate variability in patients with pituitary adenoma.
