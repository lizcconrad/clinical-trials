  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wireless video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is a non-invasive technology that looks into small
      intestine and gives images of its lumen as the wireless capsule passes through it. It is used
      widely to access this anatomically difficult part of the body that cannot be seen via either
      colonoscopy or endoscopy. Currently various studies have been done that give multiple
      comparisons between various bowel preparation in terms of quality of the small bowel
      visualization. No studies have been done where simethicone (Gas-X) is ingested after capsule
      swallowing. We intend to give patients simethicone 1 hour after capsule ingestion for two
      consecutive hours and compare results of capsule endoscopy outcomes like small bowel transit
      time (SBTT), diagnostic yield (DY), small bowel visualization quality (SBVQ) and completion
      rate (CR).

      Currently various studies have been done that give multiple comparisons between various bowel
      preparation in terms of small bowel transit time (SBTT), diagnostic yield (DY), small bowel
      visualization quality (SBVQ), completion rate (CR). Studies suggest that using Polyethylene
      glycol (PEG) prep is significantly better compared to clear liquid and overnight fast in
      terms if SBVQ and DY (Rokkas et al 2009). Other studies have shown using simethicone 30
      minutes before capsule ingestion increases visibility compared to clear liquid and PEG
      preparation but no significant difference in gastrointestinal transit time or examination
      completion rate (Wei et al 2008). No studies have been done where simethicone is ingested
      after capsule swallowing.

      Simethicone helps absorb the air bubble in the lumen which can improve the image quality. It
      decreases the surface tension of gas bubbles thereby dissolving them and preventing gas
      pockets from forming in GI system. It's often used over the counter for gas relief. Gastric
      emptying time is usually less than 5 hours, small bowel transit time is usually less than 6
      hours, and colonic transit time is usually less than 59 hours (Rao et al 2009). Giving
      simethicone till 2 hours after swallowing capsule can help clear gas bubble before the
      capsule migrates into the small bowel.

      Albert et al 2004 gave patients 80mg simethicone before swallowing the wireless capsule for
      their study. Wei et al 2008 gave 300mg of simethicone 20 minutes before swallowing the
      capsule. Chen et al 2011 gave 20ml (40mg/ml) simethicone 30 minutes before capsule ingestion
      which amounts to 800 mg total. Current FDA recommendation for adults is 500mg maximum daily
      dose. The liquid form comes in concentration of 20mg/0.3ml which constitutes to 7.5 ml for
      500mg dose.
