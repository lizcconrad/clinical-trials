  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been known for many years that the heart and the liver are intimately related. There
      is a mutual interaction between the function of the heart and the liver and a broad spectrum
      of acute and chronic entities that affect both the heart and the liver. Chronic hepatitis C
      virus infection affects more than 3% (170 million) of the world's population.

      Assessment of systolic function by echocardiography will be done to 100 hepatitis C virus
      infected patients who receive antiviral treatment (sofosbuvir and daclatasvir) by biplane
      simpson's method and by speckle tracking.

      Assessment of diastolic function by echocardiography to 30 hepatitis C virus infected
      patients who will not receive antiviral treatment, by left atrium volume , mitral inflow
      pattern , tissue doppler annular early and late diastolic velocities .

Left atrial Volume
Mitral Inflow Patterns
Pulsed wave Doppler
Mitral inflow patterns include normal, impaired left ventricular relaxation, pseudonormal, and restrictive left ventricular filling patterns.
Tissue Doppler Annular Early and Late Diastolic Velocities
Pulsed wave tissue doppler imaging
Primary measurements include the systolic , early diastolic, and late diastolic velocities.</description>
