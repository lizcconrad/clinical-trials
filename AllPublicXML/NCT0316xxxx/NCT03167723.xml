  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic hemothorax and hemopneumothorax are common diagnoses which are typically treated by
      placement of a chest tube. 28-32 Fr chest tubes have previously been shown equivalent to
      36-40 Fr chest tubes for the non-emergent drainage of hemothorax. A smaller study has found
      14 Fr pigtails had less pain than larger tubes but was not powered to compare outcomes. We
      seek to perform a prospective randomized trial that is adequately powered comparing efficacy
      of 14 Fr thal tubes to 28 Fr chest tubes for non-emergent drainage of hemothorax and
      hemopneumothorax. Additionally, we will employ maximal barrier precautions for all chest tube
      insertions and compare empyema rates to our historical controls.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is admitted to the trauma service.

          -  The patient has a hemothorax and/or or hemopneumothorax, requiring thoracostomy tube
             placement.

          -  Thoracostomy tube placement is able to be performed or witnessed by an investigator
             listed on the study.

          -  The patient has not had a chest tube in the past year.

          -  The patient is &gt;18 years of age.

          -  In the event the patient is decisionally impaired, consent will be obtained from the
             individual's legally authorized representative (LAR) or from the individual's
             healthcare power of attorney (HPA).

          -  In the instance of reversible impairment, initial consent would be obtained from the
             LAR/HPA and the patient will be approached for consent once he/she is deemed mentally
             competent by the care provider.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is incarcerated

          -  The patient is known to be pregnant

          -  The patient is &lt; 18 years of age

          -  The patient is hemodynamically unstable, requiring emergent chest tube placement (in
             &lt;10 minutes from evaluation).
