  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective case series patients with a tibial fracture are monitored with smart
      biofeedback systems to document the healing progression and real life weight.

      Ten patients treated with a large external fixator after tibial fracture will be enrolled for
      this prospective case series.

      Patients will be equipped with the AO Fracture Monitor (a data logger device) attached
      post-operatively to a connection rod of the external fixator. The device continuously
      measures deformation of the fixator frame due to normal weight bearing for up to 12 months by
      means of a strain gauge. The strain signal is processed on-board and several parameters
      related to the loading characteristics of the fracture are stored.

      Simultaneously, patients will be equipped with a fully integrated sensor insole (OpenGo
      Insole, Moticon GmbH, München). This product offers long-term weight bearing data (recording
      and storage) and allows non-invasive documentation of real life loading in patients without
      affecting the daily life activity of the patient. Recording of weight-bearing data will be
      obtained for a maximum of 4 months.
