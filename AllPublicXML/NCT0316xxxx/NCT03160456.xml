    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of transcutaneous electrical stimulation of
      the pharyngeal dilator muscles in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea in the community
      compared to usual care, and follow the patients for 3 months, as well as to assess compliance
      of non-invasive electrical stimulation of the upper airway dilator muscles in obstructive
      sleep apnoea patients over time and evaluate the control of symptoms and improvement in
      quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea is highly prevalent, with the obesity epidemic relentlessly
      increasing the problem. The best treatment for uncomplicated and moderate-severe OSA remains
      CPAP therapy. However, long-term adherence to treatment with CPAP is poor and there are few
      alternatives. Electrical stimulation of the dilator muscles of the upper airway has been
      shown to reduce nocturnal apnoeas significantly using an invasive approach, hypoglossal nerve
      stimulation, as well as by non-invasive transcutaneous stimulation. Although non-invasive
      transcutaneous stimulation may not be as effective as CPAP therapy in many OSA patients it
      could be an important option to treat some of the large number of patients who fail CPAP and
      might also be of use in those whose OSA is not judged sufficiently severe to warrant CPAP.

      The investigators propose a study to use a transcutaneous electrical stimulation device in
      selected patients with OSA who do not tolerate CPAP therapy following assessment of the upper
      airway. Participants will be treated over a period of 3-months in the community and the
      results will be compared against usual care, ongoing CPAP therapy. This study will help to
      prepare a definitive multi-centre randomized controlled trial using the non-invasive method
      of upper airway stimulation in OSA.

      The primary aim of this study is to assess efficacy and generate an accurate sample size
      estimation, test the subjective willingness of patients to use and objectively determined
      compliance with the treatment over a long period, as well as to specify the drop-out rate.
      The improvement in sleep apnoea will be the primary outcome measures. The symptomatic
      response, feasibility of the method, including compliance, comfort, adverse events, will be
      the secondary outcome measure.

    <description>The group of participants receiving continuous transcutaneous electrical stimulation will be trained on the device and settings will be recorded. The device is kept on all night and in the morning taken off with the hydrogel and disconnected. Weekly phone calls and follow up visits at 6- and 12-weeks will be organized. At each visit comfort, compliance and adverse reactions will be recorded. At 12-weeks, the patients will be invited for a repeat assessment including polysomnography during a night of electrical stimulation. Usage time of the device will be discussed with the patients and recorded.</description>

    <description>Participants who will be randomized to the usual care group will be given their own CPAP device, as previously prescribed. Weekly phone calls and follow up visits at 6- and 12-weeks will be organized. At the last visit, the patients will be studied during a repeat inpatient polysomnography and the initial assessment will be repeated.</description>

    <description>The device needs to be started by pressing the 'on' button. Once the device is turned on the current intensity can be increased by pushing the '+' button and lowered by pushing the '-' button. When a comfortable skin sensation is felt the patients should press the '-' button once more. At that time the device stimulates with a low current which is not felt but provides a neuromuscular tone to the muscles whilst asleep. The device is kept on all night and in the morning taken off with the hydrogel and disconnected. Once disconnected it should be turned off by pressing the 'off' button. The device should then be placed on the provided wireless charger so that it is fully charged again for the next night.</description>
