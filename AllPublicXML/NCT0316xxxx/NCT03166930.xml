  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the impacts of two different methods of managing MS-related
      spasticity of the lower limbs. Both interventions will be presented as group classes
      consisting of exercises to reduce spasticity. One program consists of stretching exercises,
      while the other consists primarily of range-of-motion and strengthening exercises.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomized to receive one of two exercise programs. The intervention group will receive &quot;Spasticity Take Control,&quot; which will consist of a stretching program designed by the principal investigator. The other group will receive an exercise program based on usual care, which will consist of exercises taken from the National MS Society brochure, &quot;Stretching for People with MS: An Illustrated Manual.&quot; Participants will not be masked regarding which group they are in, but they will not be told which group is considered standard of care and which is the intervention.</intervention_model_description>
