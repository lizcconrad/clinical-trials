  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The controversy surrounding epithelioid hemangioma diagnosis stems from its somewhat
      aggressive clinical characteristics, including multifocal presentation and occasional lymph
      node involvement.

      The investigators reviewed the clinicopathologic and radiologic characteristics of bone and
      soft tissue epithelioid hemangioma in patients treated at our institution with available
      tissue for molecular testing.

      The hypothesis is that epithelioid hemangioma may present with multifocal involvement and
      rare loco-regional lymph node metastasis, but it remains a benign tumor with excellent
      prognosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators retrospectively reviewed patients treated for epithelioid hemangioma of the
      bone and soft tissue in a single insitution. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      pathological, clinical, and radiological characteristics of epithelioid hemangioma arising
      within bone and soft tissue, in the first cohort of cases where the definitive diagnosis is
      supplemented by molecular techniques.

      The hypothesis is that the improved knowledge regarding this rare entity can more
      definitively elucidate the benign biology of epithelioid hemangioma.
