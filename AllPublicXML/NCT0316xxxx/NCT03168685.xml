      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility and user experience of a smart phone app
      for people with medical conditions, used in conjunction with an ActiGraph wearable device and
      a connected scale.

      HITLAB will conduct a segmented rapid user acceptance study (&quot;rapid UX study&quot;) of a smart
      phone app and an actigraphy device with a connected scale. During the first segment, of one
      month's duration, subjects will use the app, actigraphy device, and scale. Next, over an
      interphase period of up to 6 weeks, subjects will only use the app. During this time, the app
      will be modified based on data collected during the first segment. Finally, during the second
      period, also of one month's duration, subjects will use the modified app, actigraphy device,
      and scale.

    <description>Eligible patients who choose to participate in the study will be asked to wear an actigraphy device [ActiGraph GT9X Link &quot;Actigraph Link&quot;] on their wrist continuously during both 4-week study phases.
The ActiGraph Link is a small (3.5 X 3.5 X 1 cm) wristwatch like device weighing approximately 14 grams that measures indicators of the wearer's activity and sleep patterns, including: acceleration, energy expenditure, steps, basal metabolic rate, activity intensity, sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and body position.
The application being utilized is SureSource Engage application from Clinical Ink. The application is compatible to most Android and iOS devices.
Participants will also use a basic Bluetooth-enabled weight scale that syncs with the application.</description>
