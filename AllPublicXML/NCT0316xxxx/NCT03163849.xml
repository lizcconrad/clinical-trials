    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C virus infection affects an estimated one hundred and seventy million
      people around the world with and approximate prevalence 0.2-2 % in the United State of
      America and European countries.

    <textblock>
      In Egypt, Chronic hepatitis C virus is a serious health problem where Chronic hepatitis C
      virus prevalence is very high.

      Chronic Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is associated with a high risk for liver-related
      mortality because of a variety of complications, which appear obviously in those patients
      with developing end-stage liver disease, including decompensated liver cirrhosis and
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Egypt had the highest burden of deaths from Chronic hepatitis C
      virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma in the Arab world, around sixty three percentage of
      all Chronic hepatitis C virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma deaths happened in Egypt.

      Poor response rates and poor tolerability were observed during treatment of chronic Chronic
      hepatitis C virus infection with pegylated interferon and ribavirin.

      Because Chronic hepatitis C virus does not incorporate into the human genome and must
      replicate to maintain infection, it should be potential to destroy the virus completely by
      blocking replication at one or more stages of the life cycle.

      In recent years, there has been a shift in treatment paradigm with the discovery and approval
      of agents that target specific proteins vital for hepatitis C replication. The Non Structural
      3/4A inhibitors simeprevir and paritaprevir, the NonStructural 5A inhibitors ombitasvir,
      ledipasvir, and daclatasvir, and the Non Structural 5B inhibitors sofosbuvir and dasabuvir
      have been approved and incorporated as first-line agents into the latest guidelines for
      Hepatitis C treatment. Used in combination, these agents produce higher rates of sustained
      virologic response and less adverse effects than historical options, along with limited rates
      of resistance.

      In previous studies ,haematological side effect of interferon and Ribavirin was reported in
      the form of reduction in Haemoglobin ,White Blood Cells and asymptomatic thrombocytopenia
      While SOF based combination therapy improved the liver function, anemia ,leucopenia and
      thrombocytopenia were detected especially after treatment with SOF,RBV and PegINF alpha .also
      significant reduction in the percentage of CD3 CD4 ,CD3 CD8 Cells post treatment with either
      SOF and RBV or SOF ,RBV and INF were detected as compaired to baseline In our study we will
      assess and evaluate many immunological and hematological findings upon new direct acting
      antiviral agents in Egyptian chronic hepatitis C virus patients
