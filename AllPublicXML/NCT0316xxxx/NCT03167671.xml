  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AposTherapy is a home based exercise program utilizing footwear that causes exercise with
      normal activity that may significantly improve function in patients with back pain since
      patients with back pain have altered mechanics of motion contributing or due to the presence
      of the conditions. Capitalizing on the reported excellent adherence and clinical benefit of
      ApostTherapy in patients with significant knee and back pain, we propose to evaluate this as
      a conservative treatment that may supplant/supplement traditional pain medications and
      physical therapy in an at-risk urban inner city population.

      AposTherapy® is a home-based exercise program utilizing footwear that causes exercise with
      normal daily activity that may significantly improve function in patients with back pain in
      general, and specifically Axial Low Back Pain (NSLBP). Capitalizing on the reported excellent
      adherence and clinical benefit of Apos Therapy in patients with significant back pain, we
      propose to evaluate this as a conservative treatment that may supplant/supplement traditional
      pain medications and physical therapy in NSLBP population.

      A possible potential use of AposTherapy® as a replacement for traditional physical therapy
      may yield a less costly, more effective therapy with better adherence. Problems with
      traditional therapy include poor patient adherence to both outpatient and home therapy
      programs, the added cost of travel (which may be more than $100 per session for ambulette or
      access-a-ride for eligible patients), and the lack of continuation in an ongoing exercise
      program[6-8], all of which can lead to relapse and need for retreatment. Additionally, access
      to physical therapy is limited for many patients since there are not enough available
      outpatient therapy services to meet the needs of all patients. Finding an alternative
      exercise program that will increase adherence, decrease total therapy visits, and improve
      patient's outcomes with decreased dependence on pain medications is a high priority from both
      patient care and cost management perspectives.

      AposTherapy® potentially overcomes many of these issues by improving/modifying abnormal
      biomechanics (therefore decreasing pain), and providing an independent home-based exercise
      program utilizing footwear that causes exercise with normal activity by promoting
      perturbation. This biomechanical approach may significantly reduce pain and improve function
      in patients with nonspecific low back pain (NSLBP). Capitalizing on the reported excellent
      adherence and clinical benefit of AposTherapy® in patients with significant NSLBP, we propose
      to evaluate the biomechanical exercise (wearing an appropriately calibrated shoe at home for
      a prescribed amount of time each day) as a conservative treatment that may supplement or
      supplant traditional pain medications, interventional pain procedures and physical therapy in
      an at-risk urban inner city population with NSLBP.
