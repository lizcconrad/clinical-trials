  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety, tolerability, PK and PD profile of AUT00206 after
      repeated doses in patients with stable but symptomatic schizophrenia, taking one or two
      established anti-psychotic drugs. The subjects will undergo brain imaging, tests of cognition
      and tests of auditory function and electrophysiological measures in addition to routine
      safety monitoring. Because of the pioneering and novel mechanism of action of this drug, a
      key objective is to characterize this range of biomarkers which will inform the future
      development of the drug.
