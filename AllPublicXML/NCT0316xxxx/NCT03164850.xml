  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During laparoscopic surgery, video camera becomes a surgeon's eyes since the surgeon uses
      image from the video camera positioned inside the patient's body to perform the procedure.
      The greatest limitation is the impairment or complete lack of tactile sensation normally used
      to assist in surgical dissection and decision making. The Investigator proposes to develop a
      tactile sensing system, Laparoscopic Tactile Imager (LTI), to be used in urogynecological
      laparoscopic surgery for tactile imaging and tissue characterization (elasticity, structure,
      boundaries, blood vessel detection) which will be imposed on the video image at area of
      interest in real time.

      For this study, the investigator identified the sacrocolpopexy as the target procedure for
      the evaluation of LTI. In the cases of sacrocolpopexy, often performed in conjunction with a
      hysterectomy, one of the most frustrating elements is the lack of tactile feedback at the
      level of the sacral promontory. The surgeon needs to open up the peritoneum and dissect the
      underlying tissue to expose the sacral bony structures and ligament without injury to the
      surrounding bowel, ureter or vascular structures. Sometimes, the sacral promontory is covered
      with a fat pad which makes it difficult to visualize the promontory and the &quot;safe&quot; space
      below the aorta and between the iliac arteries/veins is difficult to discern. A difference
      that is very easy to appreciate with an open procedure where one can easily palpate through
      the fatty tissues. That step is very critical for the repair and has the greatest potential
      for catastrophic error without tactile sensation. Because of the reproducibility of the
      surgical technique and target anatomy for this portion of the procedure, it was thought the
      sacral promontory dissection to identify and clear the anterior longitudinal ligament would
      be appropriate surgical procedure to evaluate the use of LTI.

        Adult female subjects volunteers, scheduled for a pelvic floor surgery will be considered
        to be enrolled in the pilot clinical study. Conditions precluding patients from
        participation are listed in the study exclusion below ( Eligibility Criteria) criteria. No
        patients will be excluded on the basis of age or race. Women younger the age 21 will not be
        included due to the very low probability of pelvic floor diseased condition in the age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active cancer of the colon, rectum wall, cervix, vaginal, uterus or bladder;

          2. Ongoing or prior radiation therapy for abdominal or pelvic cancer;
