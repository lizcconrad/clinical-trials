  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Plantar heel pain (PHP)&quot; or &quot;plantar fasciitis&quot; is one of the major foot problems which can
      occur in any age group. It is a common encountered musculoskeletal problem that can cause
      disability, activity limitation, discomfort, and affect quality of life. It involves pain and
      inflammation of the plantar fascia, which runs across bottom of the foot and connects heel
      bone to toes. PHP frequently found in active workers aged between 25 and 65 years with the
      highest incidence in people aged between 40 and 60 years.

      However, very few studies investigated the alterations of the multisegmental foot motions and
      muscle functions in patients with PHP. To prescribe the relevant program of treatment and
      reduce risk of symptoms chronicity, it is necessary to have in-depth understanding of
      changing mechanisms in patients with PHP. To explain how the symptoms occur in patients with
      PHP, foot function is another aspect that should be determined. One of the popular
      questionnaires determining foot function is the Foot Function Index (FFI) questionnaire. It
      has been proved to have a good reliability and validity and has been translated into several
      languages. To be able to use the international standard questionnaire, it is necessary to
      translate the FFI into Thai. This can be implemented in Thailand and be able to compare the
      findings of interventional effect internationally. In addition, very few studies reported the
      effectiveness of the treatment program for patients with PHP. Among previous evidences, the
      controversial findings existed. Thus, the intervention program should be evaluated for
      obtaining the effective treatment for this population.

      Procedure

      Each participant will attend data collection on a single occasion and allocate into the
      healthy or patients with PHP with the selection criteria before enrollment. They will dress
      with short pants which researcher prepare. Before testing, the NORAXON TeleMyo Receiver will
      be synchronized with the forceplate and video. The real time signal of motion, EMG, and force
      data will simultaneously synchronize and present on the screen.

      EMG preparation

      The skin will be prepared over the sites for electrode placements by shaving, lightly
      abrading, and cleaning with 70% alcohol prior to electrode application. The electrodes will
      place 20 mm center to center interelectrode space over site in each muscle. Interelectrode
      impedance is less than 10 kilo ohm. The elastic adhesive tape is used to fixed electrodes to
      control movement artifacts. Participants will perform reference contractions to check the
      electrodes placement and cross-talk between EMG signals from different muscles prior to data
      collection.

      EMG placement

      Muscle activation will be measured by an electromyography (TeleMyo DTS Telemetry, NORAXON USA
      Inc.) at sampling frequency of 1000 Hz in order to quantify dynamic muscle function of lower
      extremity. Surface electrodes will be placed according to recommendations of the European
      Recommendations for Surface Electromyography (SENIAM). Pairs of wet-gelled bipolar Ag-AgCl
      Dual surface electrodes (Ag/AgCl NORAXON Dual electrodes 20 mm spacing) are selected for
      surface EMG sensor. The location and orientation of electrode placements are localized in
      supine position by same researcher. Electrode will be placed on Peroneus longus (PL) which
      will be placed at 1/4 on the line between the tip of the fibular and tip of the lateral
      malleolus. Tibialis anterior (TA) electrode will be placed at 1/3 on the line between the tip
      of the fibular and tip of the medial malleolus. Gastrocnemius medial head (GM) and
      Gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) electrodes will be placed on the largest bulb of the muscle at
      medial head. All exactly position of the muscles will confirm by their actions.

      Maximum Voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) test

      Participants perform 5 seconds MVIC against manual resistance in each of the muscle for 3
      times. The PL and TA will be assessed in supine lying position and gastrocnemius will be
      assessed in standing position. Participants will perform the action of each muscle against
      manual resistance from researcher and equipment. The peak amplitude of EMG signal in each
      trial will be selected and will be averaged from 3 second over the EMG. The peak mean
      amplitude of the 3 trials for each muscle will be used for normalization.

      Anthropometric data assessment

      Anthropometric data will be obtained from each subject for calculating the kinematic and
      kinetic data. It includes body height, body weight, leg length, and joint widths of the knee
      and ankle. Leg length is the distance between anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and medial
      malleolus. The knee width is the distance between medial and lateral condyles across the knee
      joint. The ankle width is the distance between medial and lateral malleoli.

      Marker placement

      The lower body markers of Plug in Gait will be used in the study to observe lower extremity
      motion data during walking. The model consists of left and right anterior superior iliac
      crests, left and right posterior superior iliac crests, left and right knees, left and right
      thighs, left and right ankles, left and right tibias, left and right toes, left and right
      heels. Right back marker will be used for the markers auto-label process in order to
      discriminate the left or the right.

      Foot model

      The markers will be placed on foot bony prominence following the Oxford Foot Model to obtain
      multisegmental foot motion during walking. The Oxford Foot Model have been used in previous
      studies to determine the multisegmental foot motion (35, 36) and proved to be validate and
      reliable (35, 36).

      To define the forefoot segment, markers will be placed on the most distal, medial aspect of
      first metatarsal shaft, the most proximal and distal lateral aspects of fifth metatarsal
      shaft, and midway between second and third metatarsal heads. For the rearfoot segment,
      markers will be placed on sustentaculum tali, lateral calcaneus, heel (distal part of the
      calcaneus), posterior proximal calcaneus and a peg marker will be placed on posterior
      calcaneus between heel and proximal calcaneus markers. For the tibial segment, markers will
      be placed on medial malleolus, lateral malleolus, anterior aspect of tibial crest, tibial
      tuberosity and head of fibula.

      Prior to compare the foot and ankle kinematic data between patients with PHP and normal
      healthy, repeatability of data will be assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)
      values among trials of walking for ensure the data can be acceptable, especially in the
      pathologic condition of foot as PHP.

      Gait measurement

      Participants will walk on the 8-meters walkway until they familiar with the environment of
      laboratory. Then, gait data will be collected for 3 success trials at their comfortable
      speed. Motion data will be collected at 100 Hz and will be filtered by using the Butterworth
      filtering technique at 5 Hz. Averaged data of EMG and motion from 3 trials will be used for
      further analysis.
