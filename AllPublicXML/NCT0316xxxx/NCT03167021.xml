  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this survey will be to evaluate the perception by the students (except for
      medical students, pharmacies) of community pharmacists concerning the management of cannabis
      consumption. We want to see if the student population perceives the pharmacist as the public
      health actor of choice, and if they would more easily turn to him or to another health
      professional (doctor, nurse) in case they need. Discussing possible problematic consumption
      or for a simple search for information. It will be assessed whether the pharmacist seems to
      be a good candidate and an element of choice when young adults want to take an intelligence
      approach to cannabis consumption.
