  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative anxiety is often described as an uncomfortable, tense unpleasant mood before
      surgery, an emotional response to a potential challenge or threat to reality. Data show that
      adult patients with preoperative anxiety rate of 30-40%. The main reason for the occurrence
      of patients for surgery, anesthesia and other factors of fear. Preoperative anxiety itself is
      not a mental illness, but studies have confirmed that the occurrence of preoperative anxiety
      and postoperative complications were positively correlated, and the existence of preoperative
      anxiety in patients with conventional postoperative analgesic effect is poor. At present,
      there are still few studies on the relationship between preoperative anxiety and
      postoperative complications and analgesia. At the same time, there is a lack of large sample
      size to study the incidence of preoperative anxiety and its related predictors.

      Surgical patients often have varying degrees of preoperative anxiety.The aim of this study
      was to determine the incidence of preoperative anxiety and related predictors, and to
      evaluate the effect of anxiety on anesthesia and postoperative pain and prognosis. The study
      also showed that prostaglandin, catecholamines, cortex Effects of alcohol and inflammatory
      cell level on postoperative pain in patients with preoperative anxiety.
