      Adverse cutaneous drug reactions are undesirable and typically unanticipated reactions
      independent of the intended therapeutic purpose of a medication. It may be either immunologic
      (eg, drug allergy) or non-immunologic. Adverse cutaneous drug reaction produce a wide range
      of clinical manifestations such as pruritus, maculopapular eruptions, urticaria, angioedema,
      phototoxic and photo allergic reactions, fixed drug reactions, erythema
      multiforme,vesiculobullous reactions (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal
      necrolysis) and serum sickness .They must be considered in the differential diagnosis of
      sudden symmetric eruption

      Erythema multiforme is an acute immune mediated disorder It is a type IV hypersensitivity
      reaction leading to dermal vasculitis. Erythema multiforme major usually as a result of
      medications such as sulphonamides, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and penicillin and there
      is skin and mucosal involvement.

      Steven-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) are considered a spectrum
      of acute life-threatening mucocutaneous reactions that differ only in severity. Both diseases
      are characterized by mucous membrane and skin involvement, are often caused by medications
      and are collectively known as epidermal necrolysis or scalded skin syndrome.Stevens-Johnson
      syndrome (SJS) is classified as an epidermal loss &lt;10% of the body surface area.Toxic
      Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) is indicated by &gt;30% body surface area erosion. The range of
      epidermal loss between 10% and 30% is called Stevens-Johnson syndrome-Toxic Epidermal
      Necrolysis (SJS-TEN) overlap. Severity of illness score [Score of Toxic Epidermal
      Necrolysis(TEN) ] has been devised to predict prognosis in patients with Epidermal
      Necrolysis.This scoring system addresses 7 prognostic factors: age, malignancy, heart
      rate,Body Surface Area involved, serum urea, serum glucose and serum bicarbonate levels.

      Interleukin-21 regulates both innate and adaptive immune responses and it is not only has key
      roles in antitumour and antiviral responses that promote the development of autoimmune
      diseases and inflammatory disorders. It is recently discovered member of the type 1 cytokine
      family which is produced by activated clusters of differentiation 4+ T cells ,Natural killer
      cells and follicular helper T cells.
