    <textblock>
      Chiauranib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking Aurora kinase B（Aurora
      B）、VEGFR/PDGFR/c-Kit、CSF-1R targets. This clinical trial is studying the efficacy and safety
      of chiauranib(50mg，QD，PO) works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory ovarian
      cancer, in the meantime, exploring the latent biomarkers accompany with chiauranib, as well
      as the relevancy of which and clinical benefit.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety include adverse events, vital
      signs, laboratory tests ,etc., of Chiauranib in ovarian cancer patients due to the outcomes
      of the phase I study, and to explore the relevance between the latent biomarkers of
      Chiauranib and clinical benefit.
