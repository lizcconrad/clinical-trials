  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT) is a glaucoma treatment that has been shown to
      effectively lower intraocular pressure by increasing aqueous outflow through macrophage
      recruitment. There is evidence of increased drainage in the nasal quadrants of the eye. This
      study aims to compare whether there is a difference in the reduction of eye pressure when SLT
      is performed nasally and temporally.

    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate if there is a difference between 180 degree nasal and temporal
      selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) in treatment outcomes. It is known that there is
      increased aqueous collectors and veins and thus aqueous drainage in the nasal quadrants of
      the eye. If SLT works by the hypothesized biologic mechanism in which macrophages remodel the
      aqueous drainage system to increase outflow, performing SLT in an area concentrated with
      aqueous veins may increase outflow more. As a result, we hypothesize that nasal 180 degree
      SLT may have better outcomes compared to the temporal counterpart. The results of this study
      may help inform decisions when performing 180 degree SLT and provide insight to SLT's
      mechanism of action. The primary objective of this study is to determine if there is a
      difference in treatment efficacy between nasal and temporal 180 degree SLT by measuring
      differences in baseline and post-operative intraocular pressures. We hypothesize that nasal
      SLT will have superior outcomes compared to temporal SLT due to increased number of aqueous
      veins.

        The patients will be recruited from the glaucoma practice at St. Joseph's Healthcare
        Hamilton. A baseline clinical eye examination will be completed to include or exclude the
        participant from the study according to the criteria below. The baseline exam will include
        a comprehensive questionnaire of the participant's past ocular history, relevant systemic
        diseases, glaucoma risk factors, and surgical history.
