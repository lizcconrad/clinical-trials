  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of various dose
      schedules of GSK Biologicals' candidate malaria vaccines RTS,S/AS01B (adult formulation) and
      RTS,S/AS01E (pediatric formulation) in healthy malaria-naïve subjects aged 18-55 years. The
      purpose of this study is to investigate whether changes in dosing schedule are associated
      with increased or equivalent protection, and to evaluate the immune mechanisms associated
      with vaccine efficacy under varying dosing schedules.

      Protocol Amendment 1 incorporated: additional blood sampling for assessment of parasitemia
      (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] testing); clarification that blood samples for both PBMC and
      plasma will be collected for repository storage; revision of volume of whole blood samples to
      be taken for parasitemia assessment; clarification that urine pregnancy tests will be
      conducted for all females and not just those of childbearing potential; deletion of visit at
      Day 1 post day of challenge; clarification that RNA sequencing and not deep sequencing will
      be performed in this study.

    <description>Mosquitoes infected approximately 2-3 weeks earlier that are likely to contain sporozoites in their salivary glands will be allowed to feed on the subjects. For each subject, five mosquitoes will be allowed to feed over five minutes, after which they will be dissected to confirm how many were infected, and the salivary glands scored. If required additional mosquitoes will be allowed to feed until a total of five infected mosquitoes with a minimum of 2+ salivary gland scores have fed.
The challenge occurs approximately 90 days (three months) after the last vaccination.
Subjects will be monitored during 28 days after having bitten by mosquitoes and when parasites are found in their blood, they will be treated with appropriate anti-malarial drugs.</description>
