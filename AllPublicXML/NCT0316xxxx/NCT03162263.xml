  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of neurorobotic devices into gait rehabilitative programs, including Ekso, is
      reported to increase the engagement and motivation of the patients while actively performing
      a task, and to shape the sensory-motor plasticity (SMP) and its balance between the primary
      motor areas (M1), and the fronto-parietal network (FPN) connectivity, thus contributing to
      successful gait rehabilitation. Aim of our study was to assess whether Ekso would foster the
      recovery of deteriorated FPN connectivity and SMP patterns involved in limb coordination
      during walking in a sample of patients with hemiparesis due to stroke.

      Twenty outpatients were consecutively included in this study according to the following
      inclusion criteria: (i) age ≥55 years; (ii) a first-ever ischemic supra-tentorial stroke
      (confirmed by MRI scan) at least 6 months before their enrollment; (iii) an unilateral
      hemiparesis, with a Muscle Research Council -MCR- score ≤3; (iv) ability to follow verbal
      instructions, with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) &gt;24; (v) a Modified Ashworth Scale
      (MAS) score ≤2; (vi) no severe bone or joint disease; and (vii) no history of concomitant
      neurodegenerative diseases or brain surgery.

      Patients were randomly assigned to the experimental (Ekso gait training -EGT) of control
      group (conventional overground gait training -OGT- at a velocity matched to the Ekso gait
      training).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ekso (Ekso Bionics; Richmond -CA- USA) is a wearable robot consisting of an exoskeleton
      framework for the lower limbs with (1) electric motors to power movement for the hip and knee
      joints, (2) passive spring-loaded ankle joints, (3) foot plates on which the user stands, and
      (4) a backpack that houses a computer, battery supply, and wired controller. A rigid backpack
      is an integral structural component of the exoskeleton, which provides support from the
      posterior pelvis to the upper back, besides carrying the computer and batteries. The
      exoskeleton attaches to the user's body with straps over the dorsum of the foot, anterior
      shin and thigh, abdomen, and anterior shoulders. The limb and pelvic segments are adjustable
      to the user's leg and thigh length, and the segment across the pelvis is adjustable for hip
      width and hip abduction angle. We preliminarily measured M1-leg excitability and SMI, which
      were probed using TMS pulses with a monophasic pulse configuration and peripheral nerve
      electric stimuli. Single magnetic pulses were given to the affected and unaffected leg-M1
      using a standard figure-of-eight coil (diameter of each wing, 90 mm) connected with a
      high-power Magstim200 stimulator (Magstim Co, Ltd; UK).

      Effective connectivity (that measures the causal influence that one brain area exerts over
      another under the assumption of a given mechanistic model) was assessed using a structural
      equation modelling (SEM). An 8-channel wireless surface EMG (sEMG) device (BTS; Milan, Italy)
      was used to record EMG activity from eight muscles (both tibialis anterior -TA-, soleus -S-,
      rectus femoris -RF-, and biceps femoris -BF). The device was also equipped with an
      accelerometer, put at lumbar level, to establish gait phases. Gait analysis was conducted on
      a 10-meter walkway.

      We measured the following gait measures for both the affected and unaffected lower limb [20]:
      (i) step cadence (number of steps per minute; normal values 1.9±0.1 Hz);. (ii) gait cycle
      duration (time from one right heel strike -initial contact- to the next one -end of terminal
      swing; normal values 1.1±0.1 sec); (iii) stance/swing ratio (ratio between stance from heel
      strike to toe-off, and swing phase duration from toe-off to heel strike; normal values
      1.5±0.1); .and (iv) an overall gait performance score (gait index, reflecting an approximate
      60:40% distribution of stance:swing phases; normal values &gt;90).

    <description>All patients underwent twenty-four Ekso sessions, scheduled 3 times a week. Each session lasted about 1h, and included transferring into the device arranged on an office chair; donning, standing, walking, sitting, doffing; and transferring out of the exoskeleton.The user can stand up, sit down, and walk with help of a front-wheeled walker and with the exoskeleton attached to a ceiling rail tether. A physical therapist initially provides assistance to maintain the user's center of mass over the base of support to prevent falling.</description>
