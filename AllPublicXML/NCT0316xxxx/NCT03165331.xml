  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A visible difference can have a profound impact in a society with a massive emphasis on
      appearance and &quot;looks&quot;. A vulnerable group is adolescents with a condition affecting their
      appearance as a result of injuries (burns, accidents), treatment (cancer), skin conditions or
      congenital anomalies (birthmarks, craniofacial conditions). Research has identified potential
      psychological difficulties, which, if not addressed, can lead to anxiety, depression, and
      eating disorders.

      In addition to medical treatment options, aiming at diminishing a difference that may be
      visible to others, young people with appearance concerns also need self-management skills.
      However, evidence-based interventions are scarce and specialised psychological treatment is
      difficult to reach.

      The Centre for Appearance Research (Bristol, UK) has developed an online intervention for
      adolescents, now translated into Norwegian (www.ungfaceit.no). UNG Face IT provides easy
      access to specialist advice and support via a home computer, using information, videos, and
      interactive activities. It provides advice, teaches coping and social skills, strengthening
      psychological adjustment to a visible difference.

      A systematic evaluation of the Norwegian version is needed. UNG Face IT could potentially
      address unmet needs, provide a cost-effective tool to reduce the need for &quot;face-to-face&quot;
      psychological and surgical/medical services, and contribute to make online health care
      available for young people with a visible difference.
