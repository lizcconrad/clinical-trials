      The goals of this research are to understand adherence and retention in care for multi-and
      extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (M/XDR-TB) patients using a mixed methods approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide among people
      living with HIV. Globally, incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and
      extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), the most drug-resistant forms of TB, has
      approximately doubled over the past fifteen years. Nowhere has this increased incidence
      generated more concern than in South Africa where interactions between TB and generalized HIV
      epidemics are causing 'explosive' TB incidence and case-fatality threatening to undermine the
      progress reached with antiretroviral therapy (ART).

      Medication adherence, a key predictor of outcomes in multi-and extensively drug-resistant
      tuberculosis (M/XDR-TB) and HIV treatment, is understudied in high burden TB/HIV settings.
      Patient losses during transitions in the care continuum are frequent, increase mortality and
      limit control of the linked epidemics. Demands of M/XDR-TB HIV treatment are severe including
      extraordinary pill burden, severe adverse effects, lengthy treatment, isolation and stigma
      with few parallels in modern medicine.

      This is a prospective observational cohort study for patients newly diagnosed with M/XDR-TB
      initiating treatment. A mixed method approach will be employed to address the complex
      research questions of distilling determinants of barriers and facilitators to both TB
      medications and ART; this study will employ complementary qualitative and quantitative
      methodologies for assessing differential adherence to TB medications and ART.

      A sub-set of patients and health care workers will be approached for participation in focus
      group discussions.

    <description>Barriers and facilitators to medication adherence and retention in care for M/XDR-TB HIV patients will be identified through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with patients and health care workers. To identify sociomedical risk factors associated with six-month adherence to ART or TB medications we will first identified risk factors associated with adherence in bivariate analysis and then multiple logistic regression models will be constructed including variables which are statistically significant and/or associated with &gt;10% change in effect measure.</description>

        Adult patients with newly diagnosed active pulmonary multi- and extremely-drug resistance
        tuberculosis (M/XDR-TB) (≥ 18 years old), admitted for routine care at King DinuZulu
        Hospital in Durban, South Africa will be approached for enrollment. Only patients with
        capacity for consent will be included in the study. Healthcare workers will be approached
        for participation in focus group discussions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years

          2. Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB) culture positive with at least isoniazid and
             rifampicin resistance OR

             Molecular drug susceptibility test confirming resistance to at least isoniazid and
             rifampicin OR

             Polymerase chain reaction test (GeneXpert MTB/RIF) result showing MTB positive and RIF
             resistance. Patients enrolled with only a GeneXpert MTB/RIF result will be withdrawn
             if their subsequent susceptibility test or molecular drug susceptibility test reveals
             rifampicin monoresistance.

          3. Initiating treatment for M/XDR-TB which includes at least 2 new medications

          4. Have capacity for informed consent

          5. HIV Positive Patients: on antiretroviral therapy (ART) or initiating ART within the
             following 4 weeks as per clinician recommendation
