    <textblock>
      The Bidirectional Cortical Neuroprosthetic System (BiCNS) consists of NeuroPort
      Microelectrode Array Systems and NeuroPort Electrodes (Sputtered Iridium Oxide Film), Patient
      Pedestals, the NeuroPort BioPotential Signal Processing System, and the CereStim C96
      Programmable Stimulator. The goals of this early feasibility study consist of safety and
      efficacy evaluations of this device.

    <textblock>
      This proposed early feasibility, investigator-initiated study is led by Dr. Pablo A. Celnik,
      M.D. at Johns Hopkins Medicine (JHM). The Bidirectional Cortical Neuroprosthetic System
      (BiCNS) consists of modified versions of 510(k) cleared NeuroPort Electrode Array Systems
      (Blackrock Microsystems, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) as well as a neurostimulator module
      (CereStim R96) for long term neural recording and intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of
      the brain. The BiCNS is termed bidirectional because it permits both the recording of
      information from the brain for controlling an end effector device, as well as enabling
      information regarding that end effector to be returned to the brain in the form of ICMS. &quot;End
      effector&quot; in this sense is used to mean a physical or virtual device designed to interact
      with its (physical or virtual) environment. Electrode arrays will be implanted in the brain
      in pairs, with a pair comprising a recording array and a stimulating array. A total of six
      NeuroPort arrays, consisting of three array pairs, will be implanted in each study
      participant. Each pair will consist of an array implanted in primary motor cortex (M1) for
      recording and an array implanted in primary sensory cortex (S1) for stimulation and/or
      recording; both arrays in each pair will be connected to a single percutaneous pedestal as an
      external interface. In each participant, two such array pairs will be implanted in the
      hand/arm area of M1 and S1 in the dominant brain hemisphere (e.g., the left hemisphere for a
      right-handed individual). A third pair will be implanted in the hand/arm area of M1 and S1 in
      non-dominant hemisphere (e.g. right hemisphere for a right handed-individual). The recording
      arrays implanted in M1 are the NeuroPort microelectrode arrays with platinum (Pt) tips
      (K070272), whereas the ICMS arrays implanted in S1 are NeuroPort microelectrode arrays with
      Sputtered Iridium-Oxide Film (SIROF) tips (K110010). The study has Investigational Device
      Exemption (IDE) approval from FDA to implant these devices for 52 weeks (plus/minus 2 weeks).

    <measure>Safety of BiCNS: The device is not explanted during 52-week study</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be considered successful if the device is not explanted during the 52-week period. Explantation of the device prior to the 52-week study period implies that the device is putting the subject at risk (e.g. through a serious infection at implantation site) and therefore must be removed.</description>

    <measure>Sensory feedback: the participants can perceive environmental information through delivery of intracortical microstimulation (ICMS).</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Intracortical microstimulation will be delivered to participants through the BiCNS device. The effect of ICMS will be measured based on participants' verbal reporting of what the stimuli feel like (quality of percepts) and where they appear to be coming from (location of percepts).</description>
