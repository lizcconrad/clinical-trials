  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, the emergence of biotherapies has allowed the use of intra-articular injections of
      autologous plasma rich platelet (PRP). Their use is widespread since 2010 and is based on the
      demonstration that platelets-enriched plasma, by virtue of its growth factors concentration,
      stimulates in vitro and in vivo cartilage regeneration in preclinical models. Recent
      literature highlights that these autologous products are very well tolerated by humans. PRP,
      as an intra-articular injection therapy, seems to be an autologous biological medicine,
      innovative for cartilage injury reparation and showing good primary results for this
      indication.

      Adipose tissue contains stromal-vascular fraction (SVF), in which are located a large
      proportion of mesenchymal multipotent stem cells (Adipose-derived stem cells, ADSCs) able to
      differentiate into several cellular lines in vitro and in vivo, including cartilage cells.

      The association of microfat and PRP is interesting in order to potentiate trophic and
      regenerative effects on damaged cartilage site. The combination of these two products,
      respectively rich in autologous multipotent stem cells and growth factors, aims to create an
      optimal environment for cartilage cells regeneration. Furthermore, microfat semi solid phase
      is playing the role of a nutritive support matrix which contains and limits the diffusion and
      resorption of PRP liquid while allowing progressive growth factors release on the injection
      site.

      The hypothesis of this project is that standardized injection of an innovative treatment
      (microfat and autologous PRP) should allow delay the use of invasive surgical therapy in the
      treatment of wrist osteoarthritis. This minimally invasive treatment could provide a curative
      second line treatment in case of medical treatment failure.

      Material and methods:

      This research protocol aims to evaluate the safety of intra-articular injection of a mixture
      of autologous microfat associated with autologous PRP for radiocarpal osteoarthritis
      resistant to medical treatment.

      This is a prospective, longitudinal, intrasubject, single-center clinical trial phase I-IIa
      evaluating the safety and feasibility of this innovative treatment.

      Twelve patients will receive an intra-articular injection of 4 ml of an homogeneous mixture
      of autologous PRP (2ml) and microfat (2ml).
