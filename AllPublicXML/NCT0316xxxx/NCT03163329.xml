  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous trials have shown that TAVR was a noninferior alternative to surgery in patients
      with severe aortic stenosis at intermediate surgical risk. However, patients with congenital
      bicuspid valve have been excluded in those trials. The purpose of this trial is to determine
      the safety and effectiveness of TAVR in intermediate-risk patients with bicuspid aortic valve
      stenosis.
