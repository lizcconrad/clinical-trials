  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prospective study set forth to test Thai version CPOT and BPS for validity, reliability,
      and practicality. After translation, both pain scales were tested for concurrent validity,
      discriminant validity, criterion validity, and inter-rater reliability in patients who were
      intubated during the postoperative period. Opinions regarding practicality were elicited via
      questionnaires from nurses who had been using and were familiar with these two pain scales.
