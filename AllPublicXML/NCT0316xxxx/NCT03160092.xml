  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young people with At Risk Mental State (ARMS) may have changes in their thoughts and the way
      they see or hear things, which they might find odd and distressing. They may be feeling
      tense, worried and low in mood and may not feel like socialising. They may also experience
      difficulties with eating and sleeping. For many people these symptoms might not last for very
      long, but for a small number of people, they might last longer and could become worse (health
      professionals call this psychosis).

      Psychological therapy, which involves talking to a therapist, can help to stop these symptoms
      from getting worse, stopping psychosis. It can also help to make the symptoms better.
      Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is the treatment that is most recommended to help young
      people with ARMS. But, this is not always available, can take a long time and is quite
      expensive. Some research has shown that brief therapy with a therapist who is warm and
      understanding and helps the young person to make sense of their symptoms, may be as helpful
      as CBT, and is quicker and cheaper.

      This study hopes to develop a treatment like this and to offer it to 12 young people, aged
      between 16 and 25, who are experiencing the symptoms outlined. Participants will be given
      four treatment sessions, and will be asked to complete some questionnaires. The study aims to
      see how they find it and whether it seems to help them. It will also ask professionals who
      work with these young people what they think about the new therapy. This is a feasibility
      study so the findings will help us to decide whether more research should be done on this
      treatment and whether it could be offered in the NHS in the future.

    <description>Clinical Participants will receive a 4 session individual intervention, which will be delivered by Assistant Practitioners and Assistant Psychologists (who will have received specific training in the delivering of the intervention).
The intervention will target the participant's attenuated positive psychotic symptoms, which will be referred to as: 'unusual' experiences (unless the participant prefers an alternative).
The therapist will focus on creating a therapeutic relationship in which the participant experiences them as warm, accepting and empathic. The aim is for the participant to feel listened to and understood.
The intervention will focus on taking a normalising and non-catastrophising approach to the individual's unusual experiences. The participants will be provided with psychoeducation to support this aim.</description>

    <description>The intervention aims to:
Support the participant to explore their unusual experiences
Reduce the distress or anxiety participants feel in response to their unusual experiences, through:
Helping them to recognise how common these unusual experience
Supporting them to make sense of their unusual experiences
Supporting them to understand why they may be experiencing these symptoms
Challenging any unhelpful beliefs they hold about their symptoms
Help the participant to recognise the triggers to their unusual experiences
Support the participant to increase their activities and socialisation
The intervention is not aiming to 'get rid' of the participant's symptoms, but to reduce their distress in response to them, which may result in improved wellbeing and reduced symptoms.</description>
