  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of a detection and prevention program which aims to create a continuum of care
      and support for frail community-dwelling older people (from early detection, over
      intervention, to follow-up). First, the program aims to develop methods to easily, accurately
      and timely detect and prevent a negative frailty-balance in older people. Second, the study
      aims to improve the quality and efficacy of care and support given to frail
      community-dwelling older people.
