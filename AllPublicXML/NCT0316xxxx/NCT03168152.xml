  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase II study comparing microwave ablation (MWA) and stereotactic body
      radiation therapy (SBRT) for localized hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      This trial will be the first prospective comparison of these modalities for the treatment of
      HCC and will provide critical information regarding which local ablative modality is most
      appropriate for which patients. This study will also provide important information regarding
      quality of life and liver function changes following these two different treatment
      modalities.

    <description>The primary outcome of this trial is to prospectively determine local control rates in patients with HCC treated with MWA or SBRT. Freedom From Local Progression (FFLP) is defined as the time from randomization to local tumor progression. Tumors falling to group PD (progressive disease) would constitute local control failures. Progressive disease will be defined as at least a 20% increase in the LD (longest diameter) of target lesion, taking as reference the smallest LD recorded. Or at least a 20% increase in viable arterial enhancing disease, taking as reference the smallest LD of viable HCC since treatment started. Increases of less than 3 mm compared to the smallest LD recorded will be considered stable disease rather than PD.</description>

    <description>The FACT-Hep questionnaire is used to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with hepatobiliary cancers. They are asked questions about their physical, social, emotional and functional well-being and asked to provide a score between 0 and 4 where 0 represents not at all and 4 represents very much.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are eligible for this trial. HCC is
             defined as having at least one of the following:

               1. HCC diagnosed either on biopsy or based on standard imaging criteria on contrast
                  enhanced CT or MRI (arterial enhancement with washout and pseudocapsule); or

               2. A discrete hepatic tumor(s) as defined by the Barcelona criteria10 for cirrhotic
                  patients, &gt;1 cm with arterial hypervascularity and venous or delayed phase
                  washout on CT or MRI

          -  Patients must have 1-2 intrahepatic foci of HCC and may not be candidates for refuse
             hepatic resection. Patients who are on the organ wait list for (orthotopic liver
             transplantation) OLT will be considered for this trial as a &quot;bridge&quot; to transplant.

          -  Patients with 1 focus of HCC will be eligible if their tumor is 3.5 cm or less in

             cm in diameter or less and the combined diameter of both lesions is 5 cm or less.

          -  The foci of HCC must be in an anatomic location amendable to treatment by both MWA and
             SBRT.

          -  The patient must have an ECOG performance status of ≤ 2 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology
             Group Performance Status is an attempt to quantify cancer patients' general well-being
             and activities of daily life. The score ranges from 0 to 5 where 0 is asymptomatic and
             5 is death).

          -  Patients must have recovered from the acute effects of prior liver-directed therapy
             (e.g., RT, RFA, MWA or TACE) and a minimum of 4 weeks must have passed since the last

               3. INR (international normalized ratio (for anticoagulant monitoring)) &lt; 1.5

          -  The patient must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  The patient must be at least 18 years old

          -  Patients must sign an IRB approved informed consent form for this purpose indicating
             that they are aware of the investigational aspects of the treatment and the potential
             risks. They also must be able to understand and the willing to sign a written informed
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received prior abdominal radiation

          -  Patients with 3 or more foci of HCC

          -  Patients whose HCC involves the local vasculature, regional lymph nodes or distant
             metastatic sites

          -  Patients with Child Pugh liver function worse than B7
