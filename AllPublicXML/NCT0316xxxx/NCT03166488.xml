  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at liver stiffness with a MRI sequence called Magnetic
      Resonance Elastography (MRE). The study will let the investigators know whether the subject's
      liver is normal or has increased stiffness. Increased liver stiffness often means there is
      chronic liver disease and fibrosis. Increased right heart pressure and congestive heart
      failure are considered risk factors for development of liver fibrosis. Liver fibrosis, if
      progressive, may lead to cirrhosis and its related complications. The increased liver
      stiffness may be due to a poorly functioning tricuspid valve. With this research, the
      investigators will be able to determine if the elevated stiffness of the liver returns to
      normal after the surgeon performs a repair or replacement of the tricuspid valve.

    <description>Subject Functional Capacity will be measured by the Self Assessment New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification Scale. This questionnaire consists of 4 questions regarding the subject's ability to carry on physical activities. NYHA Class I = no symptoms in regular activity; NYHA Class II = Mild symptoms and slight limitation; NYHA Class III = noticeable limitations even during minimal activity; NYHA Class IV = severe limitations even while at rest.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Primary tricuspid valvular regurgitation (tricuspid valve disease not related to a
             left-sided cardiac abnormality) diagnosed by echocardiography

          -  Evidence of passive hepatic congestion. Patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation
             diagnosed at echocardiography will constitute evidence of passive hepatic congestion.

          -  Patient scheduled for surgical tricuspid valvular repair or replacement.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Contraindication for MRI (implantable devices such as cardiac pacemaker, anxiety,
             inability to lay supine, etc).

          -  Additional conditions which may elevate their liver stiffness: hepatic fibrosis or
             cirrhosis, hepatic parenchymal disease (primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing
             cholangitis, etc), acute or chronic hepatitis (viral, substance or medication
             induced), disorders of hepatic vasculature, biliary obstruction or disease, primary or
             metastatic hepatic malignancy.

          -  Cannot agree to return for a follow up visit to complete the postsurgical imaging.
