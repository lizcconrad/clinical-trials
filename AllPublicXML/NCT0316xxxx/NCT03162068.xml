  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis induced by glucocorticoids excess constitutes the main cause of secondary
      osteoporosis. Most of data available are provided from cohort studies of patients treated by
      corticosteroids, affecting among 1% of population. In contrast, very few data on osteoporosis
      are available in the Cushing syndrome (CS), a rare disease affecting 1 or 2 million of
      inhabitants, and characterized by an endogen glucocorticoid excess production. This affection
      is responsable of frequent fractures, occuring in 30-60% of patients (vertebral asymptomatic
      in 50% of case, hip, ribs). Fractures occurs often frequently above the threshold usually
      used for osteoporosis (T-score&lt;-2.5), most often in the range of osteopenia. These data
      suggest that surface bone density isn't sufficient to characterize bone fragility,
      architectural factors are probably involved, and should be evaluated. The specificity of
      osteoporosis induced by endogen glucocorticoids excess in comparison with osteoporosis
      induced by estrogenic deficiency in post-menopausal women is poorly known, especially in
      endogen glucocorticoid excess.

      A recent microarchitecture studies showed alterations of cortical compartment in patients
      with Cushing's syndrome, confirming by our preliminary preclinical data from a transgenic
      murin model of Cushing's syndrome.

      In these ten last years, new radiologic tools have been developped, and are able to evaluate
      bone architecture. The peripheral Quantitative Computed analyses the bone architecture with
      distinction between cortical and trabecular compartment.

      Therefore, we aim to determine the specificity of osteoporosis induced by glucocorticoids
      excess in comparison to post menopausal osteoporosis thanks to pQCT analysis.

      This study are divided in two parts :

      - Cross sectional cohort with both comparison between : Cushing syndrome versus control and
      cushing syndrome versus post-menopausal women

      Outcomes :

      Primary outcomes : Analysis thanks to pQCT will be carried out in order to compare radius and
      tibia bone mineral volume (total, trabecular and cortical)

      Secondary outcomes :

      Strength parameters, muscle area adipose tissue surface will be assessed. Analysis of body
      composition thanks to DXA (Dual Energy X ray Absorptiometry), and surface bone mineral
      density.

      Evaluation of Vertebral Fracture Assesment

      - Prospective cohort with a longitudinal follow up on 5 years to assess the evolution of
      osteoporosis after treatment of Cushing syndrome (surgery or medical treatment).

      CS patients are recruited during hospitalisation in endocrinology service Post-menopausal
      women are recruited within rheumatology service. Cases are recruited thanks to advertisement
      within CHU.
