      Patients with abnormal kidney function are common in primary care, particularly in people
      with other long standing illnesses. Some of these patients have long standing weakness of
      their kidneys, others develop new kidney weakness alongside other new illnesses. Patients
      with weak kidneys are more likely to be admitted to hospital, spend longer in hospital or die
      than those with normal kidneys. Although these events are common, how kidney weakness
      develops in the community is not well understood and awareness is poor. It is known that
      appropriate attention to a patient's medical care at times of high risk may reduce the onset
      of new kidney weakness. We have developed a new education package for primary healthcare
      professionals and patients. This will teach them about risks of new kidney weakness in their
      patients, give advice about how to combat them, and help prevent it occurring. This project
      will also use a new software tool - IMPAKT EVOLVE-AKI - to extract information from primary
      care systems and combine this with hospital data to identify developing kidney weakness much
      more accurately primary care . Both these elements of the study have already been tested in
      primary care and we are confident that they work well. Patients and the public have been
      involved in the development of these tools and will also be closely involved in their
      implementation. We now intend to implement the education more widely in primary care. We will
      then test how effectively the education has been implemented and whether it has a significant
      effect on the number of episodes of new kidney weakness developing in primary care. We
      calculate that we will need to provide this education to 36 practices to be able to determine
      accurately whether the programme significantly reduces new kidney weakness. Advice we have
      received from colleagues in primary care indicates that they are very interested in this
      education programme, and we believe that that a positive result from this study will lead to
      rapid and wide implementation of this combined programme of education and data analysis to
      the benefit of patients across the UK. This study fits well with a national programme of work
      in this area, and this combination will help with wider adoption of the study findings when
      the results are available.

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common cause of excess morbidity and mortality amongst
      patients with long term conditions, and is a common finding in patients admitted acutely into
      hospital. Although the disease commonly develops in the community there is little evidence to
      guide identification of patients at risk or how best to educate healthcare workers in primary
      care to improve the care of patients at risk of AKI. We hypothesise firstly that: an AKI
      educational intervention in primary care can be delivered to healthcare practitioners with
      high integrity, and secondly that: an AKI educational intervention delivered in primary care
      will result in a decreased incidence of AKI in the community. To test this we will build on
      pilot work that detects high-AKI risk patients and provides education for healthcare workers
      and at-risk patients. The study will bring together novel informatics, and education
      programme for primary healthcare workers along with patient information and guidance.
      Recruitment will be at the practice level and will take place after the delivery of the face
      to face educational intervention. Recruited practices will have their high risk AKI patients
      identified using web based software, and GPs will be encouraged, where clinically
      appropriate, to contact patients with an educational leaflet advising them how to prevent AKI
      by stopping medications under certain circumstances. In addition a variety of associated
      biomedical data will be obtained from practice IT systems to identify the preceding incidence
      of AKI in any recruited practice. Eighteen months after the delivery of the education
      intervention the incidence of AKI in each practice will again be determined to examine the
      effect of the educational intervention on AKI incidence. The fidelity of delivery of the
      education intervention will also be studied using qualitative techniques. Power calculations
      suggest that 36 practices will need to participate to detect a 25% reduction in AKI
      incidence. We anticipate that this programme will effectively reduce AKI community incidence
      and will be of significant interest to commissioners. Study findings will be disseminated
      through a variety of avenues including through structures established by NHS England to
      support improvements in AKI management.

    <description>A face to face, a constructivist learning approach to encourage users to explore and learn about the topic of AKI in a way that maximises educational value. The programme is supported by a web based resource that presents a series of realistic case studies highlighting common causes of AKI in primary care designed to be easy to access and navigate, whilst being visual and interactive to enhance user engagement. The educayion is delivered to healthcare staff not to patients.</description>
