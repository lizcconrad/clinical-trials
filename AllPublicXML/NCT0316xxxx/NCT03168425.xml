  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of opioid overdose deaths in the United States has quadrupled in 15 years, a
      dramatic manifestation of the current opioid abuse epidemic. This rise parallels a sharp
      increase in the amount of legal prescription opioids dispensed. The abundance of prescription
      opioids available is a primary pathway for opioid abuse and diversion. Adjusting post-
      cesarean delivery opioid prescribing practices to better match actual patient need has the
      potential to reduce unused opioids available for diversion, nonmedical use, and development
      of chronic dependence, as well as reduce wasted resources.

    <textblock>
      Preliminary data from a quality improvement project performed in our department found that
      most women are prescribed opioids after discharge that were significantly in excess of the
      actual opioids used. However there is a subset of women (~25%) who use all opioids and
      complain that they were not prescribed enough. The only variable predictive of post-
      discharge opioid use was Inpatient opioid use. These data were used to develop a formula for
      estimating outpatient use based on inpatient use. Currently there are no guidelines for
      outpatient prescribing either at our institution or on a national level. On average, most
      patients at our institution received 30 tablets of 5mg oxycodone at discharge. In surveying
      providers, very few looked at inpatient use and most had a standard prescription that they
      gave everyone.
