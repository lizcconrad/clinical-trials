  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prospective study will include 200 patients and 50 critically ill patients, who had an
      abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan including the L3 level for any clinical reason.
      Ultrasound scans of the anterior thighs and forearms will be taken after the CT scan within
      48 hours. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) will also be performed. In addition muscle
      strength, mobility, physical function and nutrition will be assessed. Primary outcome is the
      prediction of CT-based whole body muscle and fat volume and BIA-based fat and lean body mass
      from ultrasound-based muscle and fat thickness. Other secondary outcomes include the intra-
      and interrater reliability of the CT evaluation and ultrasound examination of muscle and fat
      mass. The relationship between clinical aspects (strength, mobility, physical function,
      nutrition) and whole body composition is another secondary outcome.

    <time_frame>muscle strength measurement once-only within 48 hours after the CT scan</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle strength is measured with MRC scale and hand dynamometry. The outcome is muscle strength evaluated in different patient's group according to their CT-based body composition. Sarcopenia is defined as L3 skeletal muscle index equal or below 38.5 cm2/m2 for women and 52.4 cm2/m2 for men. Malnutrition is defined at a BMI beneath18,5 kg/m². Obesity is defined as a BMI above or equal to 30 kg/m². Sarcopenia obesity is defined as lowered L3 skeletal muscle indices and a BMI above or equal to 30 kg/m2.</description>
