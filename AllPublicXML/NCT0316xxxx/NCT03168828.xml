    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if TAR-302-5018, an investigational drug-delivery
      system, is safe and tolerable in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO)
      resulting from spinal cord injury (SCI).

             investigator may prevent the safe placement, indwelling use or removal of
             TAR-302-5018.

         25. History or presence of any significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal,
             gastrointestinal, gynecological, endocrine, immunological, dermatological,
             neurological or psychiatric disease or disorder that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, contraindicates participation.

         26. History of any of the following within 3 months prior to Screening Visit:

               1. Major illness/major surgery (requiring hospitalization), including pelvic, lower
                  back surgery or procedure unrelated to bladder cancer; most outpatient procedures
                  are not exclusionary

               2. Renal or ureteral stone disease or instrumentation

               3. Childbirth

         27. Difficulty providing blood samples.
