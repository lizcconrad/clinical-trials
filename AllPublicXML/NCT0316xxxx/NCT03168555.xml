  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigate serial plasma samples of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) after oral
      stimulation with chenodeoxycholic acid in the same subjects before and after elective
      cholecystectomy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lack of FGF19 and elevated 7-alpha-hydroxy-colestenone (C4) is associated with the bile acid
      diarrhoea (BAD), a disease with increasing estimated of prevalence.

      BAD is occasionally triggered by cholecystectomy and FGF19 and C4 is known to be affected by
      cholecystectomy. The investigators are exploring if FGF19 after oral stimulation can be
      developed to a universal test for BAD, and need to know how the proposed test is affected by
      cholecystectomy.
