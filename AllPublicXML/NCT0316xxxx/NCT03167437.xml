      Background:

      Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease. It causes inflammation of the gut.
      Symptoms may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, weight loss and malnutrition. CD has
      no cure, but symptoms can sometimes be controlled with medicine. Researchers want to see if
      it is safe to treat CD with the medicine vorinostat. It is thought that vorinostat may reduce
      the inflammation process of CD. This may then help to relieve symptoms of CD.

      Objectives:

      To see if vorinostat is safe for people with moderate-to-severe CD.

      Eligibility:

      Adults 18 65 with moderate-to-severe CD that medicine is not controlling.

      Design:

      Phase I is screening. It may last 120 days. Participants will have:

      Physical exam

      Medical history

      Tests of blood, urine, and stool samples

      Heart test

      Questionnaires

      Tuberculosis skin test

      They may have a colonoscopy and lymphapheresis collection. These will be explained in a
      separate consent.

      They will keep a diary of symptoms.

      Phase II is treatment. It will take 12 13 weeks. Participants will take the study drug by
      mouth twice daily for 12 weeks. They will get a weekly phone call to talk about how the drug
      makes them feel. They will have blood taken regularly. Every 4 weeks, they will have a
      check-up that will repeat some screening tests.

      Phase III is post-treatment. It starts with a check-up that lasts up to 2 days. Participants
      will repeat some screening tests. They will have a follow-up phone call 30 days after
      treatment ends. They will have check-ups 6 and 9 months after starting the study drug. They
      will repeat some screening tests.

      The study ends after the 9-month follow-up.

      Crohn's Disease (CD), a major sub-type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is a chronic,
      life-long condition characterized by relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI)
      tract. Despite recent advances in IBD therapeutics, a significant number of patients with CD
      continue to have significant symptoms.

      In prior studies, it has been demonstrated that epigenetic modifications of the genome are
      associated with and may contribute to the pathogenesis of various disease entities. One type
      of epigenetic modification involves acetylation and deacetlyation of histones, mediated by
      histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Acetylation and
      deacetylation of histones regulates the affinity of histones for DNA, thus modulating the
      accessibility of transcription factors to gene promoters and enhancer sites. Of interest in
      this context is evidence that epigenetic modifications brought about by HDAC inhibitors
      (HDACi), i.e., agents that cause hyperacetylation of histones, can limit the course of
      gastrointestinal inflammation1-3. One naturally occurring HDAC inhibitor, the bacterial
      product butyrate, has been shown to have effects on gene transcription 4,5 that regulate
      potentially deleterious pro-inflammatory responses to microbiota in the gut environment. It
      has been shown that treatment of dendritic cells and macrophages with butyrate leads to
      down-regulation of lipopolysaccharide induced pro-inflammatory mediators such as nitric
      oxide, IL-6 and IL-12.6 In addition, butyrate has been shown to enhance the differentiation
      of intestinal Foxp3-positive T cells (T regulatory T cell (Treg) development that then
      modulates GI inflammation and contributes to mucosal homeostasis7,8. Along the same lines,
      another HDAC inhibitor, vorinostat, has been shown to ameliorate graft-vs-host disease (GVHD)
      affecting the GI tract in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation9. This
      anti-inflammatory effect was also attributable to increased Treg activity, suggesting that
      vorinostat, like butyrate, decreases inflammation by enhancing the activity of cells with the
      capacity to down-regulate immune responses. The effect of vorinostat on Treg cell expansion
      in this study was particularly notable because it suggested that Treg cell numbers can be
      increased by agents that have an intrinsic effect on the transcription of key Treg cell
      transcription factors. On this basis, treatment of patients with inflammatory and autoimmune
      diseases by influencing Treg cell numbers may be more effective than alternative existing
      methods of inducing Treg cell expansion such as administration of purified Tregs.

      We propose a Phase I/II clinical trial to study the safety and efficacy of vorinostat (100 mg
      PO BID for 12 weeks) in treating 20 individuals with moderate-to-severe CD who are not
      controlled by standard maintenance therapy. We will assess the effectiveness of vorinostat by
      evaluating changes in symptom scores, endoscopic/histologic findings, and
      immunologic/laboratory parameters. The participant will return to the NIH CC after starting
      treatment on Days 28, 56 and Week 12 for assessing safety and testing of clinical and
      immunologic response. They will return again 6 and 9 months post-treatment initiation for
      safety and efficacy evaluations.

             harvest of research biopsies. Individuals with only upper gastrointestinal CD or only
             perianal fistulizing CD are also excluded for this reason.

         18. Refusal to abstain from using COX-2 inhibitors or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
             drugs (NSAIDs) throughout the study agent administration period.

         19. Has uncontrolled diabetes

         20. Is taking anti-seizure medication, such as valproic acid or its derivative (i.e.,
             Depakote)

         21. Presence of any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates
             participation in this study.

         22. Has participated in another investigational trial within 8 weeks (or 5 half-lives of
             any investigational study agent), whichever is greater, prior to the pre-trial
             (screening) visit. The window will be derived from the last date of treatment on the
             previous trial.
