  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff disease (i.e., rotator cuff tendinopathy or tear) is a common cause of shoulder
      pain in persons with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). It usually resolves with non-operative
      treatments such as pharmacological agents and physical therapy; however, when this fails,
      rotator cuff surgery may be the only option. Autologous adipose tissue injection has recently
      emerged as a promising new treatment for joint pain and soft tissue injury. Adipose can be
      used to provide cushioning and filling of structural defects and has been shown to have an
      abundance of bioactive elements and regenerative perivascular cells (pericytes). The purpose
      of this study is to explore the safety and efficacy of autologous, micro-fragmented adipose
      tissue (Lipogems®) injection under ultrasound guidance for chronic shoulder pain in persons
      with SCI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory pilot study to determine the safety and efficacy of autologous,
      micro-fragmented adipose tissue (Lipogems®) injection under ultrasound guidance for chronic,
      nonresponsive shoulder pain due to rotator cuff disease (i.e., rotator cuff tendinopathy) in
      persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). Six (6) persons with SCI who have chronic shoulder
      pain for longer than 6 months in spite of completing conservative treatment who are diagnosed
      with rotator cuff disease on examination. Micro-fragmented adipose tissue will be obtained by
      using a minimal manipulation technique in a closed system (Lipogems®), without the addition
      of enzymes or any additives. The final product will consist of micronized fat tissue yielding
      fat clusters with preserved vascular stroma of about 500 microns with intact stromal vascular
      niches and harboring regenerative cellular elements. Approximately 6 mL of micro-fragmented
      adipose will be injected into the tendon with a 22-gauge needle under continuous ultrasound
      guidance. No other biological or pharmacological agents will be used in combination with the
      micro-fragmented adipose. After 24 hours, subjects will be given a standardized stretching
      protocol to follow for 4 weeks followed by a formal strengthening program. Participants will
      be followed for adverse events and changes in shoulder pain intensity on an 11-point
      numerical rating scale (NRS; 0-10, with anchors &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;pain as bad as you can
      imagine&quot;); the Wheelchair User's Shoulder Pain Index (WUSPI; 15-item disease-specific
      functional measure of shoulder pain in persons with SCI); the Brief Pain Inventory
      interference items (BPI-I7; a subscale of 7 items measuring interference with general
      activity, sleep, mood, relationships, etc.); and a 5-point subject global impression of
      change (SGIC) scale. Subjects will be examined at 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and 6 months
      after the treatment. Follow-up shoulder ultrasound will be performed at 6 months.

    <description>Shoulder pain intensity will also be assessed weekly using a numerical rating scale (NRS). Subjects will be asked to rate their average pain, most severe pain, and least severe pain during the past week using an 11-point scale (i.e. 0-10) anchored at the ends by &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine.&quot; An 11-point NRS measure of pain intensity allows for comparison across clinical trials of chronic pain treatment and is recommended as a core outcome measure for chronic pain clinical trials.</description>

    <description>The WUSPI is a 15-item self-report instrument that measures shoulder pain intensity in wheelchair users during various ADLs, such as transfers, loading a wheelchair into a car, wheelchair mobility, dressing, bathing, overhead lifting, driving, performing household chores, and sleeping. Each item is scored using a 10cm visual analog scale (VAS) which is anchored at the ends with &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain ever experienced.&quot; Individual item scores are summed to arrive at a total index score, which ranges from 0 to 150.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be asked to rate on a 7-point scale overall impression following treatment as compared to the previous measurement interval. The 7-point PGIC scale (anchored by &quot;very much improved&quot; and &quot;very much worse&quot;) is used to measure global treatment effect.</description>

    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was developed by Cleeland, and has been used in a number of investigations of chronic pain. Its pain interference subscale has been used in several investigations of pain in SCI. In its original version the subscale (BPI-I7) consisted of 7 items measuring interference with general activity, sleep, mood, relationships, etc.). For uses with an SCI sample, in item 3 of BPI-I7, ''walking ability'' is replaced by &quot;ability to get around.&quot;</description>

    <description>The Physical Examination of the Shoulder Score (PESS) is obtained by performing a series of eleven commonly used physical examination maneuvers for rotator cuff disease and shoulder pain that are graded 0 (no pain), 1 (equivocal for pain), or 2 (pain present).</description>
