    <textblock>
      This is a Bayesian adaptive dose-finding study in patients with primary or secondary
      myelofibrosis:

        1. who have failed therapy with ruxolitinib on the basis of intolerance or loss of
           efficacy,

        2. highly symptomatic (DIPSS risk score of Intermediate-1, Intermediate-2 or High Risk, and
           MPN-SAF TSS 2.0 of ≥10),

        3. and have splenomegaly (assessed by physical examination).

      Condition or disease: Primary Myelofibrosis/Post-Polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis/
      Post-essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis

      Intervention/treatment: Drug-Pacritinib

      Phase: Phase 2

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to support a pacritinib dosage selection decision. Three dosages will
      be evaluated, with patients randomized 1:1:1 to pacritinib 100 mg QD, pacritinib 100 mg BID,
      or pacritinib 200 mg BID. Randomization will be stratified by baseline platelet count
      (≤50,000/µL; &gt;50,000/µL and ≤100,000/µL; and &gt;100,000/µL). Assigned treatment will continue
      until the patient experiences progressive disease, intolerable AEs, withdraws consent, or
      until the assigned treatment arm is closed. No study treatment crossover will be allowed. All
      patients should complete all visit procedures through Week 24, including patients who stop
      pacritinib treatment or have protocol-defined progressive disease prior to Week 24, unless
      patient withdraws consent, dies, undergoes splenic irradiation or splenectomy, or initiates
      any non-protocol-directed anti-myelofibrosis treatment. The maximum duration of trial
      participation for an individual patient will be approximately 36 months. The Following the
      Week 24 assessment, patients who are benefiting from therapy and who have not experienced
      progressive disease will be allowed to continue receiving pacritinib at the original
      randomized dose or following the dose recommendations of the Independent Data Monitoring
      Committee (IDMC), and will be followed for survival, efficacy and safety for up to 2.5 years.

      The Sponsor will collect PK samples from all patients in each dosing arm at the end of Week
      12 and Week 24 at the following timepoints: 0 hours (predose), 4 hours postdose (±10
      minutes), and 8 hours postdose (±15 minutes). In addition, PD samples will be collected on
      Day 1 (Baseline), Week 12, and Week 24 at 0 hours (predose). DNA samples will also be
      collected for analysis of mutations associated with myelofibrosis at baseline and Week 24.

      This study will utilize planned frequent monitoring by an IDMC. The first meeting will occur
      once 18 patients have been randomized and will meet approximately quarterly thereafter. To
      minimize the patient exposure to minimally effective dosages, an interim analysis of the
      primary efficacy and safety data will be performed to allow an earlier decision to
      discontinue an arm that is unlikely to achieve at least 10% SVR at Week 24. The interim
      analysis will be performed when 6 patients per arm have completed the Week 12 evaluations and
      have evaluable spleen volume data by MRI or CT.

      IDMC will review efficacy and safety data, including interim analysis, and make
      recommendations on:

        1. Closing treatment arm(s) and expanding enrollment in remaining treatment arm(s)

        2. Pausing enrollment due to cardiac or hemorrhage adverse events

        3. Dosage for further clinical studies
