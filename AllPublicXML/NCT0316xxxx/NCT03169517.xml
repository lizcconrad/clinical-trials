  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) allows real-time, non-invasive, quantitative
      measurements of regional blood flow. The aim of this prospective observational study was to
      evaluate the blood flow changes by LSCI after peripheral nerve block and determine whether
      this novel optical technique can be used as a reliable indicator of successful blocks.

      Methods: One hundred adult patients scheduled for elective upper or lower limb surgery with
      peripheral nerve block will receive LSCI measurements and pinprick sensory tests before the
      block and at 5-min intervals till 30 min after the block. The sensitivity, specificity of
      LSCI as a diagnostic method will be determined by receiver operator characteristic analysis.

      Clinical Implications: LSCI with quantitative data could be used as an indicator of
      successful blocks.
