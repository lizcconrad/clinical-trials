      This study will be observational study. The goal of this study is to evaluate the quality of
      mandible and to assess the correlation between the jaw bone quality in a sample of Egyptian
      patients with chronic renal failure and duration of dialysis using CBCT.

      This study will be observational study. The goal of this study is to evaluate the quality of
      mandible and to assess the correlation between the jaw bone quality in a sample of Egyptian
      patients with chronic renal failure and duration of dialysis using CBCT. Twenty-six subjects
      will be included in this study. These will comprise (13) CKD patients &quot;the study group&quot; and
      (13) healthy patients &quot;the control group&quot; recommended for CBCT imaging for implant placement.
      The control group will be selected from the Prosthodontic department and Oral Medicine
      department of Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine, Cairo University, the study group will be
      selected from Nephrology and the artificial kidney unit El Kasr -Al Ain Hospital, Cairo
      University.

    <description>Mandibular cortical index (MCI) is a qualitative index that determines the porosity degree of the lower cortical border of the mandible distal to the mental foramen.The lower border of the mandible can be classified into a three point scale according to MCI, C1: the cortex is sharp on both sides; C2: the cortex had semilunar defects(lacunar resorption) and c3: cortex is clearly porous</description>
