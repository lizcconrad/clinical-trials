      (TDF/FTC) for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in HIV-uninfected women.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the long-acting
      injectable integrase inhibitor cabotegravir (CAB LA) compared to daily oral tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in a
      population of sexually active HIV-uninfected women at risk for HIV.

      This study will take place in three steps. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of
      two arms:

      Arm A:

      Step 1: Participants will receive daily oral CAB and TDF/FTC placebo for 5 weeks.

      Step 2: Participants will receive injections of CAB LA at two time points 4 weeks apart and
      every 8 weeks thereafter and daily TDF/FTC placebo beginning at Week 5.

      Arm B:

      Step 1: Participants will receive daily TDF/FTC and oral CAB placebo for 5 weeks.

      Step 2: Participants will receive daily TDF/FTC and intramuscular (IM) placebo injections at
      two time points 4 weeks apart and every 8 weeks thereafter beginning at Week 5.

      Step 2 will continue until the last enrolled participant reaches approximately 76 weeks on
      Step 2 (Week 81 for the last enrolled participant).

      In Step 3, all participants (Arms A and B) will receive daily TDF/FTC for up to 48 weeks,
      starting no later than 8 weeks after the last injection.

      At the end of Step 3, all participants will then transition to locally available HIV
      prevention services, including services for PrEP, if available.

      Study visits will occur at Day 0 and at Weeks 2 and 4 during Step 1. During Step 2,
      participants will attend up to 24 visits, depending on when they enroll in the study. Study
      visits will occur every 12 weeks during Step 3. Study visits may include physical
      examinations; blood, urine, and vaginal swab collection; and risk reduction and adherence
      counseling.

             gonadotropin (βHCG) pregnancy test (sensitivity of less than or equal to 25 mIU/mL)
             performed (and results known) on the same day as and before initiating the

             with the conduct of the study (e.g., provided by self-report, or found upon medical
             history and examination or in available medical records)

          -  No alcohol or substance use that, in the opinion of the study investigator, would
             interfere with the conduct of the study (e.g., provided by self-report, or found upon
