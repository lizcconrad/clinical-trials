    <textblock>
      The investigators adopted the CAMS（Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences）-2009 trial for
      pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients between 2009 to 2015, in which a
      risk-stratified strategy and dose-dense intensive chemotherapy were introduced. The outcomes
      of CAMS-2009 trial were retrospectively analyzed, and compared to the CAMS-2005 trial.

    <description>The induction course was MAE(Mitoxantrone + Cytarabine + Etoposide) or IAE(Idamycin + Cytarabine + Etoposide). Risk-stratified therapy and dose-dense intensive chemotherapy were adopted in the consolidation therapy. After the second course of therapy, patients in remission were stratified into three risk groups: low-risk children were defined as those with t(8;21) and a white blood cell count lower than 50,000/L, inv(16), or an age younger than 2 years without any high-risk factors; high-risk children were those with CR after consolidation course 1 or induction C , or with abnormalities of monosomy 7, 5q-, t(16;21), t(9;22)(Philadelphia chromosome [Ph1]); intermediate-risk children were those who were not in either a low-risk or high-risk group. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was indicated for only relapsed patients in the second CR.</description>
