    <textblock>
      This study is intended for men and women at least 18 years of age who have relapsed and/or
      refractory multiple myeloma. This 2-arm randomized pilot study will test the safety,
      tolerability and efficacy of NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T alone (Arm 1) or in combination with pembrolizumab
      (Arm 2) in subjects who have the appropriate HLA-A2 marker, and whose bone marrow expresses
      the NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1a protein.

      This study will take a subject's T cells and give them a T cell receptor protein that
      recognizes and attacks the tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized pilot study of the efficacy and safety of NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T alone or in
      combination with pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, who
      are HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*02:05, and/or HLA-A*02:06 positive, and whose plasma cells from a bone
      marrow (BM) aspirate test positive for NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1a antigen.

      Subjects meeting all eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to a treatment Arm:
      NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T alone (Arm 1) or NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T in combination with pembrolizumab (Arm 2).

      Leukapheresis is performed to obtain cells for the manufacture of autologous NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T
      cells. When the manufactured NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cells are available, subjects will undergo
      lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on Day -7, Day 6, and Day
      -5, followed by a single infusion of NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T (transduced cell range: 1 to 8 billion
      cells) that will be administered on Day 1.

      In Arm 2, three (3) weeks after the infusion of NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T, an initial dose of
      pembrolizumab will be administered on Day 22. If toxicities preclude Week 3 treatment, the
      first dose of pembrolizumab may be given at Week 6 (Day 43). The second dose of pembrolizumab
      will be administered 3 weeks later, at Week 6 (or Week 9), and subsequent doses of
      pembrolizumab will be administered every 3 weeks thereafter up to Week 108 post T-cell
      infusion.

      Treatment Limiting Toxicities (TLTs) will be evaluated for subjects in the combination arm
      (Arm 2).

      A complete safety review of the first 3 subjects dosed with T-cells and pembrolizumab on Arm
      2 will be conducted before enrolling any further subject. The study may be paused to evaluate
      safety at any time or if at an interim assessment the predictive probability that the TLT
      rate at the end of the trial exceeds 33%, is greater than 50%.

      Efficacy will be assessed using International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform Response
      Criteria.

      Upon confirmation of their disease progression, subjects will be considered completing for
      the primary analysis. Subjects will complete the study once they have met the criteria to be
      transferred into a Long-Term Follow-Up protocol, where they will continue to be followed for
      up to 15 years from the date of their T-cell infusion.

             pneumonitis.

         14. Evidence or history of significant cardiac disease (such as, but not limited to,
             unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the prior 6 months, heart
             failure within 6 months, symptomatic congestive heart failure, symptomatic or
             uncontrolled arrhythmias, severe aortic stenosis, symptomatic mitral stenosis).

         15. Subjects showing an average QTc interval over 3 consecutive electrocardiograms (ECG)
             &gt;450 msec in males and &gt;470 msec in females at screening (≥ 480 msec for subjects with
             bundle branch block (BBB) are not eligible.

         16. Evidence or history of other significant, hepatic, renal, ophthalmologic, psychiatric,
             or gastrointestinal disease which would likely increase the risks of participating in

             nonmelanomatous skin cancers, carcinoma in situ of the breast, treated superficial
             bladder cancer or prostate cancer, or in situ cervical cancers) are excluded unless a
             complete remission was achieved at least 2 years prior to study entry and no
             additional therapy is required or anticipated to be required during the study period.
             Long-term adjuvant therapy (example: breast cancer) is acceptable.

         18. Active bacterial or systemic viral or fungal infections

         19. Pregnant or breastfeeding.
