      Lay Person's Summary:

      Knee replacement surgery has been successfully carried out for many years. However, in time,
      some knee replacements will fail-usually either because of wear or loosening of the
      replacement parts. This may mean the patient has to undergo further surgery-this is known as
      revision total knee replacement (rTKR). This revision surgery is often more complex than the
      original operation and presents the operating surgeon with several technical challenges. Of
      particular concern, is that when the old knee replacement is removed, a large cavity can be
      left in the bone. The new knee replacement has to be placed into this, but it is essential
      that it is immediately stable and secure. The large cavity has to be somehow either filled in
      or bypassed to ensure the new knee replacement is secure enough for early weight-bearing and
      long term survival.

      Different techniques have been used for many years to overcome this problem. Firstly, it may
      be possible to simply cement another knee replacement into the cavity- probably needing more
      cement than was previously used.

      An alternative option to this is use a device called a &quot;cone&quot; which sits into the bony cavity
      created by removing the original knee replacement, and a new knee replacement can be cemented
      into this.

      Bone grows onto the cone to ensure its stability. The new knee replacement can have either
      short stemmed components like the original Total Knee Replacement (TKR), or long stemmed
      components.

      All of these types of rTKR are presently in use throughout the United Kingdom (UK). At this
      point in time, no-one knows which type is best. The research team are planning to run this
      study to see if it is possible to identify which type of rTKR gives the best outcome for
      patients. The research team will examine the results in different ways including
      questionnaires to measure how well the patients feel their knee is performing, specific tests
      to measure knee function, and by using x-rays and scans.

      The investigators will identify patients suitable for inclusion in the study from their
      medical notes, x-rays and scans. If patients consent to be in the study, the research team
      will randomly allocate them to receive one of the 3 rTKR options (no cone and new knee
      replacement only, cone with short stemmed components or cone with long stemmed components)
      and monitor their progress for 5 years after the operation.

      A preliminary analysis of the data generated by the study will be carried out 2.5 years after
      recruitment of the 1st participant to assess compliance with the study protocol.

    <textblock>
      Methodology:

      A randomised, prospective internal pilot study is to be set up to compare the results of
      different ways of approaching revision Total Knee Replacement (rTKR). The invsetigators will
      examine 3 differing ways of treating patients undergoing this procedure who present with a
      grade 2 Anderson Orthopaedic Research Institute (AORI) bony defect. One arm of the study will
      be randomised to receive a long or short stemmed cemented prosthesis (according to
      intra-operative findings and surgeon decision at that time), another to receive a metaphyseal
      cone into which a short stemmed prosthesis will be cemented (&lt;/=50mm) and a third arm to
      receive a metaphyseal cone with a long stemmed cemented prosthesis (&gt;/=100 mm). The study
      will be carried out in the operating theatres, orthopaedic out-patients department and the
      physiotherapy department at the Royal Devon and Exeter (RD+E) Hospital.

      Patients will be invited to take part in the study in one of 2 ways. Firstly, by their
      surgeon when they are initially listed for rTKR surgery at their out-patient consultation at
      the RD+E Hospital. Alternatively, if identified from the current surgical waiting list as
      suitable for inclusion. In this latter case, potential participants will be contacted by
      letter by their surgeon asking for permission for one of the research team to approach them
      to discuss the study. Patients who agree to enter the trial will be divided at random to
      enter the different treatment arms of the study.

      Randomisation will be carried out using a computer generated random number assignment list.
      51 patients will be initially included with allocation to either arm of the trial by drawing
      appropriately marked slips of paper from an opaque envelope. The operating surgeon will not
      be able to read the slips before they are drawn, nor will they perform the randomisation
      which will be carried out by one of the investigators not carrying out the surgery on the
      individual patient.

      The research team will undertake a preliminary analysis of the study data 6 months after 51
      participants have been recruited (i.e. 2.5 years after 1st patient recruited). This will be
      to see if the pilot study aims and objectives and study progression rules have been met.
      Based on this analysis, the aim is to recruit further participants to the number recommended
      in the preliminary analysis.

      Participant Selection:

      Patients will be under the care of the Exeter Knee Reconstruction Unit at the RD+E Hospital.

      Sample Size:

      The exact treatment effect of the use of cones in revision knee replacement is unknown. There
      are no prospective studies to use as a basis for calculating sample size. The choice of 51
      participants initially with the potential for further recruitment after preliminary analysis
      of the 6 month post-surgery (i.e. 2.5 years after recruitment of the 1st participant)
      follow-up data is to allow an assessment of treatment size effect to allow the investigators
      to work out a definitive study sample size requirement. The investigators have taken
      statistical advice on this and are confident that this number will be sufficient to test the
      progression rules and to offer reasonable estimates of standard deviations of the intended
      outcome measures.

      The research team will initially recruit 17 cases to each arm of the study (no cone used,
      cone with short stemmed knee replacement and cone with long stemmed knee replacement)

      Pragmatically, (based on 2015 figures) the Exeter Knee Reconstruction Unit (EKRU) undertake
      approximately 62 rTKR procedure per year and in 2015, 27 of these did not meet the study
      inclusion criteria. The investigators believe this to be a representation of other years. Of
      the remaining 35 cases, if 20% are unwilling to participate this will leave 28 cases per
      annum. The study is therefore likely to recruit 56 potential participants in just under a 2
      year period. The plan is to initially recruit 51 subjects (17 to the no cone arm and 17 each
      to the cone with short or long stem arms respectively). A preliminary analysis of the data
      will be carried out after 51 cases have been recruited, operated upon and have 6 months of
      follow up completed (i.e. 2.5 years after recruitment of 1st participant), to look for any
      significant trends. Based on these preliminary results of the internal pilot study the aim is
      to recruit further cases to reach a recruitment target that has been set based on the pilot
      study results. This figure would be calculated to allow the research team to identify a total
      number of participants that would give results with statistical significance in either the
      primary or secondary outcome measures.

      Initial number of study participants is 51 patients but with potential for an increased
      number based on analysis of the pilot study.

      Procedure:

      Potential candidates for this study will be identified in one of 2 ways. Firstly, patients
      are listed for rTKR surgery whilst attending orthopaedic out-patient clinics at the RD+E
      Hospital. At the time of this consultation patients will be offered the opportunity to
      participate in the study. Potential participants will be given a copy of the information
      about the study and the consent form. This will allow the opportunity therefore, to discuss
      the study with family, friends or General Practitioner (GP) if necessary. Alternatively,
      patients will be identified from existing surgical waiting lists. In this case, potential
      recruits will be contacted in writing or by telephone asking for permission for one of the
      study team to approach them about the study. If permission is given, the patient will be sent
      a copy of the participant information sheet and a consent form so that they can decide if
      they would like to be involved. One of the research team- either the study coordinator or one
      of the research nurses- will then contact the patient and if they are willing to be involved,
      will obtain written consent for study participation. Consent is likely to be obtained at the
      pre-operative assessment clinic which usually occurs 2-4 weeks before surgery and with the
      patients consent, their GP will be informed of participation in the study.

      3 copies of written consent will be obtained. One will be returned to the patient. One will
      be placed in the medical notes and one will be kept by the research team in the patient's
      case record file (CRF).

      Patient Generated Clinical Outcomes:

      All rTKR patients attend the hospital for routine pre-operative assessment-whether involved
      in the study or not. At this appointment, trial participants will complete the questionnaires
      related to the study- the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), the Knee Osteo-arthritis Outcome Score
      (KOOS) and the Euroquol Questionnaire (EQ5D). These 3 questionnaires are contained within the
      revision cones study Patient Recorded Outcome Measures (PROMS). Participants will also
      complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS).

      Initial Radiological Assessment:

      All participants will undergo standardised long leg Antero-Posterior (AP) and lateral
      radiographs pre and post-operatively as part of routine care for rTKR patients. These will be
      reported upon by the surgeons and the results documented in the medical notes electronically
      via Clinical Document Manager (CDM).

      In addition to routine care, all patients will undergo a Dual Emission X-ray Absorptiometry
      (DEXA) scan at the University of Exeter for pre-operative bone density evaluation. At the
      time of the initial DEXA scan patients will be asked to complete the following
      questionnaires: 1) Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) and 2) General health
      questionnaire (bone health female/male) to assess the impact this may have on bone density.

      Pre-operative Functional Assessment:

      Study participants will attend the physiotherapy department at the RD+E Hospital for a
      functional assessment. The Exeter Knee Reconstruction Unit (EKRU)Knee Arthroplasty Functional
      Assessment will be undertaken with analysis by the Nurture Functional Assessment Tool.

      Randomisation:

      The knee surgery team meet every Tuesday to discuss the operations planned for the next week.
      One of the research team (study coordinator or research nurse) will attend this meeting and
      open the envelope that assigns each patient to the appropriate arm of the study. (See
      methodology above). The operating surgeon and theatre staff will be informed. It is necessary
      to do this in advance of the day of the operation to ensure all instrumentation required for
      the surgery is ready for use, sterile, available and laid out in preparation for the surgery.
      The patient will be assigned a study number and their randomisation slip stored by the study
      team. The randomization schedule will be determined using an on-line random assignment
      sequence generator (www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1.cfm) and will be kept and
      controlled by the study co-ordinator, and the surgeons will not have access to this schedule.
      A hand written note will be made by one of the research team in the orthopaedic section of
      the patient's medical notes after their surgery, confirming that they consented to the study
      and detailing which arm of the study they were allocated to.

      Randomisation will be to one of 3 arms of the study. The patient will either receive:

        1. A new TKR using the Triathlon Component System cemented into the bony cavity left after
           removal of the original TKR-stem length to be decided by surgeon during the operation.

        2. A Triathlon Cone into which a new TKR will be cemented- stem length &lt;/=50mm.

        3. A Triathlon Cone into which a new TKR will be cemented-stem length &gt;/= 100mm

      Surgery:

      Operating techniques will be standard techniques as used by the 3 surgeons involved in the
      study. All 3 are experienced rTKR surgeons.

      All stems will be cemented using a cement plug, suction catheter and pressurisation. All
      patients receive the Triathlon Total Stabilised (TS) Revision Implant with the TS
      polyethylene.

      Both femoral and tibial components will be revised in all cases. A decision to revise the
      patella component will be taken intra-operatively by the operating surgeon. If the patient's
      patella was not resurfaced during the original operation, it is likely to be resurfaced
      during the revision procedure. If the patella was previously resurfaced it will be visually
      assessed per-operatively for component wear and manually assessed for loosening. It will be
      revised if found to be significantly loose or worn.

      Patients will be discharged home allowed to fully weight-bear as comfort allows and with
      walking aids for use for a 6 week period if required.

      Follow Up:

      As per routine care, the patients will be reviewed at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and
      5 years post-operatively. At each follow up appointment they will repeat the questionnaires
      above, (OKS, KOOS, HADS and EQ5D) and the weight bearing AP long leg and standard lateral
      radiographs.

      Functional assessment will also be carried out at the 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 year and 5
      year follow up time frames.

      All patients will undergo a DEXA scan to assess the bone density in the bone immediately
      adjacent either to the new knee replacement+/- cone post-operatively at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, 24
      and 60 months. The DEXA scan will be performed at the University of Exeter.

      All of the patients with a cone implanted will undergo a dual energy Computerised Tomography
      (CT) scan at 6 months after surgery to assess potential bony on-growth onto the cone.

      The Primary outcome of the Pilot Study will be:

      • An assessment of compliance with the study protocol. For this, the research team will
      measure compliance of study participants with the pre and post-operative attendance schedule.

      Time Frame: 2.5 years after recruitment of 1st subject

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

        -  An assessment of ease of recruitment to the study by comparing the potential number of
           recruits to those actually recruited

        -  Failure for any reason requiring further revision surgery: including but not exclusive
           to loosening of the components, infection, instability or pain.

        -  The assessment of early stability of the newly implanted prosthesis as measured
           radiographically on x-rays by subsidence

        -  Measurement of on-growth of bone onto the prosthesis via dual energy CT scan for
           patients in those arms of the study.

        -  Measurement of bone density in the bone surrounding the cone via DEXA scan

        -  Clinical assessment using the KOOS tool, the OKS, the HADS and the EQ5D questionnaires.

        -  Functional assessment using EKRU Knee Arthroplasty Functional Assessment and the Nurture
           assessment tool

        -  The development of post-operative infection

      Data Collation:

      To be undertaken by the clinician undertaking the specific procedure concerned or by the
      Chief Investigator of the study or by research nurses attached to the RD+E Hospital provided
      by the hospital Research and Development (R+D) department and the National Institute Health
      Research (NIHR).

      The data will be stored on RD+E Hospital secure computers. Data will be entered into an Excel
      spread sheet for later transfer into a statistical package such as Statistical Package for
      the Social Sciences (SPSS) v15, StatsDirect or Stata for analysis. All patient identifiers
      will be removed. The study data will be kept for 5 years and destroyed thereafter by deleting
      it from the hard drive of the Hospital computers.

      Data analysis:

      As this is a pilot study, an estimate of effectiveness is not the primary aim of the
      analysis. However, as part of the secondary outcome measures, an analysis of the Minimally
      Clinically Important Difference results from the EQ5D (0.14 from the EQ5D index) between the
      3 arms of the study will be performed to establish if there are differences identified that
      can allow the investigators to power a larger study. Regarding secondary outcomes, the
      research team will be interested in the central tendency and variation found in the outcome
      data. Thus descriptive analyses will be conducted giving means and standard deviations of
      outcome scores or median and interquartile ranges where appropriate, if the data are not
      normally distributed and cannot be easily transformed. This will apply to the various
      questionnaire-based outcome measures. Estimates of central tendency and variation will enable
      a sample size calculation to be conducted in order to power a larger definitive trial at a
      later date. The research team will arrange for independent statistical analysis of the
      results.

      For the substantive study, there will be an analysis of covariance as there are 3 groups
      being compared with repeated measure Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) as data are being collected
      at more than one time point (i.e. at follow-up).

      Measures to avoid bias:

        -  The participants will be blinded as to which arm of the study they are allocated to.
           However, the participants allocated to one of the cone arms of the study may recognise
           this when they called for the post-operative CT scan. It is not ethical to CT scan all
           participants due to the radiation exposure when useful information from this examination
           can only be gleaned from the groups who have a cone implanted. Thus, patients with a
           cone device in situ may work out that they must have a cone device when they are having
           a CT scan. However, study participants will not be able to determine whether a short or
           long-stemmed TKR is in situ.

        -  The surgeon cannot be blinded to randomisation as he will be performing the surgery.

        -  The members of staff interpreting the results of the CT and DEXA scans cannot be blinded
           as to which group the patients are allocated to as it will be clear to see on the
           radiological images

        -  The physiotherapist carrying out the functional assessments will be blinded to study arm
           allocation

        -  No surgeon will report upon the x-rays of a patient upon whom they have operated

        -  The statistician analysing the results will be blinded to study arm allocation

      Personnel:

        -  Chief Investigator- Andrew Toms

        -  Surgeons-Andrew Toms, Jonathan Phillips and Keith Eyres

        -  X-Ray interpretation: Andrew Toms, Jonathan Phillips and Keith Eyres. No surgeon will
           report on cases upon whom he has operated.

        -  Study correspondence and administration Patrick Hourigan

        -  Interpretation of CT scan results by Dr Rahul Anaspure -Consultant radiologist at the
           RD+E Hospital.

        -  Radiology staff employed at the RD+E Hospital as part of routine care to undertake
           imaging

        -  Functional outcome assessment team-Dean Chisling De Burgh -physiotherapy department RD+E
           Hospital.

        -  Statistical support provided by Dr Roy Powell

        -  Radiological assessment via DEXA scans by Dr Karen Knapp University of Exeter and
           Michael Knapp-radiographer

        -  Medical Physics Expert: Helen O'Brien at RD+E Hospital.

        -  Clerical staff attached to the EKRU.

      Confidentiality:

      All of the research staff will be trained as per the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice
      (GCP) in research trained. All National Health Service (NHS) staff involved are bound by
      patient confidentiality requirements of the NHS.

      Dr Knapp (who undertakes the DEXA scans at Exeter University) will be bound to
      confidentiality requirements as part of GCP adherence as will Michael Gundry.

      The study participants GP will be informed that their patient is involved in the research-
      particularly as the patient may wish to discuss their involvement in the research with their
      GP.

      All of the data associated with the study will be kept electronically on the hard drives of
      computers within the Exeter Knee Reconstruction Unit (EKRU). It will be stored on encrypted
      and password protected hospital computers. The data will only be accessible by members of the
      research team and by the R+D department at the RD+E Hospital who will require access to the
      data to ensure compliance with the protocol.

      At the end of the study (see timescales below), all research data will be destroyed by being
      permanently deleted from the RD+E hospital computers. Copies will be archived by the study
      sponsor in line with standard research material archiving procedures. Radiographs and scans
      will remain on the secure hospital systems as per routine care.

      Timescales:

      62 rTKR operations were carried out at the RD+E in 2015. Of these, approximately 35 cases
      would have met the study inclusion criteria. If one considers that 20% of potential study
      participants will decline participation, it is estimated that 28 candidates could be
      recruited per year. Thus recruitment of 51 candidates is likely to take just under 2 years,
      provided adequate numbers of new cases are identified as needing revision and meet the entry
      criteria. However, there are at this time, approximately 15 patients awaiting surgery who
      already meet the entry criteria for this study. These patients have the potential to allow
      faster recruitment to the pilot study as their surgery is already planned as opposed to
      waiting for patients to be seen in clinics and for decisions to be taken regarding the need
      for surgery, and then patients being placed on surgical waiting lists.

      A preliminary analysis of the data will be performed once the 51 patients are recruited and
      have completed 6 months post-operative follow-up (i.e. 2.5 years after recruitment of the 1st
      subject.

      Complete follow up is for 5 years post entry into the study. It will take a further 1 year
      for data analysis, project write up and submission for publication post study end.

      Therefore, if 51 participants are recruited over 2 years, followed up for 5 years and the
      data is analysed over 1 year, the total study length is 8 years.

      If the preliminary analysis of the first 51 cases allows calculation of a sample size for a
      substantive study, the research team will then be able to give an estimate for study length
      for the substantive study.

      Study data will be destroyed 5 years after completion of the study.

      Dissemination of Results:

      The participants will be informed in writing of the results if they so desire. The Research
      and Development department at the RD+E will be informed of the results.

      The research team plan to present the results both nationally and internationally at knee
      surgery conferences (such as the British Orthopaedic Association and the European Knee
      Society) and to publish the results in a peer reviewed journal (such as the Bone and Joint
      Journal, the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery-America, The Journal of Arthroplasty.)

      Impact of Results:

      As this is an internal pilot study, the impact of this study may be limited. The main aim is
      to answer the pilot study aims and objectives. However, if it is possible to identify a clear
      advantage of one study arm over the others, then it is likely that this technique will become
      standard rTKR procedure- with the aim of providing patients with the best clinical and
      functional results after their revision knee surgery. Similarly, if a clear difference is
      found in one study arm, it is hoped that presentation of the results to colleagues at other
      institutions will result in better long term results for their patients.

      In the event that no technique proves superior to the others, then this will provide surgeons
      with the reassurance that no matter what their preferred technique, no patient is being
      disadvantaged.

      If it is found that the cemented rTKR performs as well or better than the cone device plus
      knee replacement, and if this became the technique of choice for this operation, this could
      have significant cost savings for the NHS.

      Conflicts of Interest:

      Stryker UK have supported this study financially. However, it remains completely independent
      from them in study design, results and dissemination of findings. The 3 surgeons involved all
      undertake consultancy work for Stryker UK and will complete the necessary applications
      regarding this on the ethics application for this study.

      Costs:

        -  The out-patient appointments, surgical costs, follow up costs and plain radiographs are
           all costs paid for by the NHS as part of routine care.

        -  Functional assessment, CT scan, DEXA scan. These costs will be covered by external
           funding provided by Stryker UK.

        -  Research support nurses are paid for by the RD+E Hospital.

        -  The study coordinator will provide the support for participant identification,
           recruitment, ensuring time frame adherence for follow up appointments, scans and
           functional assessment and will maintain the database of study data. Salary costs for
           this are being met by Stryker UK.

        -  Costs of statistician for analysis of results after the study will be met by the
           external funding provided by Stryker UK.

      Patient Involvement:

      The research team have consulted with patients on the feasibility of participating in the
      study at all and in particular about the demands of attending the appointments for functional
      assessment. The study was discussed at the EKRU patient research panel. (This panel is a
      group of patients who have undergone knee replacement surgery in the EKRU and who are
      therefore, well placed to comment on the practicalities of study involvement, as well as on
      the appropriateness and clarity of the patient information leaflet.) Attendance at all time
      frames is critical for completion of the secondary measure functional outcome and it was
      stressed by the patient representatives that the patients need to be fully informed of the
      commitment required should they agree to take part. Similarly, it was recommended that the
      extra commitment for CT and DEXA scan appointments be highlighted.

      Bi-annual meetings of the patient research panel are held and if issues arise when running
      the study that require further patient involvement, they will be taken to the panel for
      consultation. If a meeting is not due for some time, the research team will contact a panel
      member personally for their advice.

      When the research team consulted on the design and wording of the patient information leaflet
      and the consent form, various changes were recommended and implemented.

      Risks of the Study:

      All of the operative care is already part of routine practice in the RD+E Hospital. Thus the
      research team do not believe involvement in this study changes the risks from surgery that
      the patients already face as a part of routine care.

      The study coordinator has discussed the study with the radiological protection officer (RPO)
      at the RD+E Hospital who has provided radiation dose calculations and a risk assessment based
      on plain x-ray as per routine care, and the pre-op, 6 week post-op and 3, 6, 12, 24 and 60
      month post-op DEXA scans. The RPO will be our medical physics expert (MPE) on the ethics
      application.

      All patients undergoing a knee replacement have 7 planar x-ray examinations at the same
      frequency of the study and will receive a radiation dose of 717.5µSv (milli Sieverts)-
      equivalent to 3.4months background radiation.

      All patients involved in the study will receive 7 additional DEXA examinations of the Lumbar
      spine, dual hip, total body and both knees receiving a total dose of 740.5µSv which includes
      the additional 23µSv,i.e. the DEXA adds very little extra dose. The lifetime risk of
      developing a cancer resulting from this excess dose is 1 in 1,100,000 for a 50 year old
      patient, (this would fall to 1 in 1,600,000 for a 65 year old patient). For the ages of the
      expected cohort, this is considered to be a negligible risk (Health Protection Agency Centre
      for Radiation Chemical and Environmental Hazards (HPA-CRCE) 028, 2011 and National Radiation
      Protection Board (NRPB), 2001 and is equivalent to around 3.4 days of natural background
      radiation in the UK.

      The patients who undergo 1 additional dual energy CT examination of the knee will receive a
      total dose of 890.5µSv, which includes 23 µSv for the DEXA studies and a dose of 150µSv for
      the CT. Their total additional dose is 173 µSv. The lifetime risk of developing a cancer from
      this excess dose is 1 in 150,000 for a 50 year old patient, (this would fall to 1 in 218,000
      for a 65 year old patient). For the ages of the expected cohort, this is considered to be a
      very low risk (HPA-CRCE-028, 2011 and NRPB, 2001) and is equivalent to around 0.8 of a month
      of natural background radiation in the UK.

      Monitoring Adverse Events/Stopping the Study:

      A log of adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse device effects and serious adverse
      device effects will be kept by the study coordinator. Any such event events occurring in the
      immediate peri and post-operative events should be reported to the study coordinator by the
      consultant surgeon in charge of the case who will contact the study sponsor within the time
      frames as specified by them. Similarly any such adverse events may be identified in clinic
      and again, the surgeon concerned should report these back to the study coordinator to be
      logged and the sponsor will be informed.

      It is possible that adverse events will occur that are dealt with either by the Accident and
      Emergency (A+E) department, the patient's GP or other hospitals. These may not be readily
      apparent to the research team. Therefore the team will specifically ask participants to
      inform their surgeon if any complications or adverse events occur and similarly ask the
      surgeons to specifically ask their patients for this information at each clinic attendance.

      A meeting of the research team will be held on a 3 monthly basis to discuss progress of the
      study, any specific problems and to consider whether there are any justifications for
      stopping the study. As all 3 techniques being studied of performing rTKR are already part of
      routine practice, and it is not anticipated that an unexpected complication will be
      identified that would necessitation an early termination of the study.
