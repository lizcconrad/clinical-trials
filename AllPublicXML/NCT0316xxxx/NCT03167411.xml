  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the drug-drug interaction in your body when given the
      study drug, bexagliflozin, with one of the most commonly prescribed glucagon-like peptide 1
      receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) exenatide. The study will also evaluate how safe the study drug
      is and how well the study drug is tolerated when administered with exenatide injection.
