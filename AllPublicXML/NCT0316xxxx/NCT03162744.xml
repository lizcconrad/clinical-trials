  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicidal intentionality is generally stronger among the elderly, suicidal acts are more
      violent and are combined with a greater physical fragility. The suicide of an older adult is
      a situation that often leads to helplessness feelings.

      Analysis of the literature reveals two types of major interventions in order to reduce
      suicide rate: reducing risk factors and increasing protective factors. Risk factors are well
      documented, particularly from studies using psychological autopsies. However, protective
      factors are much less studied for the elderly. Yet the identification of relevant and
      available protective mechanisms in a suicidal crisis is essential to effectively guide nurses
      and health professionals in therapeutic commitment and intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      France has a suicide rate (16.2 per 100 000 inhabitants) well above the European average rate
      (10.2 per 100 000 inhabitants). The Poitou-Charentes region is in a situation of excess
      mortality by suicide compared to France (+ 25%). While the ratio of suicide attempts per
      suicide is about 200/1 before 25 years, it is estimated to be 4/1 after 65 years, or even 1/1
      in elderly men. In France, suicide attempts are not systematically recorded and the frequency
      of suicidal ideation is poorly understood. The consensus conference on suicidal crisis
      highlights a number of clinical points specific to the elderly population (suicidal ideas are
      not always clearly expressed or unidentified, there are various manifestations of the psychic
      crisis, greater vulnerability of this population), but the complexity of interactions between
      suicidal risk factors limits our predictive capabilities of suicidal intention in an elderly
      person. Analysis of the literature reveals two types of major interventions in order to
      reduce the suicide rate: those aimed at reducing risk factors and those aimed at increasing
      protective factors. The objective of our research is to determine the effect of protective
      factor methodical search on post-crisis patient care.
