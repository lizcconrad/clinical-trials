  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators propose to use mucosal impedance (MI), a minimally invasive
      technology, to detect mucosal damage (i.e. barrier dysfunction) based on mucosal conductivity
      changes in the colonic epithelium.

      The intestinal epithelium functions to separate luminal contents from the interstitium.
      Increased intestinal permeability can represent compromise of the epithelium's integrity.
      Prior research has demonstrated that defects in intestinal barrier function are associated
      with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and increased intestinal permeability can be important
      in the maintenance of remission in IBD patients. There is currently not a convenient way to
      measure colonic epithelial barrier function in real time which could provide clinically
      relevant information .

    <description>During routine colonoscopy, consented study participants will have a MI catheter sensor positioned along the mucosal wall to measure resistance across the mucosa. The physician will take measurements in each segment of the colon, including segments that appear inflamed and normal adjacent areas (up to 10 locations). To obtain a stable reading, the sensor must remain in contact with the mucosa for five seconds. The study procedure will add approximately 1-2 minutes of anesthesia time for each participant. Basic demographic information, prior IBD treatments, and prior colonoscopic data will be collected from the medical record following the procedure for those patients who consent to research.</description>

        Patients will be identified by physicians in the endoscopy center at Vanderbilt. Those
        patients undergoing colonoscopy for either the indication of screening colonoscopy or IBD
        surveillance will be asked, on the day of their colonoscopy, whether they want to
        participate in the study.
