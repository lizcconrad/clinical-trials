  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is a genetic rare disease, which alters the adrenal
      production of gluco and mineralo cortico√Øds. The treatment consists in supplementing children
      with hydrocortisone. Despite care for these children has improved substantially across
      decades, short adult height (AH) still remains an important consequence of the disease. About
      20% of patients have an AH below 2 standard deviations compared to their expected AH.

      In the OPALE-Model study, the investigators want to collect data from a cohort of 496 CAH
      French patients, born between 1970 and 1991 with a known genotype. Using their age, sex,
      growth, disease, bone maturation and pubertal data, the investigators will build a model
      which allows to predict their AH using data available at 8 years of age. The growth charts
      built from this cohort have shown that currently used formula to calculate the predicted AH
      (Bayley-Pineau's formula) is not applicable to children with CAH.

      In this project, the investigators plan to compute an AH prediction model using data from
      children born between 1970 and 1993, and to validate the model using data from a different
      cohort (i.e. children born between 1994 and 1998). this choice was due to availability of
      data for computing the model first, and in a second stage, data from more recently born
      patients.
