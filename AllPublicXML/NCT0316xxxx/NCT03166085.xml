    <description>The MTD will be the dose level at which 0/6 or 1/6 patients experience excessive toxicity with the next higher dose having at least 2/3 or 2/6 patients experiencing excessive toxicity. This means that if only 3 patients have been treated at a particular dose level and none of them had excessive toxicity, another 3 patients will be treated to verify that no more than 1 out of 6 patients had excessive toxicity.</description>

    <description>PU-H71 will be given as an intravenous infusion on Day 1 of a 21 day cycle and nab-paclitaxel will be administered at a dose of 260mg/m2 intravenously on Day 1. Both drugs will be administered on the same day, in sequence, with nab-paclitaxel being administered first followed by administration of PU-H71 as close as possible to 6 hours later (+/-1 hour). PU-H71 will be administered intravenously over a 1 hour period; nab-paclitaxel will be administered per standard guidelines as a 30-minute intravenous infusion.</description>
