    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2a, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability, anti-tumor activity, and immunogenicity of MEDI0457 (also known as INO 3112) a
      HPV DNA vaccine in combination with durvalumab (also known as MEDI4736) which is a human
      monoclonal antibody directed against PD-L1, which blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1
      and CD80.

      An initial three to 12 patients (Safety Analysis Run-in patients) will be enrolled and
      assessed for safety before additional patients are enrolled.

      The initial safety analysis run-in patients along with an approximate total of 50 patients
      with human papilloma virus associated recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell
      cancer will be enrolled in this study and evaluated also for anti-tumor efficacy to MEDI0457
      in combination with durvalumab.
