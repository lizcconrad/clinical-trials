        Adult patients who were diagnosed with metastatic melanoma and initiated at least 1
        treatment for metastatic melanoma after 2011 will be identified from the IMS PharMetrics
        Plus US Claims Database and included in the study sample. Patients must have had continuous
        enrollment in their healthcare plan for at least 6 months before and at least 6 weeks after
        the index date. The population from the CheckMate-067 (CA209-067) clinical trial will also
        be included. The population consists of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study
        drug.
