      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), or median neuropathy at the wrist, is a medical condition in
      which the median nerve is compressed at the wrist, leading to paresthesia, numbness and
      muscle weakness in the hand. It's the most common neuro-compressive disease. With the
      development of the modern life, the morbidity of CTS is also raised. As a common disease, the
      study on etiology is very important in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, which can improve the life
      quality of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. The risk factors include individual factors
      such as age, gender, diabetes, Hypothyroidism, obesity, complication of systematic diseases,
      tobacco, injury and occupational factors.

      As most of the research were based on the population in western country and the life style
      and the ethnicity between Chinese people and western country people is quite different, there
      may be some similarities and differences in epidemiology. There is seldom similar research in
      China so that this study was conducted to observe the characteristics of these risk factors
      in Chinese population.

    <description>age between 41 and 70years. People in the case group with the symptom &quot;numbness&quot; and then were clinical and neural-electrophysiological diagnosed CTS. People in the control group would be exclude the symptom &quot;numbness&quot;. The case group included clinical diagnosed carpal tunnel syndrome which was divided into 4 parts every 10 years old age. The gender of the patients of the control group was matched to the case group and divided into 4 parts by age.</description>

    <description>The present case-control study was based on the single medical center in Shanghai, China, in which more than 5000 CTS patients per year are treated. The hospital involved in the study is a university teaching hospital. Cases were recruited from the surgical wards and appropriate outpatient clinics, while the controls were recruited from the outpatient clinics. Both groups filled out a standardized questionnaire, and a standardized patient record was filled out by a hand surgeon. In addition, participants with jobs involving lifting and carrying of loads were interviewed.</description>
