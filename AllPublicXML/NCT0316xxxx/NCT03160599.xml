  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant gliomas are the most common type of brain tumor. Standard therapy for glioblastoma
      multiforme (GBM) includes surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Despite optimal
      treatment the prognosis remains poor. There is an urgent need for more effective therapies.
      The Warburg effect has been widely observed in human cancers. The main energy supply of tumor
      cells are aerobic glycolysis. Therefore, they are highly dependent on glucose metabolism.
      Recently, some scholars have suggested that 'Restricted calorie Ketogenic Diet (RKD)' might
      be able to inhibit glycolysis and thus anti-tumor by restricting carbohydrate intake. This
      will 'starve' cancer cells, which will lead to cell death. There are many animal and in vitro
      studies shown that RKD can reduce the tumor size and thus tumor cell growth of malignant
      glioma in mice. However, a consistent positive result can not be found within a small sample
      of clinical trials. In this study, 50 patients with malignant glioma will be treated with or
      without RKD. The safety and efficacy of RKD and the patients' tolerance will be observed in
      order to understand whether this therapy can be a potential new treatment of malignant glioma
      in the brain. This clinical study is comparatively large internationally. It is the first
      domestically. If it is successful, it can be applied to other areas of tumor. This study is
      essential to extend the survival of patients with malignant glioma, and to study clinical
      nutrition support and its metabolic pathways for malignant tumor.

The safety and tolerability of the treatment will be evaluated.This can be measured by reports of adverse incidences.</description>

    <description>Calorie restriction: The basis of dietary design is 70-85% of individual's total calories. The total calorie is based on patient's activity level and their basal metabolism values, which is obtained from indirect calorimetry or harris-benedict formula.
Treatment will consist of ketogenic diet. KD will consist of 4:1-1:1[fat]:[protein+carbohydrate].Carbohydrate is limited to 10-30 g / day.The diet will be supplemented with vitamins, calcium, phosphorus, zinc and selenium supplements to meet the requirements of US Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) standard.</description>

             permitted)

          2. Any systemic illness or unstable medical condition that might pose additional risk,
