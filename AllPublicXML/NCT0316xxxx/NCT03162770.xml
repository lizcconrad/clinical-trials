    <textblock>
      This protocol of meditation is based on mindfulness program proposes to train meditation
      during the hemodialysis session. The investigators hypothesize that this program offered
      during hemodialysis session may promote well-being, reduce symptoms of stress and depression
      reported by the patients, which ultimately may improve biochemical parameters resulting from
      better adherence to treatment. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of mindfulness meditation
      practice in patients on chronic hemodialysis, in order to verify if this training can improve
      symptoms of depression, stress, quality of life and sleep disturbances. Methods: fifty
      patients will be separated in two groups, twenty five each group, half of them in the control
      group (CG) and the other half to the intervention group (IG). The patients will be evaluated
      pre- and pos-protocol.

      Introduction: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects thousands of people in the world,
      regardless of gender, race and age. CKD requires dialysis or renal transplant. In the case of
      dialysis, cardiovascular and infectious events adversely impact the survival and quality of
      life despite technological advances. Recently, brain-renal interaction has emerged as a key
      aspect for understanding the neurological disorders-related to CKD, such as cerebrovascular
      diseases, cognitive impairment, and autonomic, sensory and motor neuropathies. In addition,
      patients on chronic hemodialysis develop sleep disorders, like insomnia and central apnea,
      restless leg syndrome, depression, anxiety and stress. Mindfulness meditation practice has
      been reported to positively affect cardiovascular parameters, since that practice contributes
      to the decrease in blood pressure levels and premature heart beats occurrence through
      sympathetic nerve modulation, which collectively may lead to improve the quality of life.
      Objectives: To evaluate the effects of mindfulness meditation practice in patients on chronic
      hemodialysis, in order to verify if this training can improve symptoms of depression, stress,
      quality of life and sleep quality. Methods: fifty patients will be separated in two groups,
      twenty five each group, half of them in the control group (CG) and the other half in the
      intervention group (IG). The IG will be enrolled in the meditation protocol, for 12 weeks, 3
      days a week during the hemodialysis session, while the CG will wait. Then after the
      evaluations, the CG will receive the intervention of meditation, while the IG will not
      receive any intervention. The groups will be evaluate before, 3-and 6-month follow-up
      periods. We will apply the following instruments: ICED (Index of coexistent diseases), KDQOL
      (Kidney Disease Quality of Life), BDI (Beck Depression Inventory), PSQI (Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Index), PSS (Perceived Stress Scale), MAAS (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale) and
      SCS (Self-Compassion Scale).

    <description>SCS (Self-Compassion Scale):
The answers are given on a likert scale (1- &quot;almost never&quot; to 5 &quot;almost always&quot;), when the answers are not compassionate they must be calculated inversely.
The scale is subdivided into 6 sub-scales of each of the three mechanisms in their positive and negative characteristics (mindfulness vs. over-identification, self-kindness versus self-judgment, and common humanity vs. isolation). &quot;Global self-pity scores were calculated by inversely encoding the items of self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification, adding up to the six sub-scales.</description>

    <description>ICED (Index of coexistent diseases): The utilization of ICED enables stratifying the dialysis patients according to severity of their comorbidities and it is useful to identify the patients with a greater risk of death and hospitalization, as well as to aid in the forecast of and optimization of resources necessary for their treatment. The ICED aggregates the presence and severity of 19 medical conditions and 11 physical impairments within two scales: the Index of Disease Severity (IDS) and the Index of Physical Impairment (IPI). The final ICED score is determined by an algorithm combining the peak scores for the IDS and IPI. The range of the ICED is from 0 to 3, reflecting increasing severity ( 0 - normal, 1 - mild, 2- moderate, 3- severe).</description>
