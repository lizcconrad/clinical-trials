  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective-observational, explorative single-centre cohort study aimed to
      examine the atherosclerosis progression in coronary arteries compared to peripheral vessels
      (carotids, femoral arteries). Atherosclerotic alterations in peripheral vessels (IMT, plaque
      volume, plaque morphology) will be measured with ultrasound (IMT measurements and 3D
      quantitative plaque volumetry), whereas atherosclerotic alterations in coronary arteries will
      be tested with cardiac computertomography (CT) (coronary artery calcium score, calcium volume
      score, plaque morphology).

      A total of 55 patients without prior known established vascular diseases will be tested.
      Cardiac CT and ultrasonography will be performed initially. After 2 years follow-up CT and
      ultrasound examination will be performed to assess the changes in atherosclerotic burden.
      Initially and after two years plasma samples will be collected and tested for traditional and
      novel cardiovascular risk factors.

      The primary endpoint of the planned study will be the correlation of the atherosclerotic
      progression between coronary arteries and peripheral arteries (carotids, femoral arteries).

      Secondary endpoints will include the correlation of atherosclerotic progression with
      established (hypertension, smoking, diabetes, dyslipidemia) and novel risk factors (hsCRP,
      P-selectin, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), intercellular adhesion molecule-1
      (ICAM-1), CETP TaqIb polymorphism), with cardiovascular event rate, and the additional
      predictive value of atherosclerotic progression compared to an established risk score (SCORE
      Card, FRS). Also plaque morphology will be compared between coronary arteries and peripheral
      vessels.

    <description>Atherosclerotic progression in peripheral vessels (carotids, femoral arteries) will be tested with 3D-ultrasonography and a quantitative 3-D Plaque volumetry will be performed (total plaque volume).Atherosclerotic progression in coronary arteries will be measured with cardiac CT and coronary plaque burden will be assessed (calcium volume score). The percent change of atherosclerotic progression in peripheral vessels (percent change in total plaque volume, mm3) and coronary arteries (percent change in calcium score, Agatston units) will be compared.</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Plaque morphology in peripheral arteries will be measured with ultrasound. Therefore Gray-Weale-Score, Grey scale median and plaque structure will be assessed. For cardiac CT the noncalcifying burden atheroma score and high risk plaque criteria will be measured. Plaque morphology in peripheral arteries as measured by ultrasound and in coronary arteries as determined by CT will be compared in a qualitative manner.</description>
