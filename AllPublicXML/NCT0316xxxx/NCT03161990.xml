  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The functional outcome and quality of life after treatment for an infected hip arthroplasty
      have been found to be significantly worse compared to an uncomplicated arthroplasty. However,
      the type of revision surgery chosen to treat the infection plays a role for the functional
      outcome. The concept of DAIR (debridement, antibiotics and implant retention) has been shown
      to yield god results with respect to infection control in cases of early infection with a
      stable implant and better functional results than a to-stage revision. In patients where
      infection control was achieved after just one DAIR procedure the functional outcome was
      comparable to an uncomplicated primary arthroplasty. However, it is not known if the
      operative approach used for the primary and revision surgery plays a role for the functional
      result after treatment of an infected total hip arthroplasty with DAIR. The project's aim is
      to investigate if the choice of the operative approach (transgluteal or posterior) for the
      primary hip replacement and the revision surgery has an influence on the functional result
      after debridement and implant retention for an infected total hip replacement.

      Potential study participants will be identified in the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register.
      Patients who have been revised once for an infected total hip arthroplasty with debridement
      and implant retention and in whom either the transgluteal og posterior operative approach was
      used in both procedures will be selected. The potential participants will be contacted by
      letter. They will be asked for written informed consent and to fill out three questionnaires:
      the Hip Disability Osteoarthritis Score (HOOS), which also allows for the calculation of the
      Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC), the EQ-5D (quality of
      life) and a questionnaire asking about confirmation that the patient only has been revised
      once for his/her infected arthroplasty, about limping, other complications (nerve injury,
      dislocation, reoperation for other causes than infection), if the infection is considered to
      have been eradicated and overall satisfaction. The data recorded in the Norwegian
      Arthroplasty Register will be used in a multiple linear regression analysis to evaluate if
      the surgical approach is an independent factor influencing the outcome measures.
