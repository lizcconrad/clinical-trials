  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the potent cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4
      inhibitor (itraconazole) on the single-dose PK of oral TAK-906 maleate.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-906. TAK-906 is being tested in healthy
      participants in order to evaluate the effect of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole on
      the single-dose PK of TAK-906 maleate.

      The study will enroll approximately 12 participants. Participants will receive the following
      treatment sequence:

      • TAK-906 maleate 25 mg; Itraconazole 200 mg + TAK-906 maleate 25 mg

      Participants will be given an oral dose of TAK-906 in the First Intervention Period which
      will be followed by a washout period, after which participants will be given Itraconazole
      solution along with TAK-906 orally in the Second Intervention Period.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall duration to
      participate in this study is 7 to 8 weeks. Participants will remain confined in the clinic
      from Day 1 up to Day 2 (First Intervention Period) and Day 4 up Day 6 (Second Intervention
      Period). Participants will return for a Follow-up Visit, 10 to 14 days after last dose of
      study drug.
