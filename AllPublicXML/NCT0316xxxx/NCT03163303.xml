  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will test the efficacy of a 3-month intervention on Facebook targeting tobacco use
      and heavy episodic drinking against a 3-month Facebook intervention targeting tobacco use.
      Both groups will be offered a nicotine patch starter kit. The primary outcome is verified
      7-day point prevalence abstinence from smoking at 3, 6, and 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to one of two conditions: (1) a Facebook-delivered
      intervention addressing tobacco use and heavy episodic drinking, tailored to readiness to
      quit smoking; or (2) a 3-month Facebook intervention targeting tobacco use. Both
      interventions will include 12 weeks of Facebook-based messages and activities tailored to
      participants' readiness to quit smoking.

      Assessments will occur at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up. Assessments will include
      measures on smoking and drinking patterns and thoughts about abstinence. All participants who
      report no past 7-day smoking will be asked to give biochemical verification of smoking status
      with saliva cotinine test kits that will be mailed to participants.
