  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the similarity between QL1101 and Avastin®
      respectively combined with chemotherapy in terms of efficacy and safety in patients with
      non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The study intends to include first-line patients
      with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, and uses QL1101 combined with basic
      chemotherapy CP (paclitaxel + carboplatin). The regimen is consistent with the usage and
      dosage of Avastin® at home and abroad indicated for the treatment of non-squamous non-small
      cell lung cancer.

      The study is a randomized, double-blind, positive drug-controlled, multi-center Phase III
      study. It is planned to enroll 512 treatment-naïve patients with non-squamous non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC). Subjects are randomized into the QL1101 combined with
      paclitaxel/carboplatin or Avastin® combined with paclitaxel/carboplatin treatment group by a
      ratio of 1:1, and stratified by age (≥65 years, &lt;65 years), sex (male, female) and EGFR
      subtype (sensitive mutation type, wild type).

             cancer. Diagnostic result of non-squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer obtained
             based on sputum cytology should be immunohistochemically confirmed. If a variety of
             tumor ingredients are mixed, the main cell types should be classified;

          -  ECOG score of 0-1 points;

          -  Patients who have not received systemic anti-tumor therapy of locally advanced or
             metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (if the subject received adjuvant

             but then the disease relapsed, the subject can be enrolled. In this case, the end time
             of the adjuvant therapy is required to be more than 6 months from the time of the
             first administration of this study, and various toxic reactions resulting from the
             adjuvant therapy should have recovered (≤ Grade 1 by CTCAE 4.03 criteria, except for
             alopecia).

          -  Expected survival time ≥24 weeks.

          -  Subjects must give informed consent to this study prior to the trial and voluntarily
             sign a written informed consent form.

             cell as the main ingredient;

          -  ALK fusion gene is known to be positive;

          -  Medical history or examination shows thrombotic disease within 6 months prior to

             radiologist must exclude patients whose tumor has been completely close to or
             surrounded or invaded the lumen of large vessels (e.g., the superior pulmonary artery
             or superior vena cava);

          -  Patients with a past history of symptomatic brain metastases or meningeal metastases,
             or spinal cord compression;

          -  Patients who received palliative radiotherapy for bone lesions outside the chest
             within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of the study drug;

          -  Patients who received major surgical procedures (including thoracotomy), or suffered
             from major trauma (such as fractures) within 28 days prior to screening, or need to
             undergo major surgery during the expected study treatment period;

          -  Patients who received a minor surgical procedure within 48 hours prior to the first

          -  Patients who are currently using or have recently used (within 10 days prior to the

          -  Patients whose medical history or examination shows hereditary bleeding tendency or
             coagulation disorders, which may increase the risk of bleeding; -Uncontrolled
             hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;150 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt;100
