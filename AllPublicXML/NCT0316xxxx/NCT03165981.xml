  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized open-label clinical trial that will be conducted during the
      2017-2018 influenza season. During the 2017-2018 season, approximately 280 children will be
      enrolled at Duke University Medical Center and Kaiser Permanente Northern California.
      Eligible children will be randomized to receive simultaneous or sequentially administered US
      licensed PCV13, US-licensed DTaP vaccine, and US-licensed inactivated influenza vaccine
      (IIV). Children in the simultaneous group will receive PCV13, DTaP, and IIV vaccines at Visit
      1, and then return for a health education visit without vaccination about 2 weeks later
      (Visit 2). Children in the sequential group will receive both PCV13 and DTaP without IIV at
      Visit 1, and then will receive IIV and health education about 2 weeks later (Visit 2).
      Parents will record the occurrence of fever, solicited adverse events, medical care
      utilization, and receipt of antipyretics over 8 days following Visit 1 and Visit 2. In
      addition, febrile seizures and serious adverse events will be recorded for the entire study
      period (from enrollment through 8 days following the Visit 2) as determined through parental
      report and chart review. Parental perceptions about their child's vaccine schedule will be
      assessed on the 8th day following Visit 2.
