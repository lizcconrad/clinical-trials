    <textblock>
      RESPOND-HF is a prospective, multi-center, non-significant risk pilot study with cross-over
      design. The purpose of the study is to investigate if rate adaptive pacing has the potential
      to provide benefit to HF patients with preserved ejection fraction, referred to as HFpEF
      patients. Findings from this pilot study may be used to guide subsequent efforts to design
      and conduct a prospective, randomized, multi-center pivotal trial powered to show improvement
      in patient outcomes.

      The RESPOND-HF is a prospective, multi-center, investigational, pilot study with cross-over
      design. Patients with existing pacemakers who have been diagnosed with HFpEF and meet study
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be included in the study.

      The study is expected to be conducted at up to 5 centers in the United States and up to 300
      patients will be consented to enroll up to 100 qualifying patients . Up to 60 patients
      meeting chronotropic incompetence (CI) criterion will be enrolled. The study will be
      conducted in subjects who have previously (≥ 30 days) been implanted with Medtronic, dual
      chamber pacemaker (IPG) device with rate adaptive pacing (RAP) feature. Additionally, up to
      40 patients who do not meet CI criterion will be enrolled to collect ambulatory activity and
      heart rate data using AVIVO/SEEQ patch. These patients will be followed for only 1 week. It
      is estimated that subject enrollment will take approximately 12 to 18 months, with a study
      follow-up of 18 weeks.

    <intervention_model_description>To assess whether rate adaptive pacing provides benefit to HFpEF patients, a pool of up to 60 qualifying subjects with pre-existing pacemaker and established diagnosis of HFpEF who demonstrate chronotropic incompetence (CI) with RAP turned off will be enrolled.
Subjects who meet CI criterion during Visit 2 will be randomized. Subjects' principal investigator and study team will be blinded to the randomization assignment. However clinical site personnel performing the device programming will not be blinded. Site personnel performing the CPET and 6-min hall walk assessments will be blinded to the randomization assignment.
Crossover of study subjects will occur during Visit 3, which will occur 12 weeks after subject enrollment. Subjects who were randomized with RAP ON first will have the device programmed to RAP OFF and conversely, subjects who were randomized to RAP OFF first will have the device programmed to RAP ON.</intervention_model_description>
