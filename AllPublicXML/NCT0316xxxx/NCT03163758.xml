  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to figure out brain structural and functional reorganization evidence after
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation through the method of neuroimaging brain network
      analysis, such as resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor
      imaging.

    <measure>functional connectivity (FC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline FC at 1 month after real rTMS/sham rTMS</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Connectivity was examined using a seed-based voxel-wise correlation approach. The ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1) was defined as the region of interest. Pearson's correlation analysis between the time course of the ipsilesional M1 and that of every voxel in the whole brain was computed for a map of correlation coefficients, which were Fisher's z-transformed and called as z-FC maps.</description>

    <intervention_name>real Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>The rTMS treatments were performed using a Medtronic MagPro type magnetic stimulation device (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and a figure-of-eight coil (MC-B70, Medtronic). Coils were placed tangent to the scalp. The stimulation protocol involved 50 trains of 20 pulses applied over the ipsilesional M1 at a frequency of 5 HZ, with the stimulus intensity set at 120% of the resting motor threshold of the unaffected extremity.</description>

    <description>The sham rTMS was performed on the same site as the rTMS treatment group but without any true stimulations. Coils were placed perpendicular to the scalp.</description>
