  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated, single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind,
      interventional phase IIb study. Forty patients with clinically and histologically confirmed
      nummular eczema will be enrolled according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients will
      be included after written informed consent is obtained. Prior to randomization, average
      application rate of class II topical steroids per day will be measured for 4 weeks.
      Subsequently, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into one arm to receive Apremilast
      30 mg BID (following titration phase) for 16 weeks or a second arm receiving identically
      matching placebo for 16 weeks. From beginning of week 17, all patients will start an
      open-label treatment with Apremilast 30 mg BID until week 32. Concomitant use of topical
      steroids (class II) is allowed during the study. During the treatment period both placebo and
      Apremilast will be applied p.o. from week 0 until week 32.
