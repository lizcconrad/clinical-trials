      A) The main purposes of this study are (i) to develop a related virtual reality (VR)
      environment in order to judge the nighttime driving ability under mesopic and under glare
      conditions (ophthalmologically healthy subjects and patients with incipient to intermediate
      cataract, i.e. opacities of the human lens, will participate in this study), (ii) to validate
      the above-mentioned VR environment with respect to a related on-road driving scenario under
      mesopic and glare conditions, (iii) to validate clinical photopic and mesopic contrast vision
      tests and glare tests with respect to the prediction of nighttime driving ability, (iv) to
      assess the test retest reliability of clinical photopic and mesopic contrast vision tests

      B) Background:

      An intact mesopic vision and a glare sensitivity within a normal range are essential
      pre-requisites for safe driving at nighttime (DOG &amp; BVA, 2011). Anderson &amp; Holiday (1995)
      have shown that (simulated) opacities of the refractive media (with only minor effects on
      daytime visual acuity) induce a pronounced impairment of contrast sensitivity under nighttime
      conditions. Especially under glare conditions by the headlights of traffic on the opposite
      lane or by stationary street illumination, an impairment of the mesopic vision may cause
      traffic hazards. The prevalence of impairments of the central visual acuity, the mesopic
      vision and the glare sensitivity is significantly higher for subjects being involved in
      nighttime traffic accidents (Lachenmayr, 1998). Furthermore, these impairments occur more
      frequently in aged drivers and are, among others, related to an increase of age-related media
      opacities (Aulhorn &amp; Harms, 1970, Babizhayev, 2003). Due to the demographic change, the
      relevance of nighttime driving ability is increasing in the next years since more and more
      aged employees will participate at the motorized traffic at night.

      The German Fahrerlaubnisverordnung (FEV i.e. driving license regulation) specifies pass/fail
      criteria with regard to mesopic vision and glare sensitivity. The luminance level during
      nighttime driving is usually between 0.01 and 1 cd/m^2, and therefore can be attributed to
      the level of mesopic vision. However, over the last years, the attempt was made to introduce
      photopic contrast sensitivity test to diagnose nighttime driving ability (i.e. testing of
      contrast vision under daytime conditions without time consuming adaptation procedures).
      Current research aims at investigating the relationship between contrast tests under various
      luminance conditions (Wilhelm et al, 2013). It is questionable, whether photopic tests are at
      all reliable predictors with regard to nighttime driving (Gramberg-Danielsen et al., 1984,
      Hertenstein et al., Graefe´s Archive of Ophthalmology, 2016).

      Subjects and Methods Adult patients with a distant binocular visual acuity of ≥ 0.8 (≥ 16/20;
      habitual correction) and healthy control subjects will be included in this explorative study
      after informed consent.

      The study will be subdivided in the following (three) parts:

      Part 1: Validation of the Aalen driving simulator set-up (ten patients with incipient to
      moderate cataract, i.e. opacities of the human lens of varying localization and of various
      degree of expression in at least one eye and ten age- and gender-correlated
      ophthalmologically healthy control subjects will be enrolled) Part 1.1.: Comprehensive
      ophthalmological/optical examination (Aalen University of Applied Sciences) including a
      detailed ophthalmological and medical history.

      Part 1.2.: Baseline driving simulator test under mesopic conditions with/without glare under
      simulated static/simulated driving conditions (Aalen University of Applied Sciences) Part
      1.3.: Baseline on road test under mesopic conditions with/without glare, under on road
      static/on road driving conditions (Aalen University of Applied Sciences) (If possible, the
      sequence of Part 1.2. and Part 1.3. will be randomly assigned.)

      Part 2: Advanced driving simulator test (twenty patients with incipient to moderate cataract,
      i.e. opacities of the human lens of varying localization and of various degree of expression
      in at least one eye and twenty age- and gender-correlated ophthalmologically healthy control
      subjects will be enrolled. Subjects being enrolled in Part 1, will be asked to participate
      also at Part 2 and Part 3.) Part 2.1.: Comprehensive ophthalmological/optical examination of
      all (newly) enrolled patients and subjects who have not already been examined in Part. 1.1.
      (Aalen University of Applied Sciences).

      Part 2.2.: Advanced driving simulator test under photopic and under mesopic simulated driving
      with and without glare (Würzburg Institute for Traffic Sciences = WIVW) in order to
      investigate the influence of glare on the driving behavior

      Part 3: Representative driving simulator test (The [altogether fourty] subjects, enrolled in
      Part 2, will be enrolled in this part of the study.) Driving simulator test under photopic
      and mesopic conditions in oder to investigate glare on representative driving situations.
      Driving performance will be evaluated highly-standardized and partially automated on
      different parameters of operational and tactical driving behavior (S.A.F.E., Würzburg
      Institute for Traffic Sciences = WIVW).

      Pass/fail rates are specified as described in the related manuals of the instruments. With
      regard to visual acuity measurements and assessment of mesopic contrast vision without/with
      glare, results are rated according to DIN 58220 - Part 3/ISO 10938: If less than three out of
      five subsequent presentations of an eight-position LANDOLT C (with two oblique and three
      horizontal/vertical gap locations in random sequence) are correctly identified, the session
      is rated as failed. Overlooking/missing reactions to obstacles (pedestrian [display dummy
      with dark clothing]/wild boar at the right roadside) are rated as failed.

      For mesopic contrast vision testing, single LANDOLT optotpyes (visual acuity level 0.1 =
      2/20) with the contrast levels (1:2, 1:5 and 1:23, respectively, according to AULHORN/HARMS)
      are presented via the Optovist Instrument (Vistec, Inc., Manching/Germany) or via the head up
      display (HUD) of the simulator vehicle/on road vehicle.

      Photopic and mesopic contrast vision tests (without glare) are repeated once in order to
      assess the test retest variability of the related test procedure.
