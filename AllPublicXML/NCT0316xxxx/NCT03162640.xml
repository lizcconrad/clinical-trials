  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis smokers having begun prematurely their consumption (before 16 years) present a
      persistent impulsivity much later after have stopped their consumptions. The literature
      highlights that the impulsivity promotes the passage towards a compulsive consumption, and
      the loss of control. To explain this phenomenon, some authors hypothesized that impulsivity
      would lead the subjects to overestimate the duration of events and to choose immediate
      rewards than preferred but delayed rewards. This hypothesis questions the role of the
      temporal anticipation in the impulsive choices. In a first hypothesis, the temporal
      impulsivity could be an endogenous deficit bound to the reward, and would be responsible for
      disorders of the temporal anticipation. In this case, the disorders should be observed
      especially when the subject anticipates a reward. Alternately, a disorder of the temporal
      anticipation could provoke impulsivity, and in this case, would be present with or without
      reward. To separate these hypotheses, we propose to test the capacities of temporal
      anticipation of non-smokers and early smokers of cannabis by means of a behavioral task &quot;
      Hazard function task &quot;, which allow to measure the capacity of a subject to anticipate the
      apparition of an event on the basis of a temporal cue. The neuronal correlates will be
      measured by a recording EEG of the wave ' CNV ' (fix a quota for denial of variation) which
      reflects the temporal accumulation and the processes of anticipation.
