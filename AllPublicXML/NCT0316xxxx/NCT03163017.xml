  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if use of new imaging technology termed &quot;3D
      fluoroscopy&quot; will lead the surgeon to change the position of the fractured bones to a more
      accurate position.

    <description>Patients with syndesmotic instability will undergo reduction of the syndesmosis followed by provisional fixation with a clamp or Kirshner wire. The reduction quality will be initially compared to the contralateral ankle mortise and talar-dome lateral radiographs using the technique of Summers (2D Fluoroscopy). After the attending surgeon is satisfied with the reduction quality, 3D fluoroscopy will be used to generate additional images to assess syndesmotic reductions.</description>
