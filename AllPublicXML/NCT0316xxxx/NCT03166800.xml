  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether MS patients who receive Oral mitoquinone
      (MitoQ) have less fatigue than those receiving a placebo. A comparison between patient's
      fatigue scored at baseline and fatigue scored 12 weeks after drug initiation will assess if
      MitoQ has a significant change in fatigue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MitoQ is a potent antioxidant dietary supplement with potentially significant
      immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. While the cause of MS related fatigue is
      uncertain, the investigators believe that mitochondria dysfunction and resultant neuronal
      energy depletion may be an important contributor to fatigue in MS.

      This clinical trial will evaluate the potential beneficial effects of MitoQ on MS fatigue. It
      will also explore the effects of MitoQ on cognitive function, quality of life and mood. If
      enrolled in the study, patients will take two capsules of the study drug or placebo at the
      same time every day for twelve weeks. There will be 4 study visits where the participant will
      undergo medical and nervous system examinations, questionnaires, and blood draws. Because it
      is a placebo-controlled trial, participants will have a 33% chance of receiving either
      placebo (inactive), 20mg of MitoQ, or 40mg of MitoQ. This will be a blinded randomized study,
      meaning neither the participant nor the investigator will know who received the placebo or
      study drug.
