  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The paradigm of pre-operative exercise as a neoadjuvant therapy to reduce morbidity is
      increasingly promoted within general surgery and surgical oncology.

      Patients with lung cancer participating in pre-operative exercise have better aerobic
      capacity and pulmonary function and shorter hospital length-of-stay after surgery.
      Additionally, pre-operative exercise may increase the likelihood of resuming exercise
      post-surgery, thereby accelerating the pace of rehabilitation and recovery.

      In order to translate the research findings into sustainable clinical practice,
      clinician-scientists need to develop pragmatic and effective home-based exercise protocols.
      Wearable fitness devices offer a way to approximate the supervision that occurs in exercise
      research.

      Before the investigators can develop an intervention in which patients receive tailored
      support similar to what occurs with supervised exercise, they need to pilot test the
      monitoring aspect of the wearable fitness device in conjunction with the pre-operative
      exercise program. The investigators propose a mixed methods, 16 single arm feasibility study
      of an unsupervised, pre-operative exercise prescription (uPEP) augmented by a wearable
      fitness device. The proposed study of 30 patients scheduled for lung cancer surgery will
      identify the strengths, weaknesses, and utility of this approach.

      The investigators propose a parallel mixed methods, 16 single arm, pre-post study with 30
      participants scheduled for lung cancer surgery. At time of enrollment (at least 3 weeks
      before their scheduled surgery), participants will complete baseline assessments, receive the
      uPEP exercise prescription, and be oriented to the wearable fitness device. A research
      assistant will call the participant to conduct an audiotaped semi-structured interview
      regarding the acceptability of the electronically-monitored uPEP within 7- 14 days of
      enrollment. The study team will complete follow-up assessments on the day of surgery, two
      weeks after surgery, and four months after surgery. Data will also be collected from chart
      review and the wearable fitness device throughout the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  This study will recruit English-speaking patients who:

               1. Are over the age of 18 and diagnosed with Stage I-III lung cancer;

               2. Are able to tolerate surgery (i.e., segmentectomy, lobectomy or bilobectomy) as
                  indicated by standard clinical pre-op evaluation, including pulmonary function
                  tests and cardiac evaluation (if indicated);

               3. Access to either Wi-Fi or cellular service and permission/ability to download the
                  wearable fitness device app on an apple device, android, or computer (or
                  willingness to use a study-provided iPod to allow the data to be uploaded to the
                  study team);

               4. Are able to provide voluntary, written consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be excluded based on electronic health record (EHR) review (after
             obtaining HIPAA waiver) if they:

               1. Have a life expectancy of &lt; 12 months or are receiving hospice services;

               2. Have a psychiatric diagnosis that would require significant study modification to
                  meet their needs such as uncontrolled severe mental illness, substance abuse, or
                  active suicidal ideation;

               3. Exhibit American College of Sports Medicine contraindications to exercise which
                  include a resting heart rate of &gt;120bpm, blood pressure &gt;180/100mmHg or unstable
                  angina;31

               4. Are unable to walk or to complete the 6-minute walk test. According to our
                  current standard of care, those participants will be referred to physical therapy
                  for evaluation and treatment and will be excluded from the study as unsupervised
                  exercise would not be safe.
