  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the project is to identify a molecular signature of tumor stroma from &quot;normal&quot;
      adjacent breast tissue obtained prospectively at the time of breast conserving surgery before
      and after receiving intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) in subjects that have luminal A
      and triple negative breast cancer. IORT is considered as being standard of care.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that the normal tissue around a tumor plays a role in determining how the
      tumor behaves, including how it responds to treatments and how likely it is to recur.

    <description>This outcome measure is designed to measure the amount of TILs in newly diagnosed luminal A and Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) tumors. The mean percent change in TILS in tumor tissue from initial core biopsy samples will be compared with pathology samples from definitive surgery after IORT between the two different breast cancer sub-types.</description>

      Two specimens will be collected. A shaved margin of the area surrounding the tumor,
      considered as &quot;normal&quot; tissue, will be collected at two time points. The tissue will be
      collected prior to intraoperative radiation therapy, and immediately after. Blood will also
      be collected.
