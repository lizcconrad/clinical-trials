      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether increased mutant ESR1 allele fraction in
      plasma ctDNA 3-6 weeks after initiating salvage endocrine therapy is predictive of
      progression free survival in patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer.

      The primary objective of this 110 patient correlative biomarker study is to evaluate whether
      changes in mutant ESR1 allele fraction in plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) are predictive
      of progression-free survival in metastatic ER+ breast cancer patients who are receiving 2nd,
      3rd, or 4th line systemic endocrine therapy. A secondary goal of this study is to explore the
      prevalence and kinetics of hotspot and non-hotspot ctDNA ESR1 mutations in this patient
      population, prior to initiating a new line of endocrine therapy as well as upon clinical
      progression, to identify potential mechanisms of resistance. Although initially to be opened
      at UNC Chapel Hill, our goal is to expand enrollment to include Rex Cancer Center in Raleigh,
      North Carolina, and collaborating institutions through the Translational Breast Cancer
      Research Consortium.
