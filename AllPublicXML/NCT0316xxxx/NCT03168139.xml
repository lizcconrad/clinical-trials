    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show that the type, number and/or distribution of tumor
      metastases infiltrating immune cells such as cytotoxic T cells and/or the cytokine signature
      in the tumor metastases can be modulated by treatment with olaptesed pegol and to explore
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of olaptesed pegol in combination with pembrolizumab as a
      basis for subsequent studies in combination with immunotherapies, in particular checkpoint
      inhibitors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Olaptesed pegol (NOX-A12) targets a key chemokine in the tumor microenvironment, CXCL12,
      which is naturally involved in the homeostasis of blood and immune cells. In cancer, CXCL12
      acts as a communication bridge between tumor cells and their environment. In particular, it
      confers resistance to checkpoint inhibitors through T-cell exclusion in preclinical models.
      The hypothesis is that inactivation of CXCL12 by olaptesed pegol induces changes in the tumor
      microenvironment of patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer which render the tumors
      more susceptible to immuno-oncological approaches such as checkpoint inhibition.
