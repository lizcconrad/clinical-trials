    <textblock>
      This is an open-label positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) study to
      investigate the diagnostic performance and evaluation efficacy of 68Ga-NOTA-RM26 in prostate
      cancer patients. A single dose of 111-148 Mega-Becquerel (MBq) 68Ga-NOTA-RM26 will be
      injected intravenously. Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT
      images.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), also known as bombesin receptor subtype II
      (BB2), is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family of bombesin receptors. GRPR is
      over-expressed in various types of human tumors including prostate cancer. RM26, a GRPR
      antagonist with high affinity, was discovered by peptide backbone modification of bombesin
      analogues.To target gastrin-releasing peptide receptor in neoplastic cells of human prostate
      cancer, peptide NOTA-RM26 was synthesized with a PEG3 linker between NOTA and RM26, and then
      labeled with 68Ga. An open-label whole-body PET/ CT study was designed to investigate the
      safety and dosimetry of 68Ga-NOTA-RM26 and to assess its clinical diagnostic value in
      patients with prostate cancer.
