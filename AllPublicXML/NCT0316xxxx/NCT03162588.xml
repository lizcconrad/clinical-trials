    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the indirect revascularization outcomes of a
      new combination therapy of multiple burrhole procedure with promotion of arteriogenesis by
      intravenous (IV) erythropoietin (EPO) pretreatment on Moyamoya patients with acute
      neurological presentation, and outline the clinical and vascular factors associated with
      revascularization through the burrholes.

    <textblock>
      This is a investigator led, single-center, single arm, interventional trial in prospective
      Moyamoya disease (MMD) and Moyamoya syndrome (MMS) registry. MMD or MMS patients with acute
      neurological presentation such as ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack are eligible.

      After inclusion, initial evaluation including transfemoral angiography is performed. A 3 day
      pre-procedure IV erythropoietin (120000 international units[IU] #3) is given for promotion of
      arteriogenesis, than multiple burrhole procedure is performed. Arteriogenesis is evaluated by
      6 month transfemoral angiography.

    <description>Epokine®, CJ healthcare, South Korea is used preprocedurally to promote revascularization. Total 120,000 units of EPO is injected for three consecutive days, 40,000 units mixed in IV saline 100 ml over 1 hour. The multiple burrhole procedure is performed in area of hemodynamic insufficiency by D-SPECT. It is performed under local anesthesia.</description>
