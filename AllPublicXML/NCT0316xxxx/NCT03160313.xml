  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a 10-week
      interdisciplinary and multimodal intervention that utilizes patient education, group
      discussion, and supervised exercise for Veterans with a history of traumatic brain injury
      (TBI). Primary outcomes include physical activity (PA), sleep quality, and community
      integration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will have a sample size of 24. Veterans between the ages of
      18 and 65 in the Polytrauma and TBI program who are greater than 1 year post injury prior to
      entering the study, will be recruited. After randomization participants in the intervention
      group will complete a 10 week bout of multidisciplinary wellness education, group discussion,
      and supervised exercise. The intervention will occur weekly and last up to 2 hours. The
      control group will complete a 10week comprehensive health education program simultaneously.
      All measures will be collected again, post intervention. A follow-up collection will occur at
      3 months post-intervention.

    <description>Each session includes a 45-minute education and group discussion. A 60-minute exercise component then completes the session. Each topic was specifically picked and tailored to benefit Veterans with TBI. The education sessions will be led and moderated by different professionals including physical therapists, recreation therapists, and physicians. Participants will be asked to participate in several learning activities. The activities are included to help improve understanding and promote group discussion. The exercise piece consists of a warm-up, endurance training (20-30 minutes), strengthening (15 minutes), balance/cognitive training (15 minutes), and a cool-down.</description>
