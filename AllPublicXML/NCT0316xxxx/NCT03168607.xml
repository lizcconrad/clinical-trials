    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no standard second line treatment for patients with neuroendocrine
      carcinoma. Irinotecan monotherapy or combination regimen has shown promising in previous
      study. The study was designed to confirm thet FOLFIRI regimen can be used as a second-line
      regimen for patients with advanced or metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma who have progressed
      after first-line chemotherapy with platinum based regimen.

             lesions);

          6. Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria (within past 7 days):
             hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL; neutrophils ≥ 1500 cells/ μL; platelets ≥ 100 x 10^3/ μL; total
             bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); aspartic transaminase (AST) and alanine
             transaminase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN without, and ≤ 5 x ULN with hepatic metastasis; serum
             creatinine ≤1╳ULN;

          7. KPS ≥ 70;

          8. Predicted survival &gt;=3 months;

          3. Received surgery within past 4 weeks, or have not recovered from surgery;

          4. Severe diarrhea;

          5. Concurrent severe infection；

          6. Severe, uncontrolled medical condition that would affect patients' compliance or
             obscure the interpretation of toxicity determination or adverse events, including
             severe liver disease (active hepatitis, cirrhosis), uncontrolled diabetes or
             hypertension, or pulmonary disease ( interstitial pneumonia, obstructive pulmonary
             disease or symptomatic bronchospasm);

          7. Prior long term steroid therapy (excluding short term steroid treatment which is
             completed prior to &gt; 2 weeks of study enrollment)；

          8. Meningeal carcinomatosis;

          9. Patients with central nervous system(CNS) disorder or peripheral nervous system
             disorder or psychiatric disease；

         10. Known history of uncontrolled or symptomatic angina, uncontrolled arrhythmias and
             hypertension, or congestive heart failure, or cardiac infarction within 6 months prior
             to study enrollment, or cardiac insufficiency；

         11. Pregnant or nursing, or sexually active males or females refuse to practice
             contraception during the study until 30 days after end of study;

         12. History of other malignancy. However, subjects who have been disease-free for 5 years,
             or subjects with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer or
             successfully treated in situ carcinoma, are eligible；

         13. Person with no capacity (legally) or inappropriate to continue study treatment for
             ethics/medical reasons；

         14. Underlying medical condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, would increase the
             risks of study drug administration or obscure the interpretation of toxicity
             determination or adverse events.
