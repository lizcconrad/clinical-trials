  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGANs), i.e. those born at &lt;28 weeks, frequently
      experience intermittent hypoxemic/hyperoxemic episodes. Observational data indicate that
      severe and prolonged hypoxemic episodes are associated with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP),
      impaired long-term development and death. Closed-loop automated control of the inspiratory
      fraction of oxygen (FiO2-C) reduces time outside the oxygen target range, decreases number
      and duration of hypo- and hyperoxemic episodes, and reduces caregivers' workload. The
      proposed observer-blinded randomized controlled trial was designed and will be powered to
      compare the effect of FiO2-C in addition to manual adjustments, in comparison with manual
      adjustments of FiO2 only, on death and severe complications of prematurity thought to be
      related to hypoxia/hyperoxia and neurodevelopmental impairment in ELGANs. The results of this
      trial may help to improve the quality of life of ELGANs and reduce the burden of significant
      morbidity as well as costs for health care and society
