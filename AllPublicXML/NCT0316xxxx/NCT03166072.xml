    <textblock>
      To conduct a pilot single-center, single blind longitudinal randomized controlled trial to
      evaluate health related quality of life (HRQoL) of low-vision patients and their care givers
      undergoing low-vision rehabilitation program (LVRP). LVRP includes functional vision
      assessments (low-vision refraction), prescription of a variety of visual aids including
      microscopes, magnifiers, telescopes, absorptive filters and electronic spectacle eyewear,
      large print books, and automatic self-transcending meditation plus essential skills for daily
      living and mobility training offered by Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB)
      including demonstration of visual aids as well as training on proper use of visual aids.
