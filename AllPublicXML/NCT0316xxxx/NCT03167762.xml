  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is used to treat some types of sun-damaged skin and low-grade
      forms of growths. A cream is applied to the skin, and the chemical in this cream is absorbed
      in to the skin and converted in to a 'photosensitiser'. This photosensitiser is fluorescent,
      meaning that it produces red light when blue light is shone on it. By measuring how much
      light is given off with a camera, the investigators can determine how much photosensitiser is
      present in the skin. Also, it is thought that more of the chemical is converted to the active
      photosensitiser if the skin is warmer, so the investigators plan to measure the temperature
      of the skin using a thermal camera. Light is shone on to the skin and this activates the
      photosensitiser, treating the problem area and leaving healthy skin intact. This research
      will increase the investigators understanding of how PDT works, and may help the
      investigators to improve treatment regimens so that they can be made more effective and
      better tolerated

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Is there a correlation between body site temperature and degree of fluorescence prior to and/or during PDT</measure>
    <time_frame>12months</time_frame>
    <description>Body site temperature is measured before and during PDT (in degrees Celsius) as is fluorescence signal (in arbitrary fluorescence units). These are compared for each time point in the treatment for each patient.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Is there a correlation between temperature and/or fluorescence and treatment outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>12months</time_frame>
    <description>Following from Outcome 1, these data for each patient will be compared with the clinical outcome (determined visually by Dermatologist) at 3 and 12 months, to see if there is a correlation between either measurements and clinical outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>How does the spatial distribution of fluorescence and temperature change prior to and during PDT</measure>
    <time_frame>12months</time_frame>
    <description>Fluorescence and thermal cameras record field of view data, so the investigators can investigate how the fluorescence and thermal distribution in the lesions changes during treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain measured immediately after irradiation</measure>
    <time_frame>12months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain (visual analogue scale 1-10 cm-1) is measured after treatment, and the investigators will check for correlations between this properties and the fluorescence and thermal readings for each patient.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>phototoxicity (inflammation) measured immediately after irradiation</measure>
    <time_frame>12months</time_frame>
    <description>inflammation (measured visually by a Dermatologist) is measured after treatment, and the investigators will check for correlations between this property and the fluorescence and thermal readings for each patient.</description>
