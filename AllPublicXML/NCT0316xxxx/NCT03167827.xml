    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of Physical Training and Supplementation of Isoflavone About
      Pelvic Floor Musculature in Women in the Postmenopausal period, and it has two groups the
      intervetion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The practice of physical exercise and isoflavone supplementation are ways of treating
      symptoms of climacteric, there is a lack of evidence as to whether these therapeutics when
      associated are useful for improving the strength, function, contraction pressure, electrical
      activity of the pelvic floor musculature of women in the Postmenopausal period.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change vaginal squeeze pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>before and after the intervetion ( 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The vaginal squeeze pressure was measured through Perineometer.To obtain the measurements, the subjects remained positioning and vaginal sensor was introduced into the vaginal cavity. The women were oriented and motivated verbally to perform three voluntary maximal contractions sustained for five seconds and one minute interval between them. Outcome Measure of the vaginal squeeze pressure is cmH20 or Pascal.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change Muscle function</measure>
    <time_frame>before and after the intervetion (10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;PFM&quot; evaluation was performed by vaginal palpation .During vaginal palpation the physiotherapist introduced the index and middle fingers about 4cm inside the vagina, and requested to hold the maximum contraction of the &quot;PFM&quot;. Muscle function was classified by the Oxford Scale Modified that five grades of the force.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change electromyography pelvic floor</measure>
    <time_frame>before and after the intervetion (10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;PFM&quot; electromyographic activity was collected during the resting to normalize the EMG data. No instruction regarding &quot;PFM&quot; contraction was given during the resting of the eight seconds. After, the volunteers were instructed to perform a maximal voluntary &quot;PFM&quot; contraction with the instruction to move &quot;inward and upward&quot; with the greatest possible force and to hold the contraction for five seconds. The women were oriented and motivated verbally to perform three voluntary maximal contractions sustained for five seconds and one minute interval between them.</description>
