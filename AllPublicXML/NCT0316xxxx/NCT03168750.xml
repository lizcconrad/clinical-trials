    <textblock>
      This prospective study will evaluate the hip function and quality of life of patients
      operated for total hip arthroplasty with Masterloc femoral stem and MPACT acetabular cup. The
      results of this study will establish the performance of Masterloc femoral component (Medacta
      International SA) and MPACT acetabular component (Medacta International SA), and provide a
      general estimate of survivorship, clinical effectiveness and complications.

    <description>Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most commonly performed and successful orthopaedic operations in improving a patient's quality of life. Orthopaedic surgeons are continually striving to improve all aspects of care relating to this procedure whether this is improvements in implant technology, instrument improvement, or the technique involved in performing the procedure.The results of this study will establish the performance of the femoral component and acetabular component, and provide a general estimate of survivorship, clinical effectiveness and complications.</description>
