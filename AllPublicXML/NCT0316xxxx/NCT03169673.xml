  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers aged 18-75 will undergo hyperpolarized 3-Helium MRI and pulmonary function
      testing for the development of tools to assess image signal to noise and reproducibility of
      spin-density and diffusion-weighted imaging.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During a two hour visit, subjects will provide written informed consent and then undergo: 1)
      brief medical history and vital signs, 2) full pulmonary function tests, 3) proton MRI, 4)
      spin-density and/or diffusion weighted 3He MRI.

      Full pulmonary function tests including spirometry, plethysmography and diffusing capacity of
      carbon monoxide (DLCO), Lung Clearance Index (LCI) and Airwave Oscillometry (AO) will be
      performed according to ATS guidelines. MedGraphics Elite Series, MedGraphics Corporation. St.
      Paul, MN USA and/or nDD EasyOne Spirometer, nDD Medical Technologies Inc. Andover, MA USA
      will be used. All measurements will be performed in the Pulmonary Function Laboratory at
      Robarts Research Institute.

      Subjects will be placed in the 3T MR scanner with the 3He chest coil fitted over their torso
      and chest. Hearing protection will be provided to each subject to muffle the noise produced
      by the gradient RF coils. A pulse oximeter lead will be attached to all of the subjects to
      monitor their heart rate and oxygen saturation. MRI will be performed for up to a period of
      30 minutes. All subjects will have supplemental oxygen available via nasal cannula at a
      flow-rate of 2 liters per minute as a precaution in the event of oxygen desaturation.

    <description>Hyperpolarized noble gas imaging using Helium-3 has been used to explore structural and functional relationships in the lung in patients with lung disease and healthy controls. In contrast to proton-based MRI imaging, 3He gas is used as a contrast agent to directly visualize the airways, and thus ventilation. Whereas the normal density of gas is too low to produce an easily detectable signal, this is overcome by artificially increasing the amount of polarization per unit volume using optical pumping.</description>
