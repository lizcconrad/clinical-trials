  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a partially double-blind study in healthy adult subjects, which will be conducted as
      a placebo- and active-controlled, single-dose, crossover study.

      Twenty-eight subjects will be enrolled to ensure 24 subjects on all study periods. All
      subjects will receive all 3 study treatments (GC4419, placebo and moxifloxacin) in randomized
      sequence.

      Cardiodynamic assessment using continuous ECG recordings (Holters) will be performed for
      approximately 26 hours on the day of dosing (Day 1) in each study period. ECGs will be
      extracted serially pre- and post-dose and predefined timepoints at which subjects will be
      supinely resting.

      Subjects will be supinely resting for at least 10 minutes prior to and 5 minutes after each
      nominal timepoint for ECG extraction.

      Blood draws for PK will be performed in all periods at the same timepoints and always after
      ECG extraction.

      Subjects will be domiciled in the clinic from noon/afternoon of the day before dosing (Day
      -1) until completion of safety procedures on Day 2 in each study period.

      All subjects (including subjects who terminate the study early) will return to the clinical
      research unit (CRU) 14 (± 1) days after the last administration of study treatment for
      follow-up procedures and to determine if any Adverse Event (AE) has occurred since the last
      study visit.
