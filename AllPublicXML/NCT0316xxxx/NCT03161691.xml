  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-center, single-arm pilot study to evaluate the ability of C-arm computed tomography
      imaging to assess perfusion parameters, collateral vessels, recanalization and brain ischemia
      in patients with suspected or proven ischemic stroke or brain ischemia in the
      neuro-angiography suite.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In neurovascular disease, and stroke in particular, physicians often want to be able to
      detect regions of ischemia in the brain and the recanalization status of cerebral blood
      vessels. Perfusion and collateral vessel imaging is a possible approach for doing this. These
      imaging techniques are able to differentiate ischemic core in parenchymal tissue in the brain
      versus salvageable penumbra tissue around the core. Also the recanalization status of blood
      vessels can be evaluated using this technique. This study wishes to investigate if the x-ray
      C-arm in the treatment room can generate perfusion and collateral images of clinical value
      during treatment, using a technique known as C-arm computed tomography. If this study shows
      that to be the case, then it might be feasible in the future to bypass CT or MR
      perfusion/collateral imaging for some patients when they arrive at the hospital, since all
      this imaging can be done in the treatment room. In the future, this imaging approach may have
      the potential to simplify and improve patient workflows and reduce the time between hospital
      arrival and treatment for these patients and could also potentially compensate for missing
      imaging information.
