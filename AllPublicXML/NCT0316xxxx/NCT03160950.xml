  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single arm non-blinded study is planned to evaluate the durability of the crowns fabricated
      using a novel composite based material, LuxaCrown (DMG, Germany). The durability of these
      crowns will be assessed for anatomical form, marginal adaptation, color match, marginal
      discoloration, surface roughness, secondary caries, pulpal compatibility, plaque index and
      modified papillary bleeding index with intensive follow up for 2 years (at 1 week, 3rd, 6th,
      12th, 18th and 24th month), and then a yearly follow-up for additional 3 years (at 36th, 48th
      and 60th month).

      A total of 50 patients will be selected and one tooth per subject will be included. For the
      purpose of study only the healthy adult patients with age range of 25 - 60 years who would be
      requiring Single crown restoration in the permanent anterior / posterior teeth, either due to
      caries, pulpal involvement or trauma, will be selected. Teeth that require endodontic
      treatment shall be included in the study only after successful endodontic therapy has been
      completed by an experienced endodontist. For broken teeth, only the teeth with &gt; 1/2 crown
      structure remaining or in case of teeth with &lt;1/2 crown structure fractured that can be
      restored with conventional post and core will be selected. In general, patients with bruxism,
      or with severe periodontal disease, mobility grade 2 or 3 shall be excluded from the study.

    <description>Teeth that would be requiring RCT, would be initially treated by a endodontist using the standardized principles of rotary endodontics.
Restoration using the LuxaCrown as a direct composite crown: In short, the impression material will be loaded with the LuxaCrown material (DMG, Germany). The impression will be then reloaded in the patient's mouth and will stay there for approx. 1.5- 2.3 minutes, that is, till the material is partially set. The impression will then be taken out and the material will be allowed to set outside patient's mouth up to approximately 5 minutes after the start of mixing. The Crown will then be finished using a fine buff and pumice, followed by application of Glaze and Bond (DMG, Germany). The preparation will then be cleaned and slightly roughened with a bur or sand blaster at the adhesion sites. The crown fabricated will then be cemented using TempoCem luting cement (DMG, Germany).</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adult patients with age range 25 - 60 years

          -  Only the patients who would be requiring Single crown restoration in the permanent
             anterior / posterior teeth will be selected for the purpose of study. Single crowns
             are usually indicated in either of the following conditions

               -  Extensive coronal / structural broken tooth due to caries or trauma

               -  Teeth undergone successful endodontic therapy (no signs of failure- asymptomatic,
                  no tenderness on percussion, healthy associated soft tissue)

               -  Microdonts

                    -  Teeth that require endodontic treatment shall be included in the study only
                       after successful endodontic therapy has been completed by an experienced
                       endodontist. The success of the endodontic therapy shall be evaluated using
                       the standardized clinical and radiographic criteria by the endodontist.

          -  Broken teeth with &gt; 1/2 crown structure remaining will be selected.

          -  Broken teeth with &lt; Â½ crown structure remaining will also be selected provided they
             can be restored with a crown after a conventional Post and core.

          -  Patients with good Occlusal Contact will be selected.

          -  Patients who would be giving the Signed Informed Consent shall only be enrolled for
             the study.

          -  Only the teeth showing mobility grade 0 and 1 as per Miller's Criteria shall be
             selected for the purpose of study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients showing signs of bruxism shall not be selected. History of bruxism and wear
             facets will be checked for ruling out the bruxism habit.

          -  Patients with severe periodontal disease, that involves all teeth or tooth indicated
             for crown fabrication shall not be included in the study.

          -  Any clinical or radiographic sig or symptom indicative of periapical or furcation
             involvement.

          -  If the tooth indicated for crown fabrication depicts a mobility grade 2 or 3 as per
             Miller's criteria, it shall be excluded from the study.

          -  History of any systemic illness, pregnancy or history of allergy to dental
             fillings/materials shall also be excluded.

          -  Teeth with fracture of crown en-masse (Ellis Class VIII) fracture or which are badly
             mutilated such that a very minimal or No coronal structure is remaining will be
             excluded.

          -  Hypoplastic / malformed teeth will not be selected for the purpose of study.
