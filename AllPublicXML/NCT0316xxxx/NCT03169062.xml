      The purpose of this study is to propose a new method for evaluating coronary artery calcium

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research, if successfully implemented, will result in a new method for
      evaluating coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) in individuals with coronary artery disease.
      Using the Cardiac Gated Stationary Chest Tomosynthesis (CG-SDCT) system the imaging dose for
      a a full tomosynthesis scan is expected to be only 10% of that from a low-dose CT. The
      targeted imaging time of 25-30 seconds is 1/2 of that from a current commercial DCT system at
      the same imaging dose. As with current commercial DCT systems, our s-DCT system will expose
      patients to less radiation and deliver comparable data for CACS. CG-SDCT will likely result
      in accurate CAC scoring and allow for a more complete patient risk assessment as compared to
      Framingham risk scoring alone.

    <description>The technologist will comfortably position the patient laying face up on the imaging table. EKG leads will be placed in appropriate positions to derive an EKG signal. The EKG will be used to trigger the image collection. The subject will be asked to hold his or her breath for 25-30 seconds during the scan. Total patient preparation and imaging time should not exceed 20 minutes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age range: â‰¥18 years of age

          2. Intermediate Framingham Risk Score of 10 to 20% risk over the next 10 years

          3. Previous non-contrast enhanced chest CT in a time frame that will accommodate
             experimental imaging (CG-SDCT) within 4 weeks. This imaging may have already been
             completed at the time of enrollment or may be scheduled in the future at the time of
             enrollment.

          4. IRB written informed consent obtained and signed Exclusion Criteria

          5. Negative urine pregnancy test in women of child-bearing potential (WCBP) within 1 week
             prior to s-DCT.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unable to provide consent

          2. Pregnant or lactating

          3. BMI &gt; 33 (Patient who may not fit on a 35 x 35 detector) (Images are not clear on
             subjects who have a greater than 33 BMI)

          4. Previous history of MI or thoracic surgery.

          5. Disability that could interfere with the scanning process, non-ambulatory or unable to
             hold their breath for up to 30 seconds.

          6. Planned procedures or therapies in between non-contrast CT scan and study Chest
             tomosynthesis scan, e.g., line placement in the chest region, biopsy, etc.
