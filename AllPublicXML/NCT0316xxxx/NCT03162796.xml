  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of guselkumab treatment in
      participants with active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) by assessing the reduction in signs and
      symptoms of PsA.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of guselkumab in participants with active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) who had
      inadequate response to standard therapies. It will evaluate the clinical efficacy of
      guselkumab in the reduction of signs and symptoms and the safety profile of guselkumab in the
      treatment of PsA. The study will consists of 4 phases: a screening phase of up to 6 weeks, a
      blinded treatment phase of approximately 1 year (that is, 52 weeks), including a placebo
      controlled period from Week 0 to Week 24 and double-blind active treatment period from Week
      24 to Week 52, and a safety follow-up phase of 8 weeks after Week 52 (Week 52 to 60) and will
      be 12 weeks from the last administration of study agent (at Week 48) to the final safety
      follow-up visit. Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity, and biomarker evaluations
      will be performed in the study at defined schedule.

    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a 20-question instrument that assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping and activities of daily living).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a survey of participant health. It consists of 8 individual domains, which are weighted sums of the questions in their section. The 8 domains are: vitality (VT), physical functioning (PF), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), Role-Physical (RP), Role-Emotional (RE), social functioning (SF) and mental health (MH). Each of these 8 scales (domains) is scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health. Based on the scale scores, the summary physical component score (PCS) is derived. Scales contributing most to the scoring of the SF-36 PCS include the PF, RP, BP and GH. Other domains not noted contribute to the scoring but to a lesser degree. The scoring is derived based on an algorithm that has been developed in a software provided by the developer. The summary PCS score is also scaled from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health.</description>
