  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the lumbar puncture is a common procedure and has been performed without ultrasound
      for decades, other research studies suggest that there may be some benefits to using
      ultrasound. This study intends to see whether by using ultrasound there is increased success
      rate, decreased need for additional procedures, and less discomfort during the procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who registered for an emergency or inpatient encounter between 5/22/2017 and
             5/08/2018

          2. Males or females 18 years of age or older

          3. Patients who have been identified as requiring a lumbar puncture for any therapeutic
             or diagnostic or therapeutic indication, as decided by the neurology staff physicians,
             residents, or advanced practice providers.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are not capable of providing consent for participation in research and do
             not have an authorized relative or power of attorney to consent in their stead.

          2. Patients who require lumbar puncture in an emergency, time dependent fashion and in
             whom a possible delay could conceivable have a negative clinical impact.

          3. Patients with known abnormal lumbar spinal anatomy or prior extensive surgical fusion
             such that fluoroscopic or CT guidance is determined to be more clinically appropriate
             by the treating physicians.

          4. BMI greater than 60

          5. Absolute contraindication to lumbar puncture such as uncorrected coagulopathy
