  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study CV-0003 will be the second clinical trial administering CV-MG01 in humans. This will be
      a phase 2/3 proof-of-efficacy therapeutic confirmatory study following the proof-of-concept
      exploratory phase 1 study (CV-0002).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The review of the clinical data accumulated so far in Study CV-0002 indicated that the safety
      and tolerability profile of CV-MG01 is considered very good, with positive immunogenicity
      results after the high dose regimen of CV-MG01. The preliminary results also show an
      indication of efficacy of CV-MG01, as based on the different scales and questionnaires
      results, all specific to MG disease. Therefore, it is proposed to investigate, in an
      appropriately designed, randomised, double-blind and powered study, the clinical efficacy of
      CV-MG01 in a larger cohort of MG patients.
