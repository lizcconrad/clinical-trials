  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a leading cause of burden in Canada and globally. Although more people now seek
      and receive treatment for depression, there are still many who do not respond well to
      treatments. New and low-cost options are needed to improve the lives of people with
      depression. Research suggests that asking patients to complete questionnaires and sending
      feedback to their clinicians may improve depressive symptoms. Research also shows that
      encouraging individuals with depression to take part in shaping their own care can be
      beneficial. To date, no research has examined a combination of these two approaches. This
      project aims to investigate the benefits of providing personalized feedback to patients and
      clinicians in order to improve the care and outcomes for people with depression in Canada. To
      answer this research question, adults who are diagnosed with depression will be placed in one
      of two groups: 1. The patient and clinician will receive feedback to help guide further care
      based on the patient's responses to questionnaires 2. The patient and clinician will not
      receive feedback. The feedback form has been developed with input from clinicians,
      researchers and people with lived experience of depression, and follows new Canadian
      treatment guidelines. Information including depressive symptoms, quality of life, personal
      goals for recovery, and healthcare costs will be collected for a year or longer using an
      online data collection platform. The research team includes clinician-scientists, healthcare
      managers, educators, primary care physician and people with lived experience of depression.
      This project has the potential to deliver significant health benefits for individuals with
      depression, lessen the population burden of depression and improve the health care system by
      optimizing care delivery and improving quality of life at low cost.

      Goal: To improve the outcomes of depression by applying measurement based care that is
      person-centered and provides individualised feedback to providers and patients within a
      collaborative mental health care framework.

      Background: Depression is a leading cause of disease burden in Canada and globally. Although
      help-seeking and treatment rates have increased, the outcomes of depression remain
      unsatisfactory with high rates of inadequate treatment response, chronicity and recurrence.
      Recent data suggest that measurement-based care with regular ratings of depression symptoms
      coupled with feedback of results to clinicians and patients may improve outcomes. There is
      also evidence for the benefits of person-centered approaches that empower individuals living
      with depression to take active part in shaping their care. Person-centered care that
      integrates measurement-based feedback is yet to be tested.

      Aims: To test the benefits of person-centered measurement-based care in improving outcomes of
      depression in contemporary Canadian primary and collaborative health care context.

      Approach: We will test the benefits of person-centered measurement-based feedback in a
      randomized registry trial. Adults aged 18 or older diagnosed with major depressive disorder
      or persistent depressive disorder will be allocated to have a regular measurement-based
      feedback sent to themselves and their clinicians or not in a 1:1 ratio. The feedback was
      designed with a council of individuals with depression following the principles of
      patient-centered and measurement-based care and the recommendations of the 2016 Canadian
      Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatment guidelines. An on-line registry platform will be used
      to collect self-report and clinician-rated depression severity, role functioning, quality of
      life and person-centered self-defined goals. The primary outcome will be meaningful change in
      treatment and depression severity measured with the self-reported Quick Inventory of
      Depressive Symptomatology at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after study entry. Secondary measures will
      include remission of depression, core role and occupational functioning, quality of life,
      healthcare cost and self-defined treatment goals. A cost-effectiveness analysis will
      determine the cost of improved outcomes in terms of quality of life.

      Core expertise: The applicants include clinician-scientists, healthcare managers, educators
      and people with lived experience of depression. The applicants have expertise in depression,
      primary and collaborative care, clinical trials, epidemiology, statistics, psychometrics and
      health economics. The registry and feedback forms were developed as part of the Canadian
      Depression Research and Intervention Network which promotes involvement of individuals with
      lived experience in research. The database and statistical analyses are supported by the
      Research Methods Unit.

      Expected outcomes: This project will deliver an innovative platform for person-centered
      measurement-based care for depression through collaborative mental health care. We expect
      that person-centered measurement-based care will lead to significant health benefits by
      optimizing care delivery, reducing burden of depression and improving quality of life at low
      cost. The outcomes of this research will be disseminated through professional networks,
      patient support organizations, on-line media and education of health professionals.

    <description>A registry platform including access to all self-report rating scales and the feedback mechanism will be made available to all patients. Patients in the experimental group will receive automated reminders (by text message, phone and/or email) to complete outcome measures each week. Feedback forms will be comprehensive and condensed to a one page report including graphical presentations of symptom course and text. Clinician feedback forms will include content on depression severity over time and recommendations for individualized treatment. Patient feedback forms will also incorporate depression severity over time as well as summary information on achievement towards personalized treatment goals. The intervention will last 6-months, with feedback forms being generated once per week for the first three month and then each month for a total of fifteen feedback time points. Patients in the feedback group will be encouraged to meet with their clinician each month to discuss the feedback.</description>
