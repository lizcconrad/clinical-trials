    <textblock>
      This is a Post Market Clinical Follow Up (PMCF) study to monitor the safety and performance
      of the GLOBAL ICON stemless humeral component. The data gathered will be used to support post
      market surveillance of the device, and may potentially be used for additional market access
      purposes.

      This study will be multi-centre and non-comparative. Subjects will be recruited and followed
      up at similar intervals to reflect the standard clinical practice and intended population for
      wider use of the device.

      157 non-randomised subjects will be recruited from approximately 15 sites. A maximum of 30
      subjects may be recruited from one site. More than one implanting surgeon may recruit
      subjects at each site as a designated sub-Investigator.

      The primary objective of this PMCF study is to confirm device survivorship of the GLOBAL ICON
      stemless humeral component at 24 months post-operative.

      The secondary objectives include the evaluation of clinical performance, radiographic
      performance and safety outcomes at 3, 12, 24, 60 and 120 months post-operatively.

      Tertiary endpoints in the study will include a mean change from baseline for the
      Constant-Murley Score, the Oxford Shoulder Score, the EQ-5D-5L dimension score and EQ-VAS
      scores. Radiographic evidence of aseptic loosening and periprosthetic fracture survivorship
      of the GLOBAL ICON stemless humeral component will be assessed.
