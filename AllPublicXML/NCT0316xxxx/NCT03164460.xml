  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of stereotactic body
      radioablative therapy (SBRT) to conventional radiation therapy in patients with head and neck
      cancer who are receiving repeat radiation.

      This is an investigational study. Conventional radiation therapy and SBRT are delivered using
      FDA-approved and commercially available methods. The study doctor can explain how each method
      of delivering radiation is designed to work.

      Up to 100 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      You will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done
      because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the other group.

        -  If you are assigned to Group 1, you will receive SBRT.

        -  If you are assigned to Group 2, you will receive conventional radiation therapy.

      If you are unable to receive your randomly assigned treatment because it is no longer in your
      best interest, you will not be asked to complete any of the procedures or visits listed
      below. Study staff will, however, collect information from your medical record about the
      status of the disease until the study ends.

      Radiation Therapy:

      If you are in Group 1, you will receive SBRT every other day for a total of 5 treatments
      (about 2 weeks).

      If you are in Group 2, you will receive conventional radiation therapy 1 time each weekday
      (Monday-Friday) for a total of up to 30-35 treatments (about 6-7 weeks).

      Length of Study:

      Your active participation in this study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Study Visits:

      During radiation treatment (1st week of treatment if you are receiving SBRT, 3rd or 4th week
      if you are receiving conventional radiation therapy) and after receiving radiation treatment,
      you will complete the same questionnaires that you did at baseline.

      At each standard of care visit during your treatment:

        -  You will complete the same questionnaires that you did at baseline.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an MRI and either a CT or PET-CT scan
           at the Center for Advanced Biomedical Imaging to help with radiation treatment planning.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      About 2-3 months after your last radiation treatment, then every 3 months for 1 year, and
      then every 3-4 months after that for up to 2 years:

        -  You will complete the same questionnaires that you did at baseline.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT and PET-CT scan to check the
           status of the disease.

      Additional Information:

        -  Researchers will collect information from your medical record before, during, and for up
           to 5 years after radiation therapy for this study. This information will be related to
           your personal medical history, diagnosis, and the treatment you received or are
           scheduled to receive for head and neck cancer.

        -  The questionnaires may be completed in person, by phone, or on REDcap (a secure,
           web-based program used to collect data for research studies).

        -  A member of the study staff may contact you by phone, mail, or email to remind you to
           complete the questionnaires.
