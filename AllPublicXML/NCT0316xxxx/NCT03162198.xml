  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All consecutive patients with liver cirrhosis, with clinical and imaging features suggestive
      of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) attending the Department of Hepatology, Institute of Liver
      and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) from February 2017 to December 2018 will be evaluated for
      inclusion.Based on the previous years data of HCC patients admitted to ILBS.

      Cirrhotic patients aged 18-70 years, with HCC proven by typical radiological features of
      arterial enhancement and delayed wash-out, on one or both of dynamic Computerized Tomographic
      or dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), as per updated American Association for the
      Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) guidelines (details in appendix1).

      Age and gender matched patients with cirrhosis, but without HCC, seen during the same study
      period will serve as controls.

      Patient characteristics, etiology of cirrhosis, and liver function parameters will be noted.
      Investigator will stage the included patients as per the Barcelona Cancer of Liver Cancer
      (BCLC) criteria (details in appendix1). Investigator will then estimate Circulating Tumor
      Cells (CTC) and cfDNA in peripheral blood samples of the patients and controls.
