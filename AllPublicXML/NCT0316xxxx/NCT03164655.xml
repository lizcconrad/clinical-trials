    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed colorectal cancer (CRC), and radiologic or histologic proof
             of CRLM

          2. CRLM not amenable to a curative intent-treatment after at least two months and no more
             than 6 months of first-line induction CT

          3. First-line CT with oxaliplatin and/or irinotecan combined with a fluoropyrimidine and
             a targeted therapy (e.g., anti-EGFR or antiangiogenic antibody) for metastatic disease
             (patients ending their adjuvant chemotherapy after primary tumor resection since less
             than 6 months should also have received first-line chemotherapy for metastatic
             desease)

          4. Unresectability of the CRLM will be confirmed by a centralized multidisciplinary
             expert panel (composed of surgeons, radiologists, interventional radiologists and
             medical oncologists). The panel will review the CT-Scan and MRI of the patients
             (weekly web conference)

          5. Non-resectability criteria (one of the following criteria):

               -  Upfront R0/R1 resection of all CRLM (that leaves at least two adequately perfused
                  and drained segments) is not possible

               -  and/or metastases in contact with major vessels of the remnant liver which would
                  require resection of the vessel for an R0 resection (i.e., tumor involvement of
                  main portal right and left portal veins, of the three main hepatic veins, or of
                  the retrohepatic vena cava)

               -  and/or documented progressive disease on imaging (according to the RECIST v1.1
                  criteria) or doubling of serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or CA
                  19.9 following ≥ 2 months of induction CT

          6. At least one measurable liver metastasis according to the RECIST v1.1

          7. Age ≥ 18 years

          8. ECOG performance status 0-1

          9. Normal liver function, i.e. bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal values
             (ULN), aminotransferases &lt; 5ULN, alkaline phosphatase &lt; 5ULN

         10. International normalized ratio (INR) &lt; 1.5ULN

         11. Neutrophils &gt; 1500/mm3, platelets &gt; 100 000/mm3, haemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL (transfusion
             allowed)

         12. Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min (Cockcroft and Gault formula)

         13. Informed consent signed by the patient or his/her legal representative

         14. Patient affiliated to a social security regimen

         15. Adequate contraception if applicable

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient eligible for curative-intent treatment of CRLM (i.e. resection and/or
             thermoablation), according to the local multidisciplinary team and/or the central
             review.

          2. Extrahepatic tumour disease (except ≤ 3 lung nodules &lt; 10 mm deemed amenable to
             curative-intent resection/thermoablation and non-resected primary tumour with no or
             mild symptoms)

          3. Patient with contraindication for trial drugs (investigators have to refer to SmPC
             drugs, see appendix 1)

          4. Sensory neuropathy ≥ grade 2 (NCIC CTAE v.4.0)

          5. Significant chronic liver disease (resulting in portal hypertension and/or liver
             insufficiency)

          6. Allergy to contrast media that cannot be managed with standard care

          7. Previous organ transplantation, HIV or other immunodeficiency syndromes

          8. Concomitant or past history of cancer within 5 years prior to entry into the trial
             other than adequately treated basal-cell skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the
             cervix

          9. Concomitant medications/comorbidities that may prevent the patient from receiving
             study treatments as uncontrolled intercurrent illness (for instance: active infection,
             active inflammatory disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal obstruction,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension…)

         10. Ionic disorders as:

               -  Kalemia ≤ 1 x ULN

               -  Magnesemia &lt; 0.5 mmol/L

               -  Calcemia &lt; 2 mmol/L

         11. Patient with known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency

         12. QT/QTc &gt; 450 msec for men and &gt; 470 msec for women

         13. Concomitant intake of St. John's wort

         14. Patient already included in another clinical trial with an experimental molecule

         15. Pregnancy or lactation

         16. Patients deprived of liberty or under guardianship

         17. Patients unable to undergo medical monitoring test for geographical, social or
             psychological reasons
