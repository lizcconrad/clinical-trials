  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study if giving radiation to a brain tumor (a procedure
      called radiosurgery) before neurosurgery (surgery to remove the tumor) will help to keep
      brain tissue healthy, while possibly eliminating the need to return for radiation once a
      patient has healed from neurosurgery. This study will also seek the best radiation dose on a
      brain tumor based on how well the radiation therapy works and asses the side-effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiosurgery is a non-surgical radiation therapy that can deliver targeted radiation to small
      brain tumors. Radiosurgery is considered to be part of standard of care. Typically for
      standard of care, radiosurgery is given after a patient has healed from neurosurgery, in an
      attempt to destroy any cancer cells that may be left after surgery. Patients who agree to
      participate in this research study will receive radiosurgery before their neurosurgery.

      The timing of radiosurgery (pre-operatively) and the dosing to determine the safest dose is
      considered experimental.

      By giving radiation the typical way, after surgery, a larger area of the brain must be
      covered, which means healthy brain tissue also receives radiation, whereas radiation before
      surgery will specifically target the tumor.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with prior histopathological diagnosis of cancer other than small cell lung
             cancer, lymphoma, and germ cell histologies.

          -  MR imaging of the brain with findings strongly suggestive of metastatic tumor(s) as
             assessed by the radiologist.

          -  MR evidence of at least one brain lesion ≤ 40 mm in maximal diameter that is deemed to
             be surgically resectable as evaluated by the neurosurgeon and appropriate for SRS. All
             other brain lesions must be appropriate for SRS alone and treated according to
             physician preference. Prior neurosurgery and/or prior SRS at a non-overlapping
             location are permitted at the discretion of the treating physician.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from subject, or a legally designated power of
             attorney and ability for subject to comply with the requirements of the study.

          -  Negative pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) within 30 days of
             radiation. WOCBP is a female patient less than 50 years of age or who has menstruated
             within the last 12 months.

          -  Patients aged ≥ 18 years.

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 3 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients deemed medically unfit to undergo surgical resection of brain metastasis,
             such as those who are neurologically or hemodynamically unstable despite appropriate
             medical interventions.

          -  Patients who have had prior whole brain radiation.

          -  Patients with &gt;4 brain metastases.

          -  Active or prior: documented inherited hypersensitivity syndromes, certain autoimmune
             diseases, and certain collagen vascular diseases. For example, any radiation
             hypersensitivity syndrome, including, but not limited to, ataxia-telangiectasia,
             Gorlin syndrome, multiple sclerosis, scleroderma, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

          -  Radiographic or cytologic evidence of leptomeningeal disease.

          -  Patients receiving methotrexate, adriamycin, epirubicine, or navelbin for one week
             prior to or concurrently with SRS. Note: All other systemic anti-cancer therapies will
             be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by study PI to determine if appropriate for study
             treatment and documented within the research record or EMR.
