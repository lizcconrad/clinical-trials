    <textblock>
      This graduate student research study has two purposes; the first purpose is to examine the
      criterion validity of the Y Balance Test (YBT) with the Limits of Stability Test (LOS) in
      healthy middle-aged adults. The second purpose is to examine balance changes using the YBT
      following a home-based exercise program.

      4. &quot;Subjects will be healthy female or male middle-aged adults who are able to walk and move
      independently.

      5. &quot;Subjects will be between 45 and 64 years of age.&quot; 6. &quot;In total, subject participation
      will last approximately eight weeks. Visit 1 (baseline): 90 minutes, visit 2 (week 4): 30
      minutes, and visit 3 (week 8): 60 minutes.

      7. &quot;Subjects will be recruited by distributing flyers in the Loma Linda Community, sending
      emails to school staff, students, and faculty, and word of mouth.

      8. &quot;Consent will take place at Loma Linda University, Nichol Hall rooms A620 -A640 by
      investigators.&quot; 9. If Multi-center: N/A 10. If Single center or investigator-initiated: &quot;70
      subjects will participate in the study.&quot;
