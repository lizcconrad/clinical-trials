    <textblock>
      A multicenter, open-label phase 2a trial of CN-105 in patients with supratentorial
      intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Patients will be evaluated for eligibility within 12 hours of
      symptom onset. Eligible participants (approximately 60) will receive CN-105 administered
      intravenously (IV) for a 30-minute infusion every 6 hours for up to a maximum of 3 days (13
      doses) or until discharge (if earlier than 3 days). Participants will be monitored daily
      throughout the Treatment phase of the study (up to a maximum of 5 days) and will receive
      standard-of-care treatment for the duration of the study. Additional protocol assessments
      will be required during the Treatment phase. After discharge from the hospital, participants
      will enter a 3-month Follow-up phase, with a clinic visit at 30 days and a follow-up
      telephone interview with telephone-validated Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days after
      first dose of study agent.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Has given written informed consent to participate in the study in accordance with
             required regulations; if a participant is not capable of providing informed consent,
             written consent must be obtained from the participant's legally authorized
             representative (LAR).

          2. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the
             duration of the study.

          3. Is male or female, age 30 to 80 years, inclusive.

          4. Has a confirmed diagnosis of spontaneous supratentorial ICH.

          5. Able to receive first dose of study drug ≤ 12 hours after onset of ICH symptoms, such
             as alteration in level of consciousness, severe headache, nausea, vomiting, seizure,
             and/or focal neurological deficits, or last-known well time.

          6. Has an interpretable and measurable diagnostic CT scan.

          7. Has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score ≥ 5 on presentation

          8. Has a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score ≥ 4.

          9. Has systolic BP (SBP) &lt; 200 mm Hg at enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is pregnant or lactating.

          2. Has a temperature greater than 38.5°C at Screening.

          3. Has ICH resulting from trauma.

          4. Has infratentorial hemorrhage (any involvement of the midbrain or lower brainstem as
             demonstrated by radiograph or complete third nerve palsy).

          5. Has primary intraventricular hemorrhage deemed to be at high risk for obstructive
             hydrocephalus, or extra-axial (ie, subarachnoid or subdural) extension of hemorrhage.

          6. Has radiographic evidence of underlying tumor.

          7. Has an unstable mass or evolving intracerebral compartment syndrome.

          8. Has a ruptured aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or vascular anomaly.

          9. Has a platelet count &lt; 100,000/mL.

         10. Has an international normalized ratio (INR) &lt; 1.6 or irreversible coagulopathy either
             due to medical condition or detected before screening.

         11. In the opinion of the investigator is unstable and would benefit from supportive care
             rather than supportive care plus CN-105.

         12. In the opinion of the investigator has any contraindication to the planned study
             assessments, including CT and MRI.

         13. Any condition which could interfere with, or the treatment for which might interfere
             with, the conduct of the study or which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             unacceptably increases the individual's risk by participating in the study.

         14. Concomitant enrollment in another interventional study.
