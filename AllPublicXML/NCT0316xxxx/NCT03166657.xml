    <textblock>
      All women with history of secondary infertility after caesarean section will be subjected to
      office hysteroscopy according to Royal college of obstetrics and gynecology guidelines to
      diagnose any subtle uterine abnormalities not detected by conventional means.

      Hysteroscopic examination will be done during the proliferation phase of the menstrual cycle.

      The hysteroscopic evaluation will include assessment of the cervical canal, intrauterine
      lesions, the endometrium and the uterotubal junction. .

      If hysteroscopy reveal a lesion, its type, size, location will be recorded. Transvaginal
      ultrasound will be done after the procedure to detect fluid in the douglas pouch to confirm
      patent tubes.

      Asses the uterine scar in details.

    <description>A speculum is first inserted into the vagina. The hysteroscope is then inserted and gently moved through the cervix into uterus. Carbon dioxide gas or a fluid, such as saline will be put through the hysteroscope into uterus to expand it. The gas or fluid helps see the lining more clearly. The amount of fluid used is carefully checked throughout the procedure</description>
