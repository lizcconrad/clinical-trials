  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if adding additional chemotherapy and
      radiation, either with or without surgery, can help to control esophageal or gastric cancer
      with oligometastases in patients whose disease did not get worse after receiving at least 6
      cycles of chemotherapy as part of their standard care.

      Oligometastases means there are less than 3 places in the body where the disease has spread.

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, participant will be randomly assigned (as
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one know if one group
      is better, the same, or worse than the other. °If participant is assigned to Group 1,
      participant will receive maintenance chemotherapy.

      Maintenance therapy is given after participant has already received chemotherapy and is meant
      to continue to prevent the return of the disease.

      °If participant is assigned to Group 2, participant will receive local therapy, which may
      include chemotherapy with radiation and surgery (if participant is eligible to have it).

      Both participant and the study doctor will know to which group participant has been
      randomized to.

      The study doctor will tell participant which chemotherapy participant is receiving, when
      participant will receive it, and its risks. This chemotherapy may include the following alone
      or in combination with each other: cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), mitomycin C, vindesine,
      or paclitaxel.

      If participant is in Group 2 and participant is eligible, participant may receive radiation
      therapy or surgery. These therapies will be provided as part of participant's standard care
      and participant will receive separate consent forms for these procedures.

      Participant will not have any clinic visits that are specific to this study. All clinic
      visits will be scheduled as part of participant's routine care and would take place even if
      participant was not taking part in this study.

      Length of Participation:

      Participant may receive treatment for as long as the doctor thinks it is in participant's
      best interest. If the disease appears to get worse, participant may receive additional
      treatment as part of participant's standard care (called second-line therapy). The study
      doctor will discuss this with participant. Participant will no longer be able to receive
      treatment if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is
      unable to follow study directions.

      Participation on this study will continue until the study ends.

      Follow-Up:

      As soon as participant finishes therapy, then about 4-8 weeks after that, and then every 3-6
      months for up to 3 years after treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy:

        -  Participant will complete a questionnaire about participant's symptoms. This should take
           about 10 minutes to complete.

        -  Participant will have imaging scans (such as an MRI, CT, PET-CT, FDG-PET, and so on) to
           check the status of the disease. The doctor will tell participant which scan(s)
           participant will have.

      If participant has surgery as part of participant's standard care, participant will have the
      above follow-up visit about 2-3 months after surgery and then every 3-6 months for up to 3
      years.

      After 3 years, participant will then have the above follow-up visit every 6-12 months until
      the study ends or until follow-up visits are no longer needed for routine care.

      This is an investigational study. The chemotherapy and radiation therapy used in this study
      is FDA-approved and commercially available for the type of cancer you have. It is considered
      investigational to use chemotherapy, alone or in combination with radiation therapy and
      surgery, to treat esophageal or gastric cancer with oligometastases.

      Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has a pathologic diagnosis of tumor biopsy or FNA of esophageal or gastric
             cancer of adenocarcinoma histology

          2. The patient is staged with EUS/EGD and PET/CT scan.

          3. The patient has three or less observable metastatic lesions. Metastatic lesions
             include distant M1 lymph node group; which will be counted as one site (M1 metastatic
             lymph nodes to include cervical, mediastinal, gastric, retroperitoneal lymph nodes
             will be counted as one lesion). Osseous metastases or visceral metastases will each
             count as one metastatic site. Each CNS metastases will count as one metastatic site.
             Satellite lesions in the primary esophageal malignancy such as skipped esophageal
             primaries are not considered metastatic sites. Symptomatic metastatic sites can be
             treated locally prior to randomization or by palliative radiation.

          4. Patient ECOG of 0-2, with life expectancy of at least 6 months

          5. Patients age &gt;18 yrs old but &lt;80 yrs old and signed informed consent

          6. Women of child bearing age must have pregnancy test at time of enrollment, agree to
             use of adequate contraception (birth control hormone or barrier method) for the
             duration of the study and for six months after discontinuation of systemic agents.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy for their diagnosis of
             esophageal or gastric cancer. Patients with prior radiation therapy to same site for
             another diagnosis of cancer. Note: Patients may receive palliative radiation to their
             symptomatic sites of metastases but not definitive local therapy to esophageal or
             gastric primary prior to randomization. All patients may be enrolled on protocol then
             start systemic therapy; if they do not have evidence of disease progression at
             re-staging following initial therapy, they may be randomized.

          2. Patients with fistula documented radiographically or by EDG/EUS, EBUS.

          3. Patients with life expectancy less than 6 months, ECOG &gt;3

          4. Female patients who are pregnant confirmed by bHCG lab test.

          5. Patient has history of uncontrolled angina, congestive heart failure or recent MI
             within 6 months.
