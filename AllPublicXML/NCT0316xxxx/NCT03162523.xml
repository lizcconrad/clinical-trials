  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are 3 articles that will be written about the experience with HDR-brachytherapy
      (HDR-BT) in patients with high-risk prostate cancer in Norway as part of a doctorial
      thesis-project. The project will focus on survival, side-effects and dosimetry variables as
      the main points of interest.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First article will compare overall and prostate cancer specific-mortality in patients who has
      received HDR-BT compared to patients who has received external beam radiation therapy only
      (EBRT). Patients who have been treated with HDR-BT have been enrolled in an approved registry
      at Oslo University Hospital since 2004. The control group (EBRT only) data are from the
      Lancet published hallmark study SPCG-7 (Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group). This is a
      case-control study.

      Second article will focus on side-effects of HDR-BT compared to EBRT patients. Patients
      included in the registry described above have been sent (and completed with a 72% answer
      rate) a questionnaire of the standard Expanded Prostate Cancer Index (EPIC-26) form. This
      will be compared to patients who already have answered the same questionnaire in a previously
      published study (approved by the Norwegian Ethical Committee).

      The Third article will investigate if there are any association between patients reporting
      severe adverse effects after HDR-BT and the patients dosimetry reports (i.e are there a
      larger dose to the urethra or rectum in these patients?)
