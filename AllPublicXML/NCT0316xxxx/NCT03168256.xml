  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will test the hypothesis that the administration of CF101, a novel
      anti-inflammatory agent, to patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis will relieve
      signs and symptoms of the disease. CF101 effect will be in comparison to apremilast in this
      study population
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, study in
      adult males and females, aged 18 to 80 years, inclusive, with a diagnosis of
      moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.

      Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to CF101 2 mg, 3 mg, matching apremilast 30 mg
      BID, or matching placebo, in a 3:3:3:2 ratio. Blinding will be maintained using a
      double-dummy technique.

      Medication will be taken orally BID for 32 weeks in a double-blinded fashion, with the option
      to continue treatment through an Extension Period to 48 weeks. Subjects initially assigned to
      the placebo group will be re-randomized at Week 16 to either CF101 2 mg, CF101 3 mg, or
      apremilast (with appropriate dose titration) in a 1:1:1 ratio and treated through Week 32,
      while subjects originally assigned to 1 of the active treatment groups will remain on that
      treatment through Week 32. The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed at Weeks 16 and 32;
      at Week 32, all subjects will be offered the opportunity to remain on their assigned blinded
      drug through Week 48 (ie, the Extension Period of Weeks 33-48).

      Disease will be assessed using PASI , static PGA , the percentage of BSA involved, and PDI.
      Subjects will return for assessments and a new supply of study medication at Weeks 4, 8, 12,
      16, 20, 24, and 28, and for final study assessments at Week 32. For those subjects continuing
      into the Extension Period, efficacy and safety assessments will also occur at Weeks 36, 40,
      44, and 48. PK will be assessed in a subgroup of approximately 120 subjects at Weeks 0, 8,
      16, 24 and 32. PK will be assessed through sparse sampling. Assessment of whole blood A3AR
      expression levels will occur at Screening, Week 16, and Week 32.

             Investigator, compromise subject safety;

         11. Active gastrointestinal disease which could interfere with the absorption of oral
             medication;

         12. Pregnancy, planned pregnancy, lactation, or inadequate contraception as judged by the
