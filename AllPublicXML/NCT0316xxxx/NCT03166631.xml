  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the dose-escalation parts of the trial is to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD), based on the frequency of patients experiencing dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs), and/or the recommended dose for further development of BI 891065
      monotherapy as well as of BI 891065 in combination with BI 754091, and to evaluate its safety
      and tolerability by monitoring the occurrence and severity of adverse events (AEs).

      Secondary objectives are the determination of the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of BI 891065
      monotherapy as well as of BI 891065 in combination with BI 754091, and the preliminary
      assessment of anti-tumour activity.

               -  Any clinically important abnormalities (as assessed by the investigator) in
                  rhythm, conduction, or morphology of resting ECGs, e.g., complete left bundle
                  branch block, third degree heart block

               -  Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic
                  events such as heart failure, hypokalaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family
                  history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years-of-age, or
                  any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval

               -  Patients with an ejection fraction (EF) &lt;55% or the lower limit of normal of the
                  institutional standard will be excluded. Only in cases where the Investigator (or
                  the treating physician or both) suspects cardiac disease with negative effect on
                  the EF, will the EF be measured during screening using an appropriate method
                  according to local standards to confirm eligibility (e.g., echocardiogram [ECHO],
                  multi-gated acquisition scan [MUGA]). A historic measurement of EF no older than
                  6 months prior to first administration of study drug can be accepted provided
                  that there is clinical evidence that the EF value has not worsened since this
                  measurement in the opinion of the Investigator or of the treating physician or
                  both.

             safety of the trial drug, such as cardiac, neurologic, psychiatric, infectious disease
             or active ulcers (gastro-intestinal tract, skin) or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with trial participation or trial drug administration,
             and in the judgment of the Investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry
             into the trial.

          -  Chronic alcohol or drug abuse or any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion,
             makes them an unreliable trial patient or unlikely to complete the trial

          -  Patients receiving systemic treatment with any immunosuppressive medication within 1
             week prior treatment start (steroids of max. 10 mg prednisolone equivalent per day are

          -  For Parts A and B: Patients with known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), known
             anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), or known ROS Proto-Oncogene 1 (ROS1) genomic tumour
             aberrations, unless disease has progressed following available EGFR or ALK targeted
             therapy (including osimertinib for EGFR T790M-mutated NSCLC)

          -  Out of range lab values as defined:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1.5 x 109/L (&lt;1500/mm3)

             Disease Epidemiology [CKD-EPI] Collaboration equation); confirmation of eGRF is only
             required when creatinine is &gt;1.5 X ULN.

          -  For Part C: Patients with EGFR, ALK, or (if known) ROS1 genomic tumor aberrations

          -  For Part C: Patients with any CTLA-4 therapy

          -  For Part C: One or more lines of anti-cancer therapy between previous
             anti-PD-1/anti-PDL1 mAb therapy and study entry.
