  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate effects of tDCS stimulation in the left primary
      motor area followed by naming therapy to improve language functions in patients with aphasia
      in the sub-acute stage.

    <textblock>
      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a simple and non-intrusive method that has
      demonstrated promising results in language rehabilitation of patients with aphasia. Various
      studies have used different stimulation set-ups, some based on prior structural and
      functional brain mapping in order to choose the optimal stimulation region. An additional
      approach that was found beneficial is stimulation of the left primary motor area (M1). A
      major advantage of this approach is its relative simplicity that may increase the application
      of this intervention in clinical settings. This intervention approach has been studied in
      patients with chronic aphasia and targeted on naming ability. In the current study the
      investigators aim to study the influence of a stimulation set-up at M1 in stroke patients
      suffering from aphasia that are in the sub-acute stage. In addition the investigators aim to
      study additional language functions including pragmatics and grammar. The study will include
      30 patients suffering from aphasia which are in the sub-acute stage. The patients will
      undergo complete language assessments at 3 time points: baseline, post intervention (third
      week from recruitment) and one month follow-up. The study group will include 15 patients that
      will undergo TDCS at the left M1 region followed by naming therapy. The intervention will be
      given daily for duration of two weeks (5 days/week). The control group will include 15
      patients that will undergo the same protocol apart from sham TDCS. The effect of the
      intervention will be examined taking into account the extent and location of the brain damage
      on language functions.

    <description>The anode will be placed over the left M1 representation of the hand (C3 of the 10-20 EEG system). Twenty minutes of sham-tDCS will be administered at the beginning of the daily treatment session.
During sham-tDCS, the current will be ramped up and remained at 1mA only for 30 s before ramping down, which does not affect neural functions, but assures effective blinding of participants due to the initial tingling sensation on the scalp. Following the sham stimulation will be 45 minutes of naming therapy.</description>
