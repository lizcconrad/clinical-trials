  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to examine which minimally invasive surgical approach is
      associated with the best outcomes when performing cholecystectomy surgery: laparoscopic or
      robotic?

      Laparoscopic and robotic approaches are similar surgical procedures using small incisions.
      The laparoscopic approach is largely used for the removal of the gallbladder
      (cholecystectomy).

      At UIC, the investigators perform the majority of the gallbladder surgeries through the
      robotic approach and only a few using the laparoscopic approach. The robotic surgical tools
      allows the surgeon the same freedom of movement as a human wrist, while using a 3D camera
      view.

      The laparoscopic and robotic surgical approaches both represent minimally invasive surgery
      approach and are associated with less pain, faster recovery and better cosmetic outcomes when
      compared to traditional open surgery. It is not currently known which approach is better.

    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic approach is largely used for cholecystectomy surgery. Here, at UIC, however the
      investigators perform many surgeries of the gallbladder through robotic approach.

      However, the investigators do also perform this surgery using the laparoscopic approach at
      UIC. Laparoscopic and robotic surgery represent both minimally invasive approach and are
      associated with less pain, faster recovery and better cosmetic outcomes when compared to
      traditional open surgery. The majority of cholecystectomies in USA are still being done with
      laparoscopic approach though. However, the number of centers switching to the more
      technologically advanced robotic approach is growing exponentially.

      A recent paper has been published indicating that the robotic approach may decrease the rate
      of open conversion (traditional, open abdomen surgery) in cholecystectomy operations in
      comparison to laparoscopic approach1. Open conversion implies removal of the minimally
      invasive instruments (straight for laparoscopy and robotic with EndowristÂ® feature) from the
      patient's abdominal cavity and the creation of a large incision that starts in the midline,
      2-5 cm below the xiphoid bone, extending in parallel with the costal margin for about 20 cm
      and going toward the right flank.

      There is sparse literature comparing outcomes of cholecystectomy between the laparoscopic and
      robotic approaches and no other major studies that focus on just this procedure.

      The investigators have already investigated the outcomes of robotic gallbladder surgery vs.
      laparoscopic surgery and published these data in a retrospective study, however the
      investigators are unsure if a prospective study would yield similar results.

      Specific Aim:

      The investigators would like to start a prospective randomized study to achieve definitive
      scientific evidence that will help determine which minimally invasive surgical approach is
      associated with the best outcomes when performing the removal of the gallbladder
      (cholecystectomy): laparoscopic or robotic?

    <description>Patients suitable for elective cholecystectomy with minimally invasive approach will be consented and randomized into either the robotic or laparoscopic group and both the patient and the operating physician will be notified which technique will be performed. Patients will be randomized to a 1:1 ratio. In order to eliminate bias in randomization, the investigators will be using an online resource available at: https://www.randomizer.org.
After randomization, the investigators will complete a chart review that will follow the patients for a total of 30 days. The patient participation will be limited to the consent discussion and potential sign off. There will be no other clinic visits in regards to this research.</description>
