  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was designed to investigate whether the survival outcome, response rate and safety
      of hepatic arterial infusion of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil/leucovorin regimens for patients
      with Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC)-C stage hepatocellular carcinoma was superior than
      those of the standard treatment with sorafenib or not.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fifth most common malignancy worldwide. Advanced-stage
      disease is found in 25%-70% of HCC at diagnosis, with a median survival time of only 4.2-7.9
      months due to limited treatment options. To date, sorafenib is the only standard treatment
      shown to extend overall survival for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (Ad-HCC). However, low
      response rates, modest survival advantages and high-level heterogeneity of individual
      response, such limitations of sorafenib prohibit its widespread use in Ad-HCC and more
      alternative therapies are highly required at present.

      Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) can provide chemotherapeutic agents to liver at
      higher concentration with lower toxicity and has been reported favorable results in advanced
      HCC. However, HAIC provides good but variable outcomes, with a response rate of 7-81% and
      median survival time of 6-15.9 months. The unstable response may attribute to complicate
      combinations based on various drugs, including fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin, doxorubicin,
      mitomycin, leucovorin and interferon. FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, 5-FU/leucovorin) was a regimen
      first used in colon cancer with liver metastasis and reported to be effective both by
      systemic and HAIC in amounts of clinical trials. A recent phase II study has shown that HAI
      of FOLFOX (HAIF) was well tolerated and effective in Ad-HCC. To the investigator's knowledge,
      no clinical studies have been developed on comparing the survival benefit of HAIF with
      sorafenib for patients with Ad-HCC. In this phase III trial, the investigators aimed to
      compare survival outcome, response rate and safety of HAIF with sorafenib in patients with
      Ad-HCC.

             clinically indicated or at the discretion of the investigator; however, they may not
             be substituted for a required dose reduction). Subjects taking chronic erythropoietin
             are permitted provided no dose adjustment is undertaken within 1 month prior to the
             study or during the study.

          -  Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance
             with clinical study procedures, e.g., infection/inflammation, intestinal obstruction,

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during dosing and for 7 days after permanently discontinuing HAIF and/or sorafenib
             treatment. Highly effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on
                  the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  patient.

               -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c, or b+c):

                    1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or
                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure
                       rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone
                       contraception.

                    2. Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system

                    3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository.

        In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a
        minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

        Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12
        months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
        appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
        (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of
        oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by
        follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while receiving
             treatment and for 7 days after stopping study treatment and should not father a child
             in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to
             prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.

          -  Subjects unable to suffer the discomfort of the HAI procedure (e.g. pain,
             claustrophobia, noise).

          -  Any contraindication for sorafenib, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, or fluorouracil
             administration.

          -  Any agents which could affect the absorption or pharmacokinetics of the study drugs.

          -  Known or suspected allergy to the investigational agents or any agent given in
             association with this study.
