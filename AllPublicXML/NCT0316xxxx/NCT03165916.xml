  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized prospective study will be conducted of patients at Vanderbilt University Medical
      Center who undergo liver transplantation from March 2014 until approximately 120 patients are
      randomized. Patients will be randomized to undergo biliary reconstruction with and without
      stent placement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk of biliary complications can be related to the type of liver transplant performed
      and the technique used for reconstruction of the bile duct. One of the main techniques of
      performing biliary reconstruction is a choledocholedochostomy which can be performed over an
      anastomotic stent. Although placement of biliary stents is routine practice in many liver
      transplant centers around the country, there is no evidence to support their use. As of now
      both the placement and non-placement of a stent are essentially &quot;standard of care&quot;. In the
      investigators' center, many of the transplant surgeons now perform the biliary anastomosis
      over a pediatric feeding tube which is used as a stent. The practice of using stents in
      biliary anastomosis is not uniform and there are no established guidelines to support their
      indiscriminate application. The investigators have designed a prospective randomized trial to
      evaluate the effect of stent placement on biliary complications and its effect on morbidity.
