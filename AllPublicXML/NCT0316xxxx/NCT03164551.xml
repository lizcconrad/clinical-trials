  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the overall clinical value of GERI+ as an
      integrated embryo culture and assessment system, providing an undisturbed culture
      environment, continuous monitoring of embryo development and automated scoring using a
      predictive algorithm.

    <time_frame>Day 3 of embryo culture</time_frame>
    <description>Good Quality Embryos is defined embryos with 7 or more blastomeres, &lt;25% fragmentation, size and symmetry of blastomeres appropriate to the cell number, and no evidence of multinucleation, based on the morphology on Day 3 of embryo culture. Good quality embryos rate is defined as the number of good quality embryos divided by the number of 2Pronuclear stage (PN) zygotes per subject.</description>

    <description>Non-viable Embryos is defined as the embryos in which development has been arrested for at least 24 h or in which all the cells have degenerated or lysed. Non-viable embryos rate is defined as the number of non-viable embryos divided by the number of 2PN zygotes per subject.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biochemical Pregnancy Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 12 of Gestational upto Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Biochemical Pregnancy defined as a pregnancy diagnosed only by the detection of hCG in serum or urine and that does not develop into a clinical pregnancy. Biochemical pregnancy rate is defined as the number of subjects with biochemical pregnancy divided by the number of subjects with embryo transfer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ongoing Pregnancy Rate</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multiple Pregnancy Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Gestational Weeks 10 to 12</time_frame>
    <description>Multiple pregnancy is defined as a pregnancy with more than one fetus. It is identified by ultrasonography at gestational weeks 10-12. Multiple pregnancy rate is defined as the number of subjects with multiple pregnancy divided by the number of subjects with ongoing pregnancy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ectopic Pregnancy Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Gestational Weeks 6 to 8</time_frame>
    <description>Ectopic pregnancy is defined as a pregnancy in which implantation takes place outside the uterine cavity. It is identified by ultrasonography at weeks 6-8. Ectopic Pregnancy Rate is defined as the number of subjects with ectopic pregnancy divided by the number of subjects with embryo transfer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spontaneous Miscarriage Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Gestational Weeks 10 to 12</time_frame>
    <description>Spontaneous miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a clinical pregnancy before 20 completed weeks of gestational age (18 weeks after fertilization). In this study, the spontaneous miscarriage is tracked up to 10-12 weeks of gestational age. Spontaneous miscarriage rate is defined as the number of subjects with spontaneous miscarriage divided by the number of subjects with clinical pregnancy.</description>

    <description>The embryo culture of consented subjects will be carried out in GERI+ incubator for both bright-field and dark-field time lapse monitoring until Day 3 of embryo culture. On Day 3, all embryos will be reviewed firstly by GERI Assess software, using bright-field imaging. A GERI Assess score will be calculated for each embryo. The three embryos with the highest GERI Assess scores of a subject are then further assessed by Early Embryo Viability Assessment (EEVA). Finally the embryo(s) with the highest EEVA grade among the three are transferred and will be followed up until the achievement of implantation and confirmation of pregnancy.</description>

    <description>The embryo culture of consented subjects will be carried outin conventional incubator for culture until Day 3 of embryo culture. On Day 3 of embryo culture, all embryos are assessed using a bench-top microscope. The embryo(s) with optimal cell stage and grade will be transferred and will be followed up until the achievement of implantation and confirmation of pregnancy.</description>
