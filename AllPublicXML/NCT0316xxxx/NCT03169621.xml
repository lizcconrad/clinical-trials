  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic endometritis (CE) is a persistent inflammation of the endometrial lining caused by
      the infection of the uterine cavity mainly by bacterial pathogens. It is known that CE can
      produce implantation failure, recurrent abortion and preterm labor. The study hypothesis is
      that patients who have repeated implantation failures (RIF) despite transferring good quality
      and normal embryos, diagnosed by preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD), into a receptive
      endometrium, diagnosed by Endometrial Receptivity Analysis (ERA), may present asymptomatic
      CE, being the altered endometrium the main cause of these implantation failures.

      The current diagnosis of CE is the microbiological culture of endometrial biopsy samples.
      Alternatively, examination of the uterine cavity by hysteroscopy is effective at 93.4%.
      However, both methods have limitations, such as the time needed to obtain the diagnosis, the
      economic cost of the tests, the possibility of detecting microorganisms in culture etc. For
      these reasons, the developing of a simple, fast, cheap and minimally invasive diagnostic tool
      for CE patients subjected to IVF treatments is expected. It would be very useful in order to
      establish a specific treatment and improve pregnancy rates in infertile patients. For this
      reason, the bacterial DNA present in the endometrial fluid samples will be obtained and the
      identification of the causative pathogens of CE will be done by sequencing (NGS) and/or
      quantitative PCR with specific oligonucleotides for the most common bacteria causing CE. The
      validation of this new method will be performed by comparison with the microbiological
      diagnosis of those same patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On the 20th day of the cycle, coinciding with the day of hysteroscopy indicated by the
      physician according to the routine clinical practice, samples of endometrial fluid (EF) and
      endometrial biopsy (EB) of patients with RIF will be obtained. These samples will be used for
      the diagnosis of CE by both classic and molecular methods. Specifically, EF sample will be
      analyzed by molecular techniques using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) for the detection of
      infectious agents. EB sample will be divided into three parts, one of them will be used for
      molecular analysis (as control of the bacterial content present in the EF), another part will
      be subjected to microbiological analysis and the third part will be analyzed using
      histological techniques. In this way, comparisons will be made between the different
      diagnostic methods of CE in the two sample types (EF and EB) and the efficacy values of the
      new diagnostic test (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and
      Receiving Operating Characteristic curves) will be obtained using the microbiological
      diagnosis as a reference (gold standard method).

      Patients with a negative outcome for CE (approximately 40%) will continue with the expected
      assisted reproduction treatment (ART) according to the clinic's standard protocol and
      patients with a positive outcome for CE (approx. 60%) will receive antibiotic treatment
      according to usual clinical practice (time and type of antibiotic will be different according
      to the microbiological diagnosis). Once this treatment is completed, the improvement of these
      patients will be confirmed obtaining a second sample of EF and EB. The Assisted Reproductive
      Treatment (ART) will be performed once the specialist considers it appropriated.

      Finally, reproductive rates will be correlated with the diagnosis of CE. Therefore, an
      observational analytical study, in which a comparison of the ART results before and after its
      diagnosis of CE, will be carried out. The reproductive impact of an altered endometrial
      microbiota will be assessed analyzing the implantation rates, pregnancy and ongoing
      pregnancy.
