      Purpose/Objectives: Examining the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on EGP and plasma glucose
      concentration in diabetic subjects after kidney transplantation (i.e. renal denervation) or
      in subjects after renal sympathectomy (63) can add insight about the possible role of a
      neural arc which mediates the changes in plasma glucagon and/or insulin concentration in
      response to glucosuria.

      Purpose/Objectives: Examining the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on EGP and plasma glucose
      concentration in diabetic subjects after kidney transplantation (i.e. renal denervation) or
      in subjects after renal sympathectomy (63) can add insight about the possible role of a
      neural arc which mediates the changes in plasma glucagon and/or insulin concentration in
      response to glucosuria.

      Research Design/Plan: After screening, eligible subjects will receive 2 measurements of
      endogenous glucose production with a prime-continuous infusion of 3-3H-glucose. Each
      measurement will be performed on a separate day in random order after a 10-12 hour overnight
      fast and will last 8 hours (from 6 AM to 2 PM). After a 3-hour tracer equilibration period,
      each subject will receive one of the following medications in random order: (i) placebo and
      (ii) dapagliflozin 10 mg. Following the test medication at 9 AM, blood samples will be drawn
      every 20 minutes for an additional 5 hours and plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon,
      catecholamine concentrations and tritiated glucose sp act will be measured.

      Methods: Visit 1: Screening Visit 2: Endogenous Glucose Production Measurement (EGP) Visit 3:
      After completing the first EGP measurement, subjects will return to the Diabetes Research
      Unit for the second study.
