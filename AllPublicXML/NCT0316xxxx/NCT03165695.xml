    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether Ramelteon can prevent delirium, decrease the severity of
      incident delirium and improve sleep wake cycle in hospitalized elderly surgical patients.
      Half of the patients will be assigned to Ramelteon, while other half will be assigned to
      placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is a common clinical syndrome characterized by acute cognitive dysfunction with core
      features of inattention, disorganized thinking, perceptual disturbances and sleep-wake cycle
      disruption. It is typically multifactorial and can be triggered by acute infection, metabolic
      derangements, surgery, and certain medications. Older adults have a much higher incidence of
      delirium. Delirium increases in-hospital mortality, length of stay, rate of
      institutionalization and may cause or exacerbate cognitive impairment. The present pilot
      study investigates sleep loss as potentially important contributing factors in delirium and
      an opportunity for intervention. Sleep disruption is prevalent among hospitalized patients.
      Sufficient sleep is important for recovery from illness, management of pain, wound healing,
      and a variety of other biologic functions integral to recovery in addition to its putative
      role in delirium prevention. Melatonin plays an important role in circadian rhythms and
      sleep-wake cycle regulation. Melatonin secretion is altered in hospitalized older patients in
      comparison with community-living older individuals. Melatonin and the melatonin-receptor
      agonist Ramelteon have been studied and have shown promise in delirium prevention, in
      addition to promoting sleep. We propose to test the use of Ramelteon to decrease delirium and
      improve sleep/wake cycles in the elderly surgical patients.
