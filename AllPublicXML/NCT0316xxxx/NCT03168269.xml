  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography (CCTA) is emerging as the diagnostic test of choice
      in chest pain patients with low to intermediate probability of coronary artery disease (CAD).
      Qualified CCTA readers may not be available around the clock in most centers, limiting the
      use of CCTA. This study aimed to determine if well-qualified CCTA technicians can provide
      initial accurate diagnosis to guide initial management and triage of such patients
