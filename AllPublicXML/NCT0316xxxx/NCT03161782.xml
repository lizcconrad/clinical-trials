  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation
      (PNF) stretching and static stretching on range of motion (ROM), pain and function in elbow
      limitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy of PNF stretching and static stretching on ROM, pain and function in
      elbow limitation, forty voluntary patients with elbow limitation, aged between 18-55 years
      will be randomly divided into two groups: PNF Stretching group and Static Stretching group.
      PNF stretching will be combined with exercise and cold application in PNF Stretching group,
      static stretching will be combined with exercise and cold application in Static Stretching
      group, will be applied for 12 sessions. The patients will be assessed before and after
      six-week treatment. The pain on activity, at rest and at night will be assessed with Visual
      Analog Scale (VAS). ROM will be assesed with universal goniometer. The functional status will
      be evaluated by Disabilities Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH). Kinesiophobia and quality of life
      will be assessed with Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia and Short Form-12, respectively. The
      Global Rating of Change will be used to evaluate patient satisfaction.

    <description>For hold-relax stretching, each subject in PNF Stretching group will be comfortably positioned in a supine lying position, and patient will move the joint to the end of the passive or pain-free ROM. The therapist will ask for an isometric contraction of the restricting muscle or pattern (antagonists) with emphasis on rotation. The patients will be asked to perform submaximal isometric contractions of the target muscle for 10 seconds. After the contraction, the patients will be instructed to relax for 5 seconds. The joint will be repositioned actively to the new limit of range, and then therapist will passively control the new ROM. The procedure will be repeated 10 times with 10 seconds of rest between two successive trials. Patients will be treated 2 times per week for 6 weeks.</description>
