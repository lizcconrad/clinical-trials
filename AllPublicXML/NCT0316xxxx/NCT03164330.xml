  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Workplace wellness programs have become a $6 billion industry and are widely touted as a way
      to improve employee well-being, reduce health care costs by promoting prevention, and
      increase workplace productivity. Yet, there is little rigorous evidence available to support
      these claims, partly because the voluntary nature of these programs means that participants
      may differ from nonparticipants for reasons unrelated to the causal effects of the wellness
      program. The investigators will implement a randomized control trial to identify the effects
      of incentives on wellness program participation, produce causal estimates of the effect of
      wellness programs on health outcomes, determine what kinds of employees benefit from wellness
      programs the most, and test for the presence of peer effects in wellness participation.

    <description>The biometric test will measure: (1) anthropometrics such as height, weight, and waist circumference (to assess obesity and overweight status); (2) resting blood pressure (to assess hypertension); (3) blood glucose (to assess diabetes risk); and (4) total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol levels, total cholesterol ratio, and triglycerides (to assess risk of cardiovascular disease). The HRA is a survey designed to identify areas of health improvement, by asking a series of questions related to wellness, health status, nutrition, healthy activities, desire to improve health, preventative health measures. The HRA is also pre-populated with biometric information from the screening. Upon completion, participants are given customized feedback on areas of improvement. No compensation for completion.</description>

    <ipd_description>Our study will collect detailed data on human subjects and perform several analyses using these data. These data will include self-reported survey data, biometric data, employer administrative data, and health care insurance claims data. Because our data are confidential and include protected health information, we can only share a de-identified version of the data. A statement is included on the study's informed consent form to secure participant's consent to make the de-identified data available to outside researchers. We will also provide replication code that will allow individuals to replicate all of our results. The public use version of our data and replication code for our analyses will be posted publicly on our study's website, which will be hosted at www.nber.org, as well as on the PI's websites.</ipd_description>
