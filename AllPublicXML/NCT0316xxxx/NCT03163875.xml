      Urticaria is one of the most frequent presenting complaints in dermatology, allergy, and
      emergency departments. The term chronic urticaria (CU) is understood as the appearance of
      recurrent wheals more than twice a week for over 6 consecutive weeks .Urticaria is not a
      single disease but a reaction pattern that represents cutaneous mast cell degranulation,
      resulting in extravasation of plasma into the dermis. The incidence of chronic urticaria is
      unknown, but it is thought to occur in 0.1%-3% of the population

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic urticaria signs and symptoms include: patches of red or white wheals, usually on the
      face, trunk, arms or legs. Wheals vary in size, change shape, and appear and fade repeatedly
      as the reaction runs its course. Itching is common, which may be severe. Swelling may occur
      that causes pain or burning (angioedema), especially inside the throat and around the eyes,
      cheeks, lips, hands, feet and genitals.

      It is characterized by a tendency for signs and symptoms to flare with triggers such as heat,
      exercise and stress as well as a tendency for symptoms to recur frequently and unpredictably,
      sometimes for months or years The significance of chronic urticaria is sometimes trivialised
      because it is a non-life-threatening disease, but the condition can be very uncomfortable and
      interfere with sleep and daily activities. It is one of the most common and frustrating
      diseases for both patients and physicians Chronic urticaria has a major impact on quality of
      life (QoL) , with impact on activities of daily living. Chronic urticaria patients reportedly
      suffer considerable loss of energy, sleep disturbance and emotional upset as well as
      restrictions in the social life. Depression and anxiety are the most common psychiatric
      diagnoses. These psychiatric disorders could also influence QoL
