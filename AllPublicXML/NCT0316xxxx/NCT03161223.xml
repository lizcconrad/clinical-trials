  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1/2a, dose-finding study with an initial phase 1 portion,
      articulated in four separate treatment arms, followed by a dedicated phase 2 for qualifying
      treatment Arm(s).

      The primary objective of the phase 1 portion is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of the combinations of: Durvalumab, pralatrexate, and
      romidepsin (Arm A); durvalumab, oral 5-azacitidine, and romidepsin (Arm B); durvalumab and
      romidepsin (Arm C); or durvalumab and oral 5-azacitidine (Arm D), in patients with relapsed
      or refractory (R/R) peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). The safety and toxicity profile of
      these combinations will be evaluated throughout the entire study.

      If one or more of the combinations in Arms A, B, C, or D are found to be feasible and an MTD
      is established, the phase 2 portion of the study will be initiated for the combination(s)
      with the strongest efficacy signal provided acceptable toxicity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are a heterogeneous group of aggressive lymphoid
      neoplasms and account for 10-15% of all newly diagnosed cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      (NHL). The current prevalence of PTCL in the United States is estimated to be approximately
      9,500 patient. Treatment options for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) PTCL have been
      limited. This study focuses on exploring rational combinations of these T-cell active agents
      in an effort to develop novel treatment platforms.

If no serious side effects occur, enrollment will continue in each arm for up to 10 patients. A total of 10 patients in each arm is anticipated.
Phase 2: The sample size will be calculated on an optimal 2-stage design. First, 10 patients will be enrolled. If at least 3 objective responses (PR or CR) are seen, then an additional 17 patients will be enrolled. A total of 27 patients per arm is anticipated.</intervention_model_description>
