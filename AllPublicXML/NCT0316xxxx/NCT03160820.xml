    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Beijing Tiantan's MMR vaccine in
      subjects 18 months of age and older. The MMR vaccine may be administered as a second dose to
      4-6 year-old persons with one dose immunization with MMR vaccine or as a first dose to 18
      month-old subjects with one dose immunization with measles-rubella(MR).

      This study will evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Beijing Tiantan's MMR vaccine in
      subjects 18 months of age and older.

      The MMR vaccine may be administered as a second dose to 4-6 year-old persons with one dose
      immunization with MMR vaccine or as a first dose to 18 month-old subjects with one dose
      immunization with MR.

      Immune efficacy and safety will be compared among different immunization schedules,including
      inoculation doses,enhanced immunity age,vaccination interval time.

      Antibody persistence of 1 dose of MMR vaccine will be evaluated in this study.
