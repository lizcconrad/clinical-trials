    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, phase II, open label study of Apatinib Mesylate in patients with
      with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma.

      At present, multiple anti-angiogenesis drugs for thyroid cancer of clinical research are
      ongoing worldwide, and most of which achieved fairly good therapeutic effect. To date,
      sorafenib has been approved for the treatment of radioactive iodine refractory DTC. Apatinib
      is a highly selective VEGFR2 inhibitor that reduces the angiogenesis of tumor efficiently,
      and had been proven to be effective in many solid tumors. In this study, the investigators
      aim to further explore the efficacy and safety of apatinib in locally advanced or metastatic
      differentiated thyroid carcinoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Informed consent.

          2. Histopathology confirmed locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid
             carcinoma, with measurable lesions (RECIST 1.1).

          3. Age:18-75 years, ECOG（Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group） Score:0-2, Expected survival
             period ≥ 3 months.

          4. Patients with disease progression which was confirmed by imaging in 18 months, and
             meet any one of the following four:

               1. The tumor invades important organs, and cannot be resectted completely, the
                  remnant thyroid tissue is extensive and not suitable for further iodine
                  treatment.

               2. Lesions have no iodine affinity.

               3. The cumulative dose of RAI (radioactive iodine) ≥ 600mCi or 22GBq.

               4. Patients with disease progression confirmed by radiological examination within 18
                  months of last RAI.

          5. Patients general condition meeting the following:
