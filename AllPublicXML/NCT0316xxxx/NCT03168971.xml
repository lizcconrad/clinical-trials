  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the preliminary efficacy of a telephone-administered
      cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention for anxiety in older adults (65 years and older)
      with cancer and their primary informal caregiver. This study will examine the impact of the
      intervention on patient and caregiver anxiety (primary outcome) and depression, distress, and
      quality of life (secondary outcomes) relative to a usual care control condition.

      This study is a pilot randomized controlled trial of a seven-session telephone-administered
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention for anxiety in older adults with cancer and
      their primary informal (unpaid) caregiver. The primary purpose of this study is to examine
      the impact of the intervention on patient and caregiver anxiety, depression, distress, and
      quality of life relative to a usual care control condition. Anxiety is the primary outcome;
      depression, distress, and quality of life are secondary outcomes. Patients will be 65 years
      of age or older and will be recruited from the myeloma, lung, lymphoma, gynecologic, breast,
      and genitourinary cancer clinics at a single institution. Study measures will be administered
      by telephone prior to initiating the intervention (baseline) and following intervention
      completion for participants in the treatment condition or 8-9 weeks after the baseline survey
      for participants in the usual care condition (follow-up).
