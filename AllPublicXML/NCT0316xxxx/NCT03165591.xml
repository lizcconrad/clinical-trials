  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer (PDA) is the most lethal form of cancer, and the fourth-leading cause of
      cancer-related death in the United States, with a survival rate of less than 7%.There are
      currently no treatments found to be effective for patients with advanced disease who are
      ineligible for surgery, a prognosis representing the majority of pancreatic cancer diagnoses.
      Pancreatic cancer is not amenable to chemotherapy as compared to other cancer types, leaving
      patients with practically no options except surgery.

      We have made oral tableted therapeutic vaccine, V3-P, derived from pooled blood of patients
      with PDA in line with similar highly promising approach we have adopted for patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CAA). Patients with PDA will be given
      one tablet per day of V3-P and followed up to see the outcome.

      This study is an open label Phase II study aimed to recruit at least 20 patients with
      inoperable PDA and who are positive for CA19.9 pancreatic tumor marker. The presence of
      higher than normal levels of CA19.9 is the sole inclusion criteria. Patients will be given
      one tablet of V3-P daily and followed for three months.
