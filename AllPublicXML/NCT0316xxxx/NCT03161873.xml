      In this study physiological data is measured using wearable sensors as well as hormonal and
      ultrasound measurements of growing follicles/ ovulation in a group of endocrinologically
      healthy women with regular cycles, who aim for a spontaneous pregnancy. These women were
      recruited to generate reliable data on changes of the measured physiological parameters in a
      healthy menstrual cycle, as well as to evaluate physiological changes associated with early
      pregnancy.

      All pregnancies beginning during the study period are to be monitored to their natural end,
      in order to evaluate how the same nine physiological parameters are changing during
      pregnancy, how strong the variations of the parameters during pregnancy are, and whether they
      could be associated with early onsets of pregnancy complications such as premature birth or
      pre-eclampsia. This will be highly valuable to develop study protocols for the specific
      evaluation of the screening potential of pregnancy complications.

        In this study we want to conduct measurements of physiological data as well as hormonal and
        ultrasound measurements of growing follicles/ ovulation in a group of endocrinologically
        healthy women with a regular cycle, who aim for a spontaneous pregnancy. We choose these
        women to generate reliable data on changes of the measured physiological parameters in a
        healthy menstrual cycle, as well as to evaluate physiological changes associated with the
        initiation of pregnancy.

        We want to continue measurements in all pregnancies beginning during the study period to
        evaluate how the same nine physiological parameters are changing during pregnancy, how
        strong the variations of the parameters during pregnancy are, and whether they could be
        associated with early onsets of pregnancy complications such as premature birth or
        preeclampsia. This will be highly valuable to develop study protocols for the specific
        evaluation of the screening potential of one of the pregnancy complications.
