  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is general that there are many factors for individual differences of drugs in clinical
      application, of which genetic factors accounted for more than 20%. Ticagrelor is a new-type
      receptor antagonist of P2Y12 and it is not affected by the influence of CYP2C19 polymorphism.
      With lack of predicted biomarkers, especially the research data of Chinese, it has the
      important significance in studying individual differences of ticagrelor in the antiplatelet
      efficacy and safety, through the pharmacogenomics research.

      The aim of this study is to determine the polymorphism of drug metabolizing enzymes, drug
      transporters and drug target genes in Chinese population. By detecting the gene polymorphism,
      we intend to study the pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamics/ pharmacogenomics (PK-PD-PG)
      correlation of ticagrelor and provide scientific basis for accurate medication guide for
      people to use ticagrelor.
