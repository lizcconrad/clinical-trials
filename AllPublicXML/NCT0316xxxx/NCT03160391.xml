  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study used a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of two interventions (dance
      and musical training) for typically developing children. Interventions were run for three
      weeks in local community locations. Participants were tested before and after the
      intervention on a battery of cognitive and behavioural measures. They were compared across
      groups, and to a control group who do not receive the intervention.

      The purpose of the current study was to assess the influence of dance and musical training on
      cognitive development. Research has indicated that musical training is associated with
      improve cognitive functioning, although the direction of such an association is unclear.
      Further, it is uncertain whether any benefits are specific to musical training or can also be
      demonstrated with other training activities. The current study used a randomized controlled
      trial to assess the causal effects of dance and musical training.

      Participants Monolingual children aged between six and nine years old were recruited from two
      local communities in Ontario, Canada. Children with developmental delays, learning
      disabilities, or previous arts training were excluded from the study.

      Participants were randomly allocated to one of two groups

        1. Dance intervention group

        2. Music intervention group

      To establish baseline performance levels and have a comparison, a passive control group was
      collected from the same towns using the same exclusion criteria.

      Data analysis Difference scores were calculated for each measure by subtracting each
      participant's second testing session data from the first. When appropriate, iterative
      trimming with a 3 SD cutoff was used, by subject and by condition, to remove outliers.
      Results for each measure were analyzed using one-way ANOVAs (analysis of variance) for the
      between-subjects factor of training group (music, dance, or control).

    <description>Training curriculums were developed using guidelines set by the Ontario Ministry of Education (The Ontario Curriculum, 2009) for teaching music to grades 1 to 3. Music was delineated into duration, pitch, dynamics and other expressive controls, timbre, texture/harmony, and form. training included direct instruction and group activities. All training programs had the same structure: a warm-up period, following by instruction from a teacher, and then group activities to practically demonstrate the concepts learned. Both programs involved working towards a variety of ensembles.</description>

    <description>As with music training, dance was operationally defined by fundamental concepts for the art form, namely elements for body, space, time, energy, and relationship. The intervention involved both individual and group activities, with a combination of instruction and practical activities, and preparation for a final performance.</description>
