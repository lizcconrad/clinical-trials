      The goal of this research study is to determine the feasibility and accuracy of Mespere Life
      Science non-invasive central venous pressure monitoring system (Mespere VENUS 2000CVP system)
      in children with congenital heart disease (CHD).

    <textblock>
      Central venous pressure (CVP), also known as right atrial pressure (RAp), is a reflection of
      the right heart filling pressure i.e the preload of the right ventricle. Assessment of the
      CVP is essential in the management of different clinical situations in children. Invasive CVP
      monitoring by placement of a CVP catheter either in the internal jugular vein or the
      subclavian vein is the gold standard way of measuring the CVP both in children and adults.
      However, placing a CVP catheter in a child can be challenging, time consuming, often requires
      the child to be sedated and it is not without complications.

      Being able to reliably measure the CVP noninvasively would be of great benefit for sick
      children as it may allow diagnoses to be made quickly and help guide treatment.

      The goal of this proposal is to determine the feasibility and accuracy of Mespere Life
      Science non-invasive central venous pressure monitoring system (Mespere VENUS 2000CVP system)
      in children with congenital heart disease (CHD).
