  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial aimed to design an intensive intervention to modify
      lifestyles of subjects with intermediate cardiovascular risk and evaluate its effectiveness.
      200 participants aged 35-74 years who have intermediate cardiovascular risk will be included.
      Subjects will be selected by consecutive sampling at urban primary care health centers from
      Salamanca (Spain) and they will be randomized to a control or an intervention group. Both
      groups will receive individual standardized counselling on healthy diet, daily physical
      activity, smoking cessation, and moderation in alcohol consumption. Moreover, individuals
      from the intervention group will receive additional group counselling and follow-up calls.
      The effect of the intervention will be assessed using lifestyles and quality of life
      questionnaires, metabolic control parameters, inflammation markers, anthropometric and
      vascular function measurements, and neuropsychological tests.

    <description>Group sessions focusing on cardiovascular risk, diet and moderation in alcohol consumption, physical activity and stress management, and smoking cessation will be held in health centres for four consecutive weeks. Each session will last 60-90 minutes, and will be led by two trained nurse practitioners. Ten participants will assist each group. During each session, attendance will be recorded and printed educational materials related to the topic addressed will be distributed.
Follow-up calls to reinforce lifestyle modification and record the barriers to behaviour change found will be performed 6 and 9 months after enrolment.</description>
