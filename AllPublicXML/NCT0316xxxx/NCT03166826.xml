  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apgar scoring system has been widely used for the evaluation of the infant's postnatal
      condition. As conventional Apgar scoring system is affected by gestational age and
      resuscitative efforts, there is a need for development of new scoring systems for the
      assessment in the delivery room. Herein, Modified Combined Apgar scoring system which
      includes two new parameters (cord blood pH and targeted oxygen saturation level) has been
      developed and the utility of this modified system was compared with Conventional and Combined
      Apgar scoring systems for prediction of hospitalization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study. Conventional, Combined and Modified Combined Apgar scores
      at minutes 1 and 5 are all recorded. For Modified scoring system, blood sample is obtained
      from the umbilical artery and pulse oximetry is used for measurement of oxygen saturation.
      Prediction of NICU hospitalization is used as a surrogate parameter to compare the scores.
