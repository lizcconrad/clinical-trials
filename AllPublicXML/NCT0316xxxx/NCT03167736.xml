  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare two different approaches for treating patients
      with lumbar spinal stenosis: electric dry needling and thrust manipulation versus
      impairment-based manual therapy, stretching, strengthening and electrothermal modalities.
      Physical therapists commonly use all of these techniques to treat lumbar spinal stenosis.
      This study is attempting to find out if one treatment strategy is more effective than the
      other.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with lumbar spinal stenosis will be randomized to receive 1-2 treatment sessions per
      week for 6 weeks (up to 12 sessions total) of either: (1) electric dry needling and thrust
      manipulation or (2) impairment-based manual therapy, stretching, strengthening and
      electrothermal modalities
