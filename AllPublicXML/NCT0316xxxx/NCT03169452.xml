  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Noninvasive ventilation is increasingly used method of respiratory management in both the
      emergency room and critical care. Noninvasive ventilation delivers mechanically assisted
      breaths without the placement of an artificial airway and has become an important mechanism
      of ventilator support inside and outside the intensive care unit.

      Noninvasive ventilation is further subdivided into negative pressure ventilation which is the
      iron lung, first used in 1928 and the Hayek oscillator, is a more recently designed to
      provide negative pressure during inspiration and positive pressure during expiration.
      Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation can be used as continuous positive airway pressure
      or bi-level positive airway pressure.
