  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mechanisms of bariatric surgery-induced weight loss go beyond reductions in calorie
      intake and may involve several other pathways. Recently, brown adipose tissue (BAT) has been
      added as another potential player. Activation of BAT results in enhanced energy expenditure
      and promotes weight loss. Here, the investigators will study the effects of bariatric surgery
      on BAT function by PET/CT studies and molecular analyses of adipose biopsies. The
      investigators will explore different pathways that may affect BAT activation in this patient
      population.
