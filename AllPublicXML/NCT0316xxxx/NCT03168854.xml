      This Phase 1 trial will include 16 subjects in Study Arms 1 and 2 who will receive the GAP3KO
      vaccine administered by the bite of approximately 200 infected A. stephensi mosquitoes in a
      controlled clinical environment and 12 CHMI infectivity controls (six for each of the two
      CHMIs). The ten subjects in Arm 1 will each receive five vaccinations, with the first four
      vaccinations given four weeks apart and the fifth vaccination given eight weeks after the
      fourth vaccination, for a maximum cumulative dose of 1000 GAP3KO bites per subject and
      scheduled vaccinations will be given to all Arm 1 subjects on the same day. The six subjects
      in Arm 2 will receive three vaccinations, with the second vaccination given four weeks after
      the first vaccination and the third vaccination given eight weeks after the second
      vaccination, for a maximum cumulative dose of 600 GAP3KO bites per subject. The scheduled
      vaccinations will be given to all Arm 2 subjects on the same day. The first CHMI will be
      given at four weeks after the last vaccination for subjects in Study Arms 1 and 2 and will
      include six infectivity controls. The second CHMI will be given 26 weeks (six months) after
      the first CHMI and will include subjects in Study Arms 1 and 2 who did not have documented
      malaria infection following the first CHMI and six new infectivity controls. To allow the
      first and second CHMI administrations to be given concurrently to subjects in Study Arms 1
      and 2, subjects in Study Arm 2 will initiate the GAP3KO series on the day that Study Arm 1
      subjects receive their third vaccination. The second vaccination for Study Arm 2 subjects
      will be given four weeks later, on the day that Study Arm 1 subjects receive their fourth
      vaccination, and both groups will receive their last vaccination eight weeks later. Subjects
      will be observed for adverse events for at least 60 minutes after each GAP3KO administration.
      Solicited local and systemic AEs will be recorded on a memory aid Subjects will be monitored
      for possible breakthrough peripheral parasitemia . Positive tests will be followed by repeat
      testing as soon as possible and with clinical safety labs.Four weeks after the last GAP3KO
      administration, all subjects who completed the immunization phase (up to 16) and a group of
      six malaria-naïve infectivity controls will be challenged on the same day with wild-type P.
      falciparum NF54 sporozoites. On the day of challenge, subjects will receive five infectious
      A. stephensi mosquito bites using standard CHMI procedures. Twenty-six weeks (six months)
      after that challenge, all of the protected subjects in Arms 1 and 2 (up to 16) and another
      six malaria-naïve infectivity controls will receive five infectious A. stephensi mosquito
      bites on the same day using standard CHMI procedures. For subjects in Study Arms 1 and 2 with
      documented parasitemia after the first CHMI or who are discontinued for other reasons after
      the first CHMI, and for the infectivity controls, additional follow up will occur on Days 90
      and 180 after their first CHMI. SAEs will be recorded from the day of CHMI through the end of
      study follow up and clinical laboratory evaluations for safety will be performed on Day 29
      and as clinically indicated (all subjects) and, for subjects with documented parasitemia, on
      the day malaria treatment is initiated and three days after malaria treatment is initiated.
      The primary objectives are to: 1) assess the safety and reactogenicity of candidate GAP3KO
      malaria vaccine when administered by the bite of approximately 200 infected mosquitoes on a
      five dose schedule, with the first four vaccinations given four weeks apart and the fifth
      vaccination given eight weeks after the fourth vaccination, and on a three dose schedule,
      with the second vaccination given four weeks after the first vaccination and the third
      vaccination given eight weeks after the second vaccination, to healthy malaria-naïve adults
      aged 18 through 50 years , 2) confirm attenuation of GAP3KO parasites by assessing the
      occurrence of breakthrough peripheral parasitemia from the time of first GAP3KO
      administration through 28 days after last GAP3KO administration.

      the first vaccination and the third vaccination given eight weeks after the second
      vaccination, for a maximum cumulative dose of 600 GAP3KO bites per subject. The scheduled
      vaccinations will be given to all Arm 2 subjects on the same day. The first CHMI will be
      given at four weeks after the last vaccination for subjects in Study Arms 1 and 2 and will
      include six infectivity controls. The second CHMI will be given 26 weeks (six months) after
      the first CHMI and will include subjects in Study Arms 1 and 2 who did not have documented
      malaria infection following the first CHMI and six new infectivity controls. To allow the
      first and second CHMI administrations to be given concurrently to subjects in Study Arms 1
      and 2, subjects in Study Arm 2 will initiate the GAP3KO series on the day that Study Arm 1
      subjects receive their third vaccination. The second vaccination for Study Arm 2 subjects
      will be given four weeks later, on the day that Study Arm 1 subjects receive their fourth
      vaccination, and both groups will receive their last vaccination eight weeks later. Subjects
      will be observed for adverse events for at least 60 minutes after each GAP3KO administration.
      Solicited local and systemic AEs will be recorded on a memory aid beginning of the day of
      first vaccine administration and continuing through 28 days after the last administration.
      Subjects will be monitored for possible breakthrough peripheral parasitemia with qRT-PCR
      testing of samples collected at 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 days after the first vaccination, at
      10 and 14 days after each subsequent vaccination, additionally at 7 days after the last
      vaccination, and as clinically indicated from the time of first vaccination through 28 days
      after last vaccination. If a subject has signs or symptoms consistent with malaria but is PCR
      negative a TBS will be performed from the sample collected for the qRT-PCR assay. Positive
      qRT-PCR tests will be followed by repeat testing as soon as possible. Four weeks after the
      last GAP3KO administration, all subjects who completed the immunization phase (up to 16) and
      a group of six malaria-naïve infectivity controls will be challenged on the same day with
      wild-type P. falciparum NF54 sporozoites. On the day of challenge, subjects will receive five
      infectious A. stephensi mosquito bites using standard CHMI procedures. Twenty-six weeks (six
      months) after that challenge, all of the protected subjects in Arms 1 and 2 (up to 16) and
      another six malaria-naïve infectivity controls will receive five infectious A. stephensi
      mosquito bites on the same day using standard CHMI procedures. For subjects in Study Arms 1
      and 2 without documented parasitemia additional post-CHMI follow-up will occur on Day 90
      after the first CHMI and on days 90 and 180 after the second CHMI. For subjects in Study Arms
      1 and 2 with documented parasitemia after the first CHMI or who are discontinued for other
      reasons after the first CHMI, and for the infectivity controls, additional follow up will
      occur on Days 90 and 180 after their first CHMI. SAEs will be recorded from the day of CHMI
      through the end of study follow up and clinical laboratory evaluations for safety will be
      performed on Day 29 and as clinically indicated (all subjects) and, for subjects with
      documented parasitemia, on the day malaria treatment is initiated and three days after
      malaria treatment is initiated. The primary objectives are to: 1) assess the safety and
      reactogenicity of candidate GAP3KO malaria vaccine when administered by the bite of
      approximately 200 infected mosquitoes on a five dose schedule, with the first four
      vaccinations given four weeks apart and the fifth vaccination given eight weeks after the
      fourth vaccination, and on a three dose schedule, with the second vaccination given four
      weeks after the first vaccination and the third vaccination given eight weeks after the
      second vaccination, to healthy malaria-naïve adults aged 18 through 50 years , 2) confirm
      attenuation of GAP3KO parasites by assessing the occurrence of breakthrough peripheral
      parasitemia from the time of first GAP3KO administration through 28 days after last GAP3KO
      administration. The secondary objectives are to 1) Is assess the efficacy of GAP3KO vaccine
      given on a five dose schedule and GAP3KO vaccine given on a three dose schedule against
      malaria challenge four weeks after last vaccination, and re-challenge 26 weeks (six months)
      after the first challenge, using standard controlled human malaria infection (CHMI)
      procedures, 2) to assess humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to malaria antigens
      induced by GAP3KO administration and by CHMI. Study Arm 1 is approximately 20 months, Study
      Arm 2 approximately 18 months. The population are 28 healthy male and female subjects aged 18
      through 50 years.

        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment in
        this study.

          1. 18 through 50 years of age, inclusive.

          2. Able and willing to participate for the duration of the study and able to understand
             and comply with planned study procedures.

          3. Able and willing to provide written (not proxy) informed consent.

          4. Provides informed consent before initiation of any study procedure, correctly answers
             = / &gt; 80% of questions* on the post consent quiz and is available for all study
             visits.

             *Subjects who score less than 80% may retake the quiz one time and are excluded if the
             second test is also less than 80%.

          5. Is in good health, as judged by the investigator, and determined by medical history
             and physical examination.

             *Existing medical diagnoses or conditions (except those in the Subject Exclusion
             Criteria) must be deemed as stable. A stable medical condition is defined as no change
             in prescription medication, dose, or frequency of medication in the last three months
             (90 days) and health outcomes of the specific disease are considered to be within
             acceptable limits in the last six months (180 days). Any change due to change of
             health care provider, insurance company, or that is done for financial reasons, as
             long as in the same class of medication, will not be considered a violation of this
             inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a
             disease outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate
             sub-investigator, will not be considered a violation of this inclusion criterion.
             Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the
             site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional
             risk to subject safety or assessment of solicited events and immunogenicity.

          6. Women of childbearing potential* must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening and a negative urine pregnancy test prior to each mosquito exposure**.

             *Not sterilized via bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy,
             or, if menopausal, still menstruating or &lt; 1 year of the last menses

             **Study vaccination or CHMI

          7. Women of childbearing potential must have used a highly effective form of
             contraception* in the 30 days prior to their first mosquito exposure.** *Highly
             effective single forms of contraception include abstinence from sexual activity that
             could lead to pregnancy, monogamous relationship with vasectomized partner who has
             been vasectomized for six months or more prior to enrollment, successful Essure®
             placement (permanent, non-surgical, non-hormonal sterilization) with documented
             confirmation test at least three months after the procedure, or use of effective
             intrauterine devices or the contraceptive implant (Nexplanon). If none of the highly
             effective single forms of contraception is used, a combination of an acceptable
             barrier method and an acceptable hormonal method must be used. Acceptable barrier
             methods include condom (male or female) and a spermicide (cream, film, foam, or gel),
             diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, and the birth control sponge. Acceptable
             hormonal methods include birth control patch, shot (Depo-Provera), and pills, and the
             vaginal ring (NuvaRing).

             **Study vaccination or CHMI

          8. Women of childbearing potential must agree to continue use of a highly effective form
             of contraception through 90 days after their last mosquito exposure.

             the end of study follow up.

         10. At low (&lt;/ = 10%) 5-year cardiovascular risk*

             *Per the risk prediction method of Gaziano
             (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2864150/). Risk for persons &lt; 35 years
             of age will be based on the age 35-44 group.

         11. No history of malaria infection or vaccination, residence in a malaria-endemic area
             for &gt;/ =5 years, or participation in a malaria research study*.

             *Participation without exposure to malaria infection or to a malaria vaccine is not
             exclusionary.

         12. No receipt of malaria prophylaxis or travel to a malaria-endemic area in the six
             months prior to first mosquito exposure.

         13. No receipt of blood products or immunoglobulin within six months prior to, or donation
             of a unit of blood within two months prior to, enrollment.

         14. Weight &gt;/ = 50 kg and body mass index (BMI) &lt; 35 kg/m2

         15. Negative serology for HIV 1/2* *If the ELISA is positive, HIV confirmation should be
             performed. If the HIV Western Blot is not consistent with HIV infection, the subject
             may be enrolled. A past subject in an HIV vaccine trial who has a positive antibody
             ELISA may participate if the Western Blot is not consistent with pending
             seroconversion or positive or an HIV PCR assay result is below the level of detection
             of HIV.

         16. Negative hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody.

         17. No Grade 1 or higher screening clinical lab value* (Appendix B)

             *Screening clinical labs include blood tests (white blood count [WBC], hemoglobin,
             platelet count, creatinine, and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) and urine dipstick
             tests (protein and hemoglobin). Any Grade 1 or higher value for any screening test
             will exclude the subject from enrollment with the exception of hematuria &gt; / = 1 +
             detected concurrent with endometrial bleeding for females. In this situation, the test
             can be repeated if clinically warranted but is not considered an indicator of poor
             health status or increased risk and so is not a contraindication to enrollment.

         18. Screening ECG with no clinically significant abnormalities.*

             *Pathologic Q waves and significant ST-T wave changes; left ventricular hypertrophy;

             of the study.

         23. No dermatologic abnormalities in either forearm that could impair assessment of local
             reactions.

         24. No history of psoriasis or porphyria.

         25. No history of G6PD deficiency.

         26. No contraindication to repeated phlebotomy* *Such as minimal venous access or recent
             history of anemia.

         27. Reachable (24/7) by mobile phone during the duration of the study period and willing
             to provide two close contacts to assist with making contact.

             study period.

         11. Active neoplastic disease*

             *Subjects with a history of malignancy may be included if treated by surgical excision
             or if treated by chemotherapy or radiation therapy and has been observed for a period
             that in the investigator's estimation provides a reasonable assurance of sustained
             cure (not less than 36 months). Cervical neoplasia under surveillance is acceptable.

         12. Chronic topical or systemic corticosteroid use*

             *Corticosteroid nasal sprays for allergic rhinitis are permissible. Persons using a

             *Note for afebrile, acute illness only: If a subject is afebrile, his/her acute
             illness is nearly resolved with only minor residual symptoms remaining, and, in the
             opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, the
             residual symptoms will not interfere with the ability to assess safety parameters as
             required by the protocol, the subject may receive the subsequent study vaccination or

             *Includes, for example, tetracycline (may reduce atovaquone concentrations), or
             metoclopramide (may reduce bioavailability of atovaquone).

             **Includes, for example, cimetidine, metoclopramide, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St.
             John's wort, and antidepressants. Antacids and kaolin may reduce absorption of
             chloroquine but can be administered if separated by at least 4 hours from intake of
             chloroquine.

         23. Has any condition that would, in the opinion of the site investigator, place the
