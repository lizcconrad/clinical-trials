    <description>The cerebral oxymetry saturation was monitored continuously, using a non-invasive method. The cerebral saturation was monitored intraoperatively with near infrared spectroscopy (INVOS 4100; Somanetics Inc, Troy, MI). Data acquired from the device were automatically and continuously recorded in 10-second intervals throughout the anaesthesia. A lead for the cerebral saturation monitoring was placed on degreased skin on the patient's forehead, on the right side, some 1 cm over the eyebrow. The baseline value was determined before induction of anaesthesia. The following criteria were accepted as significant reduction of the cerebral oxygenation (saturation) value: reduction of the cerebral oxymetry by over 25% in relation to the baseline; the absolute value of cerebral oxymetry below 50%.</description>

    <description>Upon the day preceding the actual surgery, and again at 5 days after the surgery, the Mini Mental State Examination test was completed, with a view to assessing the chang-es in the patients' cognitive function. The difference between score in Mini Mental State Examination higher than 2 points defined a diagnosis of cognitive dysfunction.</description>

    <ipd_description>The day before the surgery will be performed basic blood tests (morphology, gas analysis) and test &quot;Short Scale Mental State Examination.&quot;
During the operation, in addition to standard monitoring the electrical activity of the heart, blood pressure and peripheral oxygen saturation levels, will be assessed non-invasively cerebral oximetry.
When during general anesthesia bradycardia occurs, then half of the patients in this group will be set up into the esophagus electrode, which will provide the ability to route atrial pacing hemodynamically optimal heart rate (80 / min). However, in the second half of the patients at the time of the occurrence of bradycardia is given intravenously at a dose of atropine 0.5 mg.
In about two hours after the surgery will be taken blood tests (morphology + gas analysis) to determine the potential impact of intraoperative bleeding changes oximetry.
On postoperative day 5 will be repeated test &quot;Short Scale Mental State Examination&quot;</ipd_description>
