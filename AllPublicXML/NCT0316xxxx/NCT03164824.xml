      This study comprised 2 major stages: 1) Cross-cultural adaptation and 2) psychometric
      properties testing.

      Cross-cultural adaptation stage:

      The FRI was cross-culturally adapted to Thai following the well-accepted guideline for the
      process of cross-cultural adaptation of self-report measure.

      Psychometric properties testing stage:

      The patients with back or neck pain completed the questionnaires at the first visit, the
      second visit and at 2-week (or at discharge or when reporting 80% improvement from the first
      visit).

    <description>Cross-cultural adaptation stage:
The FRI was cross-culturally adapted to Thai (called the Thai FRI) and the pre-final version of the Thai FRI was administered to patients.
Psychometric properties testing stage:
The questionnaires were administered 3 times: the first visit, the second visit and at 2 weeks.
At the first visit: the patients with back pain completed the Thai FRI , Thai Roland-Morris Disability (Thai RM), Thai modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability (Thai modified ODQ), Thai multi-level Roland-Morris Disability (Thai multi-level RM). The patients with neck pain completed the Thai FRI and Thai Neck Disability Index.
At the second visit: all patients completed the Thai FRI and Global Perceived Effect Scale (GPES).
At 2 weeks: the patients completed the same questionnaires as the first visit. All patients and their treating physical therapists completed the GPES.</description>
