    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve urinary incontinence in older women by building
      strength in the pelvic and lower body muscle through exercise and rehabilitation. The study
      will also look at quality of pelvic floor and lower extremities muscles using MRI (Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging).

      This study will provide data on benefits of combination of multimodal strengthening and
      aerobic conditioning rehabilitation program with PFMT and will help to characterize changes
      pelvic floor and lower extremity muscles in older women with UI after multimodal
      strengthening and aerobic conditioning rehabilitation program with PFMT.

      The proposed study will shift the paradigm in the evaluation and treatment of older women
      with UI and mobility limitations. Unlike current PFMT, an innovative multimodal strengthening
      and aerobic conditioning rehabilitation program combined with PFMT will focus on overall
      physical function using a patient-centered individual approach, evaluate and treat both UI
      and mobility limitations. The study will evaluate the incremental benefit of endurance and
      lower extremity muscle strengthening in addition to benefits from PFMT. We anticipate that
      this approach will enhance the benefits of PFMT because the proposed intervention will focus
      on prevention of functional decline through endurance, strength, and balance training among
      older women with UI. Thus, not only it will improve UI symptoms, but also decrease mobility
      limitations.

      Objective evaluation of mobility and MRI muscle fat infiltration and atrophy in older women
      with UI will give us better understanding in pathophysiology of UI and mobility limitations
      in older women. Muscle fat infiltration and atrophy assessment of the pelvic floor and
      gluteal muscles in older women is novel and may represent a biomarker which serves as a
      predictor of treatment success in the evaluation and management of UI and mobility in older
      women.
