  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of studies on treatment effect in traumatised refugees. Recent findings
      indicate that emotion regulation deficits play a key role in PTSD also among traumatized
      refugees and highlight the importance and potential directions for the development of an
      emotion regulation training for refugees. In this study, the investigators therefore want to
      examine the effectiveness of a new, transdiagnostic, cultural-sensitive group therapy, which
      systematically teaches specific emotion regulation strategies. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to either the emotion regulation training, delivered in group format or a wait list
      control condition. The study takes place in cooperation with REFUGIO Munich, which is a
      treatment centre specialised in the treatment of traumatised refugees. Clinicians will
      deliver the treatment to traumatized asylum seekers and refugees that report difficulties in
      emotion regulation. The investigators will examine if refugees and asylum seekers in the
      intervention group will show improvements in psychological symptoms, social functioning as
      well as in emotion regulation in comparison to a wait list control group which will receive
      the treatment after the intervention group has completed. The group therapy covers 14
      sessions and has a cognitive-behavioural background. It focuses on conveying strategies to
      cope with intense feelings and the patients should gain a sense of self-efficacy and control
      over their trauma-relevant feelings and symptoms. Qualified interpreters will be used in the
      assessments as well as group therapies.
