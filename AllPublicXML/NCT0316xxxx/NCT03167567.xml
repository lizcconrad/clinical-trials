      Introduction Midwives have been known for many years to give support, care and advice to
      pregnant women during pregnancy, birth and after birth. The word midwife literally means
      'with woman'. It is known that throughout the age's women during childbirth depended upon a
      skilled person (usually a woman in the olden days). Her skill is based partly on art and
      partly on science. Art: the ability to understand the woman's need, encourage and build her
      confidence. Science: knowledge and decision-making. The midwife refrains from taking control
      away from the mother, but is at hand to step in where assistance is needed (Myles 1999).

      Literature review Labor is a normal physiological process, but is usually associated with
      pain and discomfort. (Othman, Jones, &amp; Neilson, 2012). Over the years, various measures to
      relieve stress, discomfort, pain, fear and anxiety during labor have been explored. (Ganji,
      shirvani, rezaei-Abhari, &amp; Danesh, 2013). Therefore, these issues that impact the wellbeing
      of the pregnant and laboring woman are of primary interest and value to caregivers.
      (Bergstrom, Kieler, &amp; Waldenstrom, 2009). However, many women would like to have a choice in
      pain relief during labor and also would like to avoid invasive methods of pain management in
      labor. (Klomp, van Poppel, Jones, Lazet, Di Nisio, &amp; Lagro-Janssen, 2012). Adams,
      Eberhard-Gran, and Eskild, (2012) concluded that duration of labor was longer in women with
      fear of childbirth than in women without it. The search for supporting measures such as the
      use of birthing in water, yoga, and other non invasive approaches in addition to drug
      administration during labor is crucial.

      Midwives support natural birth as much as possible. Thus, preparation classes have been
      introduced to teach and enlighten pregnant woman, in order for them to understand the changes
      and process of pregnancy, labor and after birth concerning their bodies. Stress, depression,
      and anxiety affect 15 to 25% of pregnant women. However, fewer than 20% of prenatal care
      providers assess and treat mental health problems and fewer than 20% of pregnant women seek
      mental healthcare (Kingston. D. et al., 2014).

      In The Baruch Pade Medical Center there are approximately 60 live births of primiparous women
      monthly.

      Medical clowning has been used as a supportive factor, mostly in pediatric settings
      (Gorfinkle et al., 1998; Koller &amp; Gryski, 2008; Scheyer et al., 2008). Medical clowns are
      trained professionals (Bornstein, 2008; Hart, 2012) who master at least one of the various
      stage arts such as theatre, acting, circus or puppetry. Their aim is to improve the mental
      and physical well-being of patients by easing pain and anxiety due to hospitalization. The
      clowns strive to be an integral part of the medical team and are even present during
      physically intrusive procedures (Hart, 2012; Smerling et al., 1999; Tener, Lnag-Franco, Ofir
      &amp; Lev-Wiesel, 2012). The medical clown plays a therapeutic and a diagnostic role and is
      perceived as any other paramedical therapist (Hart, 2012).

      The medical clown uses a broad spectrum of verbal and non-verbal artistic tools including
      mime, movement, play, act and music in order to create humor and an alternative, imaginative
      safe reality (Nuttman-Schwartz, Scheyer &amp; Tzioni, 2010). By doing so, the clown builds an
      empowering and supportive relationship (Bornstein, 2008; Koller &amp; Gryski, 2008 The empirical
      data regarding medical clowns in hospitals is limited (e.g. Battrick, Glasper &amp; Weaver, 2007;
      Bornstein, 2008; Weaver, Prudhome, Battrick &amp; Glasper, 2007). However, the influence of humor
      and laughter on decreasing anxiety levels while preparing for surgery, post fertility
      treatments, children undergoing intra-articular corticosteroid injection, children with
      special needs and sexually abused children has been studied (Fernandes &amp; Arriaga, 2010;
      Friedler et al., 2010; Higueras et al., 2006; Kingsnorth, Blain &amp; McKeever, 2010; Koller &amp;
      Gryski, 2008; Tener et al., 2010, 2012; Oren-Ziv, Hanuka, Rotchild, Gluzman, &amp; Uziel, 2012;
      Vagnoli, Caprilli &amp; Messeri, 2010; Vagnoli, Caprilli, Robiglio &amp; Messeri, 2005). Additional
      studies found that medical clowns are helpful both for health care providers (Smerling et
      al., 1999) and patients (Battrick et al., 2007) with no difference between hospitalized
      patients and outpatients (Scheyer et al., 2008; Weaver et al., 2007).

      Medical clowns have been introduced into the hospital settings in the pediatric settings,
      IVF, operating theaters, oncology, geriatrics and others with positive results shown
      statistically. The benefits of medical clowning intervention, are in encouraging and
      supporting patients to co-operate with treatment procedure, in reducing stress, coping with
      fears, anxiety and reducing pain.

      Extensive evidence indicates that negative and positive affective traits such as depression,
      worry, calmness, or cheerfulness can influence physical health (Papousek &amp; Schulter, 2008).
      Also, There is strong evidence that positive and negative affects strongly influence
      subjective physical health (such as symptom reporting, self rated health or perception of the
      examinations performed) (Cohen, Doyle, Turner, Alper &amp; Skoner, 2003; Cohen 1995; Hirdes &amp;
      Forbes, 1993; Watson &amp; Pennebaker, 1989). An increase in the patient wellbeing could be the
      result of an increase in positive affect, a decrease in negative affect, or a combination of
      the two factors (Charles, Reynolds &amp; Gatz, 2001). A number of methods are used to induce
      positive moods and reduce negative affect in the experimental studies of mood and health. In
      Pressman and Cohen (2005, 2006) review of 45 empirical studies about affect and health,
      manipulations that involved active participation or were particularly engaging to the
      participant were found to be more effective in influencing positive and negative affect,
      whereas more passive manipulations failed to do so. Medical Clowns may be an active and
      engaging way of enhancing the positive and reducing the negative affect regarding primiparas.

      In the delivery room there are women in different stages of labor that are anxious and
      fearful. It is to be noted that medical clowns have been working at The Padeh Medical Center
      for the past 10 years and the area is still expanding to different departments in the
      hospital such as: high risk pregnancy, parents in the neonatal intensive care units (NICU)
      and in the In Vitro fertilization (IVF) unit. In addition, following a meeting of women
      undergoing IVF treatments and women hospitalized due to high risk pregnancies, we have been
      contacted by several women who expressed their wish to have a medical clown present during
      their delivery. With this enlightenment, we find it necessary to check if it is possible to
      assist the birthing woman and her care givers in the labor room with medical clowning in the
      birth process.

      The purposes of this study are:

        1. To study the effect of female medical clowns on relieving anxiety during labor

        2. To document whether the use of medical clowning can reduce the time for use of pain
           relievers and shorten the duration of labor.

      Methods:

      Before their first birth, while visiting the hospital, a questionnaire will be administered
      to the women. This will be a Likert-type response scale ranging from 1 (Not at all) to 5 (the
      most) rated by the primiparas, examining the women's perception of incorporating medical
      clowning in the labor process. After birth, PANAS Scales short questionnaires which measure
      the positive and negative affect of the primiparas will be filled in by the women within 48
      hours after giving birth (Charles, Reynolds &amp; Gatz, 2001; Watson &amp; Clark, 1988). In addition,
      we will record measures regarding the length of labor and at what stage/after after entering
      the labor room women asked for analgesics, what kind of analgesics they asked for, and when
      and what did they receive.

      Patients:

      Two hundred women, older than 18 years, at their first expected labor,100 as intervention
      group and 100 as the control group.

        1. A candidate who will arrive at The Padeh Medical Center will be approached by a midwife
           or a doctor with information about the research and will be asked if she wishes to take
           part.

        2. According to the patients' request and to the clown's shift, the patients will be
           recruited to either the control or the research group.

        3. A research team member will inform the participants who will be allocated to the
           intervention that they can, at any stage, ask the clown to leave the delivery room. In
           addition, primiparas from both groups will be informed that they can at any stage ask to
           be excluded from the research. All these will be also explicitly stated in the consent
           form which she will sign. Each participant will receive a number and her details will be
           kept and available to the staff members only.

        4. The delivery room staff will guide the clown as to when to join the primipara in the
           delivery room. The medical clown will enter the delivery room and stay with the woman as
           long as she wishes (within the clown's shift of 3 hours).

        5. After the delivery a member of the research team or a research assistant will fill in
           the demographic questionnaire.

        6. Within 48 hours after delivery the patient will fill in the PANAS questionnaire.

        7. At the conclusion of all the above, all data regarding the delivery, drug usage and
           length of labor, complications if any will be entered to the CRF with all other
           patients' data.

      Clowns:

      The female medical clowns will be present in the delivery rooms for a shift of 3 hours twice
      a week.

      Research tools:

        1. Likert-type scale questionnaire (appendix 1).

        2. Demographic questionnaire for the primiparas. (Appendix 2)

        3. The PANAS scale - brief measures of positive and negative affect (appendix 3). Will be
           given to the research group.

        4. The PANAS scale - brief measures of positive and negative affect (appendix 3). Will be
           given to the control group.

        5. Information from the reports of the labor department regarding the length of labor and
           of the analgesics requested by (timing and kind) given to the women and any
           complications will be documented.

      Data analysis:

      Data from the Likert-type scales questionnaire will be analyzed in order to capture the
      perception of women before labor of introducing medical clowns during labor. Data from the
      PANAS questionnaire will be analyzed. Negative and Positive affect will be assessed in
      adapted scales. Separate Hierarchical Multiple Regression analyses will be conducted to
      examine the influence of the medical clown in the two dependent variables: Positive and
      Negative affect. In addition, we will try to understand what parameters from the demographic
      questionnaire effect the primipara's reaction and co-operation with the medical clown during
      labor.

      Control of Potential Biases:

      The research group will contain two medical clowns, a gynecologist and 2 RN midwifes from the
      labor ward team who have almost no experience in working with medical clowns and has no
      preconception about the issue.
