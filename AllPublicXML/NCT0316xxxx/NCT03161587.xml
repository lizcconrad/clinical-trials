  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disease characterized by multiple
      clinical manifestations as well as co-morbidities. While COPD subjects have traditionally
      been classified based solely on airflow limitation (forced expiratory volume in one second
      [FEV1]), a new classification system was introduced in the year of 2011 by the Global
      Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) that recommended subjects with COPD
      should be classified based on a combination of airflow limitation, disease impact (determined
      by symptom burden and activity limitation) and history of exacerbation. This approach results
      in the classification of subjects in four groups: A (low risk, less symptoms), B (low risk,
      more symptoms), C (high risk, less symptoms), and D (high risk, more symptoms). This
      classification system was further refined in year 2013, specifically around the history of
      exacerbation definition, where having ≥1 exacerbation leading to hospital admission in
      preceding year was added as a criteria for classification into the &quot;high risk&quot; C or D groups.
      Further, in the year 2016, there was a refinement of the disease impact criteria that suggest
      the use of the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score (over the Modified British Medical Research
      Council Dyspnea Scale [mMRC] score) as the preferred tool to determine classification as
      &quot;more symptoms&quot; or &quot;less symptoms&quot;. This study aims to understand subject characteristics and
      current treatment modalities in different groups classified by GOLD 2016 comprehensive
      classification system and to understand if current treatment choice is concordant with the
      GOLD recommendations in real life clinical practice in China tertiary hospitals. It will
      provide a useful point-in-time description of COPD subject characteristics and current
      treatment modalities in real life clinical practice in China.

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be classified into groups A-D according to GOLD 2016 comprehensive classification system. Symptoms will be assessed with the CAT scale to determine if the subject belongs to the boxes of side-Less Symptoms (CAT &amp;lt;10) or side-More Symptoms (CAT ≥10).
Risk of exacerbations will be assessed to determine if the subject belongs to the lower part of the box-Low Risk or the upper part of the box-High Risk.
Spirometry will be used to determine the GOLD grade of airflow limitation (GOLD 1 and GOLD 2 categories indicate Low Risk, while GOLD 3 and GOLD 4 indicate High Risk).</description>

    <measure>To assess the disease severity by CAT score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom assessment will be done based on CAT score. The CAT is a validated, short and simple subject completed questionnaire which has been developed for use in routine clinical practice to measure the health status of subjects with COPD. Subjects are scored on eight items (cough, phlegm, chest tightness, breathlessness, activity limitation, confidence, sleep and energy) on a scale of 0-5 depending on their impact. The sum of scores for each item gives the subject's impact score ranging from 0 (no impact) to 40 (worst possible impact). Subjects will be stratified as score &lt; 10 and ≥10.</description>

    <description>An exacerbation of COPD is an acute event characterized by a worsening of the subject's respiratory symptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day variations and leads to a change in medication.
