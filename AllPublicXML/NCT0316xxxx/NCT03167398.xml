  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic resistance has emerged world wide and is of major concern. Multi-drug resistant
      (MDR) bacteria is widely spread and is now a major factor in morbidity and mortality in
      health-care settings. Among MDRs, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are of
      special concern, receiving the highest classification of &quot;urgent threat level&quot; in the US
      President Report. Consistent mortality rates of 40-50% are observed among inpatients with
      infections caused by CRE in hospitals worldwide, related mainly to unavailable, delayed or
      ineffective antibiotic treatment options.

      The extremely high mortality rates of patients with CRE infections have driven efforts to
      prevent the acquisition and spread of these bacteria in hospitals. These include screening
      for carriage, contact isolation of carriers, cohorting, dedicated healthcare staff and other
      infection control measures. These strategies have been proven as effective but are cumbersome
      and expensive. In most locations these strategies failed to completely eradicate CRE
      endemicity.

      CRE decolonization (eradication of colonization) might offer a double benefit - reducing the
      risk for the individual carrier to develop an infection due to the resistant strain (by that,
      potentially lowering the mortality risk) and preventing the bacteria from spreading to other
      patients, exposing them to the same hazard.

      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), in which fecal material enriched with commensal
      microorganisms is transferred from a healthy donor, have proven efficacy in the treatment of
      recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in multiple trails. Major adverse events that
      has been reported so far are mostly related to the route of administration (aspiration during
      nasogastric tube administration/colonoscopy). Other adverse events include mostly GI related
      symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, belching) and are self limited and resolve in few hours. FMT
      seems to be safe and effective both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients.

      The high efficacy of FMT in the treatment of a multi-drug resistant pathogen such as
      Clostridium difficile, suggest that it might be an efficient tool for other MDR pathogens
      (e.g. CRE).

      The authors aim to assess the effects of FMT on colonization and clinical infections with
      CRE. The potential of FMT to restore the gut microbiome and compete with residual resistant
      strains offer a novel way to fight the current MDR epidemic.

      The authors will apply FMT on a cohort of CRE carriers in a single center in Israel. FMT will
      be given by capsules for 2 consecutive days followed by rectal sampling at predefined
      timepoint in the following 6 months.
