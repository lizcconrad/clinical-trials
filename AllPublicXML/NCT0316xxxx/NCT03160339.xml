    <textblock>
      PXVX0047 (Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine [A549 Cells], Live, Oral) is an
      investigational vaccine in development for the indication of active immunization against
      adenovirus infection. The primary goals of this Phase 1 study are to evaluate safety,
      pharmacodynamics (viral shedding), and immunogenicity of PXVX0047.
