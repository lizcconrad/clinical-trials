          -  Presence of any organ disorder, with the exception of renal function impairment, or
             use of any medication which might interfere with the pharmacokinetics of ACT-132577;

          -  Known life-threatening disease with a life expectancy of less than 1 year;

          -  Presence of unstable diabetes mellitus.
