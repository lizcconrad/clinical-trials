  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are neural crest-derived tumors of the nervous system
      that are often inherited and genetically heterogeneous. Genetic screening is recommended for
      patients and their relatives, and can guide clinical decisions. However, a mutation is not
      found in all cases. The aims of this proposal are to: 1) to map gene(s) involved in
      pheochromocytoma, and 2) identify genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with
      pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma of various genetic origins.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pheochromocytoma and paragangliomas are tumors originated from neuroectoderm cells located in
      the adrenal or extra-adrenal paraganglia, often leading to increased secretion of hormones
      known as catecholamines. These tumors represent a potentially curable cause of hypertension
      and are malignant in about 10-15% of the cases. Approximately 40% of patients with
      pheochromocytomas and/or paraganglioma have an inherited mutation. In addition, some patients
      and/or their relatives that are mutation carriers can develop other tumors as part of
      inherited cancer susceptibility syndromes. Therefore, detection of the susceptibility
      mutation is important for diagnosis and follow up. However, the susceptibility gene mutation
      cannot be identified in all cases. Studies that aim to identify novel susceptibility genes
      for pheochromocytoma are required.

      The fist aim of this study is to identify novel pheochromocytoma susceptibility genes.
      Characterization of such gene(s) can improve our understanding of the pathogenesis
      pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma and have an impact in diagnosis, therapeutic planning and
      genetic screening of relatives.

      The second aim of this project is to characterize relationships between mutations and
      clinical features that can provide insights into clinical surveillance and screening of
      at-risk individuals.
