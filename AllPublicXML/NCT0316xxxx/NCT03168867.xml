  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to conduct a multicenter, randomized effectiveness trial of The
      3Ms. The proposed study will use an effectiveness-implementation &quot;Hybrid 1&quot; design. In this
      design, the primary goal is to determine whether an intervention works in a real-world
      setting, but the design also answers secondary questions such as the relationship between
      treatment dose and treatment outcome and what factors affect the actual delivery of the
      intervention in the clinics (staff burden, workflow interference etc).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at one clinic in the Detroit area (Children's Hospital of
      Michigan; CHM) and 3 clinics in the Chicago area. Wayne State University (WSU) will function
      as the coordinating center for the trial and will be responsible for overseeing the adequacy
      all aspects of trial management, including recruitment, retention, data collection, data
      management and statistical analyses. 212 African American (AA) adolescents with type 1
      diabetes and their primary caregivers will be enrolled across all sites (half will be
      enrolled at WSU/CHM and half at the three Chicago sites). Families will be randomized to one
      of two arms: The 3Ms intervention (parental motivation for supervision of adolescent DSM) or
      standard educational control. In the 3Ms condition, parents will receive a brief (10-20
      minute) computer delivered intervention at three consecutive routine diabetes clinic visits
      that is designed to increase parental motivation to supervise adolescent diabetes management.
      In the control condition, parents will receive computer-delivered education materials
      regarding type 1 diabetes. Data collection will be completed in the diabetes clinic at
      baseline and then at 6, 12 and 18 months after baseline in the families' home. Data
      collection is completed by the adolescent and caregiver on a tablet computer and includes
      questionnaires to assess adolescent diabetes management, parental supervision of diabetes
      management, family relationships and youth quality of life. Blood will also be collected to
      measure HbA1c (mean blood glucose level). Medical record data will also be collected. The
      data analyses will be intent-to-treat, meaning that all randomized participants are included
      regardless of the intervention dose received. Trial data will analyzed using the linear mixed
      effect model (LME) for repeated measures.

      In addition to the clinical trial, 20 diabetes clinic staff members (5 at WSU from the CHM
      clinic; 15 from the Chicago clinics) will also be recruited to participate in qualitative
      interviews upon completion of the trial. The purpose of the interview is to identify barriers
      and facilitators of use of the 3Ms intervention at the level of the individual clinician, the
      diabetes clinic and the organization (hospital). Interviews will be audiotaped and
      subsequently transcribed for coding.
