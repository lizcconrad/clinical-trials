  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Salivary diagnostic testing is emerging as a less invasive, inexpensive alternative to serum
      analyte measurements with proven diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings. This study aims to
      continue analyzing aspects of the performance of salivary hormone competitive immunoassays
      for monitoring patient's reproductive hormone profiles in the reproductive cycle. Hormone
      levels will be monitored during treatment cycles for infertility.

      This study will be a prospective study to measure salivary and serum estrogen and
      progesterone levels in subject's voluntarily undergoing monitored infertility treatment
      cycles including controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) with oral agents or gonadotropins and
      controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Ultimately, the
      potential applicability and reliability of salivary steroid monitoring in IVF cycles will be
      assessed.
