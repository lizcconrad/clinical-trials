      The purpose of this study is to studying the addition of apatinib with chemotherapy to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in combination with chemotherapy in patients
      with advanced NSCLC.

      Platinum-based chemotherapy is the recommended therapeutic approach for patients with
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without EGFR mutation, ALK gene rearrangement,
      and ROS1 gene rearrangement. However, the prognosis of advanced NSCLC remains poor. Apatinib
      is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2.
      Apatinib has been proved to be effective and safe in heavily pretreated patients with gastric
      cancer. This study is to studying the addition of apatinib with chemotherapy to investigate
      the efficacy and safety of apatinib in combination with chemotherapy in patients with
      advanced NSCLC.
