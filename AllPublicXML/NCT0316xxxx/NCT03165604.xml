      The present study will explore the short and medium term effects of receiving information
      concerning a drink (water) (positive compared to standard information) on the physical
      fitness in overweight children.

      Study subjects will be 30 overweight children aged 6 to 13, new participates in a
      nutritional, behavioral sport program,The control group of 30 normal weight children.

      The first stage of the study the investigators will examine the short-term influence of
      different types of information concerning water on subjects' fitness which will be measured
      by treadmill performance. First, the water will be presented to the participants children as
      an ordinary water while in the second case it will be presented as an &quot;energy drink&quot;.

      The second stage of the study will examine the impact of varying information on the subjects'
      sports participation/level of physical activity over a 6 week period of training, Study
      subjects will be 30 over-weight children aged 6 to 13, who participate in a nutritional,
      behavioral sport program. During this period, information on the type of drink will be
      changed every week. Children will be assessed in all training sessions and their level of
      activity will be monitored to examine whether the information on the drink led to a different
      exercise behavior.

      The study hypothesis is that the use of these positive information will increase
      participants' fitness and levels of activity compared to standard information.
