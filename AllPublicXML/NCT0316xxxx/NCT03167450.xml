  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a genetic defect that affects how hemoglobin is made.
      Due to this, people with SCD have abnormally-shaped red blood cells, which can result in poor
      oxygen transport in the body and increase risk of blood clots. CRISPR Cas9 is a new tool
      which allows scientists to snip and edit genes in a way that is faster, cheaper, and more
      precise than other gene-editing tools. Recently, research has been done using CRISPR Cas9 to
      correct the sickle cell gene in animal models and human cells. Researchers want to understand
      the views of those with SCD, parents of people with SCD, and the providers of these patients
      regarding use of CRISPR Cas9 in clinical trials and treatment.

      Objectives:

      To study the attitudes, beliefs, and opinions of those with SCD, parents of those with SCD,
      and providers on the use of CRISPR Cas9 gene-editing. An additional purpose of this study is
      to assess the utility of an educational tool for improving understanding of CRISPR Cas9.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older who speak English and either have SCD, are a parent of someone with
      SCD, or are a physician for people with SCD.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened via phone. Those with SCD will be screened with data from their
      SCD genotype.

      Participation lasts about 2 hours.

      Participants will fill out three surveys.

      Participants will watch a video about CRISPR Cas9.

      Participants will engage in a focus group session. This will be audiotaped and analyzed.

      The data from the survey questions and focus groups may be used for future research. However,
      all personally identifiable information will be removed before data is shared.

      Participants data will be identified with a code number instead of their name.

      Participants may be invited to join future studies of SCD.

    <textblock>
      The CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technique is taking the scientific research and healthcare
      community by storm with the promise it holds to cure and ease the burden of debilitating
      diseases. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the implications of using this type
      of tool in human research and medicine. Researchers need to understand the viewpoints of
      patients, their families, and their providers, to ensure that the approach taken towards
      gene-editing is inclusive and respectful of different interests and concerns. The dialogue,
      thus far, has been dominated by scientific researchers, physician scientists, ethicists,
      public health and policy experts. It is important to the advancement of the science to study
      the patient s perspective about the use of the technology. In addition, parents often play
      important roles in the decision-making process; in this regard, understanding the views and
      questions of this group of individuals regarding CRISPR/Cas9 human use is essential. We
      conduct a qualitative study with a mixed methods component to investigate the knowledge,
      attitudes and beliefs of patients living with sickle cell disease (SCD), the parents of
      patients with SCD, and the physicians of this patient population regarding the use of
      CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The study is designed to measure these three cohorts baseline overall
      genetic literacy, CRISPR-specific literacy, and general attitudes and beliefs toward
      gene-editing/CRISPR Cas9(in both somatic and germline cells); to evaluate the utility of an
      educational tool in improving one s understanding of this innovative technique; and to gauge
      how attitudes and beliefs toward gene-editing, specifically CRISPR Cas9, perhaps shift or
      remain intact after the educational video, as well as within a focus group space.
