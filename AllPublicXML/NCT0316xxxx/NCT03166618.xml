    <description>The Evaluating Investigator will assess the participant's temple hollowing using the ATHS 5-point scale where: 0=convex, rounded temple to 4=severe, deeply recessed, sunken appearance. A 1-point decrease from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <description>The Evaluating Investigator will assess the participant's temple area using the GAIS 5-point scale where: 2=much improved, 1=improved, 0=no change, -1=worse and -2=much worse. The percentage of participants who the Evaluating Investigator assesses as 2=much improved or 1=improved will be reported.</description>
