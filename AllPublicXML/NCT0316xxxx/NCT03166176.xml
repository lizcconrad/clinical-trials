      Patients with TSC1/2 mutated refractory solid cancer will receive vistusertib(AZD2014)
      monotherapy. Study-arm is composed of 27 patients.

      Vistusertib(AZD2014) 50mg BD continuous schedule of a 28 day cycle as a monotherapy Tumour
      evaluation using RECIST 1.1 will be conducted at screening (within 28 days prior to first
      dose) and every 8 weeks relative to the date of first dose, up to week 40, then every 16
      weeks until objective disease progression (within a window of +/- 7 days of the scheduled
      date).

      Study treatment will be continued until objective disease progression (unless other criteria
      for treatment discontinuation are met). Patients may continue vistusertib(AZD2014) beyond
      progression (according to RECIST 1.1), at the discretion of the investigator if they are
      clinically benefiting from the treatment and they do not meet any other discontinuation
      criteria.

      If a patient discontinues study treatment prior to disease progression, they should continue
      to be assessed using RECIST 1.1 until disease progression and then followed up for survival.
