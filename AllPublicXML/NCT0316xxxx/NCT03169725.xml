    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of inactivated
      poliomyelitis vaccine based on Sabin strain (LBVC) in healthy infants to select optimal dose
      of LBVC as well as to demonstrate the lot-to-lot consistency and non-inferiority of LBVC.
