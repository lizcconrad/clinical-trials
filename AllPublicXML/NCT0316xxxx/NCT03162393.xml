      Brachial plexus avulsion injury (BPAI) caused by traction injury, especially total root
      avulsion, represents a severe handicap for the patient. Despite recent progress in diagnosis
      and microsurgical repair, the prognosis in such cases remains unfavorable. We need to find an
      relatively optimal surgical treatment.

      Brachial plexus avulsion injury (BPAI) caused by traction injury, especially total root
      avulsion, represents a severe handicap for the patient. Despite recent progress in diagnosis
      and microsurgical repair, the prognosis in such cases remains unfavorable. Nerve transfer is
      the most successful method for repairing cases of brachial plexus root avulsion. Phrenic
      nerve transfer, accessory nerve transfer, intercostal nerve transfer and contralateral C7
      transfer are all well-established technique in the treatment of certain severe brachial
      plexus lesions in adults. As reported in previous articles, shoulder function, elbow flexion,
      elbow extension, and wrist and finger function have been restored successfully by spinal
      accessory, phrenic, intercostal, and contralateral C7 nerve transfers . However, the results
      of just one function reconstruction were evaluated in those articles. Few studies were found
      that focused on the whole function reconstructions of the affected limb. In different medical
      organizations even in our department, many different surgical strategies were used in
      treating total BPAI patients and the results differed significantly. Here, we investigated
      the results of different commonly used nerve transfer in order to determine a relatively
      optimal surgical strategy for treatment of total BPAI patients.

        Between 1999 and 2006, a total of approximately 200 patients with posttraumatic total BPAI
        underwent surgical exploration and reconstruction of the brachial plexus and 109 agreed to
        participate in our study. Seventy-three patients were enrolled and 36 were excluded.
