    <textblock>
      The INTERPRET Inotrope Evaluation and Research Patient Registry is a longitudinal,
      observational study designed to look at the demographics and outcomes of heart failure
      patients on inotropic therapy administered in the home or infusion suite setting. The data
      gathered in this registry will provide information on how a patient's quality of life and
      symptoms change over time while on inotrope therapy, and help healthcare providers to have a
      better understanding of the benefits and risks associated with bridge-to-treatment and
      palliative care.

      Eligible patients will be consented by the site investigator or staff to participate in the
      Registry at the time of referral for home care. Clinical data, including dosing, symptom
      severity, lab values, and hospitalizations, along with data on quality-of-life and patient
      compliance with treatment, will be collected by the home care nurses and pharmacists. The
      Registry's goal is to significantly contribute to the medical understandings of heart failure
      treatment and to improve the quality of care for heart failure patients in the United States
      through active publication of registry findings and disease management approaches.
