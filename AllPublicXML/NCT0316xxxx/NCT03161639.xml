  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Verify, through a randomized double-blinded clinical trial, the influence in the performance
      of pulpectomies in primary teeth, based on two working length methods, electronic and
      radiographic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Samples will be composed of children between 6 and 9 years of age, with the need for
      endodontic treatment in primary teeth. They will be submitted to anamnesis, clinical and
      radiographic exams for identification of eligibility criteria for the study. These patients
      will be divided randomly into 2 groups: G1 - pulpectomy with working length method performed
      through radiography (n=100) and G2 - pulpectomy with working length method performed with the
      aid of an apex locator (n=100). Endodontic treatment will be done by a single trained
      operator. After definite restoration and final radiography, an evaluation of the obturation
      quality will be performed by another blinded operator, who will evaluate the appropriate
      obturation length. The clinical treatment success and the radiographies will also be analyzed
      during a period of 24 months through clinical and radiographic exams, also by a blinded
      operator.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients between 6 and 9 years old who search for endodontic treatment in primary teeth. The allocation of subjects to groups will be achieved by randomization. These patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups: G1 - pulpectomy with length measurement performed through radiography and G2 - pulpectomy with length measurement performed with the aid of an apex locator.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>At the end of the canal access, the first operator will leave the surroundings and a second operator will continue. A length measurement will be determined in order to define the working length. After the working measurement length performed by the second operator, the first operator will be informed about the working length of each canal without the knowledge of which method was used for the length measurement . From then on, the first operator will continue the endodontic treatment. A third operator will evaluate the outcomes.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Evaluations will be done during 24 mouths</time_frame>
    <description>The use of an electronic apex locator for the achievement of working length in primary teeth pulpectomies will demonstrate a similar or better result than the radiographic method for the obturation adequacy. Also it will show a closer or a better result in the evaluation of the clinical and radiographic success in a long-term treatment.</description>

    <description>Primary teeth pulpectomy is an important treatment option for necrotic teeth. The correct working length will determine a better chemical and mechanical disinfection of the root canals, without demanding the surrounding periapical tissues and dental germs. In addition, it decreases the chance of a sub or over-filling, which also may interfere with the achievement of the success.</description>
