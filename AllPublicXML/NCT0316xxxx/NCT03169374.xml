      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and feasibility of virtual reality for
      anxiety treatment in mechanically ventilated patients.

    <textblock>
      Mechanically ventilated patients (those on a breathing machine) often experience heightened
      levels of anxiety and discomfort. This is usually treated by using sedative medications,
      however these drugs often have unintended side effects. This study will investigate the
      safety and feasibility of using relaxing virtual reality environments for reduction of
      anxiety in mechanically ventilated patients.

          2. Expected to be liberated from ventilator within 12 hours of potential enrollment

          3. Existence of skull injury or recent surgery (craniectomy) which precludes safely
