  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sexual assault victims (SAV) have an elevated risk of developing posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD). Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective
      first-line treatment for this pathology. However, although sleep disturbances are a common
      complaint in SAV with PTSD, trauma-focused CBT does not directly address this symptom.
      Posttraumatic nightmares are widespread among SAV. Trauma-related sleep disturbances are
      associated with significant impairment in general functioning and quality of life (mental and
      physical health), and contribute to the maintenance of PTSD symptoms. This study evaluates
      the efficacy of sequential nightmare therapy (imagery rehearsal therapy; IRT) and
      trauma-focused CBT, in comparison to CBT alone. Forty-two SAV suffering from PTSD and sleep
      difficulties were recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental (IRT+CBT) or control
      condition (waiting period followed by CBT alone). Participants were administered a clinical
      interview and a series of questionnaires assessing PTSD symptoms, general functioning and
      quality of life.
