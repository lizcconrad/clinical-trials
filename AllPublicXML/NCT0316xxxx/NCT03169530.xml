    <textblock>
      The Moderate Alcohol and Cardiovascular Health Trial (MACH15) is a multicenter, worldwide,
      randomized clinical trial of ~15 gm of alcohol daily versus abstention, using a balanced
      parallel design and single-blind assessment of all outcomes among approximately 7,800
      participants aged 50 years and older with advanced cardiovascular risk. Intervention will
      average 6 years in duration with a common close-out date. Following recruitment and
      pre-screening, participants will attend a screening visit followed by a two-week abstention
      washout period, a baseline visit and randomization, and subsequent visits at 3 months, 6
      months, 12 months, and then annually until close-out.
