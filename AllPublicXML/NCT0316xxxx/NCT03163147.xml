    <textblock>
      Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by low platelet count
      (i.e less than 100.000) . In ITP, platelet surface membrane proteins become antigenic for
      unknown reasons , leading to stimulation of the immune system , autoantibody production, and
      platelet destruction In recent years ,the list of etiologies of ITP has been steadily
      increasing, so the term &quot;idiopathic&quot; is becoming obsolete, increasingly replaced by
      &quot;immune&quot;TP .

      Treatment of ITP may be conceptually divided into rescue therapy and maintenance therapy .
      the terminology of corticosteroid-dependence means The need for ongoing or repeated doses
      administration of corticosteroids for at least 2 months to maintain a platelet count at or
      above 30 _ 109/L and/or to avoid bleeding. So, patients with corticosteroid dependence are
      considered non responders

      â€¢ Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by low platelet count
      (i.e less than 100.000) . In ITP, platelet surface membrane proteins become antigenic for
      unknown reasons , leading to stimulation of the immune system , autoantibody production, and
      platelet destruction In recent years ,the list of etiologies of ITP has been steadily
      increasing, so the term &quot;idiopathic&quot; is becoming obsolete, increasingly replaced by
      &quot;immune&quot;TP.

      Treatment of ITP may be conceptually divided into rescue therapy and maintenance therapy. the
      terminology of corticosteroid-dependence means The need for ongoing or repeated doses
      administration of corticosteroids for at least 2 months to maintain a platelet count at or
      above 30 _ 109/L and/or to avoid bleeding. So, patients with corticosteroid dependence are
      considered non responders The recent entry of Helicobacter pylori to the growing list of
      etiologies of itp has stirred much interest. . The relationship between H pylori infection
      and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is less clear .

      However, among patients with H.pylori-associated ITP, a significant percentage achieve
      lasting remission after eradication of H.pylori .

      H.pylori can be readily detected by non invasive methods, the C-urea breath test and antigen
      detection in stools are considered to be the most accurate, with both sensitivity and
      specificity in the range of 90% to 95% .
