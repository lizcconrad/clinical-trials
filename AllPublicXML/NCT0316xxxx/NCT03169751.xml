      This is an observational study of subjects receiving standard of care therapy, while admitted
      to Epilepsy Monitoring Unit, Department of Neurology, General Hospital Hietzing with
      Neurological Center Rosenhügel. Additional monitoring provided by the SPEAC System will be
      compared to the gold standard, vEEG. The SPEAC System is being evaluated while being used in
      adjunct to standard of care.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>3 independent physicians' abilities to differentiate between epileptic events (with upper extremity motor involvement) and PNES (with upper extremity motor involvement) using vEEG, using a majority rules approach (2 out of 3)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is to test a physician's ability to differentiate between epileptic events (with upper extremity motor involvement) and PNES (with upper extremity motor involvement) using vEEG review. PNES and epileptic seizures will initially be identified, described, and documented following routine clinical care (vEEG).</description>

    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is to test a physician's ability to differentiate between epileptic events (with upper extremity motor involvement) and PNES (with upper extremity motor involvement) using sEMG recorded by the SPEAC System. PNES and epileptic seizures will initially be identified, described, and documented following routine clinical care (vEEG). The sEMG record will be evaluated to identify PNES, displaying upper extremity motor components, and epileptic seizures, displaying upper extremity (UE) motor components. It is anticipated that &gt; 70% of PNES with UE motor involvement identified by vEEG will be identified by sEMG recordings as well.</description>

    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>It is anticipated that &gt;70% of GTC seizures identified by vEEG will be identified by the SPEAC System's automated alarms as well.</description>

    <description>The Brain Sentinel Monitoring and Alerting System is indicated for use as an adjunct to seizure monitoring in adults in the home or healthcare facilities during periods of rest. The device is to be used on the belly of the biceps muscle to analyze surface electromyographs (sEMG) signals that may be associated with generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures and to provide an alarm to alert caregivers of unilateral, appendicular, tonic extension that could be associated with a GTC seizure. The System records and stores sEMG data for subsequent review by a trained healthcare professional.</description>
