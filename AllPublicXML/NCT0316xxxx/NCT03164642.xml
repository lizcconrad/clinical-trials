  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will determine whether an intervention to enhance communication between infants
      and toddlers with developmental disabilities and their depressed mothers can be integrated
      into federally-funded Early Intervention (EI) services. Participants will be mothers with
      depressive symptoms whose children are receiving EI services, along with their EI service
      providers.

      The investigators will conduct a small randomized control trial using the Language
      ENhancement Assessment/intervention system (LENA), a technology-supported language monitoring
      system, with 20 mothers and one of their child's EI service providers. The LENA uses an
      infant or toddler garment with an integrated audiotape system that records adult speech
      centered on the child, child vocalizations, and reciprocal parent-child turn-taking
      conversations. The LENA software produces visual feedback that a mother can use to focus her
      language interactions with her child. A &quot;LENA with feedback&quot; group will follow participants
      in the intervention over 5 weeks: 5 weeks of LENA data collection (with mothers running the
      system 1 day/week for 16 consecutive hours), with feedback during 3 weeks (baseline=LENA, no
      feedback; 3 week intervention=LENA with feedback; post-intervention=LENA, no feedback). A
      &quot;LENA no feedback&quot; group will complete LENA data collection at baseline on the same schedule
      but will not receive feedback. The main difference between groups will be provision of LENA
      feedback and strategies to promote increased mother-child interactions. This design allows
      the investigators to isolate the effect of LENA with feedback, and minimizes attributing
      changes in language environments due to exposure to LENA alone. The investigators will
      analyze data from measures on LENA communication data (adult word count, child vocalizations
      and conversational turn-taking), and measures of child language, maternal depressive
      symptoms, and child disability profiles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early Intervention (EI) services are provided to infants and toddlers with documented
      developmental delays in all 50 states and US territories. EI improves long-term
      infant-toddler adaptation and lowers the cost of care if parents use the services. However,
      depressive symptoms can reduce mothers' ability to provide the daily child
      development-promoting activities recommended by EI, increasing the child's risk for
      communication and behavioral problems. Indeed, repeated studies have shown that depressive
      symptoms reduce mothers' consistent use of developmentally sensitive, child-centered speech
      which, in turn, lead to negative child cognitive and behavioral outcomes. Previous research
      showed that over one-third of mothers of children with disabilities have significant levels
      of depressive symptoms, a rate higher than the population at large. Infants and toddlers of
      depressed mothers have been shown to receive fewer intensive services and have been shown to
      interfere with uptake of EI services through impaired mother-child interactions. A
      preliminary study by the investigators found that over a third of mothers of infants and
      toddlers enrolled in EI in a large North Carolina county had severe depressive symptoms and
      depression histories. Fortunately, the investigators also found that when depressed mothers
      were provided with concrete, attainable skills for improving interactions with their child,
      the impact of depression on both mother and child was substantially reduced. Focusing on a
      depressed mother's child-centered speech and reciprocal communication also improves child
      outcomes, even when the child is cognitively compromised. However, none of these specialized
      services are part of EI best practices. Thus, EI is an ideal setting in which to integrate
      screening, referral and targeted skills for depressed mothers in order to improve
      parent-child interactions and ultimately, child outcomes.

      This project will develop an intervention focused on communication between infants and
      toddlers with diagnosed or suspected developmental disabilities and their mothers who have
      depressive symptoms. The primary aim of the study is to test the initial efficacy of
      embedding a language pedometer, the Language ENhancement Assessment/intervention system
      (LENA), into EI to teach mothers to increase child-centered speech and reciprocal
      communication, which have been linked to positive child outcomes, and to increase parenting
      efficacy in depressed mothers of children in EI. While maternal depressive symptoms can
      disrupt developmentally stimulating, child-centered speech, simple tools to assess and
      provide feedback to mothers can improve the child-centered speech and reciprocal language
      interactions that positively impact child outcomes. Although the LENA has been used in other
      studies and shown improvements in mothers' child-centered speech, the system has not been
      used with mothers showing depressive symptoms or in the EI context.

      Using a randomized wait-list controlled design, the investigators will examine whether use of
      the LENA with feedback from a supportive EI provider has an impact on the child's language
      environment, parenting efficacy and maternal depressive symptoms. The investigators will
      stratify mothers by group based on depressive symptoms (mild, moderate, moderately severe)
      and randomly assign them to intervention (LENA with feedback) or wait-list control (LENA no
      feedback). The investigators will examine the use of the LENA system and the impact on short
      term child outcomes including receptive/expressive language, functional and social
      communication, and social-emotional behavior, and on maternal depressive symptoms. Positive
      intervention outcomes may ultimately lead to a sustainable addition to EI programs in all 50
      US states and territories.

    <measure>Change in LENA Adult Word Count score after 5 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>pre/post for a 5-week intervention window</time_frame>
    <description>The LENA system, which records adult-child vocalizations, measures the number of the target adult's (e.g., parent) child-directed words (child-directed speech). The total possible range is 0-n, where higher scores indicate an increased number of child-directed words spoken by the target adult and higher degrees of a language-rich environment. Lower scores indicate fewer words spoken by the target adult and represent an environment that is not language-rich.</description>

    <measure>Change in Parenting Sense of Competence Scale Efficacy subscale score after 5 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>pre/post for a 5-week intervention window</time_frame>
    <description>The Parenting Sense of Competence Scale is a 17-item measure assessing parental competence. Each item is rated on a 6 point Likert scale anchored by 1 = &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; and 6 = &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;. The Efficacy subscale measures feelings of efficacy as a parent. It has 7 questions (1,6,7,10,11,13,15), producing a range of 6-42. Higher scores indicate greater self-efficacy. Lower scores mean more impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score after 5 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>pre/post for a 5-week intervention window</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a depression scale used to assess brief depression severity by rating symptoms and functional impairment experienced in the last two weeks. The questionnaire contains a total of 9 questions, and each question is scored on a range from 0-3. The minimum value &quot;0&quot; represents not at all, &quot;1&quot; several days, &quot;2&quot; indicates more than half the days, and the maximum value &quot;3&quot; stands for nearly every day. The total possible range is 0-27, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms. The total number of each 0, 1, 2, 3 is added and multiplied by its value (0=0, 1=1, etc.) to produce a total score generated from the subtotal sum. The PHQ-9 total score is interpreted as follows: 0-4 represents minimal depression, 5-9 as mild depression, 10-14 as moderate depression, 15-19 moderately severe depression, and 20-27 severe depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in LENA Mother/Child Turn-Taking score after 5 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>pre/post for a 5-week intervention window</time_frame>
    <description>The LENA system, which records adult-child vocalizations, measures the number of conversational turns between the target adult (e.g., parent) and child. The total possible range is 0-n, where higher scores indicate an increased number of turns (back-and-forth, or &quot;reciprocal&quot; language exchanges) between the adult and child, reflecting higher degrees of a language-rich environment. Lower scores indicate fewer conversational turns between the adult and child, and represent an environment that is not language-rich.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in LENA Child Vocalization score after 5 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>pre/post for a 5-week intervention window</time_frame>
    <description>The LENA system, which records adult-child vocalizations, measures the number of vocalizations of the target child. The total possible range is 0-n, where higher scores indicate an increased number of vocalizations from the child, reflecting higher levels of language development. Lower scores indicate fewer vocalizations from child, and represent lower levels of language development.</description>

    <description>The LENA with Feedback intervention will involve mothers running the Language ENhancement Assessment/intervention system, an audiorecorder language pedometer that records adult speech centered on the child, child vocalizations, and parent-child reciprocal turn-taking conversations. During their regular EI providers will use a standardized feedback protocol that includes emphasizing the mother's strengths, reviewing the LENA visual output from the previous recording, and asking questions to elicit how the mother can increase her child-centered and reciprocal communications during daily routines. The conversation will include concrete examples of how the mother can increase the language exchanges, encouragement, and practical ways to individually tailor the strategies to the family.</description>
