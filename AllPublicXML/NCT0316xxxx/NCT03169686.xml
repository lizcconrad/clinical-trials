    <description>Participants who allocate to the intervention group will receive regular messages providing smoking cessation related information, such as advice, support, and distraction by professional team. One to six messages will be sent per day for the time leading up to the quit day and the following 24 weeks.
One to three messages will be sent per week until the end of the 1 year follow up. They will also be encouraged to send self-help, peer support messages in their group. In order to measure the main two outcomes (self-reported continuous smoking abstinence and point prevalence of abstinence), continuous smoking abstinence, point prevalence of abstinence, how many cigarettes per day during the last week if they are still smoking will be checked at week 1, 4, 12, 24 and 1 year points.</description>

They will receive messages of thanking them for being in the study and reminding them of the time until their free month at the end of follow up.

In order to measure the main two outcomes (self-reported continuous smoking abstinence and point prevalence of abstinence), continuous smoking abstinence, point prevalence of abstinence, how many cigarettes per day during the last week if they are still smoking will be checked at week 1, 4, 12, 24 and 1 year points.</description>
