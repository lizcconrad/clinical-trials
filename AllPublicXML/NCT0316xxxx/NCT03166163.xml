      i will compare the effect of neem extract mouthwash versus the chlorhexidine mouthwash on
      bleeding on brushing among a group of Egyptian children.

      1. First , we will select the patients according to the inclusion criteria.

        2. We will take sulcus bleeding index which is defined as an index of gingival inflammation
           in which bleeding is measured from four gingival units using a periodontal probe. The
           scoring is ranging around eight anterior teeth from 0 to 5.In this study, we will take
           only score 2 which is bleeding on probing, change in colour and no edema in order to
           reduce variability.

        3. 2%neem extract will be used to prepare mouthwash while, chlorhexidine will be used as
           positive control.

        4. Chlorhexidine will be coded with the letter &quot;A&quot; and the mouthwash of 2%neem extract with
           the letter &quot;B&quot;.

        5. The participants included will be allocated into 2 groups by drawing of sealed and
           opaque envelopes containing the codes &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;

        6. The intra and extraoral examinations will be made using masks, gloves, cap, goggles,
           gauze, medical tray, dental mirror and WHO probe. All materials will be packaged in
           sterilization wraps and autoclaved, following the required biosafety standards.

        7. The rinses will be performed twice daily, which will be supervised by the parents legal
           guardians previously instructed. Kits containing toothpaste an brush will be provided,
           so that the patients will use the same toothpaste, avoiding any interference with the
           results.

        8. After 3 weeks, we will ask the patient if there is any gingival bleeding in addition we
           will measure the sulcus bleeding index.
