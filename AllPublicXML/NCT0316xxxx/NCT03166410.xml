      This study will examine the safety and efficacy of autologous adipose-derived stromal
      vascular fraction (SVF) cells for treatment of hip, knee and thumb osteoarthritis (OA);
      monitoring adverse events and measuring pain, function and stiffness in the joints of
      osteoarthritic subjects.
