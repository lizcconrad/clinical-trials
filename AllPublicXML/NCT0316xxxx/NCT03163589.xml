  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy occurs in one to three infants per 1000 term
      births, and up to 12 000 infants are affected each year in the united state of America.
      Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy is not preventable in most cases, and therapies are limited.
      Hypothermia improves outcomes and is the current standard of care. Yet clinical trials
      suggest that 44% to 53% of infants who receive hypothermia will die or suffer moderate to
      severe neurological disability. Therefore, novel neuroprotective therapies are urgently
      needed to further reduce the rate and severity of neurodevelopmental disabilities resulting
      from hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.

      Erythropoietin is a novel neuroprotective agent, with remarkable neuroprotective and
      neuroregenerative effects in animals. Rodent and primate models of neonatal brain injury
      support the safety and efficacy of multiple erythropoietin doses for improving histological
      and functional outcomes after hypoxia-ischaemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cellular mechanisms by which erythropoietin exert neuroprotection are complex and not
      completely understood. In the acute period after hypoxia ischaemia, erythropoietin signaling
      in the brain induces several neuroprotective mechanisms. In addition to its anti-apoptotic
      and anti-inflammatory properties, erythropoietin also increases antioxidant activities and
      reduces excitotoxic cell injury.

      In addition to its acute effects, erythropoietin stimulates growth factor release, enhances
      neurogenesis and angiogenesis, and promotes long-term repair and plasticity. Thus,
      erythropoietin provides neuroprotective and trophic effects that last well beyond the acute
      period of injury erythropoietin .enhances neurogenesis and directs multipotent neural stem
      cells to differentiate toward a neuronal cell fate.

      In a clinical trial performed in China, Zhu et al. studied 167 neonates with of hypoxic
      ischemic encephalopathy that were randomized to receive erythropoietin (300-500U/kg) or
      placebo every second day for 2 weeks. The first dose of erythropoietin was given within 48
      hours of delivery. Compared with placebo-treated infants, infants that received
      erythropoietin were less likely to die or have moderate to severe disability at 18 months of
      age (44% vs 25%, p=0.02).

      Similarly, Elmahdy et al. studied 30 infants with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy who were
      randomized to receive five daily doses of 2500 units/kg erythropoietin, or placebo, with the
      first dose given within 24 hours of delivery. The erythropoietin-treated infants demonstrated
      improved electroencephalography backgrounds, reduced biomarkers of oxidative stress after 2
      weeks, and improved neurodevelopment at 6 months of age compared with placebo treated
      infants.
