      The objectives are to:

        1. validate a panel of tissue-specific miRNAs that are differentially expressed in the
           tissue of patients with and without reactive hyperplasia and lymphoma.

        2. investigate the physiological range of the miRNA panel in lymphoma and reactive
           hyperplasia subjects.

        3. investigate the dysregulation of miRNA panel and their prognostic and predictive values
           in clinical outcomes to identifying patients with malignant lymphoma or reactive
           hyperplasia.

           hyperplasia.

      This trial involves tissue samples diagnosed as lymphoma and reactive hyperplasia. The
      investigators will develop panels of miRNAs that are specific biomarkers of lymphoma, and
      assist clinical outcomes with these miRNAs.

        This research project will recruit a cohort of observational lymphoma patients. Diagnosis
        and immunophenotyping should be performed on FFPE tissues according to the
        WHO-classification system and reviewed by an in-house pathologist. Reactive hyperplasia
        controls will also be recruited to demonstrate the physiological level of different
        body-tissue miRNAs.
