      Patients with advanced primary liver cancer will be enrolled in the trial , then separated
      randomly into two group. One group treated with the Elemene Injection/Elemene Oral Emulsion
      in Combination with Systematic Chemotherapy including Oxaliplatin , another group treated
      with Systematic Chemotherapy including Oxaliplatin. The purpose of the study is to evaluate
      the effect and safety of the Elemene Injection/Elemene Oral Emulsion in Combination with
      Systematic Chemotherapy including Oxaliplatin in the First -line treatment of advanced
      primary liver cancer
