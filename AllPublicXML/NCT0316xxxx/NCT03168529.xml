  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ivabradine (IVA) has been shown to decrease the risk of hospitalizations for worsening Heart
      Failure and was associated with a trend towards improved mortality in the SHIFT1 trial.
      SHIFT1 excluded patients within 4 weeks of hospital discharge, so the efficacy and safety of
      IVA in this setting is less clear.

      In today's health care environment more and more patients that present to the Emergency
      Department (ED) for mild Acute Heart Failure (AHF) are being placed into observation unit and
      subsequently discharged, or discharged outright from the ED. This is not only a growing
      segment of patients, but also represents an important window of opportunity to intervene with
      a potentially effective therapy.

      Moreover, at this point in a patient's experience (being discharged after getting treated for
      exacerbation of Heart Failure), it's not clear that beta blockers (BB) should yet be
      increased/started due to the recent state of exacerbation.

      Standard treatment of worsened heart failure presenting to the ED or urgent care includes
      diuretics (e. g. furosemide) and vasodilators (e.g. ACE-I, ARB, Hydralazine/Isosorbide or
      ARNi), but according to usual standard of care, titration of beta blockade is often reserved
      for outpatient follow up after a period of demonstrated stability (in the ambulatory
      setting).

      This is in contradistinction to hospitalized patients, where patients have been observed by
      the treating team for days, presumably show stability and improvement, and starting low dose
      BB at the time of hospital discharge has been shown to be safe. As such these ED/Observation
      discharge patients are often not optimal candidates for intensification of BB at the time of
      release, and could be considered to be at maximally tolerated BB dose (for at least for 2-4
      weeks). This may represent a vulnerable period for these patients; its unknown in the setting
      of Observation discharge but evidence from hospitalized patients indicates that the highest
      daily risk of rehospitalization is in the days just after discharge. IVA may be effective
      post observation unit management (where lower risk Heart Failure (HF) patients are typically
      placed), to reduce heart rate (without decreasing contractility, such as a BB would) to help
      reduce the risk of hospitalization or emergency care, but safety and efficacy (in terms of
      heart rate lowering) in this setting has not been previously explored.

      Additionally, the SHIFT1 trial lacked African Americans and this unique patient population
      has not been previously studied with IVA. The investigating sites serve a predominantly
      African American patient population. Therefore the proposed study represents an important
      opportunity to gather data on IVA effect in this understudied group of patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled at the time of discharge from the observation unit (visit 1), all
      baseline procedures will be performed at this time, these would include blood draw for
      biomarker assessments, vitals, physical examination, and IP dispensation. At the baseline
      visit, the study team will schedule a follow-up appointment post Day 28 +/- 2 (Visit 3) with
      the subject's primary care physician(PCP)/cardiologist, if the subject does not have their
      own PCP/cardiologist the study team will schedule and facilitate this appointment with the
      Gateway Clinic. A list of current medications and doses will be provided. At Day 14 +/-1
      (visit 2) the subject will return for a follow up visit for IP accountability and titration
      (if needed), BB uptitration (if needed), replacement of the HR monitor (Zio patch),
      assessment of any adverse events, ECG, vital signs, and will undergo a physical examination.
      At Day 28 +/-2 (visit 3), the patient will return for study exit procedures, which include
      blood draw for biomarker assessments, vitals, physical examination, assessment of adverse
      events (if any), and IP return.

      As with any clinical trial, no un-blinding will occur unless there is a concern for patient
      safety, as this could affect the integrity of data. The study team will provide the patient
      and patient's PCP/cardiologist a clinical summary, inclusive of ECGs. On-going management for
      the patient's condition will be at the discretion of their PCP/cardiologist and will not be
      influenced directly by participation in this study.

      At Randomization the initial Ivabradine dose will be 5 mg BID. At Day 14 follow up,
      medication adjustments will be made (if needed). At Day 28 follow up, IP will be permanently
      stopped.

      At the last visit, the study team will contact the patient's primary care physician and/or
      the cardiologist to notify that the patient has completed the study and is off study drug and
      it is now the PCP/cardiologist's discretion to prescribe open label ivabradine (Corlanor) to
      the patient or not, as clinically indicated. If the patient's primary care physician and/or
      cardiologist prescribes open label ivabradine (Corlanor) after the completion of the study,
      the patient or patient's insurance will be responsible for payment as this would then be part
      of routine clinical care.

      The Zio patch will be placed at discharge from the observation unit. At the 14-day follow-up
      the original Zio patch will be collected and a second one will be placed. At the 28-day
      follow-up the second Zio patch will be collected

      Based on the SHIFT1 study, the mean heart rate reduction with IVA is 8 bpm with a standard
      deviation of 13 bpm. A sample size of 57 in each group will have 90% power to detect a
      difference in means of 8.0 assuming that the common standard deviation is 13.0 using a two
      group t-test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. To account for a projected dropout
      rate of 15%, 66 subjects will be enrolled in each group (132 total for the study over a
      2-year period). Furthermore, the investigators expect that the enrollment centers will
      recruit a cohort that is 75% self-identified African Americans. This number (n=99) will
      provide 80% power to detect the same effect size when analyzed in African Americans only.

      For the safety endpoint (unplanned presentation for medical care), assuming an event rate of
      25% at 1 month (estimated based on local hospital readmission rates), the sample size will
      provide 80% power to detect a doubling of the relative risk. If the Control group event rate
      is higher there will be greater power; for example, with an event rate of 35% we would have
      98% power for risk ratio of 2.0 and 83% power for risk ratio of 1.75.

The randomization numbers to each IP bottle will be generated and maintained in an outside dataset or randomization key. The subject ID and corresponding randomization number, recorded in REDCap, will correlate which subjects are in each group, Ivabradine or placebo.
In the case of an emergent medical event, where the unblinding of a subject is deemed medically necessary by the study PIs, the unblinded study personnel will consult the randomization key to unblind study treatment. Once a subject has been unblinded, the date, time and reason(s) for un-blinding will be recorded in the source documents and eCRF.</masking_description>
