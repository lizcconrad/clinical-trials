  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the acceptability, tolerance and effect on metabolic control of PKU Explore, a
      renovated Phe free protein substitute for the dietary management of PKU in children from 6
      months to 5 years.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, acceptability study to evaluate the gastrointestinal tolerance,
      palatability and adherence of PKU explore in a four-week period for 15 participants aged
      between 6 months and 5 years for the dietary management of PKU.

      The outcome of this assessment will be used in a submission to the regulatory authorities,
      Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances (ACBS), for PKU Start to become reimbursable on
      prescription in the UK.

      The participant's dietitian will advise on an appropriate amount of PKU Explore based on
      individual requirements. Parents/carers will be asked to substitute their usual Phe-free
      protein substitute with PKU Explore for one (1) month. The sponsor will supply PKU Explore
      free of charge.

      Parents/guardians will be asked to record information about the following:

      Daily PKU Explore intake Stools Vomiting and Spit-up Feed / Fluid Intake Compliance
      Phenylalanine Levels (from their routine blood spot testing)

      Final Evaluation about the presentation of the product, ease of preparation and use.
