      The purpose of this study is to compare AIR OPTIX® plus HydraGlyde (AOHG) contact lenses to
      ACUVUE® VITA® (VITA) contact lenses for total lipid uptake (total of surface and bulk uptake)
      after 30 days of wear by high lipid depositors.

    <description>The contact lens will be removed aseptically from the eye. Lipids (fatty deposits) will be extracted and analyzed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography and measured in micrograms. A lower value indicates a cleaner lens. One lens from each subject will contribute to the mean.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sign Informed Consent;

          -  Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of at least 0.1 logarithm of the minimum angle of
             resolution (logMAR) in each eye at Visit 1;

          -  Manifest cylinder less than or equal to 0.75 diopter (D) in each eye at Visit 1;

          -  Successful current wearer (during the past 2 months for a minimum of 5 days per week
             and 8 hours per day) of monthly replacement silicone hydrogel lenses within the power
             range of lens powers available for the screening and study lenses;

          -  Screening lenses worn 10 hours exhibiting high lipid uptake;

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Habitual lens used in an extended wear modality (routinely sleeping in lenses
             overnight for 1 night per week or more) during the past 2 months;

          -  Habitually wearing AIR OPTIX AQUA, AIR OPTIX plus HydraGlyde, ACUVUE OASYS®, or ACUVUE
             VITA as contact lenses during the past 2 months;

          -  Any anterior segment infection, inflammation, disease or abnormality that
             contraindicates contact lens wear (within 7 days of enrollment, or current)

          -  History of herpetic keratitis, corneal surgery, or irregular cornea;

          -  Any use of systemic or ocular medications for which contact lens wear could be
             contraindicated, as determined by the Investigator;

          -  Abnormal ocular conditions or findings, as specified in the protocol;

          -  Known pregnancy and lactation;

          -  Other protocol-specified exclusion criteria may apply.
