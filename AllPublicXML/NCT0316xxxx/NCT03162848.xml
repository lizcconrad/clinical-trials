  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot RCT study is to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of a
      SystemCHANGE™ intervention to improve medication adherence in older adults with heart
      failure. The intervention focuses on changing the individual's environment by incorporating
      medication taking into existing routines using small experiments with feedback, and receiving
      support from people who impact routines.

    <description>At initial home visit, the PI will work with the participant to identify important people for medication taking, routines, and cycles of routines. Possible solutions to incorporate medication taking into routines will be identified by the participant and PI and the participant will start implementing these solutions. Medication adherence will continuously be monitored using medication event monitoring systems. At one month, the participant will be sent a report on medication taking and a phone call will occur with the PI to discuss if solutions improved medication adherence or if other solutions need to be implemented. At month two, the intervention will end but participants are urged to continue to use solutions long term.</description>
