      This platform will enable investigation the cardiovascular risk reduction and the increase in
      participant engagement in their heart-healthy goals, through the use of a digital platform
      that connects them to their own doctors, nurses, and dietitians.

    <textblock>
      HealthPals is smartphone-based mobile chronic disease management platform that will be tested
      in this cardiovascular health research study. The study will use the mobile health
      capabilities of smartphones to facilitate communication of medical goals set by the treating
      physician to the subject in between clinic visits, and to assess the daily medical and
      lifestyle change compliance of enrolled Stanford subjects and provide virtual health
      coaching, as needed, to subjects to achieve said goals. How patients comply with their
      specific medical and lifestyle goals all affect their cardiovascular health, yet largely go
      unmeasured. These can now be measured with a notification-based system in which
      subject-entered activity, medication compliance, and dietary reporting data will be
      collected, assessed, and trigger appropriate responses by the subject's Care Team, which
      includes their physician, nurse, dietitian, and assigned health coach. We aim to collect this
      subject-reported activity and cardiovascular care plan compliance data to provide much more
      quantitative data on type, duration, and intensity of daily activities and compliance with
      the medication regimens of enrolled subjects.

      The study will compare anthropometric cardiovascular risk biomarkers testing at the initial
      visit and after 3 months, in subjects utilizing the HealthPals digital platform PLUS the
      standard SSATHI clinic visits, versus subjects receiving only SSATHI clinic visits.

    <time_frame>6 months or through study completion</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are given exercise recommendations (or physical activity goals depending on the patient's capacity for exercise) at the time of the initial visit by the HealthPals health coach. The patients will input their activity into the HealthPals platform at time points of their convenience during their 6 month involvement in the study, and this data will be securely aggregated within the platform. The HealthPals health coach who has access to this data will compile and analyze the data and also send it back to the patients' providers by means of final health reports, assessing the change of exercise activity over the duration of the patient's involvement in the study.</description>

    <description>Patients are given dietary recommendations at the time of their initial visit by the HealthPals health coach. After the first visit the patients will input their diet into the HealthPals platform at time points of their convenience, and this data will be securely aggregated within the platform. The HealthPals health coach who has access to this data will compile and analyze the data and also send it back to the patients' providers by means of monthly health reports.</description>
