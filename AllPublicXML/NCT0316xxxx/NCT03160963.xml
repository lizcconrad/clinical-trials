      We will determine when to transition from the common vertical jump to chair stand depending
      on age and physical activity levels.

    <textblock>
      Assessing individuals' power, while it is useful in measuring fitness and performance levels,
      often requires expensive materials. Vertical jump height has been used to assess peak power
      output using specific regression equations. The issue with this test, although it is often
      used with older persons, is that it is not practical or useful in assessing the power output
      in elderly adults due to possible injury risk and lack of familiarity with providing a
      maximal jump performance. Power is important for elderly adults; because, higher power output
      in elderly adults has been shown to highly correlate with overall functionality, the ability
      to do activities of daily living (ADL), and a reduction in fall probability. A recent study
      examined the capacity of a regression equation to quantify power in elderly adults using a
      sit-to-stand test and determined; however, the sit-to-stand lacks the difficulty and exhibits
      a ceiling effect in younger individuals. Therefore, this study will attempt to determine when
      to transition from the vertical jump to the sit-to-stand, so that the differences in
      chronological versus physiological age may be determined during aging, and conversely, during
      improvements through physical or other interventions.

    <measure>30 second stand-up test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The subject will alternate standing a sitting as many times as possible in the 30 second time frame. Wattage (power) will be computed using the equation by Smith et al., Clin Interventions on Aging, 2010.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Countermovement jump test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The subject will begin in a standing position, quickly lower the body to a self-determined angle an reach as high as possible. Jump height will be determined by subtracting the height of the jump from standing reach. The power is computed using the Lewis formula.</description>
