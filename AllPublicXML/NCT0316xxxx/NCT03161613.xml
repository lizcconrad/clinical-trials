      This is a post-marketing study of patients who started nivolumab as first- or second-line
      therapy for metastatic melanoma or as second-line therapy for metastatic squamous non-small
      cell lung cancer (SqNSCLC) , metastatic non-SqNSCLC, metastatic renal cell carcimona (RCC),
      or recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck cancer (SCCHN), or
      third-line therapy for classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) in Mexico.
