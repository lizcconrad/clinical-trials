  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aging process leads to a marked decline in immune function (immunosenescence), causing a
      significant reduction in immune response after vaccination or infections. Dietary
      intervention is an attractive, safe and non-invasive way to impact on gut bacteria and
      subsequently the functioning of the immune system. The ability of the dietary supplementation
      to alter these functions can be of particular importance in those groups that have an
      underdeveloped, poorly functioning immune system such as infants, immuno-compromised subjects
      or elderly. Research over the past two decades has provided evidence that administration of
      probiotics (live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health
      benefit on the host) could enhance immune function. Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are the
      most common probiotics used in humans and various strains have been shown to have
      immunostimulatory properties in vitro and in experimental models, these properties include
      modulation of cytokine production. evidence exists of the immunostimulating effects of
      certain probiotics and the potential to use prebiotics to increase the levels of beneficial
      bacteria (which are known to be reduced in elderly population). Furthermore, by providing a
      probiotic at the same time as a prebiotic conditions for survival are enhanced. To date, only
      a small number of studies conducted have been randomised and/or placebo controlled to
      unequivocally demonstrate efficacies.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG
      (commercialised as LGG), a pilus-less derivative L. rhamnosus GG (LGG-PB12)combined with a
      putative prebiotic PromitorTM (soluble corn fiber) i.e. a synbiotics and PromitorTM (SCF
      alone) on the faecal microbiota composition, metabolism and immunity in healthy individuals
      aged 60-80 years.

      It consists of a 3 week randomised intervention treatment periods with the synbiotics,
      prebiotic and placebo control. Any adverse medical events which occur during the trial (e.g.
      headache, gut symptoms) should be recorded in a diary along with medication taken.
