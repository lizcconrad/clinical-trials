      The purpose of this study is to assess the utility of the Contour Diabetes App 2.0 when used
      with the Contour Next One meter (the Onyx system) in the hands of subjects with type 1
      diabetes or insulin-using subjects with type 2 diabetes. It is designed to determine the
      subjects' self-reported success in utilizing the features of the system. Each feature will be
      evaluated independently, by including a series of statements about each feature set for which
      a numerical score or rating will be provided by subjects.
