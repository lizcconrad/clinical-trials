  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the efficacy of a single session psychological treatment, &quot;From
      Catastrophizing to Recovery&quot; (FCR), with the current standard of care, group Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy (CBT) specifically on individuals with chronic low back pain suffering
      from Pain Catastrophizing (PC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized 3-arm study comprised of 2 active psychological treatments (FCR &amp; CBT)
      and a health education (HE) arm that controls for time and attention. Study goals are to
      provide scientific evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of FCR, and also provide a comparison
      of said efficacy against the current gold standard group treatment for PC -- manualized
      8-session pain-CBT.

    <description>&quot;From Catastrophizing to Recovery (FCR)&quot;: A single-session approximately 2-hr group intervention to treat PC.
Format of intervention: Therapist-delivered PowerPoint presentation with experiential exercises. Experienced senior level psychologist and two (2) additional doctoral level psychologists will conduct the FCR sessions.
Content of intervention: FCR Participants have the 'FCR Relaxation Resource' app (guided relaxation audiofile) loaded on their apple or android electronic device.</description>

    <description>Format of intervention: 8-week Manualized Pain-CBT Group Intervention will be delivered by PhD-level psychotherapists (3 in total). The group is run weekly for 8 consecutive classes. Each class is 2 hours with a midpoint break (16 hours total intervention time).
Content of intervention: The protocol and materials were developed with funding from NIH/NCCAM R01 AT006226 (Dan Cherkin, PI) [1&amp; 2], and include content from a pain-CBT program developed by Drs. Ehde, Dillworth, and Turner [3].
Participants receive a workbook with homework and a copy of The Pain Survival Guide: How to reclaim your life © 2005 by Turk &amp; Winter [4] for optional reading.</description>

    <description>Format of intervention: The HE class will be instructor taught and will involve a PowerPoint presentation and handouts. Two additional providers will be identified and trained to conduct the sessions. Selected instructors will have substantial health education experience.
Content of intervention: HE content will include basic information such as nutrition and interacting with the healthcare system; these relatively 'inert' topics are unlikely to impart any specific effects typically found with a true psychobehavioral intervention.</description>
