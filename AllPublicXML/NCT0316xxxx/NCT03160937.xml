      The purpose of this study was to assess the acute effects of a single NM treatment session on
      DOMS and to compare them with those of one foam roller (FR) session. Following the damaging
      plyometric exercise bout, the participants were randomly assigned in a counter-balanced
      fashion to either a FR or NM treatment group; treatments were administered 48-h
      post-exercise. The dependent variables were recorded before the exercise, 48-h post-exercise
      before treatment, and immediately post-treatment.

      Currently, the foam-rolling massage is often used by athletes from many sports. However,
      there are a few studies on the effects of foam-rolling massage and they have conflicting
      results regarding the improvements in ROM and muscular performance. In contrast, neurodynamic
      mobilization (NM) is a manual therapy method used to assess and treat neuromuscular
      disorders. It includes gliding techniques and tensile techniques. Gliding techniques or
      &quot;sliders&quot; are intended to produce a sliding movement between neural structures and adjacent
      nonneural tissues. NM has been shown to reduce pain and soreness and improve ROM. However, no
      studies have investigated its effects after exercise-induced muscle soreness or DOMS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects were moderately active (Category 2) as assessed by the International
             Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) questionnaire (Craig et al., 2003).

          -  None of the subjects had a recent history of intensive training, heavy eccentric
             resistance, or plyometric exercise, and all subjects were free from musculoskeletal
             disorders in the last year.

          -  All subjects were asked to refrain from unaccustomed exercise during the experimental
             period, and the subjects abstained from all medications and dietary supplements during
             the experimental period and between testing sessions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Sedentary

          -  patients with pain
