  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a post-market clinical follow-up study. The data collected from this study will
      serve the purpose of confirming safety and performance of the ALTERA™ Expandable implant.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation is based on the following elements.

        1. Safety as measured by the rate of serious operative and post-operative complications.

        2. Subjects quality of life, measured by health-related quality of life questionnaires and
           Subject-reported outcome measures up to 24 months following the procedure, as compared
           to Subject's preoperative baseline.

        3. Global and segmental lumbar lordosis (LL)

      Patients will be followed upto 24 months post-operative

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult (18-70 y/o)

          -  Male or Female

          -  With the following conditions of the lumbar spine as confirmed by advanced imaging (CT
             or MRI), who is a candidate for primary spinal fusion procedure according to
             acceptable criteria for such medical conditions:

               -  Degenerative disc disease with up to Grade I spondylolisthesis

               -  Spondylolisthesis

          -  Failure of at least 6-months conservative treatment

          -  BMI &lt; 40

          -  Subject to approve no pregnancy during the 24 months of study and no participation in
             other studies in parallel to this one

          -  Ability to read, understand, and sign informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Infection, local to the operative site

          -  Signs of local inflammation

          -  Fever or leukocytosis

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Significant mental disorder or condition that could compromise the Subject's ability
             to remember and comply with preoperative and postoperative instructions (e.g. current
             treatment for a psychiatric/psychosocial disorder, senile dementia, Alzheimer's
             disease, traumatic head injury)

          -  Prior surgical procedure (with the exception of decompression only procedure) at the
             index level(s) using the desired operative approach

          -  Prior fusion procedure at an adjacent level

          -  Any other condition which would preclude the potential benefit of spinal implant
             surgery, such as the presence of tumors or congenital abnormalities, fracture local to
             the operating site, elevation of segmentation rate unexplained by other diseases,
             elevation of white blood count (WBC), or a marked left shift in the WBC differential
             count

          -  Neuromuscular disorder that would engender unacceptable risk of instability, implant
             fixation failure, or complications in postoperative care

          -  Active local infection in or near the operative region

          -  Active systemic infection and/or disease

          -  Severe osteoporosis or insufficient bone density, which in the medical opinion of the
             physician precludes surgery or contraindicates instrumentation

          -  Endocrine or metabolic disorders known to affect osteogenesis (e.g. Paget's disease,
             renal osteodystrophy, hypothyroidism)

          -  Systemic disease that requires the chronic administration of nonsteroidal
             anti-inflammatory or steroidal drugs

          -  Suspected or documented allergy or intolerance to implant's materials

          -  Symptomatic cardiac disease

          -  Subject unwilling to cooperate with postoperative instructions.

          -  Any case where the implant components selected for use would be too large or too small
             to achieve a successful result.

          -  Subject having inadequate tissue coverage over the operative site or inadequate bone
             stock or quality.

          -  Any Subject in which implant utilization would interfere with anatomical structures or
             expected physiological performance.

          -  Prior fusion at the level to be treated.
