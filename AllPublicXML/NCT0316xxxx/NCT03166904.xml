      Patients with RICTOR amplified refractory solid cancer will receive vistusertib(AZD2014).
      Study-arm is composed of 27 patients.

      Vistusertib(AZD2014) 50mg BD continuous schedule of a 28 day cycle Tumour evaluation using
      RECIST 1.1 will be conducted at screening (within 28 days prior to first dose) and every 8
      weeks relative to the date of first dose, up to week 40, then every 16 weeks until objective
      disease progression (within a window of +/- 7 days of the scheduled date).

      Patients with RICTOR amplified refractory solid cancer will receive vistusertib(AZD2014).
      Study-arm is composed of 27 patients.

      Vistusertib(AZD2014) 50mg BD continuous schedule of a 28 day cycle Tumour evaluation using
      RECIST 1.1 will be conducted at screening (within 28 days prior to first dose) and every 8
      weeks relative to the date of first dose, up to week 40, then every 16 weeks until objective
      disease progression (within a window of +/- 7 days of the scheduled date).

      Study treatment will be continued until objective disease progression (unless other criteria
      for treatment discontinuation are met). Patients may continue vistusertib(AZD2014) beyond
      progression (according to RECIST 1.1), at the discretion of the investigator if they are
      clinically benefiting from the treatment and they do not meet any other discontinuation
      criteria.

      If a patient discontinues study treatment prior to disease progression, they should continue
      to be assessed using RECIST 1.1 until disease progression and then followed up for survival.

      Assessments for survival should be made every 8 weeks following objective disease
      progression. The details of first and subsequent therapies for cancer, after discontinuation
      of treatment, will be collected.

             either a resection or biopsy)

          3. Patients with RICTOR amplification through NGS.

          4. Patients are willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the
             study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             the treatment of each tumor type in the advanced setting.

          2. Any previous treatment with PIK3CA, AKT or mTOR inhibitor or agents with mixed PI3K /
             mTOR activity.
