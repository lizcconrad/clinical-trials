  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human phase I/II randomized, double-blind, placebo (vehicle)-controlled,
      multicenter study to assess the Safety and Efficacy of AVX-012 Ophthalmic Solution in
      subjects with Mild-to-Moderate Dry Eye Syndrome.

      The study consists of two parts (part A and part B):

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study part A will be an early safety assessment of AVX-012 ophthalmic solution (Low dose
      and High dose AVX-012) administered three times per day (TID) when compared with the vehicle
      (placebo). Approximately 24 patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to study groups (Low dose
      AVX-012, High dose AVX-012, or placebo [vehicle]).

      An independent safety committee will be in charge of assessing the safety of study treatments
      to proceed to part B.

      The study part B will be an efficacy and safety assessment of the dose of AVX-012 ophthalmic
      solution selected in the study part A (Low dose or High dose AVX-012) administered three
      times a day (TID) and twice a day (BID) when compared with the vehicle (placebo).
      Approximately 148 patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to study groups (Low dose or High dose
      AVX-012 and placebo [vehicle], TID and BID).
