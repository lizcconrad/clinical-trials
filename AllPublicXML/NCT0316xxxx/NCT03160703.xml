    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the stain build up of two stannous
      fluoride (SnF2) / sodium tripolyphosphate (STP) dentifrices of differing abrasivity levels,
      with a marketed standard fluoride dentifrice and a marketed SnF2 dentifrice.

      This proof of principal (PoP) single centre, randomised, examiner blind, four-treatment arm,
      parallel design study will be used to evaluate and compare the stain buildup of two 0.454%
      SnF2/ 5% STP dentifrices of differing abrasivity levels, with a marketed standard fluoride
      dentifrice and a marketed SnF2 dentifrice. Stain will be assessed following a full
      professional dental prophylaxis, at intervals over a 4 week treatment period, using an
      established clinical measure of extrinsic dental stain - the MacPherson modification of the
      Lobene stain index (MLSI). Participants will be stratified by pre-prophylaxis MLSI score
      (total MLSI Area x Intensity (AÃ—I) for the facial surfaces of the 12 anterior teeth) and
      smoking status. The study will be conducted in healthy participants with a propensity for
      extrinsic dental stain (in the opinion of the examiner) on the facial surfaces of the
      anterior teeth.

    <time_frame>after 4 weeks of use</time_frame>
    <description>An assessment of the area and intensity of dental stain on the study teeth was performed using the MLSI after usage of the allocated study dentifrice, after 4 weeks twice daily use. The intensity of stain was scored separately for the gingival and body areas of each assessable tooth on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 - no stain, 1- light stain, 2 - moderate stain, 3 - heavy stain). The area of stain was scored separately for the gingival and body areas of each assessable tooth on the following scale: 0 - no stain; 1 - stain up to 1/3 of the area affected; 2- stain between 1/3 and 2/3 of the area affected; and 3 - stain more than 2/3 of area affected. Overall MLSI will be calculated by multiplying scores of intensity and area, and will be thus analyzed on a scale of 0 (best score) to 9 (worst score).</description>

             with full crown or veneer, orthodontic bands or cracked enamel, tooth with surface
             irregularities, discoloration due to trauma, tetracycline stain, restorations, or hypo
             or hyperplasic areas which, in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent
