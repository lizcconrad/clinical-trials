  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-comparative phase II clinical trial to assess efficacy and safety
      of tongue conservation treatment with sequential induction chemotherapy, tongue conservation
      surgery and postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with advanced oral
      tongue cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical resection remains the most important component of standard treatment for oral tongue
      cancer, but may lead to profound functional impacts not effectively compensated by
      reconstruction surgery. The volume of tongue resection remains one key factor for the
      post-treatment deterioration of the functional outcomes and quality of life in large oral
      tongue cancer. Primary chemoradiotherapy without surgical resection has not been accepted for
      oral tongue cancer because of the concerns about possible poorer response and sequelae.
      Breast conservation treatment, by the sequential use of induction chemotherapy (ICT), limited
      surgical resection and chemoradiotherapy, has become a standard treatment for human breast
      cancer of various stages. However, similar tongue conservation treatment for advanced oral
      tongue cancer has not been studied in trials. Based on these data, it will be reasonable, in
      locally advanced (&gt; 3 cm) resectable oral tongue cancers, to test whether ICT followed by
      tongue conservation surgery and postoperative CCRT can safely enhance the possibility of
      tongue conservation with improved post-treatment functions.
