  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since sedentary time is related to various health outcomes and is already highly prevalent in
      childhood and adolescence, effective strategies are needed to tackle this health problem.
      Children and adolescents spend the majority of the day in a classroom while sitting at a
      desk. Therefore, the classroom is an important setting for implementing specific strategies
      to reduce sedentary time.

      One of the strategies that gained more attention during the past years is replacing
      traditional desks and chairs with standing desks.

      This project evaluates the implementation of standing desks in primary and secondary schools
      via a clustered randomized controlled trial using an intervention and control condition.
      Effects on sedentary time during in class, sedentary activities during leisure time, breaks
      in sedentary time, and related determinants (secondary outcomes) are evaluated.

      Next to effect evaluation, it is also equally important to evaluate how teachers and pupils
      perceive this change in the classroom environment. Both groups need to be positive in order
      to obtain the adoption and sustainability. Therefore, focus groups with pupils and interviews
      with teachers are conducted, with a specific focus on the perceived barriers. Moreover, the
      process evaluation is conducted quantitatively as well by using questionnaires in pupils and
      teachers.

      The project results will lead to recommendations on how to broadly implement standing desks
      into primary and secondary schools.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decrease in children's sedentary time during school hours</measure>
    <time_frame>One schoolyear</time_frame>
    <description>In the questionnaire, following item was used to subjectively assess the outcome: 'On average how many hours do you spent sedentary in class?' Answer categories ranged from 'None' to 'More than 7 hours per day'. In addition, a subsample wore an ActivPAL inclinometer to objectively measure sedentary time. This thigh-worn device uses accelerometer-derived information about thigh position to calculate the outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Possible decrease in TV time on week- and weekend days</measure>
    <time_frame>One schoolyear</time_frame>
    <description>In the questionnaire, children and adolescents were asked on average how many hours they spent in front of a television, separately for week- and weekend days. Answer categories ranged from 'Non' to 'More than 4 hours per day'. The items are derived from the reliable and valid ENERGY-questionnaire.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Increase in the number of breaks in sedentary activities</measure>
    <time_frame>One schoolyear</time_frame>
    <description>In the questionnaire, children and adolescents were asked on average, how many times they interrupt their TV time, computer time and sitting during school hours. Answer categories ranged from '0' to '4 times or more per hour'. The items were derived from the ENERGY-questionnaire.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement of determinants related to breaking up sedentary activities</measure>
    <time_frame>One schoolyear</time_frame>
    <description>In the questionnaire, questions were added on attitude, self-efficacy, preferences and habits related to breaking up sedentary activities, with answer categories ranging from 'Totally agree' to 'Totally disagree'. The items were derived from the ENERGY-questionnaire</description>

    <time_frame>One schoolyear</time_frame>
    <description>Three school-related variables (i.e. relationship with classmates, involvement in organising school activities, and relationship with teachers) were assessed in the questionnaire using items from the Flemish Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children questionnaire.</description>
