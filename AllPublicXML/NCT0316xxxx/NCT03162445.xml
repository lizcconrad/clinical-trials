  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a observational study to investigate the degree to which bone mineral density is
      impaired in boys with autism compared with typically developing controls.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that bone cortical thickness is decreased in children with autism and
      other developmental disabilities. However it is not known whether bone mineral density (BMD)
      of these children is lower; neither is it known whether there is any correlation between BMD
      and the child's diet. The overall goal of this study is to improve the long term health of
      children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder; more specifically the investigators
      aim to develop a pilot study to investigate the degree to which BMD is impaired in boys with
      autism and to explore specific additional risk factors. In addition, the aim is to
      investigate the degree to which BMD is impaired in boys with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
      and to explore specific contributing risk factors including nutritional analysis.
