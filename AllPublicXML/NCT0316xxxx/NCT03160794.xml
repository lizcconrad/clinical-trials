  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the clinical scenario of recurrent prostate cancer (PCa) post local therapy, current
      standard studies (bone scan and computed tomography) commonly fail to identify the recurrent
      disease location. In this study the investigator aims to prospectively map recurrent disease
      with the unique combination of whole-body MR anatomical imaging combined with a new
      high-sensitivity and PCa-specific PET probe (PSMA-targeted: [18F]DCFPyL) to provide precise
      localization information to target disseminated tumor deposits in men presenting with rising
      PSA after prostatectomy and radiotherapy (maximal local therapies). Moreover, we will
      consequently treat all identified disease with image-guided stereotactic ablative
      radiotherapy (SABR), which has shown tantalizing results achieving excellent tumor
      eradication rates with minimal toxicities. This study is uniquely positioned to enable the
      discovery of new biomarkers and the correlation of prognostic tests (e.g. genomic signatures)
      from the initial prostatectomy specimen with the PET/MR imaging results and SABR treatment
      outcomes.

      The significance of the proposed work towards a measurable impact in PCa care is important to
      emphasize. The study team believes this novel curative-intent approach will transform lives,
      as opposed to therapies that transiently impact incurable disease stages. Herein, the focus
      is on patients at the earliest point of the disease spectrum of recurrent PCa after
      curative-intent treatments. Our hypothesis is that PSMA-targeted [18F]DCFPyL PET/MR allows
      earlier detection and localization of defined metastatic targets in these patients, at a
      stage amenable to image-guided curative-intent therapy.
