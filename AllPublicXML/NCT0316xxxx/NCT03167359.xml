  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the number of breast cancer (BrCA) survivors has markedly increased, clinicians are now
      seeking to reduce treatment-related toxicities and inconveniences of treatment, namely the
      traditional 6 weeks of daily radiation treatment (XRT). Skin thickening, fibrosis, and edema
      are some of the most common acute and potentially long-term debilitating toxicities of BrCA
      XRT.

      The purpose of this study is to learn if three weeks of daily radiation treatment (RT) to the
      breast is safe in breast cancer patients who are usually prescribed 6 weeks of daily
      radiation after breast surgery (e.g. lumpectomy or mastectomy) as standard of care.

      Investigators seek to assess the rate of cutaneous toxicity, the rates of lymphedema
      determined by arm measurements and Grade 3 brachial plexopathy in patients receiving regional
      nodal irradiation, as well as local control, quality of life, and fatigue levels.
