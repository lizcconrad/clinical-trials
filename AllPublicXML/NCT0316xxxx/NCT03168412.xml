    <textblock>
      This phase IV clinical study was designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the
      recombinant Hepatitis E vaccine (Hecolin®), manufactured by Xiamen Innovax Biotech CO., LTD.,
      in healthy adults (over 18 years) with accelerated vaccination schedule. The study volunteers
      will receive the 3 doses of Hecolin® administered intramuscularly according to a 0-7-21 days
      schedule or a 0-1-6 month schedule.
