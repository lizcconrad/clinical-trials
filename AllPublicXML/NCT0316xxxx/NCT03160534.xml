      The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of a single (9 sessions)
      prescription community based preoperative physical therapy in patients awaiting a Total Knee
      Arthroplasty, taking prognostic factors into account.

      The investigators will use different outcome measures to evaluate any possible effects.
