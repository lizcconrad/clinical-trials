  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 50% of older persons with osteoarthritis (OA) experience disrupted sleep and
      insomnia symptoms of difficulty falling asleep, awakening during the night, and awakening too
      early and being unable to fall back to sleep. Because OA pain has been implicated in sleep
      problems and because physical exercise interventions have been found to improve pain and
      sleep quality, staying physically active during the daytime is likely advantageous in terms
      of improving sleep. Physical exercise interventions with a duration between 10 and 16 weeks
      have been shown to improve quality of sleep in older adults with self-reported disrupted
      sleep. Unfortunately, recent reports show that older adults with OA are mainly sedentary and
      few meet national guidelines for recommended amounts of daily physical activity. A
      self-management intervention that integrates use of mobile technology to prompt older adults
      to be physically active, provides ongoing monitoring of the amount of their physical activity
      and includes self-efficacy enhancements is a novel non-pharmacological intervention both for
      prevention and treatment of sleep deficiency in persons with OA.

      The proposed study will involve delivery of automatic physical activity-focused text
      messages, a novel sleep self-management diary (SleepTight) and motivational interviewing in
      participants with OA of the hip or knee (most commonly affected joints). The purpose of this
      Project is to pilot test a new self-management program: MobMPATI, a multidimensional,
      tailored intervention for sleep deficiency in for older adults with OA. The specific aims are
      to:

        1. Test the acceptability of MobMPATI for older adults with OA and poor sleep quality as a
           manifestation of sleep deficiency.

        2. Test the feasibility of implementing MobMPATI for older adults with OA, as well as
           collecting electronic data from the sample.

        3. Explore pre/posttest changes in self-efficacy, motivation and sleep deficiency measures
           [total sleep time (TST) and sleep efficiency (SE)] with the MobMPATI intervention.

      This study will provide feasibility/acceptability and preliminary data necessary for a larger
      clinical trial of MobMPATI intervention to encourage physical activity and reduce sedentary
      behavior in older adults with OA as a way of reducing sleep deficiency. Preliminary testing
      of the intervention will indicate what measures are more sensitive in promoting self-efficacy
      and motivation so that a smaller number of outcomes could be monitored to reduce participant
      burden. This study is the first step in this innovative program of research. The knowledge
      gained will provide data on the benefit of a potentially cost-effective intervention that
      could be implemented on a large scale to improve health of older adults with OA.
