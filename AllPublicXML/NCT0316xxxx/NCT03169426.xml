  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Remote ischemic conditioning has been shown to protect myocardium from ischemia-reperfusion
      injury during cardiac intervention or cardiac surgery. However, effect of beta-blocker,
      commonly used cardiovascular medication in patients with cardiac diseases such as
      hypertension or angina pectoris, on cardioprotective role of remote ischemic conditioning has
      not been well documented. The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of
      beta-blocker on remote ischemic conditioning in healthy volunteers.

      This study is prospective cross-over study investigating effect of beta-blocker on
      cardioprotective role of remote ischemic conditioning. Eleven male healthy volunteers are
      going to take oral beta-blocker (carvedilol, 12.5 mg once) or not before undergoing remote
      ischemic conditioning (consisting of 4 cycles of 5-min ischemia and subsequent 5-min
      reperfusion of upper arm), separated by 6-day wash-out period. To evaluate cardioprotective
      effect of remote ischemic conditioning, blood samples will be obtained before and after
      remote ischemic conditioning. Form the samples, human dialysate will be obtained and be
      perfused to rat heart through Langendorff apparatus before ischemia-reperfusion injury to the
      rat heart. Changes of infarct size of the rat heart will be compared between the beta-blocker
      and control groups.
