  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of nivolumab, ipilimumab and radiation
      therapy in treating patients with stage IVA-B head and neck cancer. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.
      Giving nivolumab, ipilimumab, and radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with
      stage IVA-B head and neck cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the safety of the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab with radiation
      treatment for definitive management of patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma
      of the head and neck.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the 1 year progression-free survival (PFS) in all patients treated.

      II. To assess the overall response rate and overall survival of patients at one year

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether PDL1 expression is associated with treatment response. II. To explore
      whether there is a net change in the Th1/Th2 ratio (IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL10, etc) or cell
      subset frequencies (M2 monocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, etc) within a patient's
      peripheral blood either at baseline or in response to treatment is associated with treatment
      response.

      III. To explore whether exosomes or other immune related serum biomarkers change after
      combination therapy.
