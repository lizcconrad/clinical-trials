  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selected patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) from colorectal cancer (CRC) benefit
      from cytoreductive surgery (CRS) combined with intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (IPC). However,
      even after optimal cytoreduction, systemic and locoregional recurrence are common.
      Perioperative chemotherapy with bevacizumab (BEV) may improve the outcome of these patients.
      The BEV-IP study is a phase II, single-arm, open-label study aimed at patients with
      colorectal or appendiceal adenocarcinoma with synchronous or metachronous PC. This study
      evaluates whether perioperative chemotherapy including BEV in combination with CRS and
      oxaliplatin-based IPC results in acceptable morbidity and mortality (primary composite
      endpoint). Secondary endpoints are treatment completion rate, chemotherapy-related toxicity,
      pathological response, progression free survival, and overall survival.
