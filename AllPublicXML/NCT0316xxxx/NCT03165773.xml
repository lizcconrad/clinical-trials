    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to assess the 4 hr postprandial kinetics of total and
      exogenous glucose in response to consumption of oatmeal containing a high percentage of the
      viscous agent β-glucan, in comparison to a β-glucan free corn cereal that is matched by grams
      of available carbohydrate.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is 18-45 years of age.

          -  Subject has a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 29.9 kg/m2, inclusive at
             screening (visit 1).

          -  Subject has normal fasting serum glucose (&lt;6.5 mmol/L capillary corresponding to whole
             blood glucose &lt;5.8 mmol/L) at beginning of each visit.

          -  Subject has no health conditions that would prevent him from fulfilling the study
             requirements as judged by the Investigator on the basis of medical history.

          -  Subject understands the study procedures and signs forms providing informed consent to
             participate in the study and authorization for release of relevant protected health
             information to the study investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Failure to meet any one of the inclusion criteria.

          -  Failure to comply with pre-visit instructions on diet and physical activity.

          -  Known history of clinically important medical conditions, such as any major trauma or
             surgical event within 3 months of screening, AIDS, cancer, hepatitis, endocrine
             (including Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus), cardiovascular (including, but not
             limited to, atherosclerotic disease, history of myocardial infarction, peripheral
             arterial disease, stroke), pulmonary, biliary, or GI disorders.

          -  Subject using medications or supplements known to influence carbohydrate or lipid
             metabolism, including, but not limited to adrenergic blocks, diuretics,
             thiazolidinediones, metformin, statins, and systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks of
             the screening visit.

          -  Subject who cannot or will not comply with the experimental procedures or does not
             follow GI Labs safety guidelines.

          -  Subject has a known intolerance, sensitivity or allergy to any ingredients in the
             study products.

          -  Subject has a condition the Investigator believes would interfere with his or her
             ability to provide informed consent, comply with the study protocol, which might
             confound the interpretation of the study results or put the person at undue risk.
