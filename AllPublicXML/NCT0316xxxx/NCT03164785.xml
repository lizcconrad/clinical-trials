      Autoimmune Diabetes Mellitus (AIDM) is a subtype of diabetes mellitus caused by autoimmune
      destruction of beta cells in the islet, including Type 1 diabetes and Latent Autoimmune
      Diabetes in Adults (LADA). Insulin has been used as a routine therapy for AIDM to alleviate
      the hyperglycemic status, yet cannot effectively prevent the progressing destruction of beta
      cells or preserve its function. GLP-1 analog Liraglutide has been tested in large-scale
      clinical trial to prove its various benefits for beta cells and glucolipid metabolism in T2D
      and obesity patients. However, its clinical application in AIDM is not well-defined so far.
      The aim of this study is to investigate the potential use of Liraglutide on glycemic control
      in AIDM.

      Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) is one of the most important microvascular complications of
      diabetes and is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Intensive glycemic and blood
      pressure control, combined with renin - angiotensin system blocking therapy (including ACEI
      and ARB drugs), has to a certain extent, delayed the progression of DKD, but still cannot
      completely block its development. Cordyceps sinensis is a traditional Chinese medicine and
      Jinshuibao Capsule is its artificial preparation, with the effect of renoprotection. However,
      its clinical application in diabetic kidney disease is not well-defined so far. The aim of
      this study is to investigate the potential use of Jinshuibao Capsule on microalbuminuria in
      T2DM.
