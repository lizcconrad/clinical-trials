  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed MyPEEPS Mobile intervention is a novel and evidence-driven intervention using
      mobile technology to deliver HIV prevention information specifically developed for at-risk
      young men who have sex with men (YMSM). This will be the one of the first studies to test the
      efficacy of a scaled-up, mobile version of an existing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
      prevention intervention originally developed for, designed by, and piloted for, a diverse
      group of YMSM.

      MyPEEPS Mobile will be tested in an randomized controlled trial with racially and ethnically
      diverse HIV-negative or unknown status YMSM aged 13-18 at four geographically diverse sites:
      Birmingham, Chicago, New York City, and Seattle, allowing for increased generalizability of
      findings.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men who have sex with men (MSM) bear a greater burden of HIV/AIDS than any other population
      group in the US, comprising only 2% of the population but 56% of individuals living with
      HIV/AIDS. Although much of the increased incidence in HIV has been reported among YMSM,
      especially among racial and ethnic minority groups, and is linked to high-risk sexual
      behavior, there remains a dearth of evidence-based HIV prevention interventions for YMSM -
      and none that address racially/ethnically diverse YMSM. To address this need, this study
      leverages mobile technology and MyPEEPS, an existing theory-driven, multi-ethnic,
      group-level, evidence-based intervention for diverse YMSM. MyPEEPS is a manualized
      curriculum, comprised of 6 modules focusing on key intermediate social and personal factors,
      including knowledge (e.g., correct way to use a condom), self-efficacy for safer sex,
      interpersonal communication skills and behavioral skills. MyPEEPS is one of the only HIV
      prevention interventions in the literature that focuses on diverse adolescent MSM. Long-term
      sustainability of face-to face, group-level behavioral interventions, such as MyPEEPS, have
      been problematic for dissemination in at-risk populations, particularly among young racial
      and ethnic minority groups. In response to this challenge, the investigators propose to
      translate MyPEEPS from a face-to-face, group-based curriculum to a mobile, responsive-driven
      web-based platform, accessible by smartphone or other web-enabled devices, to increase
      accessibility and scalability for diverse YMSM. The ubiquitous nature of mobile phones in
      daily life, especially among 13-18 year olds, has created opportunities for health
      interventions in a portable format with enhanced privacy. Using a participatory approach,
      this study will incorporate user-centered design in the translation of the MyPEEPS
      intervention onto a mobile platform.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up, 9 month follow up, 12 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Male-male sexual risk will be evaluated at all time points using the AIDS-Risk Behavior Assessment (ARBA) adapted for YMSM. Variables of interest include: total number of sex partners and condomless anal sex partners, frequencies of condomless sex acts (anal or oral), sex (anal or oral) with or without condoms under the influence of drugs/alcohol, unprotected anal intercourse under the influence of alcohol/drugs, nPEP and PrEP (if FDA approved for this age group) use and self-reported HIV/STI testing.</description>

    <measure>Change in Behavioral Intention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up, 9 month follow up, 12 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The focus for a change in intent surrounding male-male sexual risk behaviors, specifically: intent to reduce the number of anal sex partners, the intent to reduce the number of anal sex partners with whom a condom was not used, the intent to use condoms during anal sex, the intent to get an HIV/STI test, and the intent to uptake nPEP/PrEP (if guidelines change for under 18 years old).</description>

    <measure>Change (decrease) in sexual behavior risk</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Sexual Behavior Risk Index is a 7-item scale is a hierarchical index of sexual behavior and demonstrates good psychometric properties. It includes lower risk behaviors such as deep kissing and genital touching. Focusing solely on a single dimension f sexual behavior such as &quot;anal sex&quot; or high risk events like &quot;unprotected anal sex&quot; in an adolescent population may be difficult when some or many of the individual behaviors are rare. This measure is more sensitive to low risk sexual behaviors and thus will be able to detect more subtle changes in risk behavior among participants.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up, 9 month follow up, 12 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The self-efficacy for safer sex and situational temptation for unsafe sex is a 10-item scale is used to assess self-efficacy in in practicing condom use and safer sex communication with a partner. A sample item is &quot;if I didn't want to have sex with my partner, I would be able to say no.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Change (Decrease) in condom use errors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up, 9 month follow up, 12 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The condom errors survey is a 12-item questionnaire was adapted to reflect a 6-week recall period. A sample question is &quot;when you used condoms during the last six weeks, how often was the condom put on the wrong side up so that it had to be flipped over?&quot;</description>

    <measure>Change (Increase) in health-related partner verbal communication</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 month follow up, 6 month follow up, 9 month follow up, 12 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The health-related partner verbal communication scale is a 9-item scale assesses the quality of safer sex verbal communication between partners. A sample item is &quot;how often in the past 6 weeks have you told a new sex partner that you won't have sex unless a condom is used?&quot;</description>
