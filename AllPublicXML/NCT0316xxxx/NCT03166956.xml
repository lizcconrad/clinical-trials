  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background &amp; Aims. Glutamine is a conditional essential amino acid that was found in reduced
      plasma amount in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. The supplementations of glutamine and
      vitamin C potentially have beneficial effects on wound healing and a reduction in infection
      rate. In this investigation, enteral glutamine and vitamin C were provided for ICU patient,
      and the associated changes in proinflammatory cytokines and clinical outcomes were
      investigated.

      Background &amp; Aims. Glutamine is a conditional essential amino acid that was found in reduced
      plasma amount in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. The supplementation of glutamine in ICU
      patients has been under much debate. Another nutritional supplement, vitamin C, had a
      beneficial effect on wound healing and a reduction in infection rate. In this investigation,
      enteral glutamine and vitamin C were provided for ICU patient, and the associated changes in
      proinflammatory cytokines and clinical outcomes were investigated.

      Methods. This is a prospective double-blind randomized study for surgical ICU patients whom
      can sustain enteral feeding. The test group was provided with glutamine and vitamin C (the GA
      group); the control (C) group was provided with maltodextrin of equivalent calories as that
      provided in the GA group. Plasma glutamine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and clinical data were
      collected and analyzed with biostatistical methods.
