  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether low-cost Short Message Service (SMS)-based
      follow-up medication reminders and surveys for surgical site infection (SSI) reporting can
      improve outcomes by increasing medication adherence and earlier detection and care of SSI.
      This will be a prospective study involving enrollment of patients onto the Memora Health
      platform, a web application developed for automating SMS content to patients. Post-operative
      patients will be identified by providers and enrolled prior to discharge, after which they
      will be followed for 3 months.

      Primary endpoints include medication adherence and patient satisfaction with the text
      messaging tool. Secondary endpoints include early detection of SSIs, patient satisfaction
      with overall post-discharge care and health-related quality of life, and pertinent 30-day
      readmissions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative follow up with patients is critical to providing high quality and cost
      effective care. In the current standard of care, patients receive verbal instructions from
      their physician along with discharge paperwork that outlines best practices for self-care.
      Unfortunately, difficult instructions can be miscommunicated or be overwhelming, and patients
      often leave confused, resulting in poor patient care post-discharge and high 30-day
      readmission rates. Medication adherence represents a crucial area for follow-up, as it is a
      major determinant of high-quality outcomes for post-operative care. Specifically, over 50% of
      patients in the U.S. either forget to or don't correctly take their prescription medications.
      Non-adherence causes nearly 10% of all hospital admissions in the U.S. and 125,000 annual
      deaths.

      In a survey of 10,000 patients, the most common reported reason for missing medications was
      forgetfulness (24%), followed by perceived side effects (20%), high drug costs (17%), and
      perception that a prescribed medication would have little effect on their disease (14%). The
      majority of the factors contributing to non-adherence could therefore be resolved by
      longitudinally addressing forgetfulness and misconceptions about medication effectiveness,
      options for treatment, and side effects.

      An SMS patient engagement case-management platform (Memora Health, Boston, MA) has been
      created that enables providers to input a new medication regimen into a web-based, HIPAA
      compliant app that then sends text message reminders to the patient to take their medication.
      Communication is two-way, therefore not only helping to improve adherence and self-management
      for the patient, but also providing care staff with more data on the post-discharge behavior
      and care satisfaction of their patients. While the value of SMS-based interventions on health
      outcomes is abundant in the literature, there is a paucity of data evaluating the impact of
      SMS follow-up on improving surgical outcomes through improved medication adherence and early
      detection of SSI. The purpose of this study is to utilize Memora Health, a platform that
      leverages mobile messaging as a medium for advancing preventive care, to improve the quality
      of post-operative care delivered to patients, and thereby improve patient satisfaction as
      well as reducing readmissions.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group or control group. The test group constitutes receiving consistent medication reminders, as per the patient's prescribed frequency, and weekly surveys prompting them to report their pain level and an image of their surgical site for the duration of the full 3 months. The control group will not receive medication reminders or questions regarding their pain or surgical site. Both control and test groups will receive a monthly questionnaire via SMS to assess patient satisfaction with the intervention and changes in medication adherence behaviors.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Medication adherence assessed by Adherence to Refills and Medications Survey (ARMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Adherence to Refills and Medications Survey (ARMS-7) is a 7-item survey asking respondents about their medication-taking behavior and factors that contribute to medication compliance or non-compliance. Participants select a score for each question ranging from 1-4, where 1 represents 'None' and 4 represents 'All'. The scores are treated as a continuous measure, with total points being added up, with lower scores indicating high adherence and high scores indicating low adherence.</description>

    <measure>Participant Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1 through Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction with the SMS tool will be assessed using a 7-item survey administered at the conclusion of the study. Participants will rate the message reminders on a scale from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good): helpfulness, ease of use, ease of understanding, frequency of messages, quality of messages, likelihood of continuing to use message reminders, and willingness to recommend message reminders to a friend.</description>

    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be allowed to intermittently provide pain scores and pictures of their surgical sites to help increase early detection of surgical site infection (SSI) post-discharge. The value of these images in early detection of SSIs will be measured through physician reporting of SSIs.</description>

    <description>Care Transitions Measure (CTM-15) is a 15-item survey asking respondents to indicate their degree of agreement with statements relating to the quality of care transition from being hospitalized to being discharged. Respondents select from: 1=Strongly Disagree, 2=Disagree, 3=Agree, 4=Strongly Agree. Missing responses and selections of &quot;Don't Know/Don't Remember/Not Applicable&quot; do not contribute to the total score. A mean score is obtained and higher scores indicate a better transition during hospital discharge.</description>

    <description>The SMS-based reminders consist of sending messages to participants assigned to this study arm reminding them to take their medication and prompting participants to complete surveys. Medication reminders are sent as per the participant's prescribed frequency and weekly surveys allow participants to report their pain level as well as send an image of their surgical site. Beyond pre-determined reminders and surveys sent to patients, the Memora Health platform is interactive and allows patients to text in questions they may have regarding their medications, care, or condition. Participants will receive the messages for 3 months.</description>
