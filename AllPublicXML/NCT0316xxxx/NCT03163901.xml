      Test the hypothesis that a certain set of osteopathic manipulation procedures preformed on
      patients with mild to moderate traumatic brain injury will result in accelerated rates of
      recovery assessed using vestibular function tests, quality of life questionnaires and
      measurements of the levels of anti-inflammatory metabolite and protein biomarkers in the
      blood and urine.

      This project proposes to test the hypothesis that a certain set of osteopathic manipulative
      treatment (OMT) procedures performed on patients with mild to moderate traumatic brain injury
      (TBI) will result in accelerated rates of recovery as assessed using vestibular function
      tests, patient response on quality of life questionnaires, and measurements of the levels of
      anti-inflammatory metabolite and protein biomarkers in urine and blood. The OMT techniques,
      performed ensemble (as a set) and in sequence, will encompass: (a) soft tissue to the
      upper-mid thoracic spine; (b) soft tissue to the cervical spine; (c) suboccipital release;
      (d) condylar decompression; and (e) cranial venous sinus release. The key clinical outcome
      measures will include Neurocom Balance Manager assessments (Modified Clinical Test of Sensory
      Interaction and Balance; Stability Evaluation Test; Rhythmic Weight Shift; Limits of
      Stability), Vestibular Oculomotor Screen, Motion Sensitivity Test, as well as questionnaires
      such as Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), Dizziness Handicap Inventory, and the more general
      quality of life measures (dressing, bathing, medication management, etc. as assessed by the
      SF 36 QOL questionnaire).

      A unique and trail blazing aspect of our proposed work is to screen for biochemical
      alterations in the plasma and urine of these patients following administration of OMT and to
      correlate these changes with vestibular function tests and other clinical parameters that may
      shed light on the biological mechanism(s) underlying the OMT. The impact of our proposed
      research lies in our attempt to establish a foundation for the basis of using OMT procedures
      to accelerate recovery of patients following mild to moderate brain injury and to find
      correlations between cognitive functions, biochemical markers, and self-reported assessments
      of quality of life.

      The successful achievement of positive outcomes in this project will serve as the basis for
      our future efforts to seek funding from the National Institutes of Health for recruitment of
      larger numbers of subjects in a multi-center research effort.

    <description>Urine sample will be taken one hour prior to initial OMT or sham treatment and again at12 weeks. Plasma samples will be taken one hour prior to OMT/sham treatment and 48 hours after treatment this will be done at week 0, 6 and 12. The anti-inflammatory biomarkers will be recorded and compared (before/after treatment) to see if they levels decrease after OMT treatments</description>
