  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) against leukemia
      antigens such as CD19 on B cells have shown promising results for the treatment of relapsed
      or refractory B-cell malignancies. However, a subset of cancer patients especially heavily
      pretreated cancer patients could be unable to receive this highly active therapy because of
      failed expansion. Moreover, it is still a challenge to manufacture an effective therapeutic
      product for infant cancer patients due to their small blood volume. On the other hand, the
      inherent characters of autologous CAR-T cell therapy including personalized autologous T cell
      manufacturing and widely &quot;distributed&quot; approach result in the difficulty of industrialization
      of autologous CAR-T cell therapy. Universal CD19-specific CAR-T cell(UCART019),derived from
      one or more healthy unrelated donors but could avoid graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and
      minimize their immunogenicity, is undoubtedly an alternative option to address
      above-mentioned issues. We have generated gene-disrupted allogeneic CD19-directed BBζ CAR-T
      cells (termed UCART019) by combining the lentiviral delivery of CAR and CRISPR RNA
      electroporation to disrupt endogenous TCR and B2M genes simultaneously and will test whether
      it can evade host-mediated immunity and deliver antileukemic effects without GVHD.

      The main goal of the phase 1 portion of this phase 1/2 trial is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of several doses of UCART019 in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19+
      leukemia and lymphoma, so as to establish the recommended dose and/or schedule of UCART019
      for phase 2 portion. The recommended Phase 2 dose will be defined as the highest dose level
      of UCART019 that induced DLT in fewer than 33% of patients (i.e., one dose level below that
      which induced DLT in at least two of six patients). Phase 2 portion of the trial will not be
      initiated until the recommended Phase 2 dose is determined. In the phase 2 portion of this
      trial, we will mainly determine if UCART019 help the body's immune system eliminate malignant
      B-cells. Safety of UCART019 and impact of this treatment on survival will also be observed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of UCART019 in patients with relapsed or
           refractory CD19+ leukemia and lymphoma.

        2. To evaluate the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred T cells, and
           the phenotype of persisting T cells. Real Time polymerase chain receptor (RT-PCR)
           analysis of peripheral blood(PB), bone marrow(BM) and lymph node will be used to detect
           and quantify survival of UCART019 over time.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to UCART019 cell
           infusions.

        2. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD19,
           and assess correlation with loss of detectable UCART019 (loss of engraftment).

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of allogeneic CD19 CAR-T-cells followed by
      a phase II study.

      The UCART019 will be administered by i.v. injection over 20-30 minutes as a using a &quot;split
      dose&quot; approach to dosing: 10% on day 0, 30% on day 1 and 60% on day 2.
