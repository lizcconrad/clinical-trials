  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to examine both the peripheral and central nervous system responses when
      light social drinkers and binge/heavy social drinkers are exposed to intravenous infusion of
      ethanol. The findings will provide a greater understanding of the brain mechanisms (cerebral
      blood flow and functional connectivity) underlying the association between stress, cortisol
      release, heart rate variability, alcohol craving, and alcohol stimulant and sedative effects.
      This knowledge could be significant in developing new therapies for the treatment of
      alcoholism.

    <measure>Change in Blood Flow</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Procedure (45 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood flow is measured in ml/100 grams/minute. The interpretation is that blood flow to that area indicates that region of the brain is responding to the consumption of alcohol or alcohol cues. Change in blood flow will be calculated as the change (and slope) of measurements taken at 10, 20, 30 and 45 minutes during the procedure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cortisol</measure>
    <time_frame>Post follow up to Procedure (125 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The units for cortisol are micrograms/deciliter and the interpretation is that amount has been released into the blood stream from the HPA axis in response to alcohol or alcohol cues. Change in Cortisol will be calculated by taking the change (and slopes) of measurements at 45, 30 and 5 minutes prior to procedure and comparing it to measurements taken at 65, 95, 110, 125 minutes following the procedure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Alcohol Effects (BAES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post follow up to Procedure (125 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol effects will be measured using the Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale (BAES). The BAES is a 12 item questionnaire with a 12-120 range. The higher the total value (up to 120), the greater the measured effects of alcohol. The change in alcohol effects will be assessed with the taking the change (and slopes) of measurements at 45, 30 and 5 minutes prior to procedure and comparing it to measurements taken at 65, 95, 110, 125 minutes following the procedure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Alcohol Effects (DEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post follow up to Procedure (125 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol effects will be measured using the Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ). The DEQ consists of 5 questions with 5-25 total point distribution. The greater the total points, the greater the measured effect of alcohol. The change in alcohol effects will be assessed with the taking the change (and slopes) of measurements at 45, 30 and 5 minutes prior to procedure and comparing it to measurements taken at 65, 95, 110, 125 minutes following the procedure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Alcohol Urges (AUQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post follow up to Procedure (125 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The urge to consume alcohol will be measured using the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ). The AUQ consists of 8 questions 8-56 total point distribution. The greater the total points, the greater the measured urge to consume alcohol. The change in alcohol urge will be assessed with the taking the change (and slopes) of measurements at 45, 30 and 5 minutes prior to procedure and comparing it to measurements taken at 65, 95, 110, 125 minutes following the procedure.</description>
