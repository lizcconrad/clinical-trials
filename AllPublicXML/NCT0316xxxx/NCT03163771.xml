  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal aim of the study is to avoid the diagnostic wanderings of patients suffering
      from a peroxisomal disorder. For this purpose, a new diagnostic strategy is proposed. It
      rests on functional metabolic explorations and gene studies directly connected to a
      first-line enlarged physico-chemical detection of metabolites from peroxisomal origin in
      clinically suspect patients.

    <description>Evaluation of a diagnostic strategy based on functional metabolic explorations and gene studies directly connected to a first-line enlarged physico-chemical detection of metabolites from peroxisomal origin in clinically or biologically suspect patients
The study is concomitant with an implementation in the routine Hospitals of the inter-region (West and North of France) of an immediate wide exploration (and not sequential and optional) of diagnostic markers of a pathology peroxisomal. This wide exploration should by itself lead to a diagnosis enrichment and should increase the number of inclusions. But the study, for patients thus included, is also considering an enlarged scanning of functional and genetic explorations that follow inclusion (instead of targeted screening guided primarily by the biological anomaly in the usual practice).</description>

        The studied population is represented by only one group of patients checking the inclusion
        criteria and recruited in the 4 University Hospital centers (Amiens, Caen, Lille and
        Rouen). For each patient, diagnostic exploration will start in patients with the common
        inclusion criteria and will include the study of all biochemical parameters susceptible to
        be disturbed In peroxisomal pathologies (Biology component). Based on the data obtained,
        the inclusion of patients will lead to biological confirmation tests (Cell Exploration and
        Enzymology) and molecular studies (Molecular Biology).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        I - CLINICAL/BIOLOGICAL CRITERIA For an efficient screening of the patients of the 4
        contributing University Hospitals (Amiens, Caen, Lille and Rouen), various inclusion
        criteria were selected: In general, the inclusion criterion is the existence of a positive
        biology or in turn the persistence of a clinical suspicion in spite of a negative biology.

        I A - Children from 0 to 17 years:

        The clinical inclusion criterion is a positive biology or the persistence of a clinical
        suspicion in spite of a negative biology. This persistent clinical suspicion is left to the
        discretion of the clinician. It is essentially based on the existence of a family history
        of peroxisomal (or suspected) pathology and / or the combination of several clinical signs
        of craniofacial dysmorphism, skeletal abnormalities, encephalopathy (seizures, ataxia,
        Hypotonia), demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, ophthalmopathy (retinopathy, cataract),
        hepatic impairment (hyperbilirubinemia, hepatomegaly, cholestasis) and growth retardation
        OR I B - Adults from 18 years

        The neurological symptoms of peroxisomal diseases in adulthood are numerous and
        non-specific. The three inclusion criteria selected for patient selection are as follows:

          -  Cognitive impairment (delayed acquisition or regression) and / or leukodystrophy AND
             At least one of the following signs: Cerebellar ataxia, Spastic paraparesis,
             Peripheral neuropathy, Neurosensory deafness, Retinitis pigmentosa, Epilepsy,
             Unexplained unexplained vigilance, Peripheral corticotropic insufficiency +/-
             gonadotropic AND

          -  no evidence for an extraperoxisomal origin of the patient disease stated after the
             usual paraclinic explorations

        II - NON CLINICAL CRITERIA

          -  Social insurances

          -  Having understood the information note and having signed the informed consent form.

          -  Patients under guardianship or curatorship may be included, since peroxisomal diseases
             as a cause of neurological impairment may potentially lead to guardianship.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or nursing women

          -  Person deprived of liberty or in emergency situations
