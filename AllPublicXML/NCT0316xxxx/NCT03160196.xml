    <description>The decision support tool is a Web-based software program accessed via a GP computer desktop icon. Clicking the icon opens a single page of tick boxes asking for relevant aspects of the presenting illness. Most fields for relevant medical history and patient demographics are automatically populated from data in the electronic health record. Depending on diagnosis and risk estimation, the tool recommends a guideline-based management strategy. Override options exist but require a justification from the GP. The tool also provides relevant prescriptions, radiology access, and referral forms, and a variety of patient information leaflets. GPs in practices randomized to the intervention group will have to initiate the tool but will not have to follow the tool's advice.</description>

    <description>Control practices will be aware of the tool but will be unable to access it and managed patients by usual care, which could include care aligned with the Guidelines. Prior to randomization, GPs from all participating practices (control and intervention) will attend a 1-hour face-to-face didactic education session on diabetes mellitus 2 management and the Colombia diabetes mellitus 2 Guidelines. The intervention pertains to the cluster level.</description>
