    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of fasinumab compared with
      placebo, when administered for up to 16 weeks in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the
      knee or hip.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of fasinumab compared with naproxen, when administered for up
           to 16 weeks in patients with OA of the knee or hip

        2. To evaluate the efficacy of fasinumab compared with placebo, when administered for up to
           52 weeks in patients with OA of the knee or hip

        3. To assess the safety and tolerability of fasinumab compared with naproxen, when
           administered for up to 16 weeks in patients with OA of the knee or hip

        4. To assess the safety and tolerability of fasinumab compared with naproxen, when
           administered for up to 52 weeks in patients with OA of the knee or hip

        5. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of fasinumab administered to patients for
           up to 52 weeks

        6. To evaluate the immunogenicity of fasinumab administered to patients for up to 52 weeks
