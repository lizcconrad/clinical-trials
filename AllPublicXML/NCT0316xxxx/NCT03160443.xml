  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eating disorders are multifactorial disorders currently conceptualized in a biopsychosocial
      model, but pathophysiology remains relatively unknown, and robust etiological models to guide
      treatment are therefore lacking. Different endophenotypes and neurocognitive vulnerability
      factors have been found in eating disorders including decision making abnormalities. The
      investigators hypothesize that decision making abnormalities are associated with a lower
      level of functioning and quality of life which could lead to social and interpersonal
      difficulties. The investigators also hypothesize that these anomalies are associated with a
      particular clinical profile (more restrictive profile, more hyperactivity, less insight on
      the disease and desire for care ...).

      The investigators will recruit a total of 340 patients with an eating disorder in the
      university hospital of Montpellier.

        -  Participation consists of a one-day visit with a multidisciplinary assessment. No action
           is specific to research. This is the usual management of patients with eating disorders
           addressed to our department.

        -  An ancillary study will be proposed, if the patient is addressed by his general
           practitioner for an annual evaluation. This second visit will be exactly the same as the
           initial visit.
