    <description>Up to 30 healthy male and female subjects (40 subjects if the optional fourth dose level is conducted) will receive multiple doses of ACT-709478 at the planned dose levels of 30, 100, and 200 mg.
Each dose level will be investigated in a new cohort of 10 healthy male and female subjects (4 male subjects on active drug and 1 on placebo, 4 female subjects on active drug and 1 on placebo) undergoing one treatment period with a once daily dosing scheme.</description>
