  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain Entrainment Technology (BET), also known as Binaural Beat Technology (BBT); is an
      auditory-neurophysiologic technique which uses auditory tones (often embedded in music,
      nature sounds or white noise) dichotically via stereo headphones to manipulate brainwave
      activity in turn affecting the listener's mental, physical and/or emotional state. Although
      this technology is widely marketed to the general public and can be found free in on the
      internet, only a hand full of scientific studies have shown its efficacy. This study is a
      follow-on study to the &quot;Sound Mind Warrior (SMW) Study&quot; (ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT02328690])
      conducted 2012-2015 which assessed the efficacy of the technology (in the &quot;theta&quot; brainwave
      frequency) on the cardiovascular stress response in a group of service members with complaint
      of chronic stress. This study will now assess BET (in the &quot;delta&quot; brainwave frequency) on
      sleep quality in a population of military healthcare beneficiaries with complaint of poor
      sleep quality.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will follow a prospective, one group pre- and post-intervention design.

      A sample of 162 military healthcare beneficiaries (within the Kaiserslautern Military
      Community footprint) with complaints of poor sleep quality will be instructed to wear sleep
      actigraphy monitors and complete daily sleep diaries upon waking for a total of four weeks.
      On weeks 3 and 4, participants will use BET at bedtime for a minimum of 30 minutes. Pre and
      post sleep quality measures will be compared along with pre- and post- c-reactive protein
      (CRP) measures and a post-study questionnaire to assess participants' perception about the
      technology.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>&quot;Quantitative&quot; Sleep Quality (via Sleep Actigraphy Watch)</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily over the course of 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep actigraphy monitor will measure wake/sleep. Using special software, that information is then articulated into graphical and tabulated report that shows the movement that occurred throughout the wake and sleep cycles as well as light exposure that may have affected sleep. The report gives the a) time the participants went to bed, b) time they woke up, c) number of hours they were in the bed, d) total number of hours asleep, e) number of minutes it took to fall asleep, f) percent efficiency of their sleep, g) number of minutes awaken after sleep onset, and h) total number of times they woke up after falling asleep.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia Severity Level (via Insomnia Severity Index Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A 7-item questionnaire will be used as a screening tool to quantify the severity level of the participant's poor sleep quality. It is comprised of a 5-point Likert scale with a total score from 0âˆ’28 with 15 or greater indicating moderate to severe insomnia</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>&quot;Qualitative&quot; Sleep Quality (via Sleep Foundation Sleep Diary Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily over the course of 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 14-item questionnaire will be used to capture sleep habits. Questions cover: napping, caffeine, alcohol, exercise, medication, meals, sleepiness, sleep hygiene, and quality. This instrument is not scored but merely used to assess patterns and if those patterns changed over the course of the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Impression of Sleep Quality (via Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4 (after using intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>A 24-item item questionnaire gives an accumulative score based on sub scores of sleep duration, sleep disturbance, sleep latency, number of days of dysfunction due to sleepiness, sleep efficiency, sleep quality, and medication usage. Minimum Score = 0 (better); Maximum Score = 21 (worse). Interpretation: TOTAL &lt; 5 associated with good sleep quality and TOTAL &gt; 5 associated with poor sleep,</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inflammatory Biomarker (via C-Reactive Protein Lab)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4 (after using intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>A blood sample for c-reactive protein will measures the inflammatory process. After accounting for any external influences on CRP level, this measure will be correlated with the objective and subjective sleep data to assess if changes in sleep quality affected the inflammatory response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Extenuating Factor Affecting C-Reactive Protein Level (via C-Reactive Protein Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4 (after using intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Since exposure to stress, infection, allergy, injury, or menstruation could affect CRP levels; this 6-item questionnaire will be used to note other possible co-variates that could have impacted CRP levels.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Impression of Brain Entrainment Technology (via Post Study Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 (after using intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-item questionnaire will be used at the completion of the study to instrument will capture any subjective comments from the participants as to assess the participant's perception about the technology as well as to assess ways that will help improve future studies using the same equipment and/or technology.</description>

    <description>Brain Entrainment Technology (BET), also known as Binaural Beat Technology (BBT), is a sound technology where two slightly different tones are present to each ear and the brain produces a third tone. This third tone impacts the reticular activating system which alters the action potentials of the thalamus and cerebral cortex in turn changing the brain wave frequency to alter the state of consciousness of the listener.</description>
