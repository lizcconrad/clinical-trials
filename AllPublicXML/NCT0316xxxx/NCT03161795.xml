      PURPOSE: Assess the risks of long-term opioid therapy, especially opioid-related disorders
      such as opioid-related chemical coping in chronic noncancer pain patients.

      Pain, particularly chronic pain, is a major threat to the quality of life worldwide and will
      become more so as the average age increases. Currently, over 30% of the world's population is
      known to have chronic pain. Opioid agonists are effective medicines for the treatment of
      moderate and severe pain. Although opioid consumption has increased in the past few decades,
      it remains below the requirements in most countries. In 2010, the WHO found that 66% of the
      world population has a level of Virtually No Consumption of opioids (ACM &lt; 3%). Conversely,
      in countries with ACM &gt; 100% such as the U.S., drug overdose deaths (the majority involving
      an opioid) have nearly quadrupled since 1999. Long-term use of opioids for chronic noncancer
      pain patients remains controversial owing to concerns regarding analgesic tolerance and drug
      dependence. Additionally, to date research consists of very low-quality evidence, studies on
      long-term opioid use are limited, and the majority were conducted in the U.S. Particularly,
      in countries with inadequate opioid consumption like most Asian countries no studies
      addressing long-term opioid use in chronic non-cancer pain patients nor opioid-related
      disorders such as chemical coping statistics are available. Therefore, in compliance with
      growth in medical opioid use and the lack of studies in countries with inadequate opioid
      consumption, it is indispensable to figure out the characteristics of opioid-related
      disorders in chronic noncancer pain patients with long-term use of opioid therapy.

      In this study, we performed a national, multicenter, observational cohort study to address
      the current status of opioid treatment for chronic noncancer pain in South Korea, a country
      showing moderate opioid consumption. The ultimate aims of this study were to estimate the
      frequency of opioid-related disorders such as opioid-related chemical coping, to evaluate
      their functional and psychiatric characteristics, and to determine the risk factors
      associated with opioid-related disorders in chronic noncancer pain patients receiving
      long-term opioid therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a devastating disease often treated inadequately.(1) More than 1.5 billion
      people worldwide (2) suffers from chronic pain. One of the pharmacological therapies for
      chronic pain are opioid agonists, and although its consumption has increased worldwide during
      the last two decades,(3) it remains below the requirements in most countries. In 2010, the
      WHO measured the ratio of opioid consumption using the Adequacy of Consumption Measure
      (ACM),(4) finding that 66% of the world population has virtually no consumption and only 7.5%
      has adequate ACM.(5) South Korea had 47.0% adequacy, which means that less than half of the
      patients who required opioid treatment actually received it. Nonetheless, the consumption of
      opioids in South Korea has increased from 10 mg/capita in 2005 to 55 mg/ capita in 2015,
      becoming the third country with more opioid consumption among Asian countries. (6) One of the
      factors that condition the poor access to opioids for severe and moderate pain is the induce
      reward responses to opioids(7), which may result in opioid-related aberrant behaviors (OAB).
      That risk remains the use of opioids for chronic noncancer pain (CNCP) controversial, owing
      to concerns regarding analgesic tolerance and drug dependence.(8) The spectrum of OAB in CNCP
      patients is wide and varies from misuse without a compliant intake to overuse or addiction
      with a severe aberrant consumption that is potentially harmful.(9) Between the extremes,
      there is a middle ground group known as opioid-related chemical coping, characterized by an
      inappropriate use of opioids to cope with emotional distress.(10) A better understanding of
      this intermediate status may be crucial to prompt the identification of individuals at risk
      of severe OAB, avoid unnecessary opioid toxicity, achieve adequate pain control, and a better
      quality of life.(11) OABs are a great source of concern, especially in the U.S. with a
      current opioid epidemic, where drug overdose deaths (the majority involving an opioid) have
      nearly quadrupled since 1999(12). As a response to the opioid crisis, in 2016, the Centers
      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), released a guideline for prescribing opioids in
      chronic pain(13). However, studies in countries with adequate consumption of opioids (ACM â‰¥
      100%) showed that pain is not well treated in many patients(14, 15), and there are signs that
      problems with opioid analgesics' misuse are not related to the prescription of this
      medication to pain patients(16, 17). Additionally, overly stringent and ill-considered
      restrictions and regulations intended to prevent illicit, non-medical use of opioids, results
      in patients suffering unnecessarily (18). Moreover, the available literature is characterized
      by great variability of definitions, measurements, demographics, opioid use duration, and an
      overwhelming majority of the studies took place in the U.S. (19-21). These factors remain the
      evidence of opioid use in CNCP patients insufficient and impractical, especially in countries
      with inadequate opioid consumption like South Korea.(5) Accordingly, studies to evaluate the
      long-term use of prescription opioids, the rates of misuse, and the risk factors of opioids
      in CNCP patients are needed in countries with inadequate ACM. Therefore, a national,
      multicenter, observational cohort study to address the current status of opioid treatment for
      CNCP patients receiving long-term opioid therapy was conducted in South Korea to estimate the
      frequency of opioid-related aberrant behaviors (OAB) such as opioid-related chemical coping,
      to appraise the functional and psychiatric characteristics of CNCP patients and to determine
      the risk factors associated with OABs.
