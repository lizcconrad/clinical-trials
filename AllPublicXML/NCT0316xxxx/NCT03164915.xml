    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of LIV-GAMMA SN Inj. in
      adult subjects with ITP. The primary objective of this study is to determine the responder
      rate. A response is defined as a platelet count of ≥30×10^9/L and at least a 2 fold increase
      of the baseline, confirmed on at least 2 separate occasions at least 7 days apart without
      bleeding. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the further efficacy assessments including
      duration of response, and the safety of LIV-GAMMA SN Inj.
