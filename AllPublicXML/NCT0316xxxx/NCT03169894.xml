    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, dose-escalation, signal-finding, single center study. The
      study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and short-term efficacy of
      MDGN-002 in adults with moderate to severe, active Crohn's disease who have previously failed
      anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) treatment.
