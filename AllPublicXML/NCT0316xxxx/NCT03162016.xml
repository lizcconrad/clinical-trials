  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limitation of donor site and significant postoperative morbidity are often described in
      connective tissue graft harvesting. We want to show if mucoderm used in tunnel technique to
      recover miller class I and II recessions defects could be an alternative to connective tissue
      graft.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Connective tissue graft harvested from the palate does not always have sufficient size to
      cover multiple recession defects. Moreover, connective tissue graft shows significant
      postoperative morbidity to treat generalized multiple gingival recessions. The goal of this
      study is to show if Mucoderm could be considered has a substitute of connective tissue graft
      in the coverage of gingival recession defects.
