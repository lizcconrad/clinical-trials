    <textblock>
      Background Macrosomia at birth is associated with subsequent susceptibility to obesity,
      abnormal glucose metabolism, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Epigenetic reprogramming has
      been reported to be involved in the development of human diseases caused by suboptimal
      environmental or nutritional factors.

      Objective The study was aiming to explore epigenetic mechanism influences on macrosomic
      infants exposed to intrauterine hyperglycemia.

      Design The investigators performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in cord blood
      from macrosomic infants born to women with gestational diabetes or infants with normal birth
      weight born to normal glucose-tolerant women in order to identify genes related to foetal
      growth or early adipose tissue development. The candidate genes were then validated using
      SEQUENOM MassARRAY after bisulfite conversion.

    <description>According to the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was diagnosed when at least one cut point was reached in 2-hour 75-g OGTT test: a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 5.1 mmol/L (92 mg/dL), a 1-hour ≥ 10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) or a 2-hour ≥ 8.5 mmol/L (153 mg/dL). Participants were divided into two groups based on OGTT: Group normal glucose tolerant (NGT, n=132) and Group GDM (n=107).</description>

    <description>After delivery, participants were further divided into four subgroups based on neonatal birth weight: normal birth weight (NBW) was defined as 2500g ≤ birth weight &lt; 4000g, macrosomia (Mac) was defined as birth weight ≥ 4000g. Group NGT-NBW (n=83): normal glucose tolerant women with normal neonatal birth weight; Group NGT-Mac (n=49): normal glucose tolerant women with macrosomia; Group GDM-NBW (n=82): GDM women with normal neonatal birth weight; Group GDM-Mac (n=25): GDM women with macrosomia.</description>
