  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Thorough QT study intended to estimate the effect of glasdegib at therapeutic
      exposure and at supra-therapeutic exposure on cardiac repolarization in healthy subjects.
      This is a randomized, double blind, positive and placebo controlled study with a 6 day
      washout between successive periods.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Healthy male and/or female subjects of non child bearing potential who, at the time
             of screening, are between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive. Healthy is defined
             as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full
             physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12 lead ECG
             or clinical laboratory tests.

        Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential must meet at least 1 of the following
        criteria:

          1. Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as follows: cessation of regular menses for at
             least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or physiological cause;
             with a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level confirming the postmenopausal
             state;

          2. Have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy;

          3. Have medically confirmed ovarian failure. All other female subjects (including females
             with tubal ligations and females that do NOT have a documented hysterectomy, bilateral
             oophorectomy and/or ovarian failure) are considered to be of childbearing potential.

             2. Body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110
             lb).

             3. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

             4. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment
             plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

             Exclusion Criteria:

               -  Screening supine 12 lead ECG demonstrating a corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;450
                  msec or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120
                  msec, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS
                  values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.

             Subjects with family history of myocardial infarction, congenital long QT syndrome,
             torsades de pointes or clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias. Subjects should
             be within normal range of potassium, magnesium and corrected calcium calculation at
             screening.

             Pregnant female subjects; breastfeeding female subjects; female subjects of
             childbearing potential; male subjects with partners currently pregnant; male subjects
             who are unwilling or unable to use atleast one highly effective methods of
             contraception as outlined in this protocol for the duration of the study and for at
             least 90 days after the last dose of investigational product and, refrain from sperm
             donation for the duration of the Study and for at least 90 days after the last dose of
             investigational product.

             History of known QTc prolongation or ECG abnormalities.

             Self-reported history of risk factors for QT prolongation or torsades de pointes (eg,
             organic heart disease, congestive heart failure, hypokalemia,
             hypomagnesemia,congenital long QT syndrome, myocardial ischemia or infarction,
             congenital deafness, and family history of sudden death, or a family history of
             congenital QT syndrome).

             Self-reported history of sick sinus syndrome, first, second, or third degree
             atrioventricular (AV) block, myocardial infarction, pulmonary congestion, cardiac
             arrhythmia, prolonged QT interval or conduction abnormalities, or any other clinically
             significant cardiovascular disease history.
