  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AURIGA is designed to collect data from routine clinical practice on the effectiveness and
      utilization of intravitreal aflibercept in the treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic
      macular edema (DME) or macula edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO).

      The primary objective of this observational study (OS) is to evaluate the effectiveness of
      intravitreal aflibercept in 4 cohorts (with/without prior treatment in DME or macular edema
      secondary to RVO) in each of the participating countries.

      Additionally, utilization and treatment regimens in routine clinical practice will be
      described.

      Health care resources and services as well as health out-comes related to vision loss will be
      evaluated based on information collected using the AURIGA patient questionnaires.
