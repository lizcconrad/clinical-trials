    <textblock>
      The Division of Neuroradiology at UHN (Toronto Western Hospital) would like to initiate a
      single center registry study on the treatment of large intracranial aneurysms with
      PIPEline[tm] flex embolization devices using optical flow imaging software, &quot;AneurysmFlow&quot;.
      The study team will consent patients diagnosed with unruptured brain / intracratial aneurysms
      IA(s) . The selected patients ,who booked for elective brain aneurysm repair/endovascular
      treatment with Flow diverter devices (FDS) called Pipeline embolization devices (PED), will
      qualify for registry participation . During the PED procedure, the study team will be using
      AneurysmFlow software to calculate a new metric called the MAFA ratio (Mean Aneurysm Flow
      Amplitude). By calculating the MAFA ratios intra-operatively, the interventionalist can adapt
      the therapeutic strategy in order to maximize the flow diverting effect on inducing complete
      aneurysm occlusions (thrombosis). Additionally, the purpose of this study is to further
      expand the body of clinical knowledge concerning the relationship between blood flow metrics
      as determined by the AneurysmFlow software and clinical outcome in patients undergoing
      treatment for intracranial aneurysms (IAs) with Pipeline and Pipeline Flex embolization
      devices. The study team aims to collect data at a 12 month follow-up period for each patient
