  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate when genetic variation in the
      carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) gene influences antiplatelet therapy response, as assessed by ex
      vivo platelet aggregometry, in healthy participants treated with clopidogrel and ticagrelor.
      We hypothesize that genetic variation in CES1 will significantly impact on-clopidogrel
      platelet aggregation while having a minimal effect in ticagrelor-treated subjects.

      Specific Aim: To conduct a prospective randomized crossover study of clopidogrel and
      ticagrelor in healthy individuals stratified by CES1 genotype. Participants will be recruited
      by CES1 genotype into a randomized crossover study of clopidogrel (75 mg daily for 7d) and
      ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily for 7d) with extensive phenotyping including ex vivo platelet
      aggregometry performed pre- and post-drug administration in order to assess the interaction
      of genotype and drug choice on on-treatment platelet function.

    <intervention_model_description>Ninety healthy Amish subjects (30 CES1 G143E allele carriers, 30 carriers of a risk variant to be determined, and 30 age/sex-matched controls) will be enrolled. We will prospectively evaluate the effect of CES1 genotype on clopidogrel and ticagrelor response, as assessed by agonist-stimulated platelet aggregation, through the completion of a randomized crossover study of clopidogrel (75 mg per day for 7 d) and ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily for 7 d) in 90 healthy Amish individuals stratified by CES1 genotype as described above, with at least a 14-day washout period between drug interventions.</intervention_model_description>

    <ipd_description>It is possible that deidentified data will be deposited into large public databases as per NIH data sharing policies (e.g. dbGAP, PharmGKB). Data to be shared would include, but not limited to, anthropometric data, study outcome data, and relevant covariate data used in statistical models of association. It is anticipated that data would be available after the completion of the trial. The data will be obtained from the participants and the study-related research procedures.</ipd_description>
