    <textblock>
      The investigators performed this study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of
      transplantation with CRISPR/Cas9 CCR5 gene modified CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells
      for patients that develop AIDS and hematological malignances. Patients will be treated with
      antiviral therapy (ART) to achieve undetectable HIV-1 virus in peripheral blood before
      conditioning. CD34+ cells from donors will be infused into the patients after treatment with
      CRISPR/Cas9 to ablate CCR5 gene.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of the infusion of CD34+ cells
      which are treated with CRISPR/Cas9 to disrupt the CCR5 gene. The secondary objective is to
      evaluate the resistance to HIV-1(R5) in infected patients after infusion of modified CD34+
      cells with or without an antiretroviral therapy interruption (ATI). After the
      transplantation, the reconstitution time and frequency of multi-lineage hematopoietic cell
      will be analyzed against previously reported HSCT in HIV-1 patients. After the detection of
      high CD4+ T cells reconstitution (over 600 cells/μL) and CCR5 negative cells (over 1%) in
      peripheral blood, subjects will undergo an ATI. HIV-1 RNA level and CD4+ cell counts will be
      monitored biweekly for at least one month.
