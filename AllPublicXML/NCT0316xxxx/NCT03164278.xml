  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research study is to assess the effectiveness of an independent
      transfer training program (ITTP), and to determine methods which may increase overall success
      of an online training program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 200 individuals will be recruited for this research study. Investigators will recruit
      individuals who use a wheelchair for the majority of their mobility (over 40 hours per week),
      have the ability to transfer independently (may use equipment like sliding boards), use a
      seated pivot to transfer, and speak English as a primary a language. This study will be
      accessed entirely online and participation is expected to last approximately one year.
      Subjects will be randomized into three groups; one group that will receive transfer training
      immediately with no follow up, one group that will receive the transfer training immediately
      with 1 month and 6 month follow up, and one group that will receive the transfer training
      after 6 months. The transfer training program itself will take approximately 1 hour to
      complete.

      After obtaining informed consent, participants in the first two groups will complete baseline
      questionnaires. They will then receive the transfer training program.

      Participants in the third group (a wait-list control group) will complete the baseline
      questionnaires and be contacted one month later to complete a transfer assessment instrument
      questionnaire. They will then wait 5 months. After this period, participants will complete
      the baseline questionnaires a second time, and then receive the transfer training.

      After completing the transfer training, all groups will be contacted immediately post
      training to complete additional questionnaires to assess the effectiveness of the remote
      transfer training program. Participants in the 2nd and 3rd group will be contacted 1 month
      and 6 months post-training to complete additional questionnaires.

They will complete data collection measures embedded in the transfer training program, including demographics, Online Learning Readiness Scale (OLRS), Moorong Self Efficacy Scale (MSES), Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS), Transfer Assessment Instrument Questionnaire (TAI-Q), and the Wheelchair User Shoulder Pain Index (WUSPI).</description>

    <description>Independent Transfer Training Program: ITTP training starts with an overview and self-evaluation using the transfer assessment instrument questionnaire (TAI-Q) followed by three core modules: wheelchair setup, body setup, and flight/landing. Wheelchair setup includes factors such as the angle and distance of the wheelchair to the transfer surface, removing barriers, applying the brakes, and height of the transfer. Body setup involves positioning one's body for an optimal transfer and covers foot, hip, arm and hand positions. Flight/landing discusses how to achieve a smooth and controlled transfer, the head-hips relationship, use of transfer device, and safe landing.</description>
