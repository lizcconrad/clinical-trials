  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Onychomycosis, a common pathology of the toenails, is even more prevalent among diabetic
      subjects. Nearly 26 million Americans suffer from diabetes, and approximately one-third of
      subjects with diabetes have toenail onychomycosis. Numerous studies have addressed the
      efficacy and safety of both topical and oral antifungal treatment options for onychomycosis
      in diabetic subjects. However, no study to date has specifically addressed the efficacy and
      safety of efinaconazole among diabetic subjects.

      The objective of this noncomparative, uncontrolled study is to determine the efficacy of
      topical efinaconazole 10% for toenail onychomycosis among subjects with diabetes mellitus.
      Specific indicators to measure efficacy of treatment will be the mycological cure rate,
      complete cure rate, and treatment success. Furthermore, an additional goal of the study is to
      gain knowledge of safety in the setting of a cohort of diabetic subjects
