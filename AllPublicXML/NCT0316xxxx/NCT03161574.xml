  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant 5-Fu based chemoradiation followed by surgery is a standard treatment for locally
      advanced rectal cancer. However, radiation-related side effects could not be neglected. But
      this multimodality strategy failed to improve survival. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone may be
      an alternative strategy to minimize treatment-related toxicities without compromising the
      oncology outcome. Thus, patients with MRI-defined CRM-positive rectal cancer will receive 6
      cycles of neoadjuvant treatment with FOLFOXIRI followed by surgery. The purpose of the study
      is to evaluate the efficacy of FOLFOXIRI alone as neoadjuvant treatment in treating patients
      with locally advanced rectal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative chemoradiotherapy has been considered for years the standard treatment to
      patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. However, this multi-modality treatment has been
      questioned since more evidences suggested that radiotherapy may not be a necessary component
      of this treatment, and by omitting radiotherapy it have the advantage of reducing acute and
      late treatment-related toxicities. Given the high anti-tumor of systemic chemotherapy alone,
      any patients with CRM involvement could be theoretically deemed candidate for an approach in
      which radiotherapy is delivered preoperatively if a substantial tumor downsizing is not
      achieved after upfront systemic chemotherapy or postoperatively if the pathologic CRM is
      involved. This single phase Ⅱ trial was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of FOLFOXIRI in
      treating patients with MRI-defined CRM-positive rectal cancer. All patients will receive the
      regimen every 2 weeks for 3 cycles. MRI of the pelvic will be performed after 3 cycles of
      chemotherapy to assess clinical response. If the tumor responds after 3 cycles of treatment,
      the patient will continue for another 3 cycles of treatment before surgery under the decision
      of MDT. On the contrary, if the tumor shows no response, radiotherapy will be given before
      operation. After surgery and pathologic CRM is not involved, 6 cycles of mFOLFOX6 will be
      given as adjuvant chemotherapy, otherwise postoperative radiotherapy will be given if the
      pathologic CRM is involved.
