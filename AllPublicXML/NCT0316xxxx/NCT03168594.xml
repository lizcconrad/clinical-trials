  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of irinotecan combined with
      cisplatin (IP regimen) and etoposide combined with cisplatin (EP regimen) in advanced or
      metastatic gastrointestinal pancreatic and esophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma.

      In this prospective randomized phase II study, the investigators aim to compare the survival
      benefit as well as the safety for irinotecan combined with cisplatin (IP regimen) versus
      etoposide combined with cisplatin (EP regimen) in advanced or metastatic gastrointestinal
      pancreatic and esophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma.

             severe liver disease (active hepatitis, cirrhosis), uncontrolled diabetes or
             hypertension, or pulmonary disease ( interstitial pneumonia, obstructive pulmonary
             disease or symptomatic bronchospasm);

          7. Prior long term steroid therapy (excluding short term steroid treatment which is
             completed prior to &gt; 2 weeks of study enrollment)；

          8. Meningeal carcinomatosis;

          9. Patients with central nervous system(CNS) disorder or peripheral nervous system

         12. History of other malignancy. However, subjects who have been disease-free for 5 years,
             or subjects with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer or
             successfully treated in situ carcinoma, are eligible；

         13. Person with no capacity (legally) or inappropriate to continue study treatment for
             ethics/medical reasons；
