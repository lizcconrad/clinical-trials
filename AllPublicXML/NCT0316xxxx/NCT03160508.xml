      This study documents real life weight bearing in patients treated with a TFNA, who are
      allowed for immediate weight bearing as tolerated.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective data will be collected from 30 patients presenting a per- or inter-trochanteric
      fracture of the femur treated with the TFNA. Post-operatively patients will be asked to wear
      a sensor insole in their shoes for up to 3 months after surgical treatment. The sensor insole
      will be used in both feet and will not have any impact in patient's activities of daily
      living while allowing real time measurements of weight bearing.

      In addition to weight bearing measurements, perceived pain (numeric rating scale), mobility
      (Parker Mobility Score and Time Up and Go Test) will be assessed at 6 and 12 weeks after
      surgical treatment and in conjunction with the standard (routine) of care follow up schedule.
      In order to investigate the relationship between these variables and the weight bearing
      measurements, patients or their care takers or assisting family members will be asked to
      document the daily use of the insole in a diary.

      Finally, over the course of the study, anticipated adverse events (AE) that may affect the
      healing process will be collected. Special attention will be given to implant- or
      bone-related AEs. Images from patients with implant- or bone related AEs will be collected as
      per standard of care

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 years and older

          -  Patients treated with the TFNA; i.e. according to the technique guide and the
             indications for use, patients who presented any of the following conditions:

               -  Stable or unstable pertrochanteric fractures

               -  Intertrochanteric fractures

               -  Basal neck fractures

               -  Combinations of pertrochanteric, intertrochanteric, and basal neck fractures

          -  Patients who were able to walk before the fracture and are prescribed full weight
             bearing as tolerated post-surgery

          -  Ability to understand the content of the patient information / informed consent form

          -  Willingness and ability to participate in the study according to the clinical
             investigation plan

          -  Signed and dated ethical committee approved written informed consent according to the
             local regulations

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are not allowed to full weight bearing as tolerated post-surgery

          -  Any condition, which impairs weight bearing (e.g. additional acute fracture on the
             ipsilateral and/or contralateral side, pain)

          -  Patients, who due to their condition, are in opinion of the Prinicipal Investigator
             (PI) unable to complete a reliable assessment

          -  Pregnancy or women planning to conceive within the study period

          -  Participation in any other medical device or medicinal product registry within the
             previous month that could, in opinion of the PI, influence the results of the present
             study
