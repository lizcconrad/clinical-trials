      This study is being conducted to investigate the rate and extent of naproxen absorption from
      the Test naproxen sodium formulation is bioequivalent to Aleve® naproxen sodium, a Reference
      product currently marketed in The Netherlands in order to support the registration of the
      Reckitt Benckiser (RB) naproxen sodium (220 mg tablets).
