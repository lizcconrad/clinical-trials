  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observation of disturbing factors in the operating room and comparison between day and night
      shift. The investigators have chosen to observe kidney transplantations, since this type of
      operation has the same priority during day and night. Stress levels of surgeons will be
      measured using the HealthPatch.

    <description>One investigator will report all factors that potentially disturb the vascular surgeon during kidney transplantation. Nature and severity of the disturbing factors will be reported, such as opening and closing of doors, beepers. For this, the investigators will use an observational tool for assessing surgical flow disruptions (Parker SE, et al. Development and evaluation of an observational tool for assessing surgical flow disruptions and their impact on surgical performance. World J Surg 2010; 34(2): 353-361)</description>
