      Primary objective: To document change in translesional pressure gradients (TLPGs) and ratios
      (fractional flow reserve) using the NAVVUS RXi catheter following endovascular treatment for
      symptomatic lower extremity peripheral arterial disease.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Evaluation of correlation of the ABI and TBI and TLPGs at baseline and following
           endovascular therapy

        -  Evaluation of the correlation between the change in WIQ, TCOMs, wound size and change in
           TLPGS

        -  Evaluation of correlation between lesion severity by QVA (MLD, % diameter stenosis) and
           TLPGs

        -  Evaluation of baseline MLA, MLD, plaque burden by intravascular ultrasound (optional)
           and TLPGs

      There are a lack of tools available for the intraprocedural assessment of endovascular
      procedures for lower extremity peripheral arterial disease. The present study will use the
      NAVVUS RXi catheter to document changes in translesional hemodynamics obtained with and
      without hyperemia in patients undergoing directional atherectomy, angioplasty, and/or
      stenting of femoropopliteal and infrapoplieal lesions.

    <description>Observational: â€¢ During treatment of Lesion a catheter is inserted into the diseased portion of the artery to remove the plaque and improve the blood flow through the artery. This measurement, which may be repeated 5 times during the treatment, to measure the blood flow at a point before and after the section of the artery with the blockage</description>
