      This is an open-label, single administration dose study in adult healthy male and female
      subjects. After qualifying for the study, subjects will receive a single intramuscular
      injection of the FDA approved 2016-2017 quadrivalent influenza vaccine.

      Subjects will be screened within 28 days prior to enrollment into the study. After qualifying
      for the study subjects will visit the clinical unit on Day l and will have pre-dose blood
      samples taken for humoral (serum) and cellular(peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs)
      immunity testing and nasopharyngeal swabs for assessment of mucosa! immunity, and will then
      be given the vaccine.

      Over the next 6 months, I 0-mL blood samples will be collected on Days 4, 8, 15, 29, 91 and
      181 for HAI testing. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected on Day 8 to assess
      cellular responses. A nasopharyngeal swab will also be done on Day 29. Screening assessments
      will include clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis (UA), drug and
      alcohol testing), vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram and physical examination.

      Adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.
