      The objective of this study is to verify the contribution of digital plethysmography in the
      early diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome in emergency departments.

      To determine the sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value of this
      method that was not previously used for this purpose.

      Chest pain is a frequent reason for consultation in the emergency room, which can be as much
      as 5 to 10% of consultants. Problems in etiologic diagnosis are often encountered due to the
      variety of etiologies of chest pain. Among them is the acute coronary syndrome, which is a
      major cause of mortality and morbidity.

      The endothelium plays a crucial role in maintaining the tone and vascular integrity and in
      particular the secretion of vasodilator and vasoconstrictor mediators. In most vascular
      pathologies, this equilibrium will be broken by the attenuation of the vasodilating function
      of the endothelium. This is called endothelial dysfunction.

      Several tools for measuring endothelial function have been developed, the main
      characteristics of which are: noninvasive, reproducible, independent operators, predictive of
      the disease, safe for subjects, inexpensive and easy to use.

      In this study we will be interested in digital plethysmography which has shown its
      effectiveness in:

        -  Screening for cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic subjects.

        -  The risk of a new cardiovascular event in the sick.

        -  Evaluation of the response to certain therapies.

      Goal of the study :

      The objective of this study is to verify the contribution of digital plethysmography in the
      early diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome in emergency departments.

      To determine the sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value of this
      method that was not previously used for this purpose, hence the originality of this study.
