      This is a multicenter, Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm,
      parallel-group efficacy and safety study of NEOD001 as a single agent administered
      intravenously in adults with AL amyloidosis who have a maintained hematologic response to
      their most recent treatment for AL amyloidosis (e.g., chemotherapy, autologous stem cell
      transplant [ASCT]) and have persistent renal dysfunction.

      This is a multicenter, Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm,
      parallel-group efficacy and safety study of NEOD001 as a single agent administered
      intravenously in adults with AL amyloidosis who have a maintained hematologic response to
      their most recent treatment for AL amyloidosis (e.g., chemotherapy, autologous stem cell
      transplant [SCT]) and have persistent renal dysfunction. Subject screening will occur during
      the 28 days prior to the first administration of study drug (i.e. month 1 day 1). If
      screening assessments are completed and all eligibility requirements are met, the subject
      will be enrolled. Study visits will occur every 28 days based on scheduling from month 1 day
      1. A ±5-day window is allowed for visits starting after month 1. Subjects may receive up to
      12 infusions of study drug. Subjects who discontinue study drug before the initial End of
      Study (EOS) visit should have an Early Treatment Discontinuation (ETD) Visit 30 (±5) days
      after their final administration of study drug. After completing 12 months of treatment and
      the confirmatory EOS visit, a subject may enter an open-label extension (OLE) study, during
      which subjects will receive active treatment with NEOD001 for 12 months and may receive
      concurrent chemotherapy.

    <description>The aim of this study is to assess the performance of CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) creatinine in comparison to iothalamate clearance measured in AL amyloidosis patients. Iothalamate will be given subcutaneously. Urine and plasma samples will then be obtained. All laboratory tests for samples obtained for GFR measurement will be performed at Mayo Clinic Rochester. Quantification of iothalamate in urine and plasma will be performed using a tandem mass spectrometric method.</description>
