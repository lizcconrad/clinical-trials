  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in combination with
      lymphodepletion and high-dose interleukin 2 (IL-2) has demonstrated reproducible objective
      response rates of approximately 50 percent in patients with highly advanced, refractory
      metastatic melanoma.

      Recent developments in theTIL ACT procedure facilitate the use of a reduced-intensity,
      non-myeloablative, lympho-depleting preparative regimen which is expected to be both less
      toxic and equally efficient compared to previous regimens.

      The Sponsor is developing the ex-vivo expanded autologous TIL as the Investigational Product
      (IP). Yet, the administration of the TIL cellular product can only be accomplished in the
      context of an autologous, Adoptive Cell Therapy (ACT) procedure which is composed of the
      following steps:

        1. Reduced Intensity, non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting induction regimen using
           Fludarabine (25 mg/m2 for 3 days) followed by Total Body Radiation (TBR) (2 Gray as a
           single treatment) for 1 day

        2. Bolus high-dose (720,000 IU/kg) IL-2, which will be administered to each patient every 8
           hours, to tolerance. A maximum of 10 doses will be administered per patient.

        3. Early-stage follow-up until 30 days post-discharge

        4. Late-stage follow-up, such as CT scans, will be carried out four and twelve weeks after
           TIL administration, and then every 3 months thereafter for the first year after TIL
           therapy; for the second year and onwards, as clinically indicated.
