  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In dermatology, biologic medications are used to treat conditions such as moderate-to-severe
      psoriasis. These medications generally function to decrease inflammation or disrupt the
      inflammatory cycle. Examples of biologic medications commonly used in dermatology include
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), blockers/inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab,
      certolizumab pegol, golimumab), interleukin 12/23 blockers (ustekinumab) and interleukin 17A
      blockers (secukinumab, ixekizumab).

      Due to biologic medication's efficacy and safety profiles, they have revolutionized
      dermatology and the general medical field. However, patients may be apprehensive about
      choosing a biologic medication for a variety of reasons. These include hearing negative
      information about the drug from friends or family, being nervous about injection, or seeing
      the drug or its side effects negatively portrayed in the media. Many patients are not aware
      that clinical trial evidence for biologics exist, and instead may rely on anecdotal evidence
      in choosing to take these medications.

      Because fear of the drug is inherently subjective, it can be modified with appropriate
      reassurance and presentation of evidence. Physicians must be able to ascertain from where the
      fear originates and how it can be countered. By understanding what kind of information will
      allow patients to be confident in their decision to take a biologic, dermatologists can
      improve outcomes and initiate use of this drug. Furthermore, reducing fear of side effects or
      adverse events may improve adherence to treatment and may improve treatment outcomes. The
      investigators propose this study with the goal of learning whether patients are more
      confident in the potential success of biologic medications in treating their psoriasis after
      being presented with clinical trial evidence, anecdotal evidence, or both.
