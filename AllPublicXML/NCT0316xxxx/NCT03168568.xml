  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate whether valsartan/sacubitril leads to a superior
      improvement in endothelial function and endocrine status compared to valsartan alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Valsartan/sacubitril (Entresto®; LCZ696) is a first-in-class angiotensin receptor neprilysin
      inhibitor (ARNI) that has recently been approved for the treatment of chronic heart failure
      with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The drug consists of a 1:1 complex of the angiotensin
      receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan and the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril. In a recent
      randomized controlled trial in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction
      (PARADIGM-HF), valsartan/sacubitril significantly reduced all-cause and cardiovascular
      mortality as well as hospitalizations for heart failure compared to enalapril. The precise
      reason why combined angiotensin receptor and neprilysin blockade is superior to ACE blockade
      is still unclear and knowledge of the mechanisms involved would provide further insight which
      patients with symptomatic heart failure will particularly benefit from valsartan/sacubitril.
      On the one hand, many of the peptides affected by neprilysin blockade act on vascular
      endothelial cells. On the other, neprilysin inhibition may induce significant endocrine
      changes with a shift to more favorable hormonal profile in HFrEF patients. Detailed studies
      on the vascular and endocrine effects of valsartan/sacubitril in humans are lacking so far.
      The investigators hypothesize that valsartan/sacubitril results in an incremental improvement
      of endothelial dysfunction and endocrine imbalance over valsartan in patients with heart
      failure with reduced ejection fraction.
