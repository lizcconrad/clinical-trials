  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a genetic rare disease, which alters the adrenal
      production of gluco and mineralo corticoids. The treatment consists in supplementing children
      using hydrocortisone. Despite care for these children has improve substantially across
      decades, short adult height still remains an important consequence of the disease. About 20 %
      of patients have an AH below 2 standard deviations compared to their expected height.

      In the OPALE model study, the investigators have collected data from a cohort of 496 French
      patients, born between 1970 and 1991 and with a known genotype. Using their age, sex, growth,
      disease, bone maturation and pubertal data, they have built a model which allows to predict
      their AH using data available at 8 years of age. This model has shown that the currently used
      formula to calculate the predicted AH (Bayley Pineau's method) is not applicable to children
      with CAH.

      In this project, the investigators plan to use the prediction model to compare the AH in
      patients who have received GH treatment to their predicted AH using the model.

      The hypothesis is that GH improves the AH in such patients. Existing cohorts have shown
      improved growth celerity, and growth expectation using the Bayley-Pineau formula), but this
      has not been shown on the actual AH.

      This study will allow to reinforce the investigators' hypothesis.
