      In order to make better use of clinical resources of the real world, strengthen the
      standardization of PLC diagnosis and treatment, and constantly improve the academic level of
      liver cancer in China, we intends to launch &quot;Chinese Liver Cancer clinical Survey&quot; project in
      cancer specialized hospitals and large general hospitals and to explore the best clinical
      pathway of PLC multidisciplinary consultation.

    <textblock>
      Primary liver cancer (PLC) is one of the most common malignant tumors of digestive system and
      also a serious threat to the health and safety of Chinese people, and has caused serious
      economic burden to the country. Research purposes: To understand the clinical characteristics
      of patients with primary liver cancer (PLC) in China; To investigate the etiology and
      pathogenesis of PLC in China; To understand the current status of clinical treatment of PLC
      in China, and to analyze the gaps among these conditions and domestic treatment guidelines,
      industry consensus, the international treatment guidelines; To understand the different
      treatment options and its clinical outcomes, and to explore the best treatment options; To
      explore the best clinical pathway of PLC multidisciplinary consultation; To provide the basis
      for the development of clinical guidelines for PLC in China.
