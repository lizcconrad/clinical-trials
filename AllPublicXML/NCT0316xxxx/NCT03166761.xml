      sacroiliac joint injections

    <textblock>
      Patients eligible for a sacroiliac joint injection will be randomized to receive one of two
      different steroids, dexamethasone or triamcinolone. The response immediately after injection
      will be assessed to confirm the diagnosis, and then they will be followed for three month to
      assess the degree of pain relief experienced
