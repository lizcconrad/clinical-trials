    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well an educational module and decision counseling
      program works in increasing mammography screening rates in formerly homeless women with
      serious mental illness. An educational module and decision counseling program may be an
      effective tool and have the potential to help with early detection and treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Increase mammography screening rates in women age 40 and over with experiences of
      homelessness and serious mental illness (SMI).

      II. Increase knowledge, decease psychological distress, and advance decision stage and
      intention to get a mammogram in study participants.

    <description>Will estimate the mean pre/post change, along with a 95% confidence interval, and will test this change via a paired t-test. Will use linear regression to assess what factors (including socio-demographics and decision counseling score) are associated with the change.</description>
