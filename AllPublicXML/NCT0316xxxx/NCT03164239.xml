  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this regional parallel-group RCT was to assess the effect of a six-month
      tailored telephone and email based physical activity intervention on various measures of
      physical fitness and body composition in a sample of physically inactive adults. A total of
      111 physically inactive adults (40-55yr) from Agder, Norway were randomly allocated to either
      an intervention group (IG;n=56) or a no-intervention control group (CG;n=55). The IG received
      tailored exercise recommendations, every two months by email or mail (print) in addition to
      motivational follow-ups every second week, alternatively by email and telephone. Primary
      outcome measures were various objective measures of musculoskeletal and cardiorespiratory
      fitness in addition to various measures of body composition, including waist circumference,
      body mass index and fat percentage, which were assessed pre- and post-intervention.
