  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to conduct research on individuals with lower limb
      amputation, evaluating if residual limb fluid volume data collected using a novel
      non-invasive device is beneficial towards prosthetic prescription, fit, and comfort as
      determined by amputee test subjects and practitioners (prosthetists). Participants' residual
      limb fluid volume will be monitored through bioimpedance analysis both before and after a
      practitioner-issued modification to the prosthesis as an observational cohort study and then
      as a blinded randomized control trial in which the data may or may not be shared with the
      practitioner before the modification is made to the prosthesis.
