  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare two different approaches for treating patients
      with shoulder impingement: electric dry needling and spinal manipulation versus
      impairment-based manual therapy, exercise electro-thermal modalities. Physical therapists
      commonly use all of these techniques to treat shoulder impingement. This study is attempting
      to find out if one treatment strategy is more effective than the other.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with shoulder impingement will be randomized to receive 2 treatment sessions per
      week for up to 6 weeks (up to 12 sessions total) of either: (1) electric dry needling and
      spinal manipulation or (2) impairment-based manual therapy, exercise and electrothermal
      modalities.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult over the age of 18 years old that is able to read, write and speak English

          2. Primary complaint of anterolateral shoulder pain lasting longer than 6 weeks secondary
             to shoulder impingement. (Shoulder Impingement is defined as a spectrum of alterations
             of the subacromial space and may affect the supraspinatus tendon, subacromial bursa,
             tendon of the long head of the biceps, and shoulder capsule (isolated or combined.)

          3. Diagnosis of shoulder impingement, as indicated by ONE or more of the following
             special tests:

               1. Positive Neer Impingement test—i.e. pain with passive overpressure at full
                  shoulder flexion with the scapula stabilized.

               2. Positive Hawkins-Kennedy test—i.e. pain with passive internal rotation at 90° of
                  shoulder and elbow flexion

          4. Pain with ONE or more of the following active movements and resisted isometric tests

               1. Pain with active shoulder elevation

               2. Pain with resisted shoulder external rotation at 90 deg of abduction

               3. Pain with resisted shoulder abduction in Empty Can Test positon - i.e. 90 deg of
                  shoulder abduction, 30 deg of horizontal adduction (i.e. in scapular plane) and
                  full internal rotation (i.e. thumb down)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Report of red flags to manual physical therapy to include: severe hypertension,
             infection, uncontrolled diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, heart disease, stroke,
             chronic ischemia, edema, severe varicosities, tumor, metabolic disease, prolonged
             steroid use, fracture, RA, osteoporosis, severe vascular disease, malignancy, etc.

          2. History of shoulder injection within the past 3 months.

          3. History of shoulder dislocation, subluxation, fracture, adhesive capsulitis, or
             cervical, thoracic or shoulder surgery.

          4. Isolated acromioclavicular joint pathology (i.e. the only location of symptoms is
             localized specifically with one finger directly over the acromioclavicular joint and
             nowhere else, and reproduced only with acromioclavicular palpation by the examiner.)

          5. Evidence of cervical radiculopathy, radiculitis or referred pain from the c-spine

          6. Full-thickness rotator cuff tears (evidenced by MRI and/or positive lag signs)

          7. Baseline SPADI of not less than 20%

          8. History of breast cancer on involved side.

          9. Prior treatments (eg. Acupuncture, physical therapy, chiropractic, dry needling,
             massage therapy, injections) to the involved limb over past 3 months.

         10. Pending litigation for an injury.

         11. Psychiatric disorders or cognitively impaired

         12. Pregnancy
