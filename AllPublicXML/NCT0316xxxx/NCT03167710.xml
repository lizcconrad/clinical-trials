  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare two different approaches for treating patients
      with lateral epicondylalgia: electric dry needling, thrust manipulation and stretching versus
      impairment-based manual therapy, exercise and ultrasound. Physical therapists commonly use
      all of these techniques to treat lateral epicondyalgia. This study is attempting to find out
      if one treatment strategy is more effective than the other.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with epicondyalgia will be randomized to receive 2 treatment sessions per week for 4
      weeks (up to 8 sessions total) of either: (1) electric dry needling, thrust manipulation and
      stretching or (2) impairment-based manual therapy, exercise and ultrasound
