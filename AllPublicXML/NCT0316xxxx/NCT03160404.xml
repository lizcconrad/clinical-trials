      Introduction: The prevalence of chronic insomnia in the general population is 10 to 15%. The
      therapy commonly prescribed for its treatment is pharmacological, however, there are several
      non-pharmacological therapies being studied, among them physical exercise. Although some
      studies have described the effect of exercise on the promotion of sleep in insomnia, no
      studies comparing exercise and drugs in the treatment of insomnia, or its effect as
      coadjuvant therapy, have been performed.

      Objective: To compare the effects of regular aerobic exercise (12 weeks) with pharmacological
      therapy (zolpidem, 10mg / night) or combined therapy (exercise + pharmacological therapy) on
      sleep quality, mood and quality of life of patients with chronic insomnia.

      Material and Methods: 45 patients with chronic insomnia will be randomly assigned to three
      groups: aerobic exercise (GEA), pharmacological therapy (GTF) and combined therapy (GTC). The
      GEA group will participate in an aerobic exercise program for 12 weeks, performed in
      intensity relative to 50% of reserve heart rate, on a treadmill. The GTF group will be
      treated with zolpidem 10mg / night and the GTC will be treated with zolpidem 10mg / night and
      will participate in the aerobic exercise program. For sleep evaluation will be used the
      polysomnography, actigraphy, sleep diary and questionnaires. Mood and quality of life will be
      investigated through questionnaires.

      Hypothesis: Considering previous studies have demonstrated positive effects of aerobic
      exercise in the insomnia symptoms, the hypothesis of this study is aerobic exercise,
      performed at moderate intensity, can control the symptoms of chronic insomnia similar to
      pharmacological therapy, and when combined with it, can accentuate its effects, also
      contributing to improvements in patients' mood and quality of life.
