  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled 3-month trial was conducted with two post-treatment assessments of 86
      breast cancer survivors receiving Aromatase Inhibitors therapy assigned to either 12 weeks of
      90-minute three times per week Baduanjin exercise classes or a wait-list control.
      Participants completed fitness assessments, measurements of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated
      production of proinﬂammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF-α), interleukin-1β(IL-1β) ,C-reactive protein (CRP) ，BMI，BMD and questionnaires to
      measure QoL, fatigue, sleep quality, Aromatase Inhibitor-Induced Arthralgia, symptoms of
      climacteric syndrome were completed at baseline and 3 months.
