    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to estimate the effect of the neuromodulation on the
      behavioral performances during the access in semantics according to the age of the
      individuals.

      Neuromodulation by non-invasive stimulation allows to explore the functioning of the brain by
      exciting or by inhibiting localized cortical zones. The modulation of the performances in
      cognitive tasks, further to the neuromodulation of these zones, allows to deduce on their
      functional roles.

      The objective of this project is to determine the changes of behavioral performances (time of
      answer, percentage of correct answers) further to the neuromodulation. The specific question
      is to estimate the effect on the performances of access at the semantic representations of
      this method, according to the age. One of the hypotheses in the research on the normal ageing
      is the difficulty of access to these representations (fundamental process for the cognitive
      functions, such as the language and the memory) at the healthy elderly. By using the
      neuromodulation the investigators wish to explore this hypothesis and to understand if the
      neuromodulation can have a beneficial effect on the improvement of the behavioral
      performances of the elderly.

    <description>The investigators extract estimates parameters (Estimated Beta weight Values) corresponding to each tES stimulation. Each session is be designed by using general linear model (Friston, 1998, statistical parametrical mapping in fMRI) defined as Ybefore tES = R1Beta1+R2Beta2 +R0Beta0 + e and Yafter tES = R1Beta1 +R2Beta2 +R0Beta0 + e, with Y = acquired BOLD signal, e = error, R1Beta1 corresponding to the task (meaning interest activation) regressor and R2Beta2 corresponding to the control (meaning no interest activation) regressor respectively convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function (cHRf) and R0B0 corresponding to the constant regressor. Parameter estimates are calculated by extracting Beta1 and Beta2 values for each session respectively in order to compute statistical comparison (measure by subject) on the outcome measure (Beta1 before tES - Beta1 after tES).</description>
