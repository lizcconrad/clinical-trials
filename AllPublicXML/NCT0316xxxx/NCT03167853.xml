    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, phase Ib study evaluating safety and efficacy of the
      humanized anti-PD-1 antibody JS001, as a monotherapy in patients with neuroendocrine tumors
      who have failed in previous systemic treatment. 40 patients are enrolled and injected with
      the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody 3mg/mg every 2 weeks until disease progresses or
      unacceptable toxicity.
