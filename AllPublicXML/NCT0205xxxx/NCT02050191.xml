    <textblock>
      This study supports the development of a diabetes prevention and control community web
      portal. The portal will feature an innovative personalized impediment profiling tool and
      reward program. The program, &quot;Nutrition Navigation on-Line Edge,&quot; or NnoLEDGE, will be used
      by community consortiums for weight loss and diabetic health interventions within their
      communities.

      The Specific Aims are:

        1. Recruitment of local community organizations to participate as a community health
           consortium

        2. Development of a comprehensive community health web portal consisting of a web portal,
           impediment profiler, community toolbox, and rewards system

        3. Final evaluation of the system with regard to participants' attitudes and perceptions of
           using NnoLEDGE as a tool for weight control and diabetes prevention to determine
           feasibility.
