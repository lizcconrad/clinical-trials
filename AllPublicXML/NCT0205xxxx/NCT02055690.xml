    <textblock>
      The first part of this study is to find the recommended dosages of a combination of two
      drugs: pazopanib and fosbretabulin, which will be given to female patients with relapsed
      ovarian cancer.

      The second part of the study involves comparing the recommended dose of pazopanib and
      fosbretabulin in combination against pazopanib alone in female patients with relapsed ovarian
      cancer to determine whether the combination is more beneficial that pazopanib on it's own.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is the fourth biggest contributor to female cancer mortality, accounting for
      4% of all malignancies diagnosed in women. In the United Kingdom (UK), there are seven
      thousand new cases of ovarian cancer annually and four thousand two hundred deaths from the
      disease. The standard treatment approach currently consists of surgical debulking and
      chemotherapy, usually based around a combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel. Most ovarian
      cancers are initially chemo-responsive however the majority of patients whose disease
      initially responds subsequently develop recurrent disease.

      Once patients recur, treatment options become less numerous and less effective. Progression
      free survival rates for platinum-sensitive disease are only about 13 months and the outlook
      for patients with platinum-resistant disease is much worse.

      This study is exploring a new combination of drugs fosbretabulin, a vascular disrupting agent
      and pazopanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. There is scientific rational for combining these
      two types of drugs as they should be able to work in combination through contrasting
      mechanisms of action.

      The first part of the study is a dose finding exercise with cohorts of patients being given
      drugs with in combination until the recommended dose of both drugs is found. Patients in each
      cohort will be monitored closely for safety and drug toxicity.

      The second part of the study has a randomised component where patients will receive the
      combination of drugs or pazopanib alone with the aim to determine whether there is an
      advantage in progression free survival for patients that receive pazopanib and fosbretabulin.
      This will be monitored by RECIST.
