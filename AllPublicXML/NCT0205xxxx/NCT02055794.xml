      The goal of this research is to investigate three different methods of perineal skin closure
      during second-degree perineal wound repair and determine which method is associated with the
      least amount of patient pain.

      Null hypothesis: There will be no difference in patient pain among the three different
      methods for second degree perineal wound repair.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the University of Michigan, there are currently two standard techniques for repairing
      second-degree perineal lacerations that differ only in management of the perineal skin :

        1. Closure of the deep tissues and superficial perineal skin using a continuous 3-0 Vicryl
           suture

        2. Closure of the deep tissues with a continuous 3-0 Vicryl suture and reapproximation of,
           but not suture-closure of the perineal skin.

      The primary goal of our study is to compare patient pain amongst the following three perineal
      skin repair techniques after second degree laceration:

        1. Perineal skin closure with suturing

        2. Not suturing the perineal skin

        3. Closure of the perineal skin with n-Butyl 2-cyanoacrylate (Indermil®) surgical glue.

      In all women, the deep vaginal and perineal tissues will be closed using a continuous 3-0
      Vicryl suture, as is current standard practice.

      Aim: To assess and compare patient pain among the three groups at intervals of 1 day, 2
      weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months postpartum.

    <description>The 2 week and 3 month measurements will be done via email, web or mailed questionnaire. Pain will be measured using 3 pain scales: a validated 100-mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (anchors: 0 = none, 100 mm = worst imaginable), a 6 point Likert scale and the McGill pain questionnaire short form.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wound assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks post-partum</time_frame>
    <description>Wounds will be assessed through wound evaluation (6 weeks post-partum), wound complications (wound infection, dehiscence, granulation tissue), need for additional interventions (silver nitrate, revision of wound) and assessment of wound appearance using a validated 100-mm VAS (anchors: 0 = worst scar, 100 mm = best scar).</description>
