      The Investigation will be conducted as a single-submission, multi-center study with approval
      from and in compliance of the Western Institutional Review Board (WIRB).

      The overall objective of this Investigation is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the
      Robotic Arm Interactive Orthopedic System (RIO) Total Knee Arthroplasty Application.
      Specifically, the study objectives are classified as follows:

        -  Primary Objective: Surgeon assessment of standardized TKA complications both
           intra-operatively and at short term follow up.

        -  Secondary Objective: Radiographic assessment of post-operative limb alignment.

        -  Supporting Objective: Patient assessment of post-operative function and satisfaction.

    <measure>Change in the Radiographic Assessment of Limb Alignment From Pre-Operative to 3 Months Post-Operative</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-op plan, 3 Month Post Op</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographic limb alignment of the operative knee according to the technique defined by Barrack et al. was assessed at the 3 month post-operative follow-up by two independent reviewers. The measured post-operative limb alignment was to be compared to the planned pre-operative limb alignment as extracted from the system log file.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-op Plan, 3 Month Post Op</time_frame>
    <description>The difference between the actual 3 month limb alignment was compared to the pre-op planned alignment. Any measurement difference &lt;4.38 was considered a success; &gt;4.38 degrees was considered a failure.</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction - Western Ontario &amp; McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Op, 3 Month Post Op [change assessed between the two time periods]</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC collects information specific to osteoarthritis outcomes. The patient-response questionnaire uses a visual analog scale for pain, measuring factors of general pain, stiffness, and function. Each question is scored from 0 to 4 for each set of factors, with 0 indicating no pain, stiffness, or limit in function, and 4 indicating extreme pain, stiffness, or limit in function. Total WOMAC scores range from 0 to 96 with lower values representing better outcomes.
The posted mean, noted as a negative number, represents the mean DECREASE in total WOMAC score from pre-operative to 3 month post-operative patient assessment.</description>

             tibial epiphyses.

          -  Subjects who are able to give voluntary, written informed consent to participate in
             this investigation and from whom consent has been obtained.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigators and Approved Study Staff, are able
             to understand this Investigation and cooperate with the Investigation procedures and
             are willing to comply with all the required post-operative follow-ups.

             osteoarthritis, post-traumatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, moderate deformities
             or femoral condyle osteonecrosis as defined below.

          -  Osteoarthritis: Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 3 or higher, with clinical history of an
             absence of major trauma to the joint; symptoms of pain, stiffness, swelling, and/or
             loss of motion; and with radiographic evidence of joint space narrowing, sub-chondral
             sclerosis, or peripheral osteophytes.

          -  Post-Traumatic Arthritis: Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 3 or higher, with a clinical history
             of trauma to the targeted knee and subsequent pain, stiffness, swelling and loss of
             motion; and with radiographic evidence of joint space narrowing, sub-chondral
             sclerosis, or peripheral osteophytes.

          -  Rheumatoid Arthritis: American College of Rheumatology classification score of 6 or
             higher, with a clinical history that demonstrates the following: morning stiffness for
             at least 1 hour and present for at least 6 weeks, swelling, loss of motion, and/or
             serum rheumatoid factor; and radiographic findings of narrow joint space,
             peri-articular osteopenia, and/or per-articular erosions.

        <description>The WOMAC collects information specific to osteoarthritis outcomes. The patient-response questionnaire uses a visual analog scale for pain, measuring factors of general pain, stiffness, and function. Each question is scored from 0 to 4 for each set of factors, with 0 indicating no pain, stiffness, or limit in function, and 4 indicating extreme pain, stiffness, or limit in function. Total WOMAC scores range from 0 to 96 with lower values representing better outcomes.
The posted mean, noted as a negative number, represents the mean DECREASE in total WOMAC score from pre-operative to 3 month post-operative patient assessment.</description>

Note regarding serious AEs:
Adhesions and arthrofibrosis are surgical complications that can result from knee surgery and present as stiffness and restriction of ROM. Reasons for stiffness and restriction of ROM after TKA are multifactorial and may be influenced by factors such as the patient’s overall health, motivation, and compliance to their rehabilitation regimen. The Principal Investigator and study Investigators stated these adverse events are not related to the use of the Investigational Device.</description>
