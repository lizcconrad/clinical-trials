    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study to characterise the lung function, airway morphometry, pharyngometry
      and inhalation profiles in patients with mild to severe Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)
      over a period of up to 6 months. Inhalation profiles will be recorded from patients with IPF
      as they inhale during tidal breathing, and following two sets of instructions (maximal effort
      and 'long, steady and deep' inhalation), across a range of airflow resistances that reflect
      those of typical inhalers used to deliver medication to the lungs. Mouth and throat
      dimensions will be measured using an acoustic reflectance Pharyngometer. Measurements of lung
      function will be made using conventional sprirometry, plethysmography and diffusion, whilst
      Low Dose High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) will be used to scan the airways at two
      lung volumes; functional residual capacity (FRC) and total lung capacity (TLC). Data from
      HRCT will be used to reconstruct airway morphometry, and model inhaled particle deposition
      within the lung. Overall, the study allows a further understanding of the IPF patient
      population, using the data to assist in the development of new inhaled products for this
      disease. Following up the patients with additional HRCT scans at 3 and 6 months will enable
      the sensitivity of CT based criteria of disease progression to be compared with lung function
      criteria. No investigational product will be used in this study.
