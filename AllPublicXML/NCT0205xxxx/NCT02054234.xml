      Epidemiological, prospective, open, multicentric trial in patients suffering from acute
      conjunctivitis who will undergo a rapid diagnostic test for adenoviral conjunctivitis at the
      time of their visit to the ophthalmologist office, at the emergency room or during
      hospitalization. This epidemiological study will include approximately 500 patients in
      France. The planned duration of the study is one year from the first patient visit to the
      last patient visit.
