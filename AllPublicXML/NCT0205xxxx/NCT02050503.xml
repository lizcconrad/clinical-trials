  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, non-randomized study to assess the titration, safety and efficacy of
      intranasal fentanyl pectin nasal spray for the treatment of secondary breakthrough pain
      secondary to radiation-induced mucositis in patients with confirmed tolerance of opioid
      therapy for chronic pain.

      Study objectives include assessment of breakthrough pain episodes related with food intake in
      patients with mucositis secondary to radiotherapy or radio-chemotherapy for head and neck
      tumors

      An open, non-randomized study design was used to assess the titration, safety and efficacy of
      intranasal fentanyl in pectin for the treatment of secondary breakthrough pain in patients
      with confirmed tolerance of opioid therapy for chronic pain secondary to radiation-induced
      mucositis. The study plans to include 30 evaluable patients from multiple centers throughout
      the country. The trial comprises a screening period, an open titration period, and an
      open-label treatment period in which at least 12 breakthrough pain episodes are to be
      treated.
