    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a highly prevalent condition and costly national public health problem and a
      transdiagnostic risk factor for the development of a number of internalizing/emotional
      disorders, as well as associated functional impairment. Interestingly, sleep treatments
      appear to reduce anxiety and depression in addition to improving sleep. Given the substantial
      individual and societal costs of insomnia and associated mental illness, there is an urgent
      need to better understand the mechanism through which sleep treatments improve daytime
      symptoms of depression and anxiety in order to enhance the efficacy of sleep treatments and
      ultimately prevent the development of depression and anxiety disorders following the onset of
      insomnia. Research suggests that sleep disruptions lead to emotional dysregulation, including
      increased negative affectivity and decreased positive affectivity. This affective reactivity
      may ultimately be related to the development of depression and anxiety. Despite the apparent
      link between sleep and emotion regulation, studies have not investigated the influence of
      sleep treatment on these affective dimensions. The investigators long term goal is to
      increase understanding of the mechanism of action in sleep treatments in relation to changes
      in positive and negative valence systems. The investigators immediate objective is to conduct
      a pilot study investigating changes in mean levels and day-to-day instability of affective
      dimensions following a brief behavioral intervention for insomnia tailored for veterans
      (Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia-Military Version. The specific aims include
      developing a deeper understanding of the effects of behavioral sleep treatment on positive
      and negative valence systems and testing a model in which affective reactivity modulates the
      relation between sleep and internalizing symptoms. Both objective and subjective sleep data,
      as well as measures of affective states and depression/anxiety symptoms, will be collected
      pre and post-treatment in order to examine changes in sleep, affect and daytime symptoms over
      the course of treatment and to test a model in which affective changes mediate the relation
      between improvements in sleep and improvements in depression and anxiety. The investigators
      hypothesize that sleep treatment will improve sleep, daytime symptoms and affective
      reactivity and that changes in affect will mediate the relation between sleep and
      internalizing symptoms.
