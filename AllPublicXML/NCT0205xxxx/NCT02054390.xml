  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome (MS) has been reported as a risk for cardiovascular events. The aim of the
      present cohort study is to investigate whether ACEi therapy reduces the rate of
      periprocedural myocardial injury (PPMI) after elective percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI) among patients with metabolic syndrome.

        Metabolic syndorme (MS) was defined as the presence of 3 or more of these components:

          1. high fasting glucose (fasting serum glucose ≥100 mg/dl or drug treatment for elevated
             blood glucose)

          2. abdominal obesity (given as waist circumference &gt;102 cm in men and &gt;88 cm in women)

          3. high blood pressure (&gt;130/&gt;85 mmHg or drug treatment for hypertension)

          4. hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglycerides ≥150 mg/dl)

          5. low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (&lt;40 mg/dl in men and &lt;50 mg/dl in
