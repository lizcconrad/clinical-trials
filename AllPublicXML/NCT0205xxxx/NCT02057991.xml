      This randomized pilot trial studies mindfulness-based program in educating patients with
      colorectal cancer and their caregivers. A mindfulness-based exercise video may help reduce
      stress and fatigue in patients with colorectal cancer and their caregivers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of a brief educational program on colorectal cancer knowledge
      acquisition in a 3-arm randomized clinical trial (Control Group: standard of care; Treatment
      Group 1: cancer education; Treatment Group 2: mindfulness + cancer education) comparing
      visual/written educational material with and without mindfulness training to the standard of
      care.

      II. To determine the priming effect of a brief mindfulness training on retaining knowledge of
      colorectal cancer education.

      III. To determine the joint effect of colorectal cancer education delivered to both the
      patient and a caregiver on the overall colorectal cancer knowledge.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the relative changes in psychobiological variables (stress, anxiety,
      depression, mindfulness, fatigue, life benefit) from pre (T0) to post (T1) intervention in
      the 3 arms of the clinical trials.

      II. To measure changes in salivary cortisol levels as an indicator of acute stress reactivity
      across 4 time points across a one-hour period (i.e., 0 min, 20 min, 40 min, 60 min) during
      active chemotherapy (T1).

      III. To determine the moderating effect of baseline peripheral levels of inflammation
      (interleukin-1 [IL-1], IL-6, c-reactive protein [CRP] and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFa])
      on the trajectory of salivary cortisol reactivity.

      OUTLINE: Patients and caregivers are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients and caregivers receive standard of care.

      GROUP II: Patients and caregivers receive a 20-minute self-playing interactive educational
      video brochure.

      GROUP III: Patients and caregivers receive a 20-minute self-playing interactive educational
      video brochure and watch a 20-minute interactive mindfulness exercise video.

    <time_frame>Baseline to up 60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Cortisol slopes will be calculated with two distinct areas under the curve analyses using the trapezoid formula as outlined by Pruessner 2003. Data values will be entered into a two factor (group by time) multilevel MIXED linear regression model to calculate differences between the three groups. A Scheffe post hoc test will be employed to determine the direction of the differences between the groups.</description>
