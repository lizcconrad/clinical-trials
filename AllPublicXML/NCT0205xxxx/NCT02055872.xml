  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients usually require intravenous fluids to correct low blood pressure and
      improve blood flow to vital organs. However, once the patient's blood pressure has improved,
      these fluids can leak out into various organs, including the lung, kidneys, and skin. Excess
      fluid in these tissues, called edema, has been associated with longer ICU stays and higher
      mortality. Thus removing excess fluid is an important goal. The simplest way to treat edema
      is to use diuretics, such as furosemide, which increase urine output.

      To further improve urine output, patients are sometimes given albumin, a protein which helps
      to suck fluid out from the tissues, and keep it in the blood vessel, where it can be filtered
      in the kidney and removed in the urine. Although albumin is often used for this purpose,
      there is little evidence to support it. A large randomized controlled trial is needed to
      determine if albumin plus furosemide is truly more effective than furosemide alone in
      critically ill patients with low levels of blood albumin. We will perform a pilot study to
      assess the feasibility of such a trial.
