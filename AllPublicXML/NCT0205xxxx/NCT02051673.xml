        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must be between the ages of 18 and 65 years and meet the institution's
             criteria for renal transplantation for end-organ failure

          -  Patient is receiving first renal transplant

          -  Patient is receiving a renal transplant only

          -  The crossmatch is negative between donor and recipient

          -  Women who are of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (urine
             test is acceptable) within 48 hours of initiating total body irradiation (TBI) and
             agree to use reliable contraception for 1 year following transplant

          -  Potential donors who are women of child bearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test (urine test is acceptable) within 48 hours prior to receiving
             Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)

          -  No evidence of donor-specific antibody presently or historically

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically active bacterial, fungal, viral or parasitic infection

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Clinical or serologic evidence of viral infection which would preclude the recipient
             from receiving a kidney transplant

          -  Previous radiation therapy at a dose which would preclude TBI

          -  Positive crossmatch between donor and recipient

          -  Evidence for immunologic memory against donor

          -  BMI &gt;35 or &lt;18

          -  Re-transplant

          -  Positive serologies for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV
