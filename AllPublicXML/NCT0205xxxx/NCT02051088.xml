  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) causes reduced blood flow to the lower limb(s) due to
      stenosis or occlusion in the supplying arteries. Symptoms of PAD range from ischemic rest
      pain and/or ischemic ulcers/gangrene (critical limb ischemia), putting the extremity at risk
      of amputation, to exercise-induced pain (intermittent claudication), limiting the patients
      daily activities. Invasive treatments are often indicated to prevent amputations and to
      alleviate symptoms. More than two thirds of these procedures are presently performed with
      endovascular techniques (i.e. percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, PTA with or without
      stent implantation).

      In coronary artery disease, stents eluting anti-proliferative drugs (drug eluting stents,
      DES) reduce restenosis and improve clinical results for the majority of patients. Drug
      eluting balloons (DEB) are a promising alternative, but there is still little evidence that
      DES or DEB technology improve clinical outcome in PAD. However, promising results utilizing
      these new technologies in PAD have been reported in a few studies.

      In this trial, we test the hypothesis that drug eluting (DE) technology is superior to
      conventional endovascular treatment (no-DE) in terms of important clinical outcomes, when
      applied on infrainguinal (femoropopliteal and/or infrapopliteal) obstructive vascular
      lesions. The trial consists of 2 separate parallel studies, SWEDEPAD 1 and SWEDEPAD 2, each
      defined by the severity of peripheral arterial disease. Patients with critical limb ischemia
      are allocated to SWEDEPAD 1 and patients with intermittent claudication are allocated to
      SWEDEPAD 2.
