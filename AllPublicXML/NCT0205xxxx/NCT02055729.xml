  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to characterize the evolution (over a period of 28 days)
      of superficial and deep bacterial skin flora in patients with stage 3 or 4 sacral pressure
      ulcers (bedsores). Changes in terms of pathogenic, potentially pathogenic and non-pathogenic
      bacterial species at the intra-individual and population levels.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      A. To compare bacterial communities collected from superficial versus deep samples of stage 3
      or 4 sacral bedsores using metagenomics and standard culturing methods.

      B. To characterize the evolution of digestive bacterial flora in the same patients over a
      period of 28 days. Changes in terms of pathogenic, potentially pathogenic and non-pathogenic
      will be described, as well as the appearance of resistance phenotypes.

      C. To characterize the evolution of urinary bacterial flora in the same patients over a
      period of 28 days. Changes in terms of pathogenic, potentially pathogenic and non-pathogenic
      will be described, as well as the appearance of resistance phenotypes.

    <description>The proposed study is a prospective, single-center pilot study lasting 28 days. Our goal is to study the temporal evolution of the bacterial communities present in the skin and digestive flora (stool) of spinal cord injured persons having one or more sacral bedsores. The study timespan can include treatment initiation, notably of antibiotics. Urinalysis for studying urinary flora will simultaneously occur.
For a description of the study population, see the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

             bactericidal or antibiotic elements

          -  The patient is in an exclusion period determined by a previous study

          -  The patient is under judicial protection, under tutorship or curatorship

          -  The patient refuses to sign the consent

          -  It is impossible to correctly inform the patient

          -  The patient is pregnant, parturient, or breastfeeding

          -  The patient is already included in the present study

          -  The patient has sacral pressure ulcers of only stages 1 or 2, or does not have a
             sacral pressure ulcer

          -  Patient under curative anticoagulation

          -  Patient who received antibiotics within 14 days before inclusion (however, after
