  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth (PTB) is associated with over one million infant deaths annually worldwide. The
      incidence of PTB in the United States is 11.5% with more than 500,000 deliveries occurring at
      less than 37 weeks gestation annually. The rate of PTB in the United States increased to
      12.8% in 2006, and remains high compared to almost all other developed countries, despite the
      introduction of many public health and medical interventions designed to delay PTB. Weekly
      treatment with 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate beginning at 16-20 weeks gestation has
      been shown to significantly reduce the risk of PTB and is currently recommended for women who
      experienced spontaneous PTB in a prior pregnancy. However, a strategy for the prevention of
      spontaneous PTBs in which therapeutic intervention is restricted to women with a previous PTB
      is likely to have a small effect on the overall rate of prematurity since only about 10% of
      spontaneous PTBs arise in women with such a history. A major reduction in rates of mortality
      and morbidity in premature babies will only be achieved with increased precision in the
      identification of women at risk of spontaneous PTB and through the development of an
      effective prevention for this complication. Transvaginal ultrasound measurement of cervical
      length is a reliable screening test for prediction of PTB. Although treatment with vaginal
      progesterone is effective in decreasing PTB in women with a short cervix, over 30% of women
      still experience premature delivery and many women find daily administration of progesterone
      to be challenging. Preliminary studies have suggested that use of an intravaginal pessary may
      be effective in preventing PTB. If effective this approach would be particularly appealing
      because of the wide availability of pessaries, ease of use, and low cost. Unfortunately,
      existing studies are inadequate to confirm effectiveness; a well designed, properly powered,
      prospective randomized trial is warranted prior to widespread implementation in clinical
      practice. We propose such a trial to study the effectiveness of the pessary in decreasing the
      incidence of PTB in an inner city Philadelphia population.
