      This pilot clinical trial studies fluorine F 18 fluorothymidine (FLT)-positron emission
      tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) in measuring early response in patients with
      metastatic solid tumors receiving treatment that blocks blood flow to the tumor. Diagnostic
      procedures, such as FLT-PET/MRI, may help measure a patient's response earlier during
      treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      The primary objective of this pilot imaging study is to determine the feasibility of
      FLTPET/MR imaging for early prediction of treatment response in patients undergoing
      antiangiogenic cancer treatment. The study will assess PET/MRI test-retest reproducibility
      and compare baseline PET/MRI with PET/MRI after initiation (within 2-4 weeks) of
      antiangiogenic therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To compare early changes in PET biomarker (FLT) tumor uptake with treatment response
           assessed at completion of therapy (prediction of treatment response).

        -  To compare changes in MRI signal intensities (multi-parametric MRI) with treatment
           response assessed at completion of therapy.

        -  To compare results from multi-parametric MR imaging with FLT tumor uptake.

        -  To assess combinations of quantitative PET and MRI metrics.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo FLT-PET/MRI twice at baseline and once within 4 weeks after start of
      treatment.
