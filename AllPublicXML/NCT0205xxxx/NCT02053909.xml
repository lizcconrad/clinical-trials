  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Saphenous vein graft disease remains an unresolved medical problem. Many vein grafts occlude
      in the first year after bypass surgery, leading to adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including
      recurrent angina, myocardial infarction, and the need for repeat coronary intervention. While
      aspirin is the standard antiplatelet treatment after CABG surgery, 10-20% of vein grafts
      continue to occlude despite contemporary secondary preventative therapy. Compared to aspirin
      and other antiplatelet therapies like clopidogrel, ticagrelor treatment leads to a more
      pronounced platelet inhibition, and may substantially improve graft patency following CABG
      compared to aspirin. No data has yet to be collected regarding the impact of ticagrelor on
      saphenous vein graft patency following CABG. In this context, the investigators seek to
      compare vein graft patency between patients randomized to receive aspirin therapy, the
      current standard of care, or ticagrelor treatment, starting in the early postoperative
      period, and continuing for 2 years after CABG.

      This clinical trial will be a randomized double-blind study focusing on ticagrelor
      antiplatelet therapy as a means of improving vein graft patency after CABG. Patients will be
      eligible if they have received at least 1 vein bypass graft at time of surgery. Patients will
      be randomized to receive either aspirin 81 mg bid or ticagrelor 90 mg bid. The aspirin and
      ticagrelor medications will be prepared in blinded capsules. Patients recovering from surgery
      will be eligible for study randomization within the first 5 postoperative days. Treatment
      will continue for 1 year, at which time patients will undergo a CT coronary angiogram to
      assess graft patency. Patients will then be invited to continue participating in the trial
      for 1 more year, and a repeat CT coronary angiogram will be performed at the 2 year
      postoperative time-point.
