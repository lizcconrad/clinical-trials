  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are examining the effects of exercise and cardiovascular fitness on
      cognitive processes, brain function, and the amount of several proteins in the blood. These
      proteins include a hormone called cortisol, also known as the &quot;stress hormone,&quot; and a growth
      factor called &quot;brain-derived neurotrophic factor&quot; (BDNF). The &quot;stress hormone&quot; cortisol is
      produced by the adrenal glands. Stress, exercise, obesity, and other factors may influence
      cortisol levels. BDNF is a protein that promotes the health of nerve cells in the brain and
      in the body. It plays a role in the growth, maturation, and maintenance of these cells. The
      amount of this protein in blood samples is therefore an indicator of healthy nerve cell
      function. Here, the investigators are investigating if exercise improves brain function by
      changing BDNF levels. Participation in this research study will take approximately 4 months.
      During this time, participants will make four initial study visits. The first visit is for
      informed consent and screening, the second and third visits are for baseline fitness testing,
      and the fourth visit is for a blood draw, cognitive testing, and a functional Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (fMRI) exam. Functional MRI is a brain imaging technique that uses a
      magnetic field to &quot;take pictures&quot; of the brain while a person performs a given task. It will
      take up to approximately three weeks to complete these initial four study visits. Following
      the four initial study visits, the exercise-training program will begin. Participants will be
      randomized to one of two training programs: an aerobic exercise program and a non-aerobic
      exercise program consisting of strengthening, balance and stretching exercises. The exercise
      training program will last 12 weeks. There will be three one-hour exercise sessions per week.
      After completion of the exercise-training program, participants will attend three follow-up
      study visits. The first two follow-up visits are for fitness testing. The third and final
      follow-up visit is for a blood draw, cognitive testing, and an MRI exam.
