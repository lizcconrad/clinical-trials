    <textblock>
      The antihypertensive effect of Amlodipine/Valsartan combination has been evaluated in
      worldwide populations including Asian patients. The study primarily aims to evaluate the
      effectiveness of Amlodipine/Valsartan combination in patients with essential hypertension in
      Taiwan using a prospective, open-label, non-randomized approach.

      The study also wants to investigate the safety of Amlodipine/Valsartan combination during the
      6-week treatment period.
