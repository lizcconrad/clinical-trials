        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy, adult, male or female, 18-55 years of age, inclusive, at screening.

          -  Cohort 1 only: continuous nonsmoker who has not used nicotine-containing products for
             at least 6 months prior to the first dose and confirmed by urine cotinine test at
             screening.

          -  Cohort 2 only: moderate to heavy smokers defined as &gt; 1 pack of cigarettes per day or
             &gt; 39 cigarettes per week for at least 6 months prior to the first dose and confirmed
             by urine cotinine test at screening.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 18.5 and ≤ 32.0 kg/m2 at screening.

          -  Medically healthy with no clinically significant medical history, physical
             examination, laboratory profiles, vital signs or ECGs, as deemed by the PI.

          -  For a female of non-childbearing potential:

          -  A non vasectomized, male subject must agree to use a condom with spermicide or abstain
             from sexual intercourse during the study until 90 days beyond the last dose of study
             medication. (No restrictions are required for a vasectomized male provided his
             vasectomy has been performed 4 months or more prior to study start. A male who has
             been vasectomized less than 4 months prior to study start must follow the same
             restrictions as a non vasectomized male).

          -  Understands the study procedures in the informed consent form (ICF), and be willing
             and able to comply with the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated or has significant emotional problems at
             the time of screening visit or expected during the conduct of the study.

          -  History or presence of clinically significant medical or psychiatric condition or
             disease in the opinion of the PI.

          -  History of any illness that, in the opinion of the PI, might confound the results of
             the study or poses an additional risk to the subject by their participation in the
             study.

          -  History or presence of alcoholism or drug abuse within the past 2 years prior to
             screening.

          -  History or presence of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to the study
             medication or related compounds.

          -  History of prolonged QT syndrome.

          -  Positive urine drug and alcohol results at screening or check-in.

          -  Positive results at screening for HIV, HBsAg or HCV.

          -  Seated blood pressure is less than 90/40 mmHg or greater than 140/90 mmHg at
             screening.

          -  Seated heart rate is lower than 40 bpm or higher than 99 bpm at screening.

          -  QTcF interval, is &gt;430 msec (males) or &gt;450 msec (females) or deemed clinically
             abnormal by the PI at screening or Period 1 check-in

          -  Unable to refrain from or anticipates the use of:

               -  Any drug, including prescription and non-prescription medications, herbal
                  remedies, or vitamin supplements beginning approximately 14 days prior to the
                  first dose of study medication and throughout the study.

               -  Any drugs known to be significant inducers of CYP enzymes, including St. John's
                  Wort, for 28 days prior to the first dose dosing of study medication and
                  throughout the study. Appropriate sources will be consulted by the PI or designee
                  to confirm lack of PK/pharmacodynamics interaction with study medication.

          -  Have been on a diet incompatible with the on-study diet, in the opinion of the PI,
             within the 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication(s), and throughout the
             study.

          -  Hemoglobin, platelet count or absolute neutrophils below the lower limit of normal at
             screening.

          -  Potassium or magnesium below the lower limit of normal at screening.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase above upper limit of normal at
             screening.

          -  Donation of blood or significant blood loss within 56 days prior to the first dose of
             study medication.

          -  Plasma donation within 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within 28 days prior to the first dose of
