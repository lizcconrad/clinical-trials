  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reason the investigators are doing this study is to compare the results of angiography
      versus angiography with intravascular ultrasound in dialysis grafts/fistulas that are
      blocked.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with kidney failure have a fistula or graft for long-term dialysis in order for the
      dialysis machine to draw blood, filter it, and give it back to the patient. Over time, the
      fistula or graft may not work well enough to use for dialysis, most commonly because the
      veins may develop &quot;scar tissue&quot; within and around them that narrows the vein resulting in
      poor flow or complete blockage.

      These blockages are commonly opened with wires, balloons (a procedure called angioplasty),
      and stents. These blockages are seen with angiography, a special type of x-ray used with a
      dye that shows the inside of the blood vessels. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a type of
      imaging that uses sound waves to produce an image of the inside of blood vessels and to see
      their condition. Currently, it is not known if angiography alone or angiography with IVUS has
      better results. The reason we are doing this study is to compare the results of angiography
      versus angiography with IVUS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  &gt; 18 years old

          -  Male or female (non-pregnant females)

          -  Patients with hemodialysis access failure (arteriovenous fistulae or arteriovenous
             grafts)

          -  Patients must undergo elective angiographies (fistulograms) based on surveillance
             duplex ultrasound findings (stenosis)

          -  Patients with outflow stenoses between 1 cm distal to an arterial anastamosis and
             clavicle in AV fistulae or between venous anastamosis and clavicle in AV grafts found
             on surveillance duplex ultrasound

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with other etiologies (inflow lesions, intragraft lesions, hypercoagulable
             states, lesions not readily amenable to stenting), advanced failures (thrombosis,
             central venous occlusion), and non-routine access conformations (chest wall/groin
             grafts, balloon assisted maturation)
