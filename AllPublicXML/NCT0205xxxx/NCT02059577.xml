    <textblock>
      70 children and adults with autism spectrum disorders will be enrolled in a 1-year,
      single-blind treatment study. Assessments will be conducted at the beginning and end of the
      study, including measurements of nutritional, metabolic, and digestive status and assessments
      of autism severity and overall functioning. Half of the participants will be randomized into
      a treatment study, and half will be randomized to no changes in their current treatments.
      Treatments will be added in a sequential manner over 12 months, including vitamin/minerals,
      essential fatty acids, carnitine, digestive enzymes, and healthy, gluten-free, casein-free
      diets. A dedicated team of nutritionists, nurses, and physicians will support and monitor the
      participants throughout the study.

      A group of 50 neurotypical children and adults, of similar age and gender, will be included
      for comparison.
