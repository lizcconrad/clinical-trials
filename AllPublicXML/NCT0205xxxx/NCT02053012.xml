      The investigators feel that children who have OSA or sleep-disordered breathing may have a
      different reaction time than normal variants. Children who have OSA are known to have
      behavioral and sleep patterns that are different. It makes sense their reaction time may be
      different than normal as well. We plan to measure reaction times via a 10 minute psychomotor
      vigilance test device in children who snore who are coming in for a sleep study or for
      adenotonsillectomy.
