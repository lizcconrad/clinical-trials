  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective and retrospective chart review, investigators will evaluate the response
      rates and duration of response for patients with relapsed and refractory idiopathic
      thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) who have been treated with rituximab and repeated courses of
      dexamethasone. Investigators will also evaluate observed toxicities of the combination, and
      characteristics associated with response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) usually respond with an increase in
      platelet count after treatment with steroids, but most patients will experience
      recurrence.Rituximab has been a useful treatment for patients with recurrent ITP; many
      hundreds of patients have been treated. 30-40% of patients will achieve a complete remission
      (CR: platelet count &gt;150 x 109/l) with initial treatment. However, most patients will relapse
      between 1 and 3 years from initial treatment suggesting that long-term &quot;cures&quot; only occur in
      20% of the initial patients. An increased rate of durable CRs is therefore a desirable goal.
      One approach would be to use rituximab maintenance; however, this strategy results in long
      term B cell suppression. Dexamethasone has also been used to achieve &quot;cure&quot; in ITP,
      especially in adults at or near diagnosis. An initial study suggested that approximately 50%
      of patients would achieve a long-term response with only one 4-day cycle of high dose (40
      mg/day) dexamethasone. A follow up study suggested that 3-4 cycles of dexamethasone would be
      better than 1 cycle. Finally, a recent publication suggested that rituximab plus one cycle of
      dexamethasone was superior to dexamethasone alone, with a &gt; 50% CR rate at 6 months. Based on
      the published activity of rituximab and dexamethasone in this disorder, some patients have
      received treatment with combined dexamethasone and rituximab. We will review the data of
      those patients who have received more than one course of dexamethasone together with
      rituximab for relapsed or refractory ITP in order to determine the response rate, duration of
      response, toxicity of the combination, and clinical predictors of response in this group.
