      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether endocavitary intramyocardial injection of
      autologous bone-marrow-derived CD133+ cells is safe on the basis of number of adverse events,
      with follow-up assessments extending up to 1 year after enrolment.

      This will be a Phase I study investigating the safety and preliminary efficacy of
      endocavitary injection of bone-marrow-derived CD133+ cells in 15 patients with ischemic heart
      failure (IHF) not eligible for conventional revascularization. Patients eligible will undergo
      bone-marrow aspiration. On the day following bone-marrow aspiration patients will undergo
      fluoroscopy-based endocavitary intramyocardial injections of the target areas previously
      identified by gated-SPECT/CMR. CD133+ cells suspended in physiological saline supplemented
      with 5% human albumin solution will be injected into the myocardium via the endocardial
      route.

      After discharge, efficacy follow-up will last 6-months safety follow-up (FU) will be extended
      up to 1 year.
