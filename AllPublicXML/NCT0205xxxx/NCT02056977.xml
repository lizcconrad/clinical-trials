      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  Compare PEEP level selected by individualized PEEP titration by electrical impedance
           tomography and PEEP level routinely used in post-operative cardiac patients with
           Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure;

        -  Evaluate the agreement between the results of a rapid titration (total procedure
           duration = 5 min) versus an already validated slow titration (total procedure duration =
           40 min) of the same patient, sequentially. Specifically, degree of collapse and degree
           of distention in each PEEP level, estimated by EIT;

        -  Compare hemodynamics during the two maneuvers of PEEP titration;

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of the selected PEEP (minimum PEEP preventing lung collapse less
           than 5%) to maintain stable levels of the following variables: arterial oxygenation,
           respiratory system compliance, and degree of collapse by EIT;

        -  Compare these results (evolution of the three variables, along 4 hours) with the control
           strategy (default strategy currently used in the institution) group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) increases the morbidity and mortality of
      patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). In the postoperative period of cardiac
      surgery, the use of intraoperative extracorporeal circulation is one of the factors
      triggering the syndrome, its incidence increasing.

      Potentially, a protective ventilatory strategy with optimal positive end expiratory pressure
      (PEEP) could improve the prognosis of those patients with ARDS.

      An already validated maneuver to titrate the ideal PEEP to these patients has a longer
      duration, about 40 minutes. The lung Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) monitors
      respiratory system mechanics and intrathoracic lung volume changes and provides information
      about regional behavior and recruitability of lung tissue and thereby allows shortening
      titration maneuver, reducing its hemodynamic effects.

      Patients in the postoperative period of cardiac surgery with a diagnosis of Hypoxemic
      Respiratory Failure (PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 250 mmHg, calculated at FiO2 60%, and the presence of
      bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography), admitted to the surgical ICU from Heart
      Institute, University of São Paulo.

      Recruitment maneuver and PEEP titration maneuver will be monitored by EIT.

      All patients will be followed and monitored for 4 hours, with measures of the evolution of
      alveolar collapse . Hemodynamic and oxygenation data will also be recorded .
