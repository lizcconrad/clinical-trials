  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive disease. Symptoms include coughing, poor lung
      ventilation, recurrent infections, poor weight gain, diarrhoea, malnutrition, stress,
      frustration, depression, irritability, worry, insomnia, behavioural issues and missed
      school/work.

      Tai chi, a Chinese form of exercise, uses slow choreographed movements, breathing exercises
      and mindfulness. Research suggests tai chi can improve physical and emotional wellbeing for
      various chronic conditions.

      This study compares methods of teaching tai chi to 70 people with CF, and evaluates the
      effect on symptoms and quality of life. Adults and children with CF will be recruited and
      randomly allocated to an intervention group or a control group. The former will receive 8
      individual face to face sessions of tai chi over a 3 month period and a video and handouts to
      aid home practice. The latter will have routine care for the first 12 weeks, followed by 8
      individual online sessions of tai chi over a 3 month period, and a video and handouts for
      home practice.

      Both groups will be encouraged to practice tai chi at home in the months following the taught
      sessions.

      Questionnaire data on how participants and their carers are coping with CF, any general
      improvements in wellbeing, and differences in other clinical outcomes (medication etc.)will
      be collected. Data will be collected at the beginning and end of the intervention, and at 6
      and 9 months post intervention and differences between the 2 groups compared over time.

      Feedback from on line focus groups will ask about their experiences, feasibility of learning
      and practicing of tai chi, engagement with the process, perceived health impact, and
      experiences of participation.

      It is hoped that the study may show how Tai Chi can help people with CF to maintain their
      health through mindful exercise, and improve troublesome symptoms like sleep and anxiety.

    <description>• Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R), a disease-specific instrument (Quittner et al 2005; Modi &amp; Quittner 2003). The CFQ uses 5 point Likert scales in 9 quality of life domains (physical, role/school, vitality, emotion, social, body image, eating, treatment burden, health perceptions), 3 symptoms (weight, respiratory, and digestion) and health perception. CFQ-R was seen as acceptable, appropriate and easily completed in the feasibility study. There are four different versions of the CFQ-R which will be used as appropriate: Adult/adolescent version completed by the patient for those 14 and over; 12-13 year old version completed by the patient; parent CFQ for children aged 6 to 13; for children 6 to 11 child CFQ in interviewer format (parent/carer)</description>

    <description>Tai Chi, a Chinese form of mindful exercise, may help alleviate CF symptoms, encourage active self-management and provide a practical way to relieve and manage stress for patients and carers. It involves gentle physical exercises, combined with breathing techniques and mindful awareness.
It will be taught by qualified instructors either face to face in the participant's home or over videoconferencing technology e.g. Skype.
A DVD of the Tai Chi was developed in Phase 1 which was successful for teaching adults, and will be used here, along with a child-friendly DVD. This will be filmed with and aimed at children aged 6-18. Teaching support materials, incorporating child-specific guidance such as animal-based Tai Chi movements, will be prepared for use in conjunction with the DVD.</description>
