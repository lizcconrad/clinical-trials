    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to select the size of the molded rotation mark for a new toric
      contact lens by comparing the visibility of various molded rotation marks.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants wore the test and control products contralaterally (in each eye separately) for
      2 hours, during which the Investigator assessed the various molded rotation marks for
      visibility. Each participant was assessed by 10 investigators.

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Each lens (containing 8 rotation marks and one reference mark, in total 9 marks) was assessed for visibility by 10 investigators using the following scale: &quot;N/A;&quot; &quot;Not visible;&quot; &quot;Slightly visible, not acceptable;&quot; &quot;Slightly visible, acceptable;&quot; &quot;Clearly visible;&quot; &quot;More visible than necessary.&quot; Visibility assessments were made after all marks had been evaluated. S9 Mark (test lens) functioned as a starting marker only and was not rated. The control lens was not used as a comparison, but rather as a reference for what a mark looks like on a commercial product. &quot;Visibility of Rotation Mark&quot; is reported as the percentage of assessments rating the rotation mark as &quot;Clearly visible&quot; or &quot;Slightly visible, acceptable.&quot;</description>
