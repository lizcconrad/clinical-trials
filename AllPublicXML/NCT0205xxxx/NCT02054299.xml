        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent obtained prior to study entry including informed consent for
             molecular genetic analysis concerning candidate genes relevant for pharmacokinetics
             and pharmacodynamics of the study medication.

          2. Both genders (male and female), as far as feasible, in each of the 3 OCT1 genotype
             groups, an equal proportion of males and females will be included.
