  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows non-invasive measurement of the concentration of
      up to 18 metabolites in the brain (&quot;neurochemical profile&quot;).

      The objective of this proposal is to develop new methods for high-field brain MRS (3 to 7
      Tesla).

      Our main hypothesis is that higher magnetic fields lead to improved spatial and temporal
      resolution and improved quantification precision.

      Aims

        1. To obtain improved &quot;neurochemical profiles&quot; in the brain using single voxel proton MRS
           at very high field (3 Tesla to 7 Tesla).

        2. To develop new methods for proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to
           obtain metabolic maps at very high field (3 Tesla to 7 Tesla).

      Since this project is focused on technical development, only healthy volunteers will be
      recruited (no patients).

    <description>This protocol is devoted exclusively to technical development and testing of MRS methods on our MR scanners. As such, there is no well-defined outcome measure or time frame. It is a continuous effort. We recruit subjects on an ongoing basis to test, optimize, and assess the performance of newly developed techniques.</description>
