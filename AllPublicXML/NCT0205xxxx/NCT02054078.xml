    <textblock>
      Patients with Malignant pleural effusion can be diagnosis advanced cancer. Currently
      recognized as the most reliable method to control malignant pleural effusion is pleural fixed
      or thoracic catheter drainage. The most effective pleural fixed agent is pulvis talci, but
      there are about 30% relapse rate. Thoracic drainage can lead to some complications, such as
      chest infections, catheter migration and blockage etc. The investigators need a reliable
      methods to solve dyspnea and other symptoms caused by malignant pleural effusion, and improve
      quality of life. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and Safety of
      intrapleural Bevacizumab versus pulvis talci as treatment for malignant pleural effusions
      (MPE) in patients.

      Backgroundï¼š Patients with Malignant pleural effusion can be diagnosis advanced cancer.
      Currently recognized as the most reliable method to control malignant pleural effusion is
      pleural fixed or thoracic catheter drainage. The most effective pleural fixed agent is pulvis
      talci, but there are about 30% relapse rate. Thoracic drainage can lead to some

      efficacy and Safety of intrapleural Bevacizumab versus pulvis talci as treatment for
      malignant pleural effusions (MPE) in patients.

      Methods:

      A unblended, randomized study to compare the inhibition of two treatment methods in malignant
      pleural effusion. Consecutive 183 patients were randomly assigned to two groups, A group is
      Bevacizumab200mg by intrapleural administration; B group is injected pulvis talci with closed
      thoracic drainage.
