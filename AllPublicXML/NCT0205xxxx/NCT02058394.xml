  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate postoperative events in patients noted to have
      retained nuclear fragments in the anterior vitreous during routine phacoemulsification and in
      those who did not.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we investigate whether presence of retained nuclear fragments in the anterior
      vitreous noted during uncomplicated cataract surgery is associated with higher incidence of
      postoperative adverse events. We will be assessing events including cystoid macular edema,
      iritis, elevated intraocular pressure, and retinal detachment.
