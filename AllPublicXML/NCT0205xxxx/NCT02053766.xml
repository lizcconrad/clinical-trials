    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a prospective, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of
      anesthesia in the mitochondrial dysfunction patient.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study subjects undergoing a routine medical care non-emergent procedure will be randomized
      into three different groups to receive one of the following anesthetic agents; Sevoflurane,
      Propofol or Dexmedetomidine.

      The primary outcome of this pilot study is to evaluate and compare the incidence of adverse
      events in mitochondrial patients undergoing a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure up to 48
      hours post anesthesia. The secondary outcome is to compare the metabolic derangements between
      three study groups by comparing changes in blood sugar, serum pH, serum bicarbonate, serum
      lactate and serum pyruvate levels before, during and after anesthesia in the groups.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, compared with pre-existing condition that occurs during any phase of the research study. An AE is defined as being independent of assumption of any causality. The following laboratory values and physical findings are to be considered AEs:
Laboratory value(s) of blood glucose, serum lactate, serum pyruvate, serum bicarbonate and pH that change from a subject's baseline by greater than 10% and is outside the normal range.
Any of the following parameters; feeding difficulties, temperature &gt;100 F, vomiting, nausea, lethargy, change in admission plan and any other change in baseline that are clinically relevant.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>In the Operating Room (OR) after applying routine monitors, anesthesia will be induced with a mask using Sevoflurane up to 8%. Sevoflurane will be used for maintenance for the rest of the procedure with dosage between 1.5% and 4%. Vitals will be monitored. Fentanyl will be used as needed. Rocuronium will be used as needed for muscle relaxation. At the end of the procedure twitches will be evaluated and muscle relaxation will be reversed. Sevoflurane will be turned off at the end of procedure.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Dexmedetomidine (Precedex®)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>These subjects will receive Dexmedetomidine intravenously. In the OR routine monitors will be placed. Vitals will be monitored. A loading dose of Precedex 1mcg/ kg will be given over 10 minutes. Infusion will be started using Precedex 1mcg/ kg/ hr and can be increased or decreased as needed. Fentanyl will be used as needed. Rocuronium will be used as needed for muscle relaxation. At the end of the procedure twitches will be evaluated and muscle relaxation will be reversed. Precedex infusion will be stopped at the end of the procedure.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Propofol</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>These subjects will receive propofol for anesthesia maintenance. In the OR routine monitors will be placed. Vitals will be monitored. A loading dose of Propofol 2mg/ kg will be given over 2 minutes. Infusion will be started using Propofol 50 mcg/ kg/min and can be increased or decreased as needed (range 50-300mcg/kg/min). Fentanyl will be used as needed. Rocuronium will be used as needed for muscle relaxation. At the end of the procedure twitches will be evaluated and muscle relaxation will be reversed. Propofol infusion will be stopped at the end of the procedure.</description>
