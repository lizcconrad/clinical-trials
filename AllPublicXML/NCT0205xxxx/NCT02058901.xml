      The primary objective of this study is:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sunitinib when administered once weekly
           or once every two weeks.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of sunitinib in a once weekly or once every two
           weeks dose schedule.

      Our hypothesis is that sunitinib, when given in a high-dose, intermittent schedule may
      exhibit improved efficacy with an acceptable toxicity profile. In the present phase I trial,
      we aim to determine the maximum tolerated dose of sunitinib when administered high-dose, once
      weekly or once every two weeks. Furthermore, by acquiring skin and tumor biopsies, we will
      assess intratumoral concentrations of sunitinib, correlate these to skin and plasma
      concentrations and gain more insight into the biological effects of the drug. Additionally,
      we aim to preliminary assess the efficacy of sunitinib administered at the MTD level in both
      schedules. Known serum angiogenesis markers will be correlated to efficacy endpoints.

    <description>Initial dose of sunitinib is set at 200 mg once weekly. Three patients are treated at the current dose level. If at least 2 patients are observed to have Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), the prior dose level is defined as the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) (unless only 3 patients have been treated at that level, in which case it is the tentative MTD). If 0 of the 3 patients are observed to have DLT, the dose level is escalated one step for the next cohort of 3 patients. If exactly 1 of the 3 patients treated show DLT, 3 additional patients are treated at the current dose level. If none of these show DLT, the dose level is escalated for the next cohort of 3 patients; otherwise, the prior dose level is defined as the MTD (unless only 3 patients have been treated at that level, in which case it is the tentative MTD). A tentative MTD becomes final when a total of 6 patients are treated with less than 2 showing DLT</description>

    <description>When the final MTD is reached for the cohort of patients treated once weekly and depending on the toxicities developed and defining MTD, enrollment of patients in the once every 2 weeks escalation cohort will begin, with the initial dose set at the MTD dose of the once weekly schedule, escalating again at 100 mg increments per dose level.</description>
