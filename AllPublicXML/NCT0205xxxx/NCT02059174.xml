  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of
      MK-1293 compared with a basal insulin (EU-Lantus™) in participants with Type 1 Diabetes. The
      primary hypotheses are that the duration of action, pharmacodynamic profile, and
      pharmacokinetic profile of MK-1293 and the comparator basal insulin are similar.

Median and max below are reported for the length of clamp duration (i.e. 30 hours).</description>

        <description>M1 glargine is the dominant circulating glargine-derived insulin metabolite after subcutaneous injection and it is pharmacologically active. AUC12-24 is a measure of the total amount of drug in the plasma from Hour 12 to Hour 24. Analysis was performed on log scale with results back transformed to original scale.</description>

One participant was not included in the PP population due to a medical issue. All available data from 5 of the participants who discontinued the study were included in the analyses.</population>
