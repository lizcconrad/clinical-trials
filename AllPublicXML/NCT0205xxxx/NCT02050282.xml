  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breathlessness is a dangerous symptom. Preliminary data from national and regional Danish
      databases show, that patients with shortness of breath in the ambulance have a very high
      mortality. Breathlessness can be caused by many different conditions - but heart diseases and
      lung diseases are dominant. The mortality is especially high in patients with breathlessness
      caused by heart disease.

      Distinguishing these different causes of breathlessness is a classical, often difficult,
      discipline in medicine. Visitation and guidance of treatment in patients with breathlessness
      in the prehospital setting relies on medical history and physical examination and as a
      consequence prehospital treatment for breathlessness is often non-specific. The use of
      heart-failure specific biomarkers may improve prehospital visitation and treatment of
      patients with breathlessness.

      We hypothesize, that

        1. Supplementing the routine examination by prehospital anesthesiologist with measurement
           of a biomarker for heart failure increases the proportion of patients with severe
           shortness of breath caused by heart disease triaged directly to department of cardiology

        2. This strategy does not increase the proportion of patients with severe shortness of
           breath caused by non-heart disease triaged directly to department of cardiology

      Measurement of the biomarker for heart failure N-terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide
      (NT-proBNP):

      In patients randomized to the strategy with supplementary measurement of NT-proBNP, a blood
      sample will be drawn from the peripheral venous catheter that is routinely inserted. This
      will be analyzed point-of-care in the ambulance.

      Interpretation of NT-proBNP:

      Cut-off values based on bootstrap-validated optimal cut-points for heart failure on will be
      used.

      Confirmatory ('rule in') cut point

      &lt; 50 years: 450 pg/mL

      50-75 years: 900 pg/mL

      &gt; 75 years: 1800 pg/mL

      Exclusionary ('rule out') cut point

      All patients: 300 pg/mL

      The emergency physicians will be thoroughly informed about these cut-points, but told not to
      triage to department of cardiology or other department strictly according to NT-proBNP, but
      according to clinical assessment AND NT-proBNP.
