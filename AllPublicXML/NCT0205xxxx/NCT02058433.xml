  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platinum-based doublets including paclitaxel, gemcitabine, or docetaxel are standard 1st
      regimens in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC). The traditional method of individualizing
      cytotoxic drug dose is by using body surface area(BSA), which is not correlated with the
      ability of an individual to metabolize or excrete cytotoxic drugs, because it is not related
      to liver function and is poorly correlated with glomerular filtration rate, and does not seem
      to be a determinant of toxicity. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as area under the curve have
      been shown to correlate with toxicity. The advantages of using a fixed dose of antineoplastic
      agents for all of the patients are obvious. Pharmacokinetically guided treatment would avoid
      severe adverse effects, which has not been sufficiently investigated in advanced NSCLC.First,
      the investigators monitor the blood concentrations of paclitaxel and neutropenia blood
      toxicity after chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients of NSCLC and verify
      suitable paclitaxel therapeutic window for Chinese patients. Then the investigators compare
      safety and efficacy between individual paclitaxel dose adjustment based on the therapeutic
      window compared with conventional dosage.
