      Assess the safety and functionality of the Freedom Knee速 system through a multi-center
      clinical trial. Study endpoints include a comparison of Pre-Surgery versus Post-Surgery data
      for:

        1. Range of Motion

        2. Quality of Life measurements using Knee Society Scale (KSS)

        3. Survivorship as defined by 'No Revision' of baseline implant

        4. Quality of Life measurements using the WOMAC Score

      The clinical study will involve a series of evaluations performed by your surgeon. These
      examinations are consistent with the normal surgeon care as part of Total Knee Replacement
      surgery. The study objective is to assess the safety, functionality, and survivorship of the
      Freedom Knee System through a multi-center clinical trial. Study endpoints include a
      comparison of Pre-Surgery (baseline) versus Post-Surgery data for Range of Motion and
      Flexion, Quality of Life (KSS), and survivorship (defined by 'no revisions'). Additionally,
      the structural integrity will be evaluated based on the x-ray performed 36-months after knee
      replacement.
