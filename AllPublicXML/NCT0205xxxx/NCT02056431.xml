  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) affects more than 5.5 million people with
      diabetes. People with painful DPN have trouble sleeping, participating in social events, and
      conducting daily activities such as going to the store. Several prescription medications are
      available for the treatment of DPN symptoms, but none work perfectly and all have side
      effects that may be difficult for some patients.

      When patients report their symptoms and side effects to their doctor, they provide the doctor
      with important information to help them make adjustments to treatment that will help with
      symptoms and that the patient can tolerate in terms of side effects. In some cases, doctors
      may encourage patients to make these changes on their own at home based on their experience
      with therapy. However, patients may have a long time between visits to their doctor and may
      have trouble describing their symptoms to their doctor during a brief 10 to 15 minute visit.

      This clinical trial explores the possibility of computerized telephone calls to patients
      (Interactive Voice Response, IVR, technology) to gather information about treatment
      experiences that can then be reported to the doctor or used to guide patients to make changes
      in how they take the medication. It addresses the following question: Can routinely asking
      patients about their experiences with medications and using that information to encourage
      clinically appropriate titration improve patient quality of life?

      The investigators hypothesize that systematic collection and feedback of information about
      DPN treatment preferences and experience from newly treated patients to their primary care
      physician will facilitate treatment changes that improve patient outcomes

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among newly-treated Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) patients, the investigators will
      compare the systematic collection and feedback of information about patients' treatment
      experiences on changes in quality of life (intervention group) to newly treated DPN patients
      in usual care who will receive generic educational messages by phone but no active data
      collection and feedback (comparator group). The investigators have chosen usual care as the
      control to evaluate the potential for the intervention to enhance current practice.

      Aim 1: Refine and pilot test instruments for collecting the patient-reported data most
      important for guiding changes in treatment.

      Aim 2: Implement a seven-month cluster randomized trial to improve quality of life among
      patients newly treated for DPN symptoms by collecting data on patient treatment experiences
      and facilitating evidence-based patient and provider-initiated treatment titration.

      Aim 3: Examine patient and physician initiated treatment changes as secondary outcomes in
      order to inform the development of this type of rapid feedback process for guiding decision
      making about initial treatment selection among patients with DPN.

    <description>The primary outcome measure is change in quality of life at eight months following study entry. We calculated the EuroQOL (EQ-5D) from the Global Health Scale, a 10-item Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System measure developed and validated in patients with neuropathy as part of the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders Measures. The range for EQ-5D is 0-1, with &quot;0&quot; being the worst and &quot;1&quot; being the best.</description>

        <title>Change in Patient Quality of Life Over 8 Month Period</title>
        <description>The primary outcome measure is change in quality of life at eight months following study entry. We calculated the EuroQOL (EQ-5D) from the Global Health Scale, a 10-item Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System measure developed and validated in patients with neuropathy as part of the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders Measures. The range for EQ-5D is 0-1, with &quot;0&quot; being the worst and &quot;1&quot; being the best.</description>
