    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I/II dose escalation trial designed to test the feasibility of
      delivering IMRT to thyroid, larynx and hypopharynx cancer patients, and to assess the safety
      and possible improvement in outcome when the dose is increased.

      This protocol is in fact two studies running in parallel: thyroid cancer patients and larynx/
      hypopharynx cancer patients. These two groups of patients are being treated differently and
      will be analysed separately.

      The primary objective of this Phase I sequential cohort study was to determine the
      feasibility of delivering modest acceleration and dose-escalated IMRT in locally advanced
      high-risk thyroid cancers. We report the incidence and prevalence of acute toxicities of 2
      dose fractionation regimens.

      DL1: primary site 58.8 Gy in 28 daily fractions and nodal levels 50 Gy in 28 daily fractions

      DL2: primary 66.6 Gy in 30 daily fractions and post operative nodal levels 60 Gy in 30 daily
      fractions and elective nodal levels 54 Gy in 30 daily fractions

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Newly diagnosed histologically confirmed squamous cell or undifferentiated carcinoma
             of the head and neck.

          2. Newly diagnosed histologically confirmed papillary,follicular, undifferentiated or
             medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.

          3. Tumours arising from the oral larynx or hypopharynx requiring radical radiation of the
             primary tumour by parallel opposed lateral fields, and bilateral cervical lymph node
             irradiation.

          4. High risk of radiation induced xerostomia with conventional radiotherapy due to the
             irradiation of the majority of both parotid glands (defined as estimated mean dose to
             both parotid glands greater than 26 Gy using conventional radiotherapy technique).

          5. Radiotherapy either as primary therapy or post-operative (only for thyroid carcinoma).
             Techniques to be detailed by each centre. Neo-adjuvant and concomitant chemotherapy
             are permitted.

          6. Stage T1-4, N1-3, M0 disease

          7. Zubrod Performance Status 0-2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous radiotherapy to the head and neck region

          2. Previous malignancy except non-melanoma skin cancer

          3. Previous or concurrent illness which in the investigators opinion would interfere with
             either completion of therapy or follow-up

          4. Prophylactic use of amifostine or pilocarpine is not allowed

          5. Brachytherapy is not allowed as part of the treatment
