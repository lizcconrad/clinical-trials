  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on the
      severity of oral mucositis (OM) and inflammatory mediators (pro- and anti-inflammatory
      cytokines, metalloproteinases and growth factors) levels in saliva and blood of hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation (HSCT) patients.

    <time_frame>Daily from the day of the transplant (D0) until day 20 (D+20)</time_frame>
    <description>A trained clinical member of the team who was blind to the randomization allocation scores the degree of OM, during the hospitalization, in accordance to the World Health Organization (WHO) mucositis scale as follow: grade 0, no signs or symptoms; grade 1, painless ulcers, erythema, or mild soreness; grade 2, painful erythema, edema, or ulceration but the patient is able to eat; grade 3, mucosal damage and the patient is able to ingest only liquids; and grade 4, severe mucosa damage and the patient requires parenteral or enteral support.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of inflammatory mediators</measure>
    <time_frame>At 2 time points before the transplantation (admission and D-1), on days 3 and 7 after transplantation (D+3 and D+7) and on the day of the patient's neutrophil recovery (granulocytes &gt; 500/mm3 for two consecutive days).</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were instructed to rinse their mouths with pure water and swallow all saliva before collection. The saliva was collected during the early hours of the morning and sterile tubes were used where each patient collected all of the saliva that had formed in the oral cavity for 5 minutes. Samples (5.0 mL) of peripheral blood were taken at the same days as saliva collection using the VacutainerÂ® system (Becton Dickinson and Company) with anticoagulant (EDTA).</description>

    <description>In the laser group, an indium phosphide, galium and aluminum (InGaAIP) diode laser was used to irradiate oral mucosa. Subjects received the LLLT from the first day of the conditioning regimen and continued until D+7. Laser therapy was applied by a single dentist expertise in laser irradiation. The tip touched the mucosa of the lips, right and left buccal mucosa, right and left lateral tongue, ventral tongue and buccal floor, giving a total of 10 points per region.</description>
