  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to study the effect of infant nutrition on brain development, as measured
      using Magnetic Resonance (MR) techniques. The investigators will collect detailed information
      about the diet of each of the infants, and seek to correlate this information with multiple
      MR measurements, including structural imaging, diffusion imaging, and functional
      connectivity. The MR scans will be performed at birth and 3 months of age. Dietary
      information collected will include detailed food diaries describing the feeding habits of the
      infants, and food frequency questionnaires to characterize the diet of the mother.
