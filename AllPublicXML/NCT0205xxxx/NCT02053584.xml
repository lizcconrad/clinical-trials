  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is performed to evaluate the accuracy of blood glucose level results obtained from
      fingertip using Labstyle Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS) compared to reference
      equipment (YSI 2300 STATPLUS) and to evaluate the ease of use of the Dario Device by the
      lay-person.

      The participants will review the Dario user manual and guide and will be requested to operate
      the Dario BGMS and perform their own glucose blood test, after which they will be asked to
      complete a questionnaire. As reference the participants will be tested by professional
      caregivers both using the Dario BGMS and by YSI 2003.

    <textblock>
      Device accuracy will be assessed based on the acceptance criteria of ISO 15197:2003 which
      states: &quot;The minimum acceptable accuracy for results produced by a glucose monitoring system
      shall be as follows: 95% of the individual glucose results shall fall within 15 mg/dL of the
      results of Reference method at glucose concentrations ≥ 4,2 mmol/L (≥ 75 mg/dL)&quot;.
