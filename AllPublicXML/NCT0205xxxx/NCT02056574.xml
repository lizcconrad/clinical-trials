    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose study investigating the
      safety and efficacy of NA-1 in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) undergoing
      endovascular repair of ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Up to 300 male and female patients
      with SAH undergoing endovascular repair of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm will be dosed
      with 2.60 mg/kg of NA-1 or placebo as a 10 minute intravenous infusion after completion of
      the endovascular procedure on Day 1 of the study period. Subjects will undergo interim
      procedures at Day 2-4, Day 30-45, and end-of-study procedures on Day 90.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. A diagnosis of a ruptured brain aneurysm deemed suitable for repair by
             neuroendovascular techniques involving intraluminal occlusion by detachable platinum
             coils, or any neuroendovascular technique such as balloon-assisted coiling, stenting,
             or flowed diversion.

          -  2. Patient should be Grade II-IV on the WFNS grading scale for SAH.

          -  3. Male or female with a minimum age of 18 years on the day of enrolment.

          -  4. Female subjects of childbearing potential: Negative pregnancy test.

          -  5. Non-surgically sterile males or males with partners of childbearing potential must
             be willing to use condoms with spermicide for 3 months after completion of dosing.

          -  6. Body weight less than or equal to 180 kg.

          -  7. Vital signs on admission:

               -  Blood pressure between 80-180 mm Hg systolic/50-100 mm Hg diastolic;

               -  Body temperature ≤ 38.5C.

          -  8. Informed consent and availability of the subject for the entire study period and
             willingness of the subject to adhere to protocol requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Prior SAH within 6 months of presentation.

          -  2. Dissecting or mycotic brain aneurysm.

          -  3. Planned endovascular vessel sacrifice as the primary modality for aneurysm
             treatment.

          -  4. Known history of life-threatening allergic reaction to any medication.

          -  5. Chronic renal disease defined as a baseline serum creatinine &gt; 150 µmol/L.

          -  6. Women who are pregnant, or have a positive urine or blood (β-hCG) pregnancy test.

          -  7. Women who are breastfeeding.

          -  8. Any clinically significant psychiatric or psychological disease, which would
             preclude the patient from completing the protocol.

          -  9. Pre-morbid (estimated) modified Rankin scale score of &gt;1.

          -  10. Previous major stroke.

          -  11. Patients with known HIV infection.

          -  12. Participation in a clinical trial with an investigational drug within 30 days
             preceding this study.

          -  13. Previous participation in the ENACT trial (e.g, to treat a prior aneurysm),
             participation in another trial involving NA-1 or prior receipt of NA-1.

          -  14. Any other medical condition that the site investigator deems would put the patient
             at excessive risk of participation in the study or an expected life expectancy less
             than 1 year or that would result in inability to collect clinical outcomes at 90 days.
