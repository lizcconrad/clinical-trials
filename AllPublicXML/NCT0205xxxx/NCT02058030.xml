  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background - The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the success and pharyngeal
      trauma when 3 or 6 cm height of pillow is used for the ProSealTM laryngeal mask airway
      insertion

      Methods

      - This prospective randomized, controlled study included 80 adult patients . In the 3 cm
      (n=40) or 6 cm group (n=40), the PLMA was inserted while the head is placed on the 3 cm or 6
      cm height of pillow. The success rate at first and second attempt, insertion time, blood
      staining on cuff, sore throat and hoarseness were assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: The &quot;sniffing position&quot; (i.e., the neck flexed and head extended by means of a
      pillow) eases tracheal intubation because the three axes, namely, the axis of the mouth, the
      pharyngeal axis and the laryngeal axis, are put in almost a straight line. The benefit of the
      sniffing position that align three axis could possibly be applicable when the ProSeal LMA is
      inserted. For the endotracheal intubation, it has been recommended to elevate the patient's
      head 8 to 10 cm with pads under the occiput (shoulder remaining on the table) and extend the
      head at the atlanto-occipital joint to align the oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal axes such
      that the passage and line of vision from the lips to the glottic opening are most nearly a
      straight line.

      There have been several clinical studies about the effect of head and neck position including
      neutral, flexion or extension on the ease of LMA insertion.

      However, it has not been much recommended or investigated about the influence of head
      elevation on the insertion success of PLMA until now. The purpose of the present study is to
      evaluate the success and pharyngeal trauma when 3 or 6 cm height of pillow is used for the
      ProSeal laryngeal mask airway insertion in adult patients.
