  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (rTMS) can augment occupational therapy in improving motor function in children
      (10 years of age or older) and young adults (&lt; 21 years of age) with chronic hemiparesis from
      either stroke or cerebral palsy.

    <textblock>
      RTMS is a noninvasive technology that can induce changes in brain function that may lead to
      functional improvement in people with hemiparesis. This is a randomized, double-blinded,
      sham-controlled rTMS study in conjunction with intensive daily occupational therapy (OT) for
      2 weeks to improve motor function in hemiparetic patients. Participants will be followed for
      at least 12 weeks after rTMS to detect any clinical change. The sham group participants will
      be offered an open-label active rTMS treatment plus OT after the 12 week assessment.
