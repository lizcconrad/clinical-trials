    <textblock>
      Investigating which receptors are involved in nutient sensing of enteroendocrine cells and on
      nerve endings, gives further knowledge on the kind of nutrients responsible for the secretion
      of gut hormones involved in satiety signalling. So far only little is know about the
      distribution of potential nutient sensing receptors along the gastrointestinal tract. The
      investigators are interested in the intestinal parts which highly secrete CCK and GLP-1. By
      comparing these tissues, it is expected to further elucidate which receptors are important
      for satiety signalling in the intestine.

      Having this information gives rise to further reseach on how these receptors stimulate the
      secretion of gut hormones. Moreover, knowing which receptors are involved in satiety
      signalling, gives oppertunity for targeting these receptors to increase satiety and
      influencing food intake.

      The investigators aim to investigate the distribution of the above mentioned receptors, in
      the following referred to as 'nutrient sensing receptors', which have been suggested to be
      involved in satiety signalling, throughout the intestinal tract. For these receptors the gene
      expression, localisation and protein expression will be determined at different locations.
      This will be measured in intestinal mucosal biopsies of two locations in the duodenum, in the
      terminal ileum, the ascending colon, the transverse colon and the descending colon.

        Inclusion criteria for duodenal biopsies:

          -  Step 1 (patients asked for participation):

               1. Patients (male and female between 18 and 65 years) referred for upper GI
                  endoscopy (because of functional complaints)

               2. Based on medical history and previous examination, no objection arises for taking
                  extra biopsies during the gastroduodenoscopy.

          -  Step 2 (patients agreed to participate and in whom biopsies will be taken) 1) Patients
             with no relevant endoscopic abnormalities (gastroduodenoscopy): patients without
             gastric or duodenal ulcers/polyps/lesions suspect for malignancy and esophageal
             lesions or varices.

        Inclusion criteria for ileal and colon biopsies:

          -  Step 1 (patients asked for participation):

        Patients (male and female between 18 and 65 years) referred for colonoscopy (because of
        screening for colorectal cancer or follow up of colonic polyps) Based on medical history
        and previous examination, no objection arises for taking extra biopsies during the
        colonoscopy

          -  Step 2 (patients agreed to participate and in whom biopsies will be taken) Patients
             with no relevant endoscopic abnormalities (colonoscopy): patients without ileal and/or
             colonic ulcers/polyps/diverticula and lesions suspect for malignancy Ileum can be
             reached during colonoscopy

        Exclusion criteria for duodenal and ileal colon biopsies:

          1. History of severe cardiovascular, gastrointestinal/ hepatic,
             hematological/immunologic, metabolic/nutritional disease and/or laboratory assessments
             which might limit participation in the study. The severity of the disease (major
             interference with the execution of the experiment or potential influence on the study
             outcomes) will be decided by the principal investigator.

          2. Use of medication, which could interfere with normal coagulation (anticoagulants,
             antiplatelet drugs).

          3. Major abdominal surgery interfering with gastrointestinal function (uncomplicated
             appendectomy, cholecystectomy and hysterectomy allowed, and other surgery upon
             judgement of the principle investigator)

          4. Excessive alcohol consumption (&gt;20 alcoholic consumptions per week)
