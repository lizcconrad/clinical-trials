    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PC) represents one of the most common cancers in industrialized countries.
      Patients with localized disease may be treated with surgery or radiation, while androgen
      ablation is used as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic disease. While most
      patients initially respond well to this hormonal therapy, they most ultimately become
      unresponsive and recur within 2 years as androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC).
      Recently, docetaxel-based regimens have demonstrated improved survival in men with AIPC in
      two different, large, phase III studies. However, the median overall survival was prolonged
      for only 2 or 3 months. Androgen independent (AI) progression involves variable combinations
      of clonal selection, adaptive up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes, ligand-independent
      androgen receptor (AR) activation, alternative growth factor pathways, and immune system
      escape. Additional therapeutic strategies targeting molecular mechanisms mediating
      resistance, combined with immunotherapy must be developed. One strategy to improve therapies
      in advanced PC involves targeting genes that are activated by androgen withdrawal, either to
      delay or prevent the emergence of the resistant AI phenotype. Recently, a
      scientist,identified Heat Shock Protein (Hsp27) as a highly over-expressed gene in AIPC.
      Hsp27 knockdown using antisens oligonucleotides (ASO) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)
      increased apoptotic rates and enhanced hormone- and chemo-therapy in PC. She developed and
      patented a 2nd generation ASO targeting Hsp27 that has been licensed (investigational drug
      called OGX-427) and clinical trials phase I/II is currently in process in PC. Despite OGX-427
      efficiency, the functional role of stress induced Hsp27 in castration or chemotherapy-induced
      apoptosis remains undefined. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the pathways leading
      to Hsp27 action in androgen-independent prostate cancer in order to 1/ Increase the
      pharmacological safety of OGX-427 and 2/find new specific therapeutic targets and treatment
      strategy for androgen-independent prostate cancer .
