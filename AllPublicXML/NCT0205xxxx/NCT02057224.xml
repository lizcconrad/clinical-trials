  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal denervation has recently shown to improve glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in
      addition to reducing blood pressure. The mechanisms are however unclear. The investigators
      hypothesize that renal denervation alters adipose tissue function by reduced sympathetic
      outflow, measured by fat biopsies and markers of inflammation and insulin sensitivity. 15
      clinical patients undergoing renal denervation are recruited to the study investigating
      anthropometry, peripheral blood samples, body composition, heart rate variability and
      subcutaneous fat biopsies at baseline and 6 months after renal denervation.

      Renal denervation, a catheter-based approach to reduce renal sympathetic afferent and
      efferent activity has been used successfully to treat drug-resistant hypertension. Previous
      studies has demonstrated a reduction of muscle sympathetic nerve activity and renal and total
      body noradrenaline spillover. In addition, renal denervation seems to improve glucose
      metabolism and insulin sensitivity, representing the first potential nonpharmaceutical
      approach for treating insulin resistance. However, the mechanisms are unclear. There is a
      clear relationship between sympathetic overactivity and insulin resistance. Activation of the
      sympathetic nervous systems contributes to insulin resistance and metabolic disorders and
      insulin itself induces sympathetic overactivity. One possible explanation to improved glucose
      metabolism after renal denervation is altered adipose tissue function (due to the reduction
      in sympathetic activity). Therefore,15 individuals undergoing renal denervation are
      recruited. The clinical study includes anthropometry, peripheral blood samples, body
      composition, heart rate variability and subcutaneous fat biopsies before renal denervation
      and after 6 months.

    <description>Secondary hypertension is excluded by an extensive preoperative clinical investigation and the renal artery anatomy is visualized by computer tomography (with contrast). By cannulating the femoral artery both renal arteries are treated by a radiofrequency-catheter, 4-6 ablations in each artery.</description>
