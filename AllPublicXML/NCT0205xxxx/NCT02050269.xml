  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of estimating the clearance of
      iohexol as an indirect measure of glomerular filtration rate in patients with unstable renal
      function in the intensive care unit through analysis of rich iohexol plasma kinetics.
