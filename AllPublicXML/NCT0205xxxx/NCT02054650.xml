  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is based on osteopathic medical philosophy that: 1) the body is a unit;
      2) the body has inherent self-regulatory mechanisms; 3) structure and function are
      interrelated; and 4) rational treatment is based on an understanding and integration of these
      concepts. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus often report more aches and pains than
      people without diabetes. Because osteopathic manual medicine addresses dysfunction in the
      musculoskeletal system, patients with both chronic low back pain and type 2 diabetes mellitus
      may benefit from this non-pharmacological treatment to reduce their pain, thereby reducing
      their stress and perhaps providing better clinical control for diabetes as demonstrated by
      key markers such as hemoglobin A1c and kidney function. This study is an extension of
      research completed in the OSTEOPATHIC Trial. Results of that study were published in the
      Annals of Family Medicine in March/April 2013.

      SPECIFIC AIM 1:

      To conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine the efficacy of osteopathic
      manual treatment (OMT) vs sham OMT in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and
      comorbid chronic low back pain (LBP). This will involve a 12-week protocol to study changes
      in response to OMT in such outcomes as LBP severity (primary outcome measure), somatic
      dysfunction, renal function, glycemic control, and other biomarkers potentially related to
      T2DM.

      SPECIFIC AIM 2:

      Within the RCT, to corroborate previous findings indicating that patients with T2DM have a
      high prevalence of tissue texture abnormalities in the T11-L2 spinal segmental region and to
      determine if such findings can be statistically associated with the presence of diabetic
      nephropathy using such laboratory measures as serum creatinine, urinary microalbuminuria and
      macroalbuminuria, and the glomerular filtration rate.

      SPECIFIC AIM 3:

      Within the RCT, to explore potential mechanisms of action of OMT by longitudinally measuring
      concentrations of biomarkers such as insulin, glucagon, cortisol, hemoglobin A1c, tumor
      necrosis factor-α,interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18 in subjects with T2DM and
      comorbid chronic LBP over 12 weeks. Significant changes in biomarker concentrations may help
      explain the effects of OMT and whether such effects are mediated by changes in somatic
      dysfunction.

The protocol will target the thoracic, lumbosacral, iliac, and pubic regions using the following techniques: high-velocity, low-amplitude thrusts; moderate-velocity, moderate-amplitude thrusts; soft tissue including stretching, kneading, and pressure; myofascial stretching and release; counterstrain; muscle energy; and other optional techniques as time permits and indicated. The intervention will be delivered at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8. Week 12 is a data collection visit with no intervention.</description>
