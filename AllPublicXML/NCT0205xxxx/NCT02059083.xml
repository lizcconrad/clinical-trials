      The aims of this study are: 1) to estimate the effect size of HRV biofeedback for stress in
      adolescents undergoing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for cannabis use disorder (primary
      outcome: Perceived Stress Scale) and 2) to estimate the effect size of HRV biofeedback for
      cannabis use in adolescents undergoing CBT for cannabis use disorder (primary outcome: number
      of days used cannabis in the past 30 days).
