      This phase II trial studies how well sorafenib tosylate, combination chemotherapy, radiation
      therapy, and surgery work in treating patients with high-risk stage IIB-IV soft tissue
      sarcoma. Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as epirubicin hydrochloride
      and ifosfamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation
      therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving sorafenib tosylate, combination
      chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery may be an effective treatment for soft tissue
      sarcoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pathologic response rate (&gt;= 95% necrosis) after preoperative treatment
      with sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate), epirubicin (epirubicin hydrochloride), ifosfamide, and
      hypofractionated radiation for high risk soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities or body
      wall.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further characterize the safety of sorafenib plus chemoradiotherapy, including wound
      complication rate.

      II. To estimate time-to-event rates, including overall survival, overall disease-free
      survival, distant disease-free survival, and local disease-free survival in patients with
      high risk soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities or body wall treated with preoperative
      sorafenib plus chemoradiotherapy and postoperative sorafenib plus chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-71 and 85-155,
      epirubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 3-5 minutes, and ifosfamide IV over 90
      minutes on days 15-17, 36-38 (ifosfamide only), 57-59, 99-101, 120-122, and 141-143. Patients
      undergo external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) on days 36-45 and surgical resection on day
      78. Patients with positive margins, undergo EBRT boost on days 91-98.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 1 year, and then yearly for 2 years.
