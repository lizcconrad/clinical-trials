    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the effect of hormone therapies (androgen pathway
      modification) on the outcomes of patients with lung cancer. This information may be of
      benefit for future treatment strategies, prevention and control.

      In this study, the protein where testosterone binds, called the androgen receptor (AR), will
      be measured in samples from the patient's biopsy and surgical tumor samples. The
      investigators will look at a marker of how fast the cancer is growing (Ki67) before using
      finasteride from your biopsy specimen. Finasteride will be taken from the day of consent
      until the day of the patient's surgery. This marker will be measured again after using
      finasteride from the surgical specimen. The investigators will be looking for a decrease in
      the Ki67 from the patient's biopsy specimen to the surgical specimen as an indicator that
      this medication is blocking tumour growth.
