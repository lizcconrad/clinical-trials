      Aim: In this study the investigators aimed to compare the time of antagonism and intensity of
      effect of sugammadex which is used for antagonism of rocuronium on diabetic and non-diabetic
      patients.

      Methods: Included patients were divided into 2 groups: diabetic (n=21) and non-diabetic
      (n=20). All patients were premedicated. After arrival in the operating room, all patients
      were monitorised with Datex Ohmeda S/5 Anesthesia Machine and electrocardiography (DII
      derivation), hemodynamic variables, respiratory rate, and inspiratory sevoflurane
      concentrations were recorded. Neuromuscular monitoring system was used. Anesthesia was
      induced with propofol 2 mg/kg and fentanyl 1 mcg/kg. After the loss of eyelid reflex the
      neuromuscular monitoring system automatically identified supramaximal stimulating currents
      and after that rocuronium 0,6 mg/kg was given. Train of four (TOF) stimulation with the
      supramaximal current were applied and by recording of second TOF value (TOF2) the patient was
      intubated. Anesthesia was maintained with 50% O2 + 50% air and sevoflurane of 1-2 %
      concentration. TOF stimulation was applied and recorded every 20 seconds. Intraoperatively by
      return T2 rocuronium 0,15 mg/kg was given. T2i time was recorded as intubation time and T2d
      time was recorded as clinical effect time. At the end of the operation sugammadex 2 mg/kg was
      given. When TOF rate reached 0,9 patients were extubated and the time was recorded.
