    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in
      identifying and localizing tumors in patients with non-small cell lung cancer undergoing
      radiation therapy. Diagnostic procedures such as diffusion weighted MRI may help identify
      where active cancer is to improve the targeting accuracy of radiotherapy. Comparing results
      of diagnostic procedures done before, during, and after radiation therapy may help determine
      how the location and volume of tumors changes over time and predict how the tumor will
      respond to therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess diffusion-weighted MRI as an early predictor for tumor response in patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      II. Establish the potential of individualized radiotherapy targeting of radioresistant tumor
      sub-volumes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo diffusion-weighted MRI within 4 weeks of radiation start (baseline), during
      the second week of radiation therapy, during the fourth week of radiation therapy, and at 3
      months after radiation therapy (post-treatment). Patients also undergo standard of care
      4-dimensional (4D) computed tomography (CT) and fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-positron emission
      tomography (PET) at the same time points.

    <description>A paired sample t-test could be applied to test the difference between MRI, CT, and PET-CT contours. Parameters used for comparison will include volume size, volume overlap, such as Dice similarity coefficients and Jaccard index, and surface distance maps including Hausdorff distance.</description>

    <description>Patients will be classified into responders and non-responders based on their PET signal which will serve as the reference method for response assessment. Although this is a little different from the three group analysis of variance (ANOVA) used in the power calculation, it is expected that there will be similar high power when the partial responders and non-responders are combined. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis will be used to define a threshold of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) change to stratify between metabolic responders vs. non-responders.</description>

    <description>Patients undergo 15 imaging studies: 5 chest CT scans, 5 chest MRI scans, 5 PET scans. Each scan will be obtained before treatment begins, weeks 2 and 4 during radiation therapy, 3 months and 1 year following radiation therapy. THe chest CT obtained pre-treatment, at 3 months post treatment and 1 year post treatment are considered routine and would be obtained regardless of study participation. The pre-treatment PET scan is also considered routine. All other scans are being done for the purposes of this research.</description>
