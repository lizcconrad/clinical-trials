    <textblock>
      Chronic problems after traumatic events are common in non-elderly adults. Previous studies
      have shown that after minor motor vehicle collision (MVC), 10-30% of non-elderly adult
      patients develop chronic regional pain (neck or back pain). In addition, up to 1/3 of
      non-elderly adults will develop psychological sequelae, including posttraumatic stress
      disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders. There have been no prospective studies examining
      the frequency or predictors of persistent pain or psychological sequelae in older adults. The
      proposed study seeks to determine the frequency of persistent pain, psychological sequelae,
      and associated disability in older adults after minor MVC trauma and to identify candidate
      predictors for a model of adverse outcomes after MVC in this population. 200 individuals over
      65 years of age will be recruited from emergency departments in four states with no-fault
      accident laws. Patients who meet inclusion criteria and who consent to the emergency
      department (ED) study will undergo a 30-45 minute ED assessment of crash-related,
      psychosocial, and biological factors, and complete telephone follow-ups at 2 weeks, 6 weeks 6
      months, and 12 months. The wealth of information gained from this study will be used to
      determine the frequency of adverse events in older adults after MVC and to identify high risk
      elderly patients. These results will inform subsequent development of secondary pharmacologic
      and/or behavioral interventions to prevent chronic pain and psychological sequelae after
      traumatic events in older adults.
