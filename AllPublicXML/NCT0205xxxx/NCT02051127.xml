  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the biggest challenges of today is the high stress levels among employees in companies
      and organizations. Physical exercise may be an effective preventive measure for
      stress-related problems. This relatively simple and inexpensive action is believed to be
      important for increasing and maintaining work ability and reduce the cost of stress-related
      ill health in the workplace.

      The aim is to investigate how regular physical exercise affects the individual's ability to
      mentally and physiologically cope with stress. Acute stress physiological responses are
      measured before and after a 6 -month intervention, where 100 untrained individuals are
      randomized to either regular physical exercise or a control group.

      The hypothesis is that exercise leads to lesser activation of the individual's stress
      physiological systems and to an efficient physiological protection system. Mental ability to
      handle stress is also studied as well as possible effects on the brain's cognitive functions.
      From a work perspective, cognitive impairment due to high exposure to stress is a major
      problem leading to substantial costs in businesses and organizations as a result of reduced
      performance and production.

      We believe that physical activity can alter and mitigate individual stress reactions. This
      study brings new knowledge that can contribute to increased motivation to prioritize physical
      activity in everyday life. The study could also provide evidence for businesses and
      organizations of the benefits of engaging in interventions and fitness initiatives to
      facilitate/enable increased physical activity in daily life for its employees. With an aging
      population, we are expected to work longer, which poses a challenge as the ability to manage
      stress and maintain cognitive abilities decline with age. For older employees, regular
      physical activity could be an important factor directly affecting the prospects for a
      sustainable working life.
