  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of Crohn Disease (CD) is unknown, but there is evidence show that the
      inadequate immune response or overreaction of the immune system against food antigens or
      components of the commensal flora involve it. Corticosteroid therapy is effective for adult
      patients with CD, but it has side effects and can't promote mucosal healing. In recent years,
      Enteral nutrition (EN) is becoming primary therapy in induction and maintenance remission of
      CD, especially in children. But the mechanism of EN in induction and maintenance remission of
      CD is still unclear, and parts of patient have good clinical response to EN therapy while
      other don't. So we design the study to explore whether EN treats CD by effecting intestinal
      flora and whether the intestinal flora of patient with CD relates with clinical response.
