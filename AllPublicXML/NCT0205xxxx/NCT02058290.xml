  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the standard of care against EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome
      injectable suspension) to determine if total opioid consumption is reduced when using
      EXPAREL, therefore possibly reducing total hospital costs.

      This is a Phase 4, prospective, sequential, open-label study designed to evaluate the
      efficacy, safety, and health economic benefits of intraoperative local wound infiltration
      with EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) compared with postsurgical
      administration of standardized intravenous (IV) morphine sulfate or Sponsor-approved
      equivalent for postsurgical analgesia in adult patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy
      with general anesthesia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, at least 18 years of age.

          -  Patients scheduled to undergo laparoscopic segmental colectomy with planned primary
             anastamosis, as defined by cecectomy, right hemicolectomy, resection of transverse
             colon, left hemicolectomy, or sigmoidectomy. (Note: patients who converted from a
             planned laparoscopic colectomy to an open colectomy were not eligible.)

          -  Ability to provide informed consent, adhere to study visit schedule, and complete all
             study assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reactions or intolerance
             to any local anesthetic, opioid, or propofol.

          -  Patients who abuse alcohol or other drug substance.

          -  Patients with severe hepatic impairment.

          -  Patients currently pregnant or who may become pregnant during the course of the study

             before and 1 month after dosing. Acceptable means of contraception include hormonal
             contraceptives (e.g., oral, injectable, implantable), effective barrier methods (e.g.,
             condoms with spermicide), intrauterine device, lifestyle with a personal choice of
             abstinence, non-heterosexual lifestyle, or in a strictly monogamous relationship with
             a partner who has had a vasectomy.

          -  Patients with any psychiatric, psychological, or other condition that the Investigator
             feels may make the patient an inappropriate candidate for this clinical study.

          -  Participation in an EXPAREL study within the last 30 days.

          -  Patients who have received any investigational drug within 30 days prior to study drug
             administration, or planned administration of another investigational product or
             procedure during the patient's participation in this study.

        In addition, a patient was ineligible if he or she met the following criteria during
        surgery:

          -  Patients who had any concurrent surgical procedure.

          -  Patients with unplanned multiple segmental resections of large intestine.

          -  Patients who converted from laparoscopic-assisted colectomy to traditional open
             colectomy.

          -  Patients who had unplanned, temporary or permanent colostomies, ileostomies, or the
             like placed.

          -  Patients who received intraoperative administration of opioids (other than fentanyl or
             analogs) or any other analgesic, local anesthetics, or anti-inflammatory agents.

          -  Patients who received Entereg.
