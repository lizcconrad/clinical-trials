    <description>SK Telecom will utilize 15 single-plex quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) assays to analyze an initial set of 300 clinical samples in China. SomaLogic will analyze these samples on the SOMAscan array (&gt;1000 proteins) for additional lung cancer biomarker candidates.</description>

        A total of 300 patients will be recruited from hospital pulmonary clinics. The study
        participants will have pulmonary nodules suspicious for lung cancer and a bronchial biopsy
        diagnosis of NSCLC or probable benign. Approximately half of the patients will be cases and
        half controls.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults â‰¥ 18 years of age

          -  Patients referred to pulmonologists, oncologists, or thoracic surgeons for diagnosis
             of suspicious pulmonary nodules as either lung cancer or benign and undergoing
             bronchoscopic biopsy

          -  Patients will be enrolled if the result of the bronchoscopic biopsy is a diagnosis of
             NSCLC or benign pulmonary nodule

          -  Cases: Patients with untreated non-small cell lung cancer, i.e. primary lung
             adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of early

          -  Computed tomography or X-Ray is available and shows a suspicious pulmonary nodule

          -  A biopsy or surgical resection to clarify the nature of the lung nodule is available
             (NSCLC or benign, including histological diagnosis) in both groups

          -  Controls: Patients must be available for a 6 month follow-up to confirm benign
             diagnosis

          -  A serum and plasma sample was collected prior to any treatment of the lung nodule
             beyond biopsy

          -  No other cancer diagnosis in the last 5 years excluding non-melanoma skin cancer

          -  Patients must be fully informed of the investigational nature of the procedure and
             sign an informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment for lung cancer by chemotherapy or surgery (excluding biopsy)

          -  Patients with benign nodules who are not able or willing to have a 6-month follow-up
             visit to confirm benign diagnosis

          -  Diagnosis or treatment of other cancer in the last 5 years excluding non-melanoma skin
             cancer. In the judgment of the clinical investigator, patients who are likely to be
             non compliant or uncooperative during the study.
