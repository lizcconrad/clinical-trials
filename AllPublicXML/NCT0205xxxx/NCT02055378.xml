      To compare the effect of myopia control between patients treated with low-concentration
      atropine eye drops combined with auricular acupoint stimulation and those treated with
      atropine alone.

      Myopia has been an increasing problem among school children, especially in Asian countries.
      High myopia is not only a refractive problem, but also a disease that can result in a number
      of sight-threatening complications such as macular degeneration, retinal detachment,
      glaucoma, and cataract. Atropine is a long-acting non-selective muscarinic antagonist that
      blocks accommodation by paralyzing ciliary muscles; it may affect remodeling of the sclera
      and suppress the elongation of axial length. Acupuncture and acupressure have been widely
      used in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years. Auricular acupoint stimulation
      by acupuncture or acupressure has been reported to improve visual acuity in myopic patients.
      Therefore, we want to compare the effect of myopia control between patients treated with
      low-concentration atropine eye drops combined with auricular acupoint stimulation and those
      who treated with atropine alone.
