      The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term safety follow-up of patients having been
      treated with HepaStem.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the SAF001 study is the long-term safety surveillance of the
      patients post infusion with HepaStem. Furthermore, the evolution of both the metabolic
      condition and the quality of life are followed. As much as possible, the surveillance will
      mimic the standard follow-up of the respective diseases (standard of care). The surveillance
      will end when the patient is undergoing an organ transplant or takes part in another research
      study. This surveillance will last up to a maximum of 48 months.

    <measure>Characterisation of the long term safety profile of HepaStem therapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of safety will be achieved by evaluating the following parameters
Physical examination
Vital signs
Laboratory tests
Liver tumor markers
Autoimmune markers related to liver pathology
Anti-HLA antibodies specific for donor cell haplotypes
Morphology of liver, bile ducts, and portal system by ultrasound
Morphology of the kidneys by ultrasound
Non-serious or serious Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) related to HepaStem therapy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To characterize the disease evolution after having received HepaStem therapy and to report on general safety.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment is based on the evaluation of:
Report on cognitive skills, behaviour, and health-related quality of life indicators
Non-serious or serious Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) related to concomitant medications or other causes
Indication I: Crigler-Najjar syndrome
Frequency and severity of metabolic decompensation
Metabolic parameters (serum total bilirubin)
Report on supportive treatment and any adjustment of phototherapy and medication (eg phenobarbital treatment)
Indication II: Urea cycle disorders
Frequency and severity of metabolic decompensation
Metabolic parameters (NH3 values, amino acids in plasma)
Report on supportive treatment and any adjustment of:
diet (natural protein intake, total protein intake, amino acid supplements)
Medication (eg nitrogen scavengers)</description>
