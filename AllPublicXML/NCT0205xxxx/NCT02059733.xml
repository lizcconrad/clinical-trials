      Study duration is expected to be completed in a period of 4 year. This study is a
      uncontrolled, open-label, non-randomized, parallel, and cross-sectional study. Total 130
      subjects, including 20 patients with PD, 20 patients with MSA, 20 patients with PSP, 20
      patients with CBS, 20 patients with VaP, 20 patients with ET, and 10 patients with DT, will
      be enrolled.

      Each evaluable subject involved in this study must fulfill all the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria according the subject grouping, each subject will have 3 visits in this study, as
      one screening visit, one imaging visit, and one safety evaluation visit.

      Safety measurement will be evaluated by medical history, vital signs, physical examinations,
      laboratory examinations and collecting of adverse events.

    <measure>Analyzing the differences of monoaminergic degeneration between each group by comparing the SUVR of 18F- DTBZ measured by the VOIs methods in each brain region.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>During this study, subjects will receive a single i.v. administration of approximately 10 mCi 18F-DTBZ immediately prior to imaging.
The proposed dose for this study is based on our phase I study. At the proposed human dose of 10 mCi, the whole body effective dose (ED) will be approximately 680 mrem. The estimated human ED is expected to be comparable to or below the range of other approved brain imaging agents, such as 18F-FDG.</description>

    <description>Statistical parametrical mapping (SPM) will be performed to compare the early-phase (cerebral perfusion) and delayed-phase (monoaminergic system) imaging of 18F- DTBZ PET in each group. The capability of 18F- DTBZ PET imaging as an imaging biomarker in differentiating PD and PM will be also investigated.</description>
