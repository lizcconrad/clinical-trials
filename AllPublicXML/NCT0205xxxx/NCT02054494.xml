  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV-infection is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Especially
      patients with low CD4+ counts have a higher incidence of structural heart disease. Myocardial
      T1 relaxation time, as well as T1-derived extracellular volume fraction are relatively new
      methods for non-invasive myocardial tissue characterization, including diffuse myocardial
      fibrosis.

      In our study HIV-patients with high and low CD4+ counts are examined on a 3T MRI scanner
      (Ingenia 3T, Philips Medical, Best, Netherlands). Scanning protocol includes common SSFP
      sequences, STIR imaging and LGE [Late gadolinium enhancement]. All HIV patients are treated
      in the HIV outpatient clinic of the hospital's Internal Medicine department and have an
      unremarkable history of cardiac disease. Patients are recruited from all over Germany. In
      order to obtain reference values, a subgroup of healthy, age-matched controls is included in
      this study.

      Aim of this study is to show differences in T1- and ECV-values in the investigated subgroups.
      In addition, we also want to create cut-off values for healthy and affected myocardium in
      asymptomatic HIV-infected patients. This study could show whether myocardial T1 mapping is a
      potential screening parameter for beginning heart disease as part of an HIV-infection, and
      whether an application in routine diagnostic is reasonable.

    <measure>Native T1 Relaxation Times</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement will be performed within 2 weeks after MRI scan</time_frame>
    <description>T1 relaxation times will be directly obtained form the T1 maps through ROI analysis. T1 maps will be analyzed using a segmental approach. T1 relaxation times are given in [ms].</description>

    <measure>Extracellular volume fraction (ECV)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement will be performed within 2 weeks after MRI scan</time_frame>
    <description>Hematocrit corrected ECV will be calculated using pre- and post-contrast T1 values for myocardium and blood pool using following formula:
ECV= (1⁄T1 &quot;myocardium post contrast&quot;-1⁄T1 &quot;myocadium pre contrast&quot;)/(1⁄T1 &quot;blood post contrast&quot;-1⁄ T1 &quot;blood pre contrast&quot;) x (1-hematocrit).
ECV is given in percentage.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiac function and aortic distensibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement will be performed within 2 weeks after MRI scan</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiac function (left ventricular endsystolic volume (LV-ESV), left ventricular enddiastolic volume (LV-EDV), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LV-EF)) will be determined offline using a dedicated software (ViewForum, Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands). LV-ESV and LV-EDV will be quantified manually by tracing the endocardial borders. LV-EF is given in percentage. LV-ESV and LV-EDV are given in [ml].
Aortic Distensibility will be calculated as:
Distensibility(10^-3 mmHg^-1 )=(Amax−Amin)/Amin x (Sys−Dias),where Amax and Amin represent the maximal and minimal cross-sectional area of the aorta on cine CMR images, and Sys and Dias represent the systolic and diastolic blood pressures (in millimetres of mercury), respectively.</description>
