  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Without rigorous, high-quality training materials, the results of the LUNG-SAFE study
      examining the global incidence and outcomes of severe lung failure (acute respiratory
      distress syndrome [ARDS]) could be confused by either under-recognition of patients with, or
      misclassification of patients without, ARDS. This problem has been previously identified with
      the use of the prior ARDS definitions, particularly in patients with milder severity of
      illness. Importantly, the chest x-ray criteria in the ARDS definition has demonstrated only
      moderate reliability when applied by experts, although this can be improved through the use
      of training radiographs (as will be used in this educational module). The investigators
      hypothesize that the training from the educational module will allow more accurate diagnosis
      of ARDS by data collectors/study coordinators participating in the LUNG-SAFE study.

      In this LUNG-SAFE sub-study, the investigators will evaluate the effect of a brief online
      educational module on correctly identifying patients (i.e., standardized cases) with ARDS
      according to the Berlin Definition.

      The investigators hypothesize that the training from the educational module will allow more
      accurate diagnosis of ARDS according to the Berlin Definition by participating data
      collectors/study coordinators.

      Data collectors and study coordinators from ICUs participating in LUNG-SAFE would be
      randomized (by simple random number generator) to one of the following online educational
      streams:

        1. Educational module completion followed by evaluation

        2. Evaluation followed by educational module completion

      Limited demographic data will be collected from the respondents, along with their responses
      to the 15 multiple choice test questions. Time spent viewing the educational module will also
      be collected.
