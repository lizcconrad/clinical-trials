        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Asian male aged at least 20 years at the time of signing the informed consent form

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Evidence of metastatic disease (bone and/or visceral), excluding node lesion only, on
             radiographic examination, whether from bone scan (bone lesions) or other imaging
             modality (computed tomography [CT] scan/magnetic resonance imaging [MRI])

          -  Chemical or surgical castration verified by levels of serum testosterone ≤50 ng/dL
             (1.75 nmol/L), Evidence of progressive disease after castration levels of testosterone
             have been achieved

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer within 2 years prior to
             the start of study treatment

          -  Previous anticancer therapy using radiation, biologics or vaccines and including
             sipuleucel-T (Provenge®) within 4 weeks prior to the start of study treatment and
             abiraterone, TAK700 or MDV3100 within 2 weeks prior to the start of study treatment.
             Before inclusion, abiraterone, TAK700 or MDV3100 related adverse effect must have been
             resolved to NCI-CTCAE v4.03 Grade ≤1. If radiation therapy is applied after Baseline
             scan, a new Baseline scan needs to be done at least 4 weeks after the radiation
             therapy

          -  Therapy with antiandrogens within 4 weeks (within 6 weeks for bicalutamide e.g.
             Casodex®) prior to the start of study treatment

          -  Concurrent use of other anticancer agents or treatments, with the exception of ongoing
             treatment with luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists or antagonists,
             denosumab (Prolia®) or bisphosphonate (e.g. zoledronic acid), which are allowed.
             Ongoing treatment should be kept at a stable schedule; however, if medically required,
             a change of dose, compound, or both is allowed

          -  Prostate cancer pain that requires ongoing treatment with narcotic analgesics or
             warrants the initiation of radio- or chemotherapy

          -  Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) &gt;100 ng/mL
