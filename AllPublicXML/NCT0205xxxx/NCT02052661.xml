    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term persistence of immunity to hepatitis B
      in adolescents aged 12-13 years who were vaccinated with four doses of Infanrix™-Hexa in
      infancy and to assess the anamnestic response, immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of a
      single challenge dose of the hepatitis B vaccine Engerix™-B Kinder.
