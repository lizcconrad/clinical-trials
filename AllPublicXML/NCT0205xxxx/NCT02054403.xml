      Rationale: Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) causes high rates of blindness, either by
      means of a painful attack of acute angle closure glaucoma or unnoticed over a period of many
      years. Patients with angle closure are particularly at risk but can be detected during an
      ophthalmological examination and sent for early preventive (laser) intervention. Current
      practice shows that patients at risk of PACG are frequently missed during routine
      examinations. Moreover, new imaging techniques like swept source optical coherence tomography
      (SS-OCT), are emerging with which the angle of the anterior chamber can be imaged in great
      detail with no burden for the patient. These techniques are already used in clinical practice
      and replace and complete part of the ophthalmic examination. However, in Caucasians, it is
      not yet known to what extent angle closure is detected in regular care and can be detected
      with this OCT device. There are few published data concerning angle closure and PACG in
      Caucasians and its characteristics.

      Objective: To quantify the presence of angle closure by gonioscopy in patients at risk of
      angle closure on SS-OCT. Secondary objectives are to quantify the presence of an increased
      intra-ocular pressure during the day or after dark provocation, to quantify morphometric
      details of the anterior chamber, structural changes, and corneal endothelial cells and to
      quantify the functional changes of the visual field.

      Study design: prospective, observational, descriptive study. Study population: Caucasian
      patients, presenting at the outpatient clinic of the University Eye Clinic Maastricht, aged
      40 to 80 years, who are diagnosed with angle closure on SS-OCT.

      Intervention (if applicable): Not applicable. Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study
      parameter is assessment of the anterior chamber angle according to gonioscopy. Secondary
      study parameters are the presence of an increased intra-ocular pressure (IOP) (&gt;21 mmHg)
      during the day or after dark provocation (IOP rise from baseline), morphometric details of
      the anterior chamber, structural changes of the retinal nerve fiber layer, number of corneal
      endothelial cells and functional changes of the visual field Hypothesis: It is hypothesised
      that, based on its resolution and ease of use, SS-OCT is a suitable imaging technique to
      identify patients with or at risk of angle closure. It will be of value as an additional
      diagnostic instrument and may even replace gonioscopy.

        This study will consist of Caucasian patients, aged 40-80 years. Patients will be recruited
        at the University Eye Clinic Maastricht, the Netherlands. All study participants are
        derived from the study 'Caucasian patients with angle closure on SS-OCT', METC 13-4-108.
