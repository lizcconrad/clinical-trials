  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop a simple blood and urine test that we would perform before patients start their
      treatment to predict the risk that their bladder cancer might come back. To develop this test
      the investigators plan to analyze blood, urine and cancer tissue from bladder cancer patients
      and follow them closely during and after treatment. This will include looking for changes in
      proteins and genes that might play a role in bladder cancer biology. The investigators will
      then compare the information obtained from the studies of blood, urine and cancer tissue
      between patients that are cured and those whose cancer comes back. The knowledge about these
      differences between patients can then potentially be used to develop a blood or urine test to
      tell us who has a high risk for having bladder cancer come back.
