      A Phase 2a study to evaluate the effects of an investigational compound administered at 200
      mg, twice daily (BID), for 6 weeks in adult subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) on
      metformin background therapy.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    On 25April2014, study was terminated before any dosing due to an AE of safety concern that
    occurred in protocol B1731003 with the same drug.
