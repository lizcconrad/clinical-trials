      The main objective of this study is to explore experiences and insights from exceptional
      patients, patients with cancer that were considered by their physicians as having exceptional
      course of survival related to their specific disease state.

      A secondary future objective of this study is to develop an international multicenter
      registry and database documenting and examining the experience of patients with cancer that
      were considered by their physicians as having exceptional course of survival related to their
      specific disease state.

      This pilot study will utilize a population registry in one location (Israel) to identify
      exceptional patients with one terminal disease. Pancreatic malignancy, advanced lung cancer;
      advanced stomach cancer and advanced esophageal cancer have been chosen as the specific
      terminal disease, based on its extremely high mortality rate. These specific situations can
      apply to a strict definition set by Gotay: &quot;An exceptional survivor is a cancer patient who
      is alive when the probability of doing so was less than 25% of living for five or more years
      , for a given type and stage.&quot; [48] These types of cancers are associated with a 5 year
      survival of less than 15% and even with the latest technology and advances in cancer care;
      there is a very slight improvement in survival of these patients.

      The study will be divided into three stages:

        1. Identifying the patients Clalit HMO will be approached to obtain ethical committee's
           approval to the study and access to the HMO registry. Clalit HMO is the largest HMO in
           Israel with over 4 million members (out of a total population of 7.5 million). After
           securing this approval, patients will be identified through the HMO registry. We will
           try to identify patients with a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer advanced lung cancer,
           advanced stomach cancer and advanced esophageal cancer that are still alive from
           2001-2008.

           Each patient's physician will be contacted to verify that the diagnosis is correct. The
           physician will be asked to contact the patient and obtain his or her consent to
           participate in the study. Consenting patients will be sent a letter signed by their
           primary physician that describes the study and indicates that someone will be calling
           them to invite them to participate in the study. The letter will clarify that
           participation is completely voluntary and declining to participate will not affect them
           in any way.

        2. Approaching the patients Patients consenting to participate in the study will be
           contacted by our qualitative researcher (SG) which will interview them following a
           qualitative study protocol

        3. Analysis of findings and preparation of summary report.

    <description>Understanding the patient's experience of a disease process is important in assessing and treating a complicated illness. Qualitative research allows participants to describe an experience in the way that is most meaningful to them. A qualitative approach is deemed as the most appropriate to capture the perceptions and experiences of exceptional patients. This study is using an exploratory, qualitative approach consisting of in-depth, semi-structured interviews. This approach has been widely used in health care to better understand the patient experience. Descriptive analysis of sociodemographic, disease-related, and treatment-related factors were conducted to characterize the sample and to verify that sampling criteria were met. The study endpoint is aimed at reaching saturation of recurring themes that were extracted in the interviews.</description>
