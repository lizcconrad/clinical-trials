  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of a whole own (autologous)
      umbilical cord blood transfusion in the first 5 days after birth if the baby is born
      premature &lt;34 weeks and developed anemia of prematurity.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to conduct the investigation of the safety and efficacy of
      autologous cord blood infusion in premature neonates who demonstrate anemia due to
      prematurity (most common prematurity complication). However, premature infants reveal a high
      risk of other acute complications, including brain injury (e.g., intraventricular hemorrhage;
      IVH), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), as
      well as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Therefore,
      prematurity is considered one of the main causes of neonatal deaths. The preterm neonates
      need transfusion of allogenic whole peripheral blood or any of its components at a time of
      anemia of prematurity development. In contrast, other prematurity complications do not have
      effective treatment nor preventive strategies. We will enroll premature neonates born
      premature (&lt;34 weeks of gestation) who developed anemia of prematurity and had their own
      autologous cord blood collected for subsequent transfusion. Next, we will test tolerability,
      safety and efficacy of autogenic whole cord blood infusion and evaluate the frequency of
      premature complications in neonates after transfusion. Besides, this pilot study will test
      feasibility of technical collection, preparation and infusion of a neonate's own umbilical
      cord blood within the first 5 days after birth.
