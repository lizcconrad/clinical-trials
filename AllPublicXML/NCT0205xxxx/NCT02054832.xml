  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to determine if there is a change in quality and quantity of
      sleep perceived by adults and children with GSD and their parents while starting a modified
      UCCS (Glycosade) to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia. The investigators also aim to evaluate if
      there is a change in quality of life perceived by adults and children and their parents with
      Glycosade.

      This is a prospective cohort study. Patients above 2 years old and their parents (for
      children only) will be enrolled during their usual follow-up. Parents will be asked to
      complete a quality of sleep questionnaire (as it pertains to both child and parent) relating
      to the past month on their current dietary regimen (standard UCCS) and a quality of life
      questionnaire (as it pertains to the child only). Parents will then complete a sleep diary
      (for both child and parent) and both child and parent will wear an actigraph that will record
      movements during sleep over a 1 week period. Adult GSD patients will complete their own
      questionnaires. Following this first assessment, they will be hospitalised over a 24 hour
      period as part of standard of care to start the modified UCCS, Glycosade, under supervision
      and with a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor. Following hospitalization, the family
      will return home. Glucose will be monitored with the aid of the CGM sensor for 5 to 7 days.
      The actigraphy and the sleep diary will be repeated after 2 weeks (for 1 week) while on
      Glycosade. One month after starting the modified UCCS, questionnaires on quality of sleep and
      quality of life will be repeated.

    <description>Parents will be asked to complete a quality of sleep questionnaire (as it pertains to both child and parent) relating to the past month on their current dietary regimen (standard UCCS). Parents will also complete a sleep diary (for both child and parent) and both child and parent will wear an actigraph that will record movements during sleep over a 1 week period prior to Glycosade. The actigraphy and the sleep diary will be repeated after 2 weeks (for 2 weeks) while on Glycosade. The quality of sleep questionnaire will be repeated after 1 month on Glycosade. Adult GSD patients will complete their own questionnaires.</description>

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Parents (as it pertains to their child) and adult patients will be asked to complete quality of life questionnaire prior to Glycosade and 1 month after starting this new diet.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>To describe the variability in glucose fluctuations with Glycosade using a CGM sensor.</measure>

    <description>Glucose will be monitored with the aid of the CGM sensor for 5 to 7 days while starting Glycosade.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>To establish if metabolic control is maintained using Glycosade.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Metabolic control in hospital after starting Glycosade will be defined as the absence of deterioration of biochemical data at the end of fast compared to during the fast.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the safety profile of Glycosade, based on the frequency of side effects, e.g. gastrointestinal side effects while receiving Glycosade.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be constantly monitored for adverse events throughout the study. They will be asked to keep a diary to document side effects while receiving Glycosade. They will also be asked at each visit whether they experienced any known or unknown side effects.</description>
