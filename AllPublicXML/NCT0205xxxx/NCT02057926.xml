  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study was to evaluate the histological impact of treatment with
      tetracycline (TTC) solution of two layers collagen membranes (CMs) bio-degradation, in ridge
      preservation technique (RPT). Additionally, secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect
      of TTC on bacterial colonization and inflammatory response. This is a randomized simple-blind
      clinical trial. Consecutive patients referred to the Department of Periodontology at
      Universitat Internacional de Catalunya (Barcelona, Spain), between November 2009 and April
      2011, were included in the study. This study was based on data collected from 20 surgical
      sites in 10 systemically healthy patients requiring 2 extractions with SPT. Before starting
      the surgery, the two teeth of each selected patient were randomized in two groups. The test
      group underwent RPT with CMs embedded with TTC solution (CMs TTC), and the control group was
      performed without TTC solution (CMs NO TTC). Randomization was performed using SPSS software
      (version 18, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). In the test group, both membranes were first
      dipped for 5 minutes in TTC solution (50 mg/ml). This involved the use of 250 mg tablets of
      TTC and 5 ml of saline that were mixed in a sterile trough. A sample of the membrane used in
      each SPT was retained as a negative control sample. The membrane sample was retrieved 7 days
      after initial surgery. At 14 days the suture was removed and a new control was performed
      within 1 month. A sample from the negative control, test and control group was analyzed from
      each patient. The specimens were fixed in a 10% formalin solution, dehydrated in a series of
      alcohols, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned in 4-5μ. The sections were stained with
      hematoxylin and eosin and examined with an Olympus BH-2 optical microscope. The stained
      sections were photographed with a digital camera mounted on an optical microscope at
      magnification (x100, x200 and x400). According to the findings of the present study, we can
      conclude that CMs exhibit rapid degradation when exposed to the oral environment.
      Histological interpretation suggests that CMs immersed in 50mg/ml TTC solution delay the CM
      degradation when exposed to the oral environment. Statistical evaluation did not show any
      difference in bacterial colonization and inflammatory response, but the findings may also be
      affected by the limited sample size.

      The limits of the present study are the absence of histomorphometric analysis, the sample
      size, and the lack of a long-term evaluation with clinical evidence of the advantages of this
      technique. More clinical studies in humans are require to confirm the effect of TTC in CMs
      degradation before we can make recommendations.
