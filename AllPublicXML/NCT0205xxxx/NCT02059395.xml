  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      In cardiac arrest survival rates dramatically increase when bystanders are present and
      initiate Basic Life Support (BLS). However, even though serious efforts have been made, skill
      retention after a traditional time-based BLS course for laypeople remains suboptimal. In
      contrast, a mastery learning-based educational approach was shown to be efficacious and might
      be promising even for laypersons. Therefore the investigators aim to evaluate the impact of a
      mastery learning-based BLS course on skills retention of BLS in laypeople.

      Methods:

      Forty laypeople without previous BLS experiences will be randomized into the traditional
      time-based BLS course group (Control - TB group) or mastery learning-based group
      (Intervention - ML group).

      Both groups will receive BLS training consisting of 6 successive stations including diagnosis
      of cardiac arrest, chest compression, ventilation, one-rescuer BLS, two-rescuer BLS and AED
      use. In the ML group, subjects will deliberately practice and receive feedback at each
      station until a pre-set target level is reached. Subjects will be allowed to proceed to the
      next station only when they achieve the required target level of performance. In contrast,
      participants of the TB group will be taught the same 6 stations in two hours, according to
      standard American Heart Association BLS criteria. All subjects will have an assessment of
      knowledge and skills immediately after teaching (immediate post-test) and at four months
      (retention post-test).

      Implications:

      Previous research has shown that mastery learning-based education improves learners'
      procedural skill performance. The investigators study will determine the impact of a mastery
      learning-based BLS course on skill retention in laypeople.

    <measure>Skill Retention Estimated From the Change of AHA Heartsaver Total Score From Immediate Post-test to Retention Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The official AHA Heartsave adult CPR AED Skill Sheet checklist for single-rescuer BLS was used to capture participants' skills for single-rescuer BLS and defibrillation with an AED. The AHA Heartsaver checklist has 11 action items, participant receives 1 point when an action on the checklist is performed. Therefore, the total score range from 0-11, with higher values represent a better outcome. Immediate post-test and retention test skill performance were evaluated by 2 independent raters. Skill retention was estimated by calculating the change in score from immediate post-test to retention test.</description>
