  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The consultation-referral process is complex, involving several steps including 1) the PCP
      recognizing the need for specialist advice/intervention, 2) patient agreement on seeing the
      specialist, 3) referral letter and information sent to specialist, 4) appointment booked and
      communicated, 5) patient visit(s) with the specialist and 6) communication back to the PCP.

      There are many factors during this process which limit the effectiveness and efficiency of
      patient care. These include inequitable access for patients and providers, long wait times
      before specialist advice received/implemented, delayed communication and mismatched consult
      expectations. These gaps result in significant breakdowns in transitions of care,
      inappropriate treatment, patient dissatisfaction and potential harm. Moreover, not all
      individuals are willing or able to travel to see specialists in a large academic medical
      centre even when recommended by the PCP.

      eConsultation has the potential for improving transitions in care through improved
      communication ensuring that patients are seen by the right specialist, when necessary, with
      the right information and in a timely manner. The goal of this project is to evaluate the
      impact of eConsultation on specialist referral rates.

      Research Question: What is the impact of, and the patients' perceptions of, an electronic
      consultation service (eConsult) between primary care professionals and specialists?

      The goal of this project is to evaluate a novel electronic referral-consultation process
      between primary care providers and specialists utilizing e-consultation which will:

        1. provide patient-specific advice to primary care providers (PCPs) in place of a formal
           consultation

        2. provide patient-specific advice to PCPs for further investigations or treatment options
           prior to the formal consultation, resulting in fewer visits required with the specialist

        3. provide opportunity for PCPs to receive patient-specific advice on patients previously
           seen by a specialist but no longer followed in the specialty clinic, resulting in
           enhanced confidence of transition of care back to primary care providers thus promoting
           best practices and continuity of care

      Intervention: Building on a recent successful pilot project, and using a pre-existing secure
      web-based collaboration space, primary care providers will submit a patient-specific clinical
      question to a specialist using a standardized electronic form that permits attachments (e.g.,
      laboratory results, digital images). The specialist responds within one week by either: i)
      directly answering the question (negating the need for referral), ii) asking for additional
      patient information, or iii) requesting an in-person referral. Results from the pilot study
      (n=18 primary care providers) demonstrated a high level of provider satisfaction and resulted
      in the avoidance of 43% of referrals.

      Design: A mixed methods evaluation approach will be used to meet the objectives of this
      study.

      Quantitative: This will be a clustered randomized controlled trial using a stepped wedge
      design, a type of crossover study in which different groups (in this case, primary care
      providers) cross over from the control arm to the intervention arm at different time points.
      100 providers from across the province of Ontario will be recruited and allocated to either
      Group 1 (50 providers) or Group 2 (50 providers). Please note that in this study, the
      investigators are recruiting primary care providers only. Group 1 providers will have access
      to specialties already available through eConsult in the first year of intervention, while
      Group 2 will use standard referral practices during this time period and will begin using
      eConsult in the second year of intervention. This offset in start times allows the
      investigators to control for temporal effects, as Group 2 will serve as a control for Group
      1. This stepped wedge approach helps overcome several pragmatic issues and avoids ethical
      concerns as all providers will eventually be offered access to the eConsult service.

      Referral data will be collected from the Insitute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (Ontario),
      the Ontario Health Insurance Plan and IPDB databases for all 100 providers . The change in
      referral rates from the baseline to the end of the study for both Groups will be analyzed,
      while controlling for temporal effects.

      Sample size: With 50 providers per arm, the investigators will be able to detect a change of
      0.06 referrals/patient/year (referral rate for 12 specialties (# of available specialties
      increases monthly): 0.31 referrals/patient/year) with 80% power using a two-sided test at a
      5% level of significance and using a coefficient of variation of 0.38 to account for
      clustering.

      In year two or three, the investigators will recruit randomly selected patients whose cases
      involved the eConsult system, to gain insight into their views on the acceptability of
      electronic consultations.

      Quantitative Analysis: A clustered, multi-level Poisson regression analysis will be conducted
      using the stepped wedge analysis approach outlined by Hussey and Hughes to examine the impact
      of the eConsult system on referral rates while accounting for practice (model, urban/rural),
      provider (age, sex, years since graduation, baseline referral rate, foreign trained) and
      patient-level (age, sex, socioeconomic status, health status, baseline referral rate)
      characteristics.

      Qualitative Analysis: Patient interview data will be evaluated using a constant comparative
      approach with a combination of inductively and deductively determined codes.

      Expected outcomes: The eConsult service has the potential to greatly reduce the number of
      unnecessary referrals, which will reduce overall wait times and provide specialists with more
      time to see patients with more urgent needs. By implementing this system, it is anticipated
      that there will be a reduction in avoidable referrals, decreased patient wait times and
      improved communication between primary and specialty care.
