      Many years myoectomy for Morrow was the gold standard in the treatment of obstructive
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Currently more retrospective data in the literature about the
      good results the extended septal myectomy. But the question remains what is best for patients
      with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and severe mitral insufficiency: use extended
      myoectomy with mitral valve repair a or replacement.

    <description>Procedure: extended myoectomy, mitral valve surgery
Will be included in a group of 41 patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and severe mitral insufficiency. Intraoperatively for all patients will be executed TEE to calculate the volume of excision. All patients will be performed extended myoectomy with full isscheniem subvalvular apparatus and mitral valve replacement.
Evaluation results will be made myoectomy as TEE and direct tensiometer.</description>

    <description>Procedure: extended myoectomy, mitral valve surgery
Will be included in a group of 41 patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and severe mitral insufficiency. Intraoperatively for all patients will be executed TEE to calculate the volume of excision. All patients will be performed extended myoectomy which supplemented resection and release of the papillary muscles and the mitral valve repair. Results of mitral valve repair will be more appreciated intraoperatively. In case of unsatisfactory MV repair will reconnect the device artificial circulation and mitral valve replacement. There after, patients will be moved to the first group.
Evaluation results will be made myoectomy as TEE and direct tensiometer .</description>

    <description>The scheme of Extended septal myectomy: Two parallel incisions were made into the septal bulge and connected to remove the muscle mass. Myectomy was extended to the base of the papillary muscles, when midseptal thickening was present. The papillary muscles were grasped and pushed medially to visualize the abnormal connections between the papillary muscles and the anterior wall of the ventricle. A blade was used to divide the thickened abnormal attachments. A pituitary rongeur may be used to resect a portion of the junction of the papillary and lateral wall. This reduces the diameter of the papillary muscle and allows for posterior displacement of the anterior mitral leaflet. Division of abnormal attachments and thinning of the papillary muscles is critical for the treatment of SAM.</description>
