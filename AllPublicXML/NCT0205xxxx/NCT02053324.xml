  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess a new treatment for patients with liver tumor
      metastases from colorectal cancer. The treatment has never been used in humans before. The
      treatment foresees the use of two compounds: AvdinOX and [177Lu]DOTA-biotin.

      AvidinOX is a new compound, essentially a natural protein obtained from hen eggs, while
      [177Lu]DOTA-biotin is a new chemical compound resulting from the combination of the
      DOTA-biotin (also deriving from a natural vitamin which is biotin) with the 177Lutetium, an
      atom which emits radiation.

      AvidinOX will be injected directly into the metastases in the liver and [177Lu]DOTA-biotin
      will be injected into the arm vein.

      One specific property of AvidinOX is that it chemically links to the tumor tissues when it is
      injected while maintaining the capacity to take up [177Lu]DOTA-biotin. Once locally bound in
      tumor tissue, AvidinOX becomes an &quot;artificial receptor&quot; for intravenously injected
      [177Lu]DOTA-biotin, which allows an internal radiation therapy of the tumor tissue.

      The treatment of liver metastases with local injection of AvidinOX and the following
      intra-venous injection of [177Lu]DOTA-biotin could be simpler and more tolerable than the
      current available treatments.

      Secondary objectives

        1. To evaluate proportional 177Lu-ST2210 tumor binding, as a function of total tumor load,

        3. To evaluate whole body dosimetry of IV 177Lu-ST2210 after prior AvidinOX injection
           (radiation safety dosimetry)

        4. To record individual tumor dosimetry

        5. To evaluate preliminary efficacy of {AvidinOX + 177Lu-ST2210}-complex in reducing tumor
           size

        6. To evaluate whole body safety dosimetry and dose linearity of IV administered
           177Lu-ST2210 after prior intra-lesional injection of AvidinOX
