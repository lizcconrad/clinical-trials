    <textblock>
      Introduction: Ankle sprains, the most common sports-related musculoskeletal injury, account
      for approximately 25% of sports injuries. An estimated 40% of these individuals will progress
      to develop chronic functional ankle instability (CFAI), which can significantly affect
      athletic performance and activities of daily life. Stresses from the injury can damage the
      ligaments, muscles, nerves and mechanoreceptors. It is widely accepted that ankle
      proprioception is critical for balance and that individuals with CFAI demonstrate decreased
      proprioception and altered muscular function, which impairs postural stability. The goal of
      this study is to determine if a single application of electroacupuncture can have an
      immediate positive outcome related to balance in individuals with CFAI.

      Methods: This single blinded randomized trial will include 12 subjects receiving a single
      application of electroacupuncture and 12 subjects in the placebo group receiving sham
      electroacupuncture. Subjects aged 18-50 with a history of unilateral inversion ankle
      sprain(s) and chronic symptoms of instability will be selected. Balance will be assessed pre-
      and post-treatment using force plate data during a single-leg stance and via the Star
      Excursion Balance Test (SEBT). GB-34 and GB-40 will be used for the experimental group and
      non-traditional points on the medial aspect of the leg will be used for the sham
      electroacupuncture group. Both will be connected to the electrical stimulation unit for 10
      minutes. Results from this study may inform future research investigating the ability of EA
      at decreasing the risk of ankle sprains, improving perceived stability, and reducing the risk
      of subsequent degenerative changes.

      A single application of electroacupuncture improves balance greater than placebo control in
      subjects with chronic functional ankle instability

      Specific Aim #1:

      Evaluate the effect of a single application of electroacupuncture on center of pressure mean
      total velocity in individuals with chronic functional ankle instability during single-leg
      stance compared to placebo control.

      H0: EA will not improve postural sway during single-leg stance compared to placebo control.

      Specific Aim #2:

      Describe the effects of a single application of EA compared to placebo on mean total
      displacement, as well as the mediolateral and anterioposterior components during single-leg
      stance for possible trends to inform hypothesis generation.

      Specific Aim #3:

      Correlate the results from the Star Excursion Balance Test with results of the single-leg
      stance measures to inform hypothesis generation.

    <description>Subjects will do balance assessment in lab. In treatment room, practitioner will clean insertion area with alcohol swab, allow adequate time to dry, and insert 2 Asia-Med Special No 16 (0.30x30mm) needles: one at proximal insertion of fibularis longus anterior to fibular neck, in proximity to common fibular nerve (GB-34); one over sinus tarsi and lateral ligaments of ankle mortise (GB-40). Needles will be inserted approximately 1-2cm, connected for 10 min at 2Hz to electrical stimulation (ITO ES-130, 500 ohm test load, 1 to 500Hz). Needles will disposed of in sharps container. Area will be wiped with long handled cotton swab, pressure will be applied for 2 seconds. Subjects will be asked to slowly get up from table and return to lab for second balance assessment.</description>

    <description>As with experimental group, controls will do balance assessment pre- and post-intervention. Streitberger placebo needles (Asia-Med, 0.03 x 30 mm), blunted with a telescoping mechanism, will be used. Subjects will feel slight prick, and shaft will telescope into handle, creating illusion of skin penetration. Needles will be held in place by plastic ring covered by a bandage. They are validated for blinding. They will be placed over non-traditional acupuncture points on medial aspect of leg, in direct opposition to treatment group needles. Needle placement is not intended to produce therapeutic outcome. The needles will be connected to a wire, which will be turned on for 10 minutes but no stimulation will be felt.</description>
