The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) is a disease-specific patient-reported outcomes measure for patients with heart failure. It consists of 23 items, is comprised of 7 clinically relevant scales (Symptom Frequency, Symptom Burden, Symptom Stability, Physical Limitation, Social Limitation, Quality of Life, and Self-Efficacy), and yields 3 summary scores (Clinical Summary, Total Symptom, and Overall Summary Scores). Scale and summary scores range between 0 and 100, with higher scores indicating better health status (eg, better functioning, fewer symptoms, better quality of life).</description>

        <title>Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary Score (Phase II)</title>
        <description>To evaluate whether isosorbide mononitrate improves quality of life in comparison to placebo. • The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) is a disease-specific patient-reported outcomes measure for patients with heart failure. It consists of 23 items, is comprised of 7 clinically relevant scales (Symptom Frequency, Symptom Burden, Symptom Stability, Physical Limitation, Social Limitation, Quality of Life, and Self-Efficacy), and yields 3 summary scores (Clinical Summary, Total Symptom, and Overall Summary Scores). Scale and summary scores range between 0 and 100, with higher scores indicating better health status (eg, better functioning, fewer symptoms, better quality of life).Higher values of the overall KCCQ score are considered to be better than lower values.</description>
