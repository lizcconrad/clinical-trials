  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to conduct a phase 2 study to assess whether the addition of acitretin to
      vemurafenib therapy is able to decrease the rate of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC)
      development, a known side effect of vemurafenib therapy, in patients with advanced melanoma.
      Further, we seek a preliminary assessment as to whether the addition of acitretin to
      vemurafenib enhances the clinical efficacy of this anti-melanoma agent.

    <description>Vemurafenib is self-administered at a dose of 960 mg (four 240 mg tablets) twice daily. The first dose should be taken in the morning and the second dose should be taken in the evening approximately 12 hours later. Each dose can be taken with or without a meal. Acitretin will initially be dosed at 25 mg orally per day with dosing altered every two weeks with a 50 mg dose.</description>

            <description>Vemurafenib is self-administered at a dose of 960 mg (four 240 mg tablets) twice daily. The first dose should be taken in the morning and the second dose should be taken in the evening approximately 12 hours later. Each dose can be taken with or without a meal. Acitretin will initially be dosed at 25 mg orally per day with dosing altered every two weeks with a 50 mg dose.
Acitretin: A combination of Acitretin and Vemurafenib will be administered to determine if it reduces the incidence of biopsy-confirmed cSCC at 6 months
