    <textblock>
      The definition of biliary fistula is heterogeneous and the more accepted is that proposed by
      the ISGLS. We devised a precise definition of post-resectional biliary fistula and a
      well-established policy both for its disclosure and management.Aim was the validation of our
      definition, and management of biliary fistula after hepatic resection in a large prospective
      cohort of patients and its comparison with that of the International Study Group of Liver
      Surgery (ISGLS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data on abdominal drains and on clinical, pathological and short-term outcome were reviewed
      in a prospective cohort of patients who underwent hepatic resection between 2004 and 2012.
      Drains were maintained at least 7 days, and the bilirubin levels were measured in POD3, 5,
      and 7. Drains were removed if the bilirubin level in POD7 was inferior than in POD5, and less
      than 10 mg/dl. Statistical analysis on prognostic factors for biliary fistula was performed.

    <description>The first study endpoint was the ability of our criteria to detect and manage bile leak after liver surgery. For this purpose we considered the rate of bile leaks detected and managed using the surgical drains, and the rate of abdominal collections that required any surgical or radiological intervention after drains removal.</description>
