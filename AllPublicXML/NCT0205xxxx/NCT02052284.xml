  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extremely low birth weight infants have significant water loss through their skin immediately
      after birth. This significant fluid loss is because they have large amounts of fluids, have
      immature skin and large surface area. Loss of fluids is associated with many complications.
      The investigators hypothesize that application of sterile water to the skin of these infants
      is associated with decreased fluid requirements in the first week of life , improve skin
      integrity and decrease some complications of prematurity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants have significant transepidermal water loss
      immediately after birth. This significant fluid loss is related to proportionally large
      extracellular pool of fluids, the immaturity of the skin barrier, and the relatively large
      surface area exposed to evaporation. Water depletion in this population is associated with
      development of significant electrolyte imbalance in the form of hypernatremia, hyperkalemia,
      hyperglycemia and hyperosmolarity. In order to compensate for these losses, clinicians have
      to progressively increase fluid intake. Excessive fluid intake in the first days of life is
      associated with worsening patent ductus artriosus (PDA), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC),
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and mortality. Also skin integrity is important to protect
      against skin infection and secondary sepsis. Based on recent studies and relevant data, the
      risk of sepsis in ELBW is up to 40% nationwide, but only about 25% at GWUH Water application
      is a benign treatment that is routinely applied to the skin of premature babies and was shown
      to decrease skin colonization. The current practice at GWUH is to clean the bodies of
      premature infants using a piece of damp cloth with warm water. This is performed at birth and
      consequently every other days. The study group will receive more frequent and standardized
      applications. The investigators hypothesize that application of sterile water in ELBW infants
      is associated with decreased fluid requirements in the first week of life. As a secondary
      outcome, the investigators hypothesize that sterile water application is associated with
      improved skin integrity, decreased incidence of BPD with no increased incidence of skin or
      systemic infections.

    <description>The control group will receive standard skin care of the NICU, which does not include specific measures to modulate skin-barrier function.The current practice at GWUH NICU is that nurses clean the bodies of newborns less than 1000 grams using a piece of damp cloth with warm water. This is performed at birth and consequently every other days.</description>

    <description>The study group will undergo a protocol of sterile water application in addition to routine skin care of the NICU. The study group will receive more frequent and standardized applications. A commercially sterile water bottle (EnfamilÂ® Water) will be kept inside the isolette, to be maintained at isolette temperature, and will be changed on a daily basis. Nurses use sterile gloves as a routine for care of ELBW infants. A 2 inches x 2 inches sterile gauze will be soaked in sterile water and gently applied to all skin of the baby excluding umbilical cord and IV lines sites. This procedure will be repeated every 4 hours with routine patient care for the first 1 week of life.</description>
