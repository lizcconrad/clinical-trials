  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, randomized, parallel group two-stage phase 1 study with a
      phase 2 expansion component in pts with recurrent or metastatic APRpos uterine endometrioid
      adenocarcinoma. Stage 1: Six dose cohorts, 5 using the extended release tablet (ER)
      formulation (10 mg BID, 20 mg BID, 30 mg BID, 40 mg BID, 50 mg BID) and 1 using the
      immediate-release (IR) tablet formulation 100 mg QD will be randomized in parallel. After
      enrollment of 36 patients in Stage 1, a dose of 50 mg BID was determined to be the RP2D.
      Stage 2: An additional 10 patients with recurrent or metastatic APRpos uterine endometrioid
      adenocarcinoma (Stage 2a) will be enrolled at the RP2D. Based on the response in Stage 2a,
      the cohort will be further expanded by up to 19 more patients to a total of 29 patients to
      confirm the efficacy and safety profile of onapristone in this selected patient population
      (Stage 2b).
