  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide increase in the incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens is alarming.
      Antimicrobial treatment is a risk factor for the isolation of MDR pathogens and can therefore
      contribute to the observed trend. Differences in the degree of selection pressure caused by
      various antimicrobials have not been systematically investigated until today. The aim of the
      proposed project is the determination of the impact of antibiotic treatment on the copy
      number of resistance genes in the human intestinal microbiome using metagenome shotgun
      sequencing. The resistance gene count in the gastrointestinal tract will be determined in a
      clinical cohorts of patients treated with either ciprofloxacin or cotrimoxazol as
      monotherapy. The subsequent quantification and comparison of the selection pressure
      facilitates the application of antibiotics with a lower potential to select for resistance.
      To achieve this goal, a self-controlled, prospective observational epidemiological study will
      be performed at two centres of the German Centre for Infection Research (Tübingen, Cologne).

    <description>Stool samples will be collected from patients at four time points:
t0 (baseline) The time point serves as a control. The stool sample will be obtained before treatment start.
t1 (early phase) The time point reflects the early phase at day 1 of treatment with either ciprofloxacin or cotrimoxazol.
t2 (early-late phase) The time point reflects the early-late phase at day 3 of treatment.
t3 (late phase) The time point reflects the end of treatment (max. day 7).</description>
