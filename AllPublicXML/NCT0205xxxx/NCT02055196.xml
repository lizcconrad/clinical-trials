    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of genetically modified stem cells
      when given together with irinotecan hydrochloride in treating patients with recurrent
      high-grade gliomas. Irinotecan hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Placing a gene that has been created in the
      laboratory into neural stem cells and injecting it into the brain may help irinotecan
      hydrochloride kill more tumor cells once it reaches the brain.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the recommend phase II doses of intracranially administered active modified
      human form of carboxylesterase (hCE1m6)- neuronal stem cells (NSCs)
      (carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural stem cells) in combination with intravenous
      irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride).

      II. To determine the biologic activity of the hCE1m6-NSCs by comparing SN-38 concentrations
      in the brain after treatment with hCE1m6-NSCs and irinotecan compared to irinotecan alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the relationship between hCE1m6-NSC dose and SN-38 concentrations in brain
      interstitium.

      II. To characterize the relationship between intracerebral and systemic concentrations of
      irinotecan and SN-38.

      III. To assess for possible development of NSC immunogenicity after first exposure and with
      repeat doses of NSCs.

      IV. To evaluate the intracerebral distribution of NSCs by using iron-labeling as a cellular
      tracker.

      V. To describe the clinical benefit (defined as stable disease, partial response, or complete
      response) in patients who receive treatment with repeat cycles of NSCs and irinotecan.

      VI. To determine, at time of autopsy, the fate of the NSCs.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural
      stem cells.

      Patients receive carboxylesterase-expressing allogeneic neural stem cells via intracerebral
      catheter on day 1 of week 1; weeks 1 and 3, weeks 1, 2, and 3; or weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4.
      Patients also receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 3 of
      week 1; weeks 1 and 3, weeks 1, 2, and 3; or weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4. Courses repeat every 6
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 15 years.
