  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza (the 'flu') is a common virus infecting approximately 5-20% of the population in
      the United States and causing as many as 500,000 deaths worldwide each year. Currently, there
      are only a few treatments for influenza infection and none of these target inflammation that
      can be caused by the virus. This study will test whether the anti-inflammatory effects of
      statins, a class of drugs most often used to treat high cholesterol, will decrease the
      severity of illness in patients who are infected with influenza by testing markers of
      inflammation in the blood and recording resolution of influenza illness.
