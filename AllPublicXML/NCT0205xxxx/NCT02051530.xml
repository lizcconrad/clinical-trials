    <textblock>
      Rationale: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric disorder whose onset, severity,
      and duration are influenced by interpersonal factors. The serotonin system is known to
      influence MDD risk. Recent research has suggested that serotonin may also play a role in
      regulating social behaviour. Therefore, it would be interesting to study the role of
      serotonin in responses to social stimuli in individuals at risk for MDD.

      Objective: This project aims to study how changes in serotonin alter interpersonal
      functioning in adults with or without a first degree family member diagnosed with MDD. The
      primary goal is to investigate the effect of experimentally lowered brain serotonin levels on
      empathic accuracy. Secondary goals are to determine how this manipulation influences verbal
      and non-verbal communication, cardiovascular function in a social context, and mood. An
      exploratory goal is to investigate how these outcomes are related to genes thought to be
      involved in MDD.
