  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended to demonstrate that macitentan does not have an effect on cardiac
      repolarization exceeding the threshold of regulatory concern after repeated administration of
      daily oral doses of 10 and 30 mg to healthy male and female subjects.

    <measure>Baseline-adjusted placebo-corrected QT interval according to Fridericia's correction (QTcF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>The QTcF interval was obtained directly from the Holter ECG monitoring.Triplicate ECG recordings were obtained from a 12-lead Holter recording device at various time points on Day 8. Baseline data were obtained from the pre-dose recording on Day 1 (from about 45 to 15 minutes prior to the morning dose). The QTcF interval is the QT interval (interval from beginning of the Q wave until end of the T wave) corrected for heart rate with Fridericia's formula (QTcF = QT/RR^0.33 where RR is 60/heart rate)</description>
