    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Responded With Improvement on the Patient Global Impression (PGI) Scale at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>PGI is a participant rated instrument to measure participant's change in overall status on a 7-point scale. 7 items on scale include sleep onset, sleep time, sleep quality, morning awakening, morning tiredness, daytime somnolence, and daytime physical condition/function. Participants provide their response on a PGI questionnaire. The results of survey using the PGI questionnaire was scored, summarized and assessed. Total score range from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Percentage of participants with improvement rated as &quot;much better&quot; or &quot;a little better&quot; were reported for sleep onset,time, quality; morning awakening, tiredness and daytime sleepiness, physical condition.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Responded With Improvement on the Patient Global Impression (PGI) Scale at Week 4</title>
        <description>PGI is a participant rated instrument to measure participant's change in overall status on a 7-point scale. 7 items on scale include sleep onset, sleep time, sleep quality, morning awakening, morning tiredness, daytime somnolence, and daytime physical condition/function. Participants provide their response on a PGI questionnaire. The results of survey using the PGI questionnaire was scored, summarized and assessed. Total score range from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Percentage of participants with improvement rated as &quot;much better&quot; or &quot;a little better&quot; were reported for sleep onset,time, quality; morning awakening, tiredness and daytime sleepiness, physical condition.</description>
