  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to test the beneficial effect of a pharmacist-initiated
      knowledge transfer intervention to both patients and prescribers on the discontinuation of
      inappropriate prescriptions, compared to usual care. The investigators hypothesize that the
      pharmacist-led intervention will reduce inappropriate prescriptions by at least 20% over
      6-months compared to usual care. The intervention consists of simultaneously educating
      consumers and providing physicians with an evidence-based pharmaceutical opinion on
      inappropriate prescriptions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Complete discontinuation of inappropriate prescriptions.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Provincial prescription insurance claims will be used to measure whether the inappropriate prescription has been discontinued in the intervention and control group at 6-months. Prescription data contain information on all dispensed prescriptions including drug name, dispensation date, dosage, drug form, duration and quantity of the drug dispensed, as well as the license number of the physician who wrote the prescription. Discontinuation of an inappropriate prescription will be defined as the lack of a claims renewal for that medication during a minimum of three or more consecutive months (with no subsequent renewals) during the nine months following receipt of the intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The frequency, timing and type of pharmaceutical opinions sent by the pharmacist to the patient's primary care physician.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence and delivery date of any pharmaceutical opinion sent to the patient's physician will be ascertained by the presence of a pharmacist billing claim recorded within 6 months after randomization of pharmacies to the intervention group. The type of opinion (evidence-based example provided by the research team vs customized by the pharmacist) will be ascertained by obtaining a photocopied paper copy of the pharmaceutical opinion from the patient's pharmacy record at the end of the trial (by law, the pharmacist must keep a copy in the patient's dossier). The dates of the paper copy will be matched to the date of the billing registered in the billing database to validate that the latter relates to the drug under study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of the pharmaceutical opinion on the prescriber's behaviour.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacists will be provided with a &quot;study response card&quot; to accompany any pharmaceutical opinion sent to a physician for study patients with inappropriate prescriptions. The &quot;response card&quot; will ask the physician to endorse one of the following three options: 1) I agree with the proposed recommendation and have signed the prescription recommendation you have provided to discontinue or substitute the inappropriate prescription 2) I will discuss with the patient at the next visit; or 3) no change required. The physician will be asked to fax back the response card to the pharmacist. A copy of all response cards received by the pharmacist will be collected by the research team at the end of the trial. The pharmacist will also be asked whether the physician acknowledged the pharmaceutical opinion in any other way. Lack of acknowledgment of the pharmaceutical opinion by the physician will be coded as a non-response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-physician encounters to discuss inappropriate prescriptions.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient visits to their primary care provider within the 6-months post-intervention will be ascertained by physician billing claims. Visits to physicians where discussions about inappropriate prescriptions occurred will be determined by patient self-report during the 6-month semi-structured telephone follow-up interview by asking whether patients met with their physician to discuss their prescriptions and what happened during these encounters. We will also query any phone call discussions with physician on this subject and conversations with pharmacists to discuss prescription changes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in risk perception around inappropriate prescriptions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline and post-intervention evaluation of participant's, pharmacist's and physician's beliefs about the risks associated with certain inappropriate prescriptions, as listed on the Beers Criteria of inappropriate medication in the elderly.</description>
