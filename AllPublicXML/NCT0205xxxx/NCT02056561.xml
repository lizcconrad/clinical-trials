      Introduction and Aim: Desflurane and sevoflurane are frequently used for maintenance of
      anesthesia and studies have shown that these anesthetics cause a variety of changes in
      oxidative stress and antioxidative defense mechanisms. The chemical structure of propofol is
      similar to some free radical consumers such as endogenous vitamin E and butylated hydroxene
      toluene. This study aims to compare the effects of sevoflurane, desflurane and propofol
      infusion anesthesia on the oxidant and antioxidant systems of patients undergoing
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      Material and Method: Forty-five patients, ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) I-II,
      score between 18-50 years with planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia
      were included in the study. Patients were divided into 3 groups as total intravenous
      anesthesia (TIVA) (group T n: 15), sevoflurane (group S n: 15) and desflurane (group D n:
      15). Propofol 2 mg/kg IV, fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IV, vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg IV given to all groups
      for anesthesia induction. For maintenance of anesthesia group S were ventilated with 2%
      sevoflurane, 50% air and 50% O2 mix at 6 L/min flow. Group D were given 6% desflurane 50% air
      and 50% O2 mix at 6 L/min flow. Group T were given propofol infusions of 12 mg/kg/hr for the
      first 10 minutes, 9 mg/kg/hr for the second 10 minutes and 6 mg/kg/hr after that. Patients
      were ventilated with 50% air and 50% O2 mix at 6 L/min flow. Before induction and after the
      operation venous blood samples were taken to evaluate the levels of glutathion peroxidase,
      total oxidants and antioxidants.

        45 patients ASA I-II between 18-50 years with planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy under
        general anesthetic were included in the study. Patients were divided into 3 groups on the
        way to surgery; TIVA (group T n: 15), sevoflurane (group S n: 15) and desflurane (group D
        n: 15).
