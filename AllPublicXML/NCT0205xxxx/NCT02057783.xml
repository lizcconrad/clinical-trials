      Investigators hypothesize that CPAP treatment for suppressing OSAS in combination with a
      physical activity program will optimize 24-hour blood pressure control in patients with
      OSA-related resistant hypertension.

      1. Sleep apnea syndrome, resistant hypertension and cardio-vascular risk. There are many
           epidemiological and clinical cohort studies demonstrating an increasing cardiovascular
           risk associated with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS). In epidemiological
           studies, OSA severity and incident hypertension are linked in a dose-response fashion.
           This is true even when taking into account usual confounding factors such as age,
           alcohol, tobacco consumption and body mass index. More specifically, OSAS is the leading
           cause of refractory hypertension and OSAS prevalence is up to 80% in patients with
           resistant hypertension.

        2. CPAP treatment impact for reducing blood pressure in OSAS patients with resistant
           hypertension A recent small sample size randomized trial (n=35) demonstrated the
           positive impact of CPAP in decreasing both clinical and 24-hour ambulatory blood
           pressure. Compared to the control group, awake systolic/diastolic ambulatory blood
           pressure monitoring decreased significantly in the continuous positive airway pressure
           group (Delta: +3.1±3.3 /+2.1±2.7 vs. -6.5±3.3/ 4.5±1.9mmHg in control and CPAP groups
           respectively, p&lt;0.05). Interestingly, the blood pressure changes were only observed
           while patients were awake, but not during nocturnal ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
           (Delta: +2.8±4.5/+1.8±3.5 vs. +1.6±3.5/+0.8±2.9mmHg, p=NS).

           HIPARCO Study, the largest Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) in the field (n=194) recently
           published in JAMA (9 December 2013) also showed a significant but limited impact of CPAP
           on blood pressure. In an Intention To Treat analysis, CPAP significantly improved 24-h
           mean BP (3.0 mmHg; 95% CI 0.3 to 5.8; p=0.031) and DBP (3.2 mmHg; 95% CI 1.0 to 5.4;
           p=0.005) but not SBP (3.1; 95% CI -0.6 to 6.7; p=0.098). Moreover, patients in the CPAP
           group had 2.4 (1.2-5.1; p=0.019) times greater probability of recovering their dipper
           pattern. As CPAP alone is not enough in OSAS to sufficiently improve BP, further studies
           should address the efficacy of combined therapies in OSAS patients with resistant
           hypertension.

        3. Resistant hypertension and physical activity A study has recently explored the impact of
           a standardized exercise program in patients suffering from resistant hypertension7. In
           this RCT, the authors have demonstrated that the group of patients who have benefit from
           a physical activity program had their systolic and diastolic 24-hour ambulatory blood
           pressure monitoring decreasing by 6±12 and 3±7 mmHg respectively(p=0.03). Thus, the
           physical activity implemented in this population enabled a better control of blood
           pressure values. However the authors do not give any information about the presence of
           the absence of Sleep Apnea Syndrome (SAS) in this cohort.

        4. Study hypothesis:

      Investigators hypothesize that CPAP treatment for suppressing OSAS in combination with a
      physical activity program will optimize 24-hour blood pressure control in patients with
      OSA-related resistant hypertension.

      Originality: Up to now no study has assessed the effects of combining physical activity with
      CPAP treatment in patients with sleep apnea and resistant hypertension. Our work is will be
      the first aiming at evaluating the benefit of this combination on the control of the systolic
      blood arterial pressure.
