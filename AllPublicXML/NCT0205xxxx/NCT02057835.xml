  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BI 691751 is currently being developed to inhibit growth and prevent rupture of
      atherosclerotic plaques and to consequently reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in
      patients with established atherosclerotic disease. 1334.5 is a Pan Asian Phase 1 study to
      investigate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of BI 691751 in healthy Chinese and
      Japanese male volunteers.
