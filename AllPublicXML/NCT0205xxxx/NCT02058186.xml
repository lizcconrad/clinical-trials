      Background: Increase in skin colonization of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in atopic
      dermatitis patients (AD) resulted from the reduction of cathelicidin production in these
      patients plays the important role in pathogenesis of this disease. Recently in vivo study has
      showed that vitamin D can stimulate cathelicidin production. Oral supplement of vitamin D
      might be beneficial in atopic dermatitis.

      Objective: To determine the effect of oral vitamin D supplement on clinical impact including
      skin colonization of S. aureus in atopic dermatitis patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible criteria included patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis by SCORAD
             (Scoring for Atopic Dermatitis) score criteria1,17,18, age between 1-18 years old. All
             patients had been advised to take normal, dietary product and their activities. They
             had been advised to discontinue at least 4 weeks of oral corticosteroid, at least 2
             weeks of topical corticosteroid or topical calcineurin inhibitor application and at
             least 6 months of vitamin supplement prior to starting the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The exclusion criteria were to coexisting skin infection on top with AD lesions, known
             case of primary or secondary immune-compromised host, hepatic or renal disease, those
             taking vitamin D or nutraceutical supplementation, those continues taking with
             antibiotics, corticosteroid, immunosuppressive agents, anti-epileptic drugs, thiazide
             diuretics, proton-pump inhibitors, histamine 2-receptor antagonists at the time of
             enrollment. Patients who used topical antiseptic or antibiotic products during study
             period were also excluded. Patients who developed worsening of AD with flare-up of
             clinical manifestation or SCORAD greater than 40, secondary infection on-top tested
             lesions were excluded from data analysis.
