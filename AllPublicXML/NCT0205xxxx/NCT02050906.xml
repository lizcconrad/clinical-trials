      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies intensive diet and exercise or standard of care
      in improving physical function and quality of life in patients with prostate cancer
      undergoing androgen deprivation therapy. Diet and exercise may help improve physical function
      and quality of life in prostate cancer patients. It is not yet known whether intensive diet
      and exercise is more effective than standard of care in improving physical function and
      quality of life in patients with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the effects of the intensive lifestyle intervention and standard of care
      treatments on functional limitations (FL), body composition (BC), and quality of life (QOL)
      in prostate cancer (PC) patients on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

      II. To determine the feasibility of delivering an intensive lifestyle exercise and dietary
      intervention to PC patients undergoing ADT.

      III. To identify the intermediate variables that account for the beneficial effect of the
      lifestyle intervention on functional limitations and QOL.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I:

      EXERCISE COMPONENT: Patients undergo 1 hour of intensive exercise comprising 30 minutes of
      aerobic exercise and 30 minutes of resistance exercise twice weekly during weeks 1-6, once
      weekly during weeks 7-8, and independently during weeks 7-12.

      BEHAVIORAL ACTIVITY COUNSELING: Patients undergo behavioral activity counseling in small
      group sessions over 20 minutes once weekly during months 1-2 and individualized activity
      counseling via telephone calls over 20 minutes every 2 weeks for 3 months.

      DIETARY COMPONENT: Patients undergo nutritional counseling over 30 minutes once weekly during
      months 1-2 and then every 2 weeks via telephone calls during month 3.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard care and educational literature describing the American
      Institute of Cancer Research dietary and physical activity guidelines. Patients also receive
      phone calls over 20 minutes every 2 weeks for 3 months focusing on routine prostate cancer
      self-management. After 3 months, patients undergo 2 supervised exercise training and dietary
      counseling sessions.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with PC: histologically-defined diagnosis of PC based upon providing
             pathology reports and staging studies

          -  Initiating ADT: will be initiating a planned course of at least 3 months of ADT; the
             ADT is defined as: (a) surgical castration; (b) gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH)
             antagonist alone; (c) GNRH antagonist with oral androgen receptor blockade, and (d)
             GNRH antagonist, oral androgen receptor blockade, and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors; we
             will not include men with only oral antiandrogen therapy such as 5-alpha reductase
             inhibitors alone or oral antiandrogens alone, as they do not produce castrate levels
             of testosterone

          -  Stage: at enrollment, all men have stage IV disease, which is our major presentation
             to the medical oncology prostate program; two groups are typical; the first involves
             men who usually present for initial diagnosis with minimally metastatic disease and
             elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and staging studies with modest nodal
             enlargement or bone lesions, typically asymptotic; the second group involves men we
             have been monitoring after local therapy, surgery or radiation, but who have a slow
             rise in PSA indicating failure of curative therapy; at some point in time asymptomatic
             metastases are noted on scans, and ADT is offered

          -  Sedentary lifestyle: fewer than 60 minutes of participation in structured moderate
             intensity physical activity each week

          -  Health status: all participants must be free of active cardiovascular disease (CVD),
             unstable angina, arrhythmia, or severe systemic disease that would make moderate
             intensity exercise participation unsafe; men with prior CVD that have had successful
             intervention/treatment that are no longer have active CVD and are medically cleared to
             safely exercise by their physician will be eligible to participate in the study

          -  Consents: willing to give an informed consent and sign a Health Insurance Portability
             and Accountability Act (HIPPA) authorization form

          -  Physician medical clearance: all men will have medical clearance to participate in the
             study from a board certified internist, primary care physician, or cardiologist (for
             men with ongoing cardiovascular disease) prior to inclusion in the study; all
             participants' treating oncologists will also provide consent for participation prior
             to inclusion in the study
