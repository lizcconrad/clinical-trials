  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the dose-proportionality of palbociclib pharmacokinetics in
      healthy subjects of Japanese descent. Approximately fourteen healthy Japanese subjects will
      receive four single doses of palbociclib (PD-0332991) with a minimum washout of 10 days
      between doses. Additionally, this study will investigate the effect of Japanese ethnicity of
      palbociclib pharmacokinetics by comparing palbociclib pharmacokinetics at a single dose-level
      between healthy subjects of Japanese descent and approximately fourteen healthy non-Asian
      subjects.

    <measure>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-120 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-120 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>
