    <textblock>
      Participants in this study will receive 3 single oral doses of LY2835219 at least 14 days
      apart. One dose will be given with a standard meal, one dose with a high-fat meal and one
      dose without food. The study will evaluate the effects of the standard and high-fat meals on
      how much drug gets into the bloodstream. Side effects will be documented. This study is
      approximately 43 days, not including screening. Screening is required within 28 days prior to
      the start of the study.
