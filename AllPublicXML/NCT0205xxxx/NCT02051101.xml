  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms of Port Wine Stain,
      collect biopsy samples and blood samples to characterize exosomes and metabolites from Port
      Wine Stain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The researcher can detect the defects in nervous system innervation to cutaneous blood
      vessels contribute to the pathogenesis of Port Wine Stain . Unveiling the pathogenic
      mechanisms of PWS is crucial to the design of new therapeutic strategies and can use the
      results to improve current PWS therapeutic outcomes.
