  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Pluripotent stem cells are cells that can be converted to any type of cell (muscle, nerve,
      liver, etc.). Researchers are collecting blood samples to develop way to make a special cell
      product called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). iPSCs may be used to repair or replace
      organs and tissues, produce blood and immune cells for transfusion, or correct inherited
      immune and blood diseases. iPSCs can be made from many kinds samples, such as skin, blood, or
      hair. This is different from embryonic stem cells, which can only be derived from embryos.

      Objectives:

      - To develop new methods to make iPSCs; to identify better ways to collect, produce, and grow
      them; and to make an iPSC bank.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy adults and adults already in a treatment protocol who have a medical condition that
      could be treated with iPSCs.

      Design:

        -  All participants will be screened with questionnaire, physical exam, and blood and HIV
           tests.

        -  All participants:

        -  Will donate 4 tablespoons of blood. It will be taken by needle from a vein in their arm.

        -  Participants already in another protocol:

        -  Will have their blood collected, separated in a lab, and iPSCs grown in large numbers.
           Some may have their sample given back to them as a treatment.

        -  Samples will be kept in the study up to 5 years or until a participant withdraws from
           the study or becomes ineligible to participate, or the study is closed. If participants
           have not withdrawn their consent, they may be contacted in the future to donate again.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be produced from small quantities of blood.
      Clinical protocols to treat several diseases using iPSCs or cells derived from iPSCs are
      being developed by intramural investigators, i.e., investigators in National Institute of
      Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and National Eye Institute (NEI). This clinical
      protocol will allow personnel in the Cell Processing Service (CPS) of the Department of
      Transfusion Medicine (DTM) to collect blood from healthy donors or patients with diseases
      targeted in IRB-approved treatment protocols to manufacture iPSCs or iPSC derived products to
      support these intramural investigators. CPS DTM will submit a Drug Master File (DMF) to the
      US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the manufacture and testing of these products. When
      iPSCs are used clinically in some cases the donors will be the recipients of the iPSCs, or
      the ex vivo expanded and differentiated iPSCs (autologous therapy). In other cases, healthy
      subjects will serve as donors of the blood used as starting material for manufacturing iPSCs
      (allogeneic therapy) where no matching of HLA or other antigens is required between the
      healthy blood donor and the iPSC recipient. While methods to produce and expand iPSCs have
      been described, they must be modified periodically to meet changing Good Manufacturing
      Practices (GMP) requirements for manufacturing clinical cell and gene therapies, therefore
      peripheral blood for iPSCs from normal donors is needed for research and development.
