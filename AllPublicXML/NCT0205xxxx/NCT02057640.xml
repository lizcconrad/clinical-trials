    <textblock>
      This study will look at the safety and tolerability of the new drug MLN9708 in combination
      with the existing drugs panobinostat and dexamethasone among patients with relapsed or
      refractory multiple myeloma. This study will also look at the response and clinical benefit
      of the treatment and the progression-free survival and overall survival of study
      participants.

      The primary objective of this study is to define the tolerability and safety of MLN9708
      (ixazomib) administered on a day 1,8,15 every 28 day schedule up to 4mg in combination with
      fixed doses of panobinostat and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory
      myeloma.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to assess response and clinical benefit response
      rates according to international uniform response criteria and adapted EBMT criteria,
      respectively. And to assess progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

             any antibiotics that are continued are either beta lactam antibiotics or are
             specifically allowed on study.
