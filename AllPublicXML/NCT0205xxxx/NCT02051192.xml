  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behaviorally and cognitive-behaviorally based therapeutic techniques (BT; CBT) that
      incorporate exposure therapy useful for treatment of anxiety disorders among typically
      developing children. Although a large amount of data demonstrate the effectiveness of of BT
      and CBT approaches for treating anxious youth, there is a gap in the literature for the
      effectiveness of these approaches for children under the age of seven. Evidence increasingly
      suggests that family factors such as accommodation and parenting style contribute
      significantly to the presence of anxiety symptoms as well as treatment outcomes, particularly
      in young children. These findings stress the importance of using a treatment approach in
      which parents are directly involved in education, parent training, and generalization of
      treatment effects. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate a new treatment program, parent-led
      behavioral treatment, for children ages 3 to 7 years of age who have a principal anxiety
      disorder diagnosis.

    <description>Therapists will work with families for 10 sessions, twice weekly. The first treatment session will be a 90 minute parent only psychoeducation and treatment preparation session.

Thus, treatment will continue as it would in standard practice.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatient children between the ages 3-7 years.

          -  Meets DSM-IV criteria for a primary diagnosis of an anxiety disorder or achieves a
             minimum score of 12 Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS)

          -  Child has a PPVT IV SS &gt; 80.

          -  Patients with co-morbid depression, ADHD, tic disorder or disruptive behavior
             disorders will be included as long as anxiety is primary (i.e., most
             impairing/distressing).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  â€¢ (a) Current clinically significant suicidality or (b) individuals who have engaged
             in suicidal behaviors within 6 months will be excluded and referred for appropriate
             clinical intervention.

               -  Receiving concurrent psychotherapy, social skills training, or behavioral
                  interventions (e.g., applied behavior analysis). Families will have the option of
                  discontinuing such services to enroll in the study. Those randomized treatment as
                  usual (TAU) will be able to continue or initiate psychosocial interventions
                  (psychotherapy, social skills training, applied behavior analysis, or family
                  therapy) whereas those randomized to PLET will not receive these interventions
                  concurrent with PLET.

               -  Any change in established psychotropic medication (e.g., antidepressants,
                  anxioloytics, antipsychotics, stimulants) within 10 weeks before study. Those
                  randomized to TAU may make medication changes following randomization, including
                  starting a medication; those randomized to PLET will remain stable on medications
                  during the study.

               -  Absence of language.

               -  A formal diagnosis of mental retardation or autism spectrum disorder.

               -  Unwillingness of parents to make the commitment to accompany their child for
                  multiple study visits, unwillingness to take part in randomization, inability to
                  attend sessions twice weekly as therapist availability allows, inability to
                  attend assessment visits.

               -  Presence of a significant and/or unstable medical illness which might lead to
                  hospitalization during the study.
