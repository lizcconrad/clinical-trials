      The aim of this study is to test the efficacy of alanyl-glutamine supplementation in the
      treatment of C. difficile infection. We hypothesize that alanyl-glutamine when given with
      standard antibiotic treatment for C. difficile infection will decrease diarrhea, mortality
      and recurrent disease.
