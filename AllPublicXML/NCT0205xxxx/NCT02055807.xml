  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and recruitment maneuvers during
      laparotomy will limit the development of atelectasis and therefore improve the aeration
      score.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pulmonary complications contribute to the morbidity of surgical patients.
      During general anesthesia, up to 90% of patients will develop atelectasis, which is thought
      to be a major contributing factor to their development. The adjustment of ventilator settings
      to prevent the occurrence of atelectasis and reduce pulmonary complications remains
      controversial. Despite the use of similar mechanical ventilation strategies, two recent
      studies (IMPROVE, PROVHILO) involving 1300 patients diverged in their conclusions regarding
      the impact of these strategies in the prevention of pulmonary complications. In these
      studies, the absence of imagery to assess the pulmonary end-result of the different
      ventilation strategies complicates the interpretation of their results.

      On arrival in the operating theatre, each patient will undergo a baseline lung ultrasound
      examination. The anesthetic technique and monitoring will be standardized. The radial artery
      will be cannulated after induction of anesthesia for blood gas monitoring. Ventilator
      settings will be adjusted according to randomization.

      A second lung ultrasound examination will be performed 5 minutes following induction of
      general anesthesia. In the PEEP group, a lung ultrasound examination will be performed
      immediately following the first recruitment maneuver. A lung ultrasound examination will also
      be performed at the end of surgery before emergence of general anesthesia.

      Fifteen minutes after arrival in the recovery room, a last lung ultrasound examination will
      be performed. Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and vital signs will be recorded during each
      ultrasound examination. Arterial blood samples will be collected simultaneously. The aeration
      score will be calculated for each lung ultrasound examination.

    <description>A PEEP of 7 cm H2O will be applied starting after intubation until the end of surgery. Recruitment maneuvers (continuous positive pressure of 30 cm H20 for 30 seconds) will be initiated following intubation and repeated every 30 minutes during surgery and immediately prior to extubation. Lung ultrasound examinations will be performed at different time-points immediately before surgery, during surgery under general anesthesia and after surgery in the recovery room to detect and monitor atelectasis.</description>
