  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a
      quit-smoking program that combines behavioral therapy with either yoga, or a health &amp;
      wellness program that serves as a contact control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men enrolled in this pilot will be provided with 8 weeks of cognitive-behavioral therapy for
      smoking cessation and either 1) a twice-weekly program of yoga, or 2) a health &amp; wellness
      program that serves as a control for number of contacts and subject burden between study
      conditions. Qualitative data from open ended surveys and interviews is used to supplement
      survey data to enhance the investigators understanding of study outcomes. Participant accrual
      and retention rates, acceptance of randomization, and compliance with study protocols will be
      examined along with perceptions and beliefs about yoga and its relationship to quitting
      smoking specifically, and health in general.
