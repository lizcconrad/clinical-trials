      Coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) may promote alterations in heart
      responses during exercise or postural maneuver. Thus, the purpose of this study is to observe
      the influence of different postures (supine, seated and standing) and different percentages
      (15, 30, 45 and 60%) of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) of handgrip in the responses
      of heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean
      arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV) and peripheral vascular
      resistance (PVR) in coronary patients with and without type 2 diabetes.

    <time_frame>Change in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume and peripheral resistance. [time frame: initial (10 min), during the time of contraction (peak) and after contraction (10 min)</time_frame>
    <description>15 men with coronary artery disease and 15 healthy subjects will perform isometric contractions (handgrip) in different percentages (15,30, 45 60%) of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and in different postures (supine, seated and standing position). The percentages and postures will be randomized and the subjects will perform two contractions per day in a posture. All the variables will be evaluated through pulse plethysmograph (Finometer PRO, Finapress Medical System, The Netherlands). The subjects will be assessed in the protocol of isometric exercise for six days (two contractions per day and one posture). Initially they will remain at rest for 10 minutes and wiil perform the percentage drawn of maximal voluntary contraction until exhaustion. After 10 minutes of recovery subjects will perform another percentage of maximum contraction to exhaustion.</description>

    <description>The isometric protocol (handgrip) will be performed into 4 percentages of MVC (15, 30, 45 and 60%) to exhaustion in 3 postures (supine, seated and standing position). The percentages and the postures will be randomized. In the first day of exercise protocol the subjects will be at rest during 10 minutes and will perform 3 MVC during 5 seconds, with 5 minutes of recovery. The higher value of MVC will be used to prescribe the percentages. The subjects will perform two contractions until exhaustion in one posture in each day.</description>
