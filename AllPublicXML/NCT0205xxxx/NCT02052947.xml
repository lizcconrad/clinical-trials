    <textblock>
      One of the crucial challenges for the future of Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutic
      approaches in elderly is to target the main pathological process responsible for disability
      and dependency. However, a progressive cognitive impairment occurring after the age of 70 is
      often related to mixed lesions of neurodegenerative and vascular origins. Whereas young
      patients are mostly affected by pure lesions, aging favors the occurrence of co-lesions of
      AD, vascular and Lewy body types. Pure DLB (Dementia with Lewy Body) and AD are distinct
      disorders but they often coexist in old age patients, the Abeta pathology of DLB/AD cases
      being different to that observed in patients with AD alone. Vascular dementia (VD) and AD
      with cerebrovascular disease (AD+CVD) are the leading causes of dementia next to AD alone.
      Lack of consensus persists about the diagnosis criteria for VD and AD+CVD, due in part to
      their clinical, pathological heterogeneity and the multiple pathological subtypes.

      We do not know the precise role and weight of each brain lesion type in the disability
      progression in elderly. To target the actual pathological process, we need to disclose the
      functional weight of AD, Lewy body and vascular lesion types in elderly. Most of the studies
      report on functional and clinical abnormalities in patients with pure pathologies. Thus,
      co-morbid processes involved in the transition from an independent functional status to
      disability in the elderly with co-lesions still remain to be elucidated. Neuropathological
      examination often performed at late stages cannot answer this question at mild or moderate
      stages.

      Brain MRI, Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) with DaTscan® and CSF
      biomarkers help routinely in performing the diagnosis of pure or mixed lesions responsible
      for dementia. The topography of the atrophy in MRI helps to provide information about the
      etiological diagnosis. Medial temporal lobe atrophy on MRI has good discriminatory power for
      AD compared to DLB and VD in pathologically confirmed cases. DaTscan® SPECT presents with
      good sensitivity and specificity at early stages of DLB. The good diagnosis value of CSF
      biological markers has led recently to their inclusion in the research diagnosis criteria of
      AD. Low Aβ1-42 and high levels of total tau and hyperphosphorylated tau isoforms appear to be
      the most sensitive and specific CSF biomarkers. Aβ1-42 is lowered in AD, as well as in other
      neurodegenerative diseases like DLB, VD. The combination of MRI, particularly medial temporal
      atrophy measures and vascular lesions on FLAIR MRI sequences, SPECT and CSF biomarkers seem
      to be of incremental value for the diagnosis AD, VD, DLB and mixed profiles.

      The aim of this study is to identify the biomarkers (MRI, SPECT-DaTscan® and CSF), and their
      combination, that are the most predictive of functional disability in elderly presenting with
      a progressive cognitive decline related to AD, DLB, VD and all mixed patterns.
