  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine is increasingly used for sedation in children placed on cardiopulmonary
      bypass for heart surgery. It is also often used after surgery and may be particularly helpful
      for children with heart disease. In order for this medication to be helpful and to minimize
      risks associated with taking the medication, it is important to provide correct dosing for
      this medication. Based on evidence from studies of other medications used during heart
      surgery, it is likely that dosing of dexmedetomidine while on cardiopulmonary bypass is
      different from dosing in other settings. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how the
      heart-lung bypass machine affects dexmedetomidine levels in the body.

    <measure>Plasma pharmacokinetics (clearance, volume of distribution, area under the curve, oxygenator extraction efficiency) of dexmedetomidine in children supported with cardiopulmonary bypass</measure>
    <time_frame>Data will be collected at the following approximate time points: 0h, 0.5h, 0.75h, and 2h after infusion initiation; 0.25h, 0.75h, and 2h after bypass initiation; 0.5h prior to bypass termination, 0.25h, 1h, 3h, 7h, and 10h after bypass termination</time_frame>
