  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to evaluate its morphologic reproliferating patterns in patients with
      pterygium treated with the excision and conjunctival autograft.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The medical records of 116 eyes of 116 patients with pterygium who had pterygium excision and
      conjunctival autograft between February 2009 and May 2011 were reviewed. Using consecutively
      recorded photographs, we evaluated preoperative morphologic characteristics and its growth
      patterns.
