  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60% of the patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) that receive Levodopa therapy
      eventually develop response fluctuations in motor symptoms, such as rigidity, freezing and
      akinesia. Patients experience an 'off'-period just before the next dose of dopaminergic
      medication is needed, called the 'wearing-off'-phenomena. Wearing-off is also accompanied by
      non-motor symptoms such as depression, anxiety, pain and thinking disability. Together, these
      motor and non-motor symptoms have a major impact on the quality of life of patients and their
      partner or caregiver.

      Patients with wearing-off often experience severe anxiety and panic symptoms that are
      incongruent with the severity of the motor symptoms during an 'off' period. These symptoms
      include stress, dizziness, pounding/racing of the heart, dyspnoea and hyperventilation. This
      type of anxiety is called wearing-off related anxiety (WRA) and might be a consequence of the
      hypersensitivity towards somatic manifestations and effects of a wearing-off period. This
      bodily misperception can have major consequences for the patient's feelings and behaviour.
      The experienced anxiety is often not consciously linked to the wearing-off and is therefore
      not well recognized by neurologists.

      Treatment as usual in response fluctuations is physiotherapy, consisting of physical
      exercises for mobility problems, freezing, dyskinesias, etc. This kind of training hardly
      touches upon the mental aspects and the role of anxiety as integral element of the response
      fluctuations. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT, including exposure in vivo) is sometimes used
      to treat WRA, but seems to have unsatisfactory results since the changed body awareness is
      not sufficiently addressed. Also, the methods used in cognitive therapies focus on the
      elimination of WRA which is often not realistic since wearing-off symptoms will remain or
      even increase during disease progression. As of yet, there are no known alternative
      intervention options. This study focuses on a new intervention by integrating elements from
      physiotherapy, mindfulness, CBT (mainly exposure), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
      and psycho-education.

      Objective: The current proposal aims at investigating the effect of a multidisciplinary
      non-verbal intervention on the awareness and modulation of WRA to improve self-efficacy,
      mobility, mood, and quality of life as compared to usual care.

      Study design: Randomized controlled clinical trial.

      Study population: Thirty-six PD patients who experience WRA.

      Intervention: Patients with PD are randomly allocated into one of two groups (n= 18 each).
      One group receives the experimental 'body-awareness therapy', while the second group receives
      regular group-physiotherapy (treatment as usual). Both interventions will take 6 weeks in
      which 2 sessions per week with a duration of 1,5 hour will be performed.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The General Self-Efficacy Scale is the primary outcome
      measure and will be assessed prior to, directly after and 18 weeks after the intervention.

    <description>Experimental condition: BEWARE training group The physical and psychosocial elements of the training sessions will be complementary: psychological techniques are used to induce and endure wearing-off and physical techniques are used to improve body awareness to cope with the off-periods.
Specifically the following techniques will be applied:
Body scan
Psychoeducation
Acceptance Commitment Therapy / Mindfulness skills (sustained attention, concentration, non-reactivity, nonjudging of experience)
Body Awareness Training
Exposure training (imaginary exposure to induce response fluctuations)
Training in cueing techniques to overcome problems with initiation and freezing
Visual Feedback training
Relaxation techniques</description>

    <description>Control condition: Treatment as Usual The control group will receive treatment as usual based on the current guidelines for physical therapy in patients with Parkinson's Disease, with the same training schedule of 2x per week for 1,5 hours during 6 weeks. Group treatment will contain exercises for balance, walking, posture, transfers, arm/hand dexterity, strength, flexibility, relaxation and physical condition.</description>
