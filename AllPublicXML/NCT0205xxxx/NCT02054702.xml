    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales: a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 (absence of symptoms) and a score of 7 (extremely severe symptoms). The PANSS total score was the sum of the rating scores for 7 positive scale items, 7 negative scale items, and 16 general psychopathology scale items from the PANSS panel. The PANSS total score ranged from 30 (best possible outcome) to 210 (worst possible outcome).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Cognitive Test Battery Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The cognitive test battery contains 8-tasks, including the Detection Task (DET, speed of processing), Identification Task (IDN, attention/vigilance), One Card Learning Task (OCL, visual learning), One-back Memory Task (ONB, working memory), Two Back Task (TWOB, working memory), the Groton Maze Learning Task (GML, problem solving/error monitoring), Social Emotional Cognition Task (SECT, social cognition), International shopping List Task (ISL, verbal learning and memory). The results of each domain on the cognitive test battery were calculated into Z-scores, where the healthy control mean was set to zero and the standard deviation to 1. A composite score was generated, with higher values representing better cognitive performance. The composite score is then the mean of z-scores for appropriate tasks where z-score = − 1 × z-score for DET, GML, IDN and ONB to correct for the direction of improvement.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of illness for each participant was rated using the CGI-S. To perform this assessment, the study physician answered the following question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the participant at this time?&quot; Response choices included: 0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = among the most extremely ill participants.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Score at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of trial medication was rated for each participant using the CGI-I. The study physician would rate the participant's total improvement whether or not it is due entirely to drug treatment. All responses were compared to the participant's condition at Baseline prior to the first dose of double-blind study medication. Response choices included: 0 = not assessed, 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Rate by Study Week</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The response rate was defined as reduction of ≥30% from Baseline in PANSS Total Score or CGI-I score of of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in Specific Levels of Functioning Scale (SLOF) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The SLOF questionnaire used in this trial consisted of 30 items grouped into 4 areas: interpersonal relationships, social acceptability, activities, and work skill. The SLOF correlates with a subject's quality of life. Each of the questions in the domains is rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 &quot;not well at all&quot; to 5 &quot;very well&quot;. The possible total score range for SLOF is from 30 to 150, higher score indicating better overall functioning of the participant.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11 Item) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The BIS-11, a subject-rated scale designed to assess impulsive personality traits, was administered at the baseline and Week 6 visits. The BIS-11 consisted of 30 items scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (rarely/never) to 4 (almost always/always). The scores provided information to assess 6 first-order factors (attention, motor, self-control, cognitive complexity, perseverance, and cognitive instability impulsiveness) and 3 second-order factors (motor impulsiveness, nonplanning impulsiveness, and attentional impulsiveness). The total score ranged from 30 to 120, higher scores indicate better personality trait.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales: a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 (absence of symptoms) and a score of 7 (extremely severe symptoms). The PANSS total score was the sum of the rating scores for 7 positive scale items, 7 negative scale items, and 16 general psychopathology scale items from the PANSS panel. The PANSS total score ranged from 30 (best possible outcome) to 210 (worst possible outcome).</description>

The results of each domain on the cognitive test battery were calculated into Z-scores, where the healthy control mean was set to zero and the standard deviation to 1.

          <description>The cognitive test battery contains 8-tasks, including the Detection Task (DET, speed of processing), Identification Task (IDN, attention/vigilance), One Card Learning Task (OCL, visual learning), One-back Memory Task (ONB, working memory), Two Back Task (TWOB, working memory), the Groton Maze Learning Task (GML, problem solving/error monitoring), Social Emotional Cognition Task (SECT, social cognition), International shopping List Task (ISL, verbal learning and memory). The results of each domain on the cognitive test battery were calculated into Z-scores, where the healthy control mean was set to zero and the standard deviation to 1. A composite score was generated, with higher values representing better cognitive performance. The composite score is then the mean of z-scores for appropriate tasks where z-score = − 1 × z-score for DET, GML, IDN and ONB to correct for the direction of improvement.</description>

To perform this assessment, the study physician answered the following question: “Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the participant at this time?” Response choices included: 0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = among the most extremely ill participants.</description>

The scores provided information to assess 6 first-order factors (attention, motor, self-control, cognitive complexity, perseverance, and cognitive instability impulsiveness) and 3 second-order factors (motor impulsiveness, nonplanning impulsiveness, and attentional impulsiveness). The total score ranged from 30 to 120, higher scores indicate better personality trait.</description>
