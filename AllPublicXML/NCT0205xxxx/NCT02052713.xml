    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the bioequivalence of the second generation
      dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride (HCL) combination capsule versus currently available
      commercial combination of dutasteride 0.5 milligram (mg) and tamsulosin HCL 0.4 mg capsule in
      healthy adult male subjects. Subjects in this study will receive either a single oral dose of
      the second generation dutasteride 0.5 mg and tamsulosin 0.4 mg combination capsule or a
      single dose of commercially available combination of dutasteride 0.5 mg and tamsulosin HCL
      0.4 mg followed by a 28-day washout period both in fasted state. The study will enroll
      approximately 92 healthy adult male subjects in order to complete approximately 76 evaluable
      subjects. The total duration of a subject's involvement in this study is anticipated to be
      approximately 12 weeks.
