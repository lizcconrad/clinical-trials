  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Addiction to methamphetamine is a serious health problem. There are no medications that a
      doctor can give someone to help them stop using methamphetamine. Entacapone (Comtan©) is a
      medication that could help people addicted to methamphetamine.

      This study will see how entacapone works in healthy people who are given methamphetamine. We
      think that the study drug will be well tolerated, and that it will prevent some of the
      effects of methamphetamine that make it so addictive. We also want to see how differences in
      people's genes may cause differences in the ways the study drug and methamphetamine work for
      them.

      The study has six total visits. The first visit is for screening. Tests and procedures will
      make sure it is safe for subjects to participate.

      The second visit is a familiarization day. Subjects will receive methamphetamine, but no
      entacapone. This is done to make sure they can tolerate the drug and recognize its effects
      before being given a second drug on the same day. Subjects will take surveys and computer
      tests to see how the medications change mood, thinking, and liking the drug.

      The final four visits are the actual study days. Subjects will be randomly assigned (like the
      flip of a coin) to the different ways to get either 1) study medication or placebo (placebo
      contains no active study medication) and then 2) methamphetamine or placebo. Subjects will be
      in all four groups during the study, which means that each day a subject will get a different
      group.
