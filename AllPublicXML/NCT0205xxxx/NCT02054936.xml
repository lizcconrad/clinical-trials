  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare side effects and complications relating to use of warfarin or rivaroxaban,
      tolerance and/or toxicity of these two agents such as drop in hemoglobin post operatively,
      extent of bruising, quantity of wound drainage, duration of drainage, wound swelling, sub and
      supra-therapeutic prothrombin times, need for transfusion, and patient tolerance in two
      randomized groups. Return visits to the operating room, length of stay, and VTE rates will
      also be compared.

    <description>Comparative wound oozing time between patients receiving Rivaroxaban and those receiving Warfarin will be measured. Wound will be defined as actively draining if the gauze covering the wound is wet to the edges or if fluid is noted to be originating from the surgical site. The nursing staff will record the wound drainage during the hospital stay and the patient will be instructed in self assessment upon discharge using the patient diary.Wound drainage will be recorded twice daily. Time when the wound appeared dry will be noted.</description>
