      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of dose-dense(biweekly)
      carboplatin and paclitaxel ± trastuzumab as neoadjuvant treatment in early breast cancer.

    <textblock>
      Dose-dense regimens have been shown to improve outcome when given as adjuvant therapy to
      patients with breast cancer compared with their three weekly counterparts. It is unknown if
      dose dense neoadjuvant therapy will improve survival in resectable breast cancer. This study
      is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dose-dense(biweekly) carboplatin and paclitaxel ±
      trastuzumab as neoadjuvant treatment in early breast cancer. The endpoint of pathologic
      complete response is used as a surrogate marker for survival. Safety and tolerability
      assessed by number of grade 4 toxicities and hospitalizations.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive breast carcinoma

          -  Clinical stage Ⅱ-ⅢB

          -  Patients must have measurable disease as defined by palpable lesion with both
             diameters ≥2cm measurable with caliper and/or a positive mammogram or ultrasound with
             at least one dimension ≥2cm. Bilateral mammogram and clip placement is required for
             study entry. Baseline measurements of the indicator lesions must be recorded on the
             Patient Registration Form. To be valid for baseline, the measurements must have been
             made within the 14 days if palpable. If not palpable, a mammogram or MRI must be done
             within 14 days. If palpable, a mammogram or MRI must be done within 2 months prior to
             study entry. If clinically indicated, xrays and scans must be done within 28 days of
             study entry.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group(ECOG) performance status 0 to 1 within 14 days of
             study entry

          -  Normal (greater than 50%) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by
             echocardiography

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Adequate organ function within 2 weeks of study entry:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1500/mm3, Hgb &gt;9.0 g/dl and platelet count
                  &gt;100,000/mm3

               2. Total bilirubin &lt; upper limit of normal

               3. Creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL or calculated cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) &gt;50mL/min
                  using the Cockcroft Gault equation

               4. serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase(SGOT)(AST) or serum glutamic
                  oxaloacetic transaminase(SGPT)(ALT) and Alkaline Phosphatase must be within the
                  range allowing for eligibility

          -  Patients must be over 18 years old.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed
             within 7 days prior to the start of treatment

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Metastatic disease

          -  Prior chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, biologic therapy, investigational agent,
             targeted therapy or radiation therapy for current breast cancer. Patients with history
             of breast cancer greater than 5 years from initial diagnosis are eligible for the
             study. Patients may not have received anthracycline-based chemotherapy in the past.
             Patients with history of ductal carcinoma in situ(DCIS) are eligible if there were
             treated with surgery alone.

          -  History of previous or current malignancy at other sites with the exception of
             adequately treated carcinoma in-situ of the cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinoma
             of the skin. Patients with a history of other malignancies, who remain disease free
             for greater than five years are eligible.
