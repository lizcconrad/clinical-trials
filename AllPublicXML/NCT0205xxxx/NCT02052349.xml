    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Body mass index of 18.0 to 35.0 kg/m2 or, if outside the range, considered not
             clinically significant by the investigator

          2. Subjects must demonstrate their ability to swallow an empty size 000 capsule

          3. Must be willing and able to communicate and participate in the whole study

          4. Must provide written informed consent

          5. Must agree to use an adequate method of contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participation in a clinical research study within the previous 3 months

          2. History of any drug or alcohol abuse in the past 2 years or current smokers and those
             who have smoked within the last 12 months. A breath carbon monoxide reading of greater
             than 10 ppm at screening

          3. Females of childbearing potential who are pregnant or lactating (female subjects must
             have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening and admission)

          4. Radiation exposure, including that from the present study, excluding background
             radiation but including diagnostic xrays and other medical exposures, exceeding 5
             (micro sievert) mSv in the last 12 months or 10 mSv in the last 5 years. No
             occupationally exposed worker, as defined in the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999,
             shall participate in the study

          5. Positive hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M (HAVIgM), hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             results

          6. Donation or loss of greater than 400 mL of blood within the previous 3 months

          7. Subjects who are taking, or have taken, any prescribed or over-the-counter drug (other
             than 4 g per day paracetamol, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and hormonal
             contraception) or herbal remedies in the 14 days before Investigational Medical
             Product (IMP) administration. Exceptions may apply on a case by case basis if
             considered not to interfere with the objectives of the study by both the Principal
             Investigator (or delegate) and sponsor's medical monitor

          8. Acute diarrhoea or constipation in the 7 days before the predicted first study day. If
             screening occurs &gt;7 days before the first study day, this criterion will be determined
             on first study day. Diarrhoea will be defined as the passage of liquid faeces and/or a
             stool frequency of greater than 3 times per day. Constipation will be defined as a
             failure to open the bowels more frequently than every other day

          9. Presence of non-removable metal objects such as metal plates, screws, etc, in the
             abdominal region of the body (with the exception of sterilisation clips)
