  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      treatment effect of BBI-4000 when topically applied to subjects with axillary hyperhidrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, vehicle controlled, double blind study in subjects with axillary
      hyperhidrosis designed to assess the safety, tolerability and the effect on sweat production
      of topically applied BBI-4000 for 14 days.

      Safety will be assessed though vital signs, physical exam, adverse events, local skin
      reactions and laboratory tests (blood chemistry and hematology).

      Efficacy will be assessed though the gravimetrically measured sweat production and the
      Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score (HDSS).

      Pharmacokinetic information will also be collected.
