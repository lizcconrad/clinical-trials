  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and its related disorders (e.g., trichotillomania) are
      characterized by the marked difficulty in inhibiting unwanted or inappropriate responses.
      There is compelling evidence that poor response inhibition is a core cognitive feature of OCD
      and its related disorders, but no effective intervention exists that directly attempts to
      address this problematic cognitive deficiency. This study will examine the feasibility and
      clinical utility of a computerized cognitive training program designed to improve response
      inhibition among individuals diagnosed with OCD or trichotillomania.This training program
      offers systematic practice of response inhibition in the form of a 40-level computer game.
      Individuals with these conditions will be randomized to either 8 sessions of (a) computerized
      response inhibition training (RIT) or (b) placebo computer training (PLT). We hypothesize
      that RIT will outperform PLT in improving response inhibition capabilities and reducing
      relevant clinical symptoms. In sum, this project is expected to generate important knowledge
      to guide the development of effective computer-based treatment approaches that may help
      reduce critical problems of existing treatments such as suboptimal patient retention and
      treatment under-utilization, thereby improving overall treatment response rates among
      individuals suffering from OCD and related conditions.
