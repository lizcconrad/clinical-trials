  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      20 Patients will be recruited with confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma and anemia who are
      planned to undergo surgery. All patients will be treated with a single dose of 1g intravenous
      ferric carboxymaltose (FERINJECT).

      It is hypothesized that intravenous iron supplementation is efficacious at raising
      haemoglobin levels and reduced blood transfusion requirements.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are anemic at the time of operation have been shown to have an increased
      frequency of complications including wound infection and longer post-operative admissions.
      Similarly, patients who are anemic at the time of their cancer operation are more likely to
      require a blood transfusion which may increase the risk of recurrence of the cancer.

      At present, oral iron is often used to treat anemia preoperatively in an attempt to minimize
      the risk above. This drug is often poorly tolerated due to the side effect profile. Blood
      transfusions can also be administered but expose the patient to other risks including
      infection and transfusion associated reactions. In order to overcome these issues,
      intravenous iron preparations have been developed and have improved in safety.

      This is open label clinical trial, which looks to investigate the efficacy of intravenous
      iron is in the treatment of preoperative anemia in colorectal patients. The outcomes reviewed
      will include the amount and frequency of blood transfusions received, changes in patient
      blood profiles operative complications and hospital length of stay. The role of hepcidin as a
      biomarker of treatment response will also be assessed.

      All data will be confidentially recorded on a Case Report Form, as will drug reactions and
      side effects.
