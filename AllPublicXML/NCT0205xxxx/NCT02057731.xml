  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether carrier status for any type of glycogen
      storage disease (GSD) predisposes the carrier to GSD markers, like high cholesterol, by
      testing blood, urine, and saliva samples.

      Subjects will be asked to contribute about a teaspoon of blood, 1 oz of urine, and 2
      tablespoons of saliva samples in the morning before they have had anything to eat. The blood
      and urine samples will be tested for the markers of GSD, while the saliva sample will be used
      for genetic testing. Subjects' height and weight will also be measured.

      Subjects will also be asked to fill out a questionnaire about symptoms common to full GSD
      expression that they may have experienced, as well as if they are currently on any medication
      to control their cholesterol.
