  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate in ALS patients the regulatory T cell early response to
      two low-doses of IL-2 at 1 and 2 MIU per day after one course of 5 consecutive days
      comparatively to placebo.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study on ld-IL-2 as a therapeutic agent for ALS which aims at defining the
      activity and safety of a range a doses for subsequent use of the best dose in a phase II/III
      trial. For ethical reasons, ld-IL-2 must be tested as an add-on therapy to riluzole hence all
      patients will need to be treated with riluzole for at least three months prior to entry. A
      randomized (1:1:1), placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial will be carried
      out to assess ld-IL-2 activity on regulatory T cells and immuno-inflammatory markers in ALS
      patients treated for 3 months (5 days every four weeks repeated three times).

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      A. To evaluate maintenance of Tcell response after three repeated 5-day courses at one course
      every four weeks for 12 weeks.

      B. To evaluate the safety of ld-IL-2 therapy in an ALS population, with an overall follow-up
      of 6 months (up to 15 weeks after last administration); C. To evaluate functional changes
      throughout the study; D. To evaluate changes in other pre-defined blood cytology parameters,
      and a blood biomarker for axonal damage.
