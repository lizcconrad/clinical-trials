  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to inform the integration of mobile and social media components
      into larger interventions aimed at increasing adherence and maintenance of physical activity.
      Nearly half of the US population do not meet physical activity recommendations of ≥150
      minutes of moderate activity per week. The use of smartphones to &quot;self track&quot; data and upload
      that data to an online social network is becoming increasingly common and may be an effective
      way to motivate physical activity adherence and maintenance. We are proposing a two phase
      study to develop and evaluate a mobile health (&quot;mHealth&quot;) intervention that includes the use
      of two existing technologies: 1) the RunKeeper mobile app to collect and upload exercise data
      (distance, pace, time), and 2) the RunKeeper.com online social network as a place to analyze
      uploaded data and engage with a coach and online community. Phase 1 (n=10) will iteratively
      develop the mHealth intervention and phase 2 (n=30) will pilot the mHealth intervention
      (participants will be randomized to either mHealth intervention (n=20) or control (n=10)) to
      collect feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy data. All participants will
      attend a day-long ChiWalk/Run training to help them avoid potential injuries and meet their
      coach and community in-person. All participants will also be asked to wear a FitBit
      accelerometer from one week before the beginning of the intervention through one week after
      the end of the intervention to collect total physical activity data. This data will be
      uploaded automatically to the study data base. Primary outcomes will be total physical
      activity as collected by the FitBit accelerometer (and the RunKeeper mobile app for the
      intervention group) and secondary outcomes will be changes in psychological factors that may
      mediate adherence to physical activity.

    <measure>Change in mindfulness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and end of 10 weeks of active participation</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) to assess changes in mindfulness. FFMQ is a 39-item questionnaire with five subscales (observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, and non-reactivity to inner experience) and a summary score ranging from 39 to 195. Internal consistencies range from α=0.75-0.91.</description>

    <measure>Change in body awareness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and end of 10 weeks of active participation</time_frame>
    <description>We used the Multi-dimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) to measure body awareness. MAIA is a 32-item questionnaire with eight separately scored scales. .We used 3 of the 8 scales most relevant for an exercise intervention to assess body awareness. The subscales we used were: 1) Self-Regulation: ability to regulate distress by attention to body sensations; 2) Body Listening: active listening to the body for insight; 3) Trusting: experience of one's body as safe and trustworthy. Scales range from 0-5 with higher numbers representing higher aspects of body awareness with internal consistencies of α=0.83; 0.82; 0.79 on the Self-Regulation, Body Listening, and Trusting subscales, respectively.</description>
