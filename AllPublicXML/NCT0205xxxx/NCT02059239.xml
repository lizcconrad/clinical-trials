      This clinical trial is for men and women with whose lymphoma (non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin) did not
      respond to treatment or has returned after responding to previous therapy, and who are in
      need of a stem cell transplant.

      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of giving the drug
      Bendamustine, followed by high dose chemotherapy, within two weeks prior to a stem cell
      transplant for lymphoma that has not achieved a complete response to salvage (treatment used
      for relapsed disease) chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with Hodgkin's or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that did not respond to treatment or have
      disease that has returned after responding to previous treatment, and are in need of a stem
      cell transplant will be eligible for this pilot study. Thirty subjects will be enrolled, with
      15 subjects assigned to the autologous transplant cohort (according to disease status and
      eligibility) and 15 subjects to the allogeneic transplant cohort (according to diseases
      status and eligibility).

      Subjects will undergo the following a number of screening procedures to determine
      eligibility. All eligible subjects will receive bendamustine at a dose of 200 mg/ m2/ day for
      two days on Days - 24 and Day - 23 followed by a short break of 10 - 14 days. Subjects will
      then receive the conditioning regimen, BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine arabinoside,
      and Melphalan) and alemtuzumab for 6 days (Day -6 to Day -1) followed by an autologous or
      allogeneic transplant.

      Subjects with pathological confirmed B-cell malignancies will also receive rituximab 375
      mg/m2 on Days + 1 and +8 post-transplant. Subjects with T-cell lymphoma will be enrolled in
      the study but will not receive rituximab.

      After the transplantation all subjects will receive medication to prevent graft vs host
      disease and supportive care to prevent infections. To speed up the recovery of stem cells,
      subjects will receive post-transplant filgrastim (G-CSF).

      After discharge from the hospital, subjects will be seen regularly in the clinic for an exam
      and assessments. All these tests are considered standard of care.

                       bidirectional area of masses but standardized uptake value (SUV) remains ≥8
                       in at least some PET avid areas

                    -  Prior autologous transplant

               -  Autologous arm:

                    -  Partial response of &gt;50% reduction in bidirectional area of masses and SUV
                       reduction to &lt;8 in PET avid areas Subjects must have evaluable disease.

          -  Subjects must have received at least one induction therapy and one line of salvage
             therapy that each incorporate at least two drugs that are standard of care for
             lymphoma

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) ≥ 50%

          -  For autologous transplants: Subjects must have an adequate number of CD34+ stem cells

             investigational agent.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast feeding. Women of childbearing age must use adequate
             contraception and have a negative pregnancy test.

          -  The risks to an unborn fetus or potential risks in nursing infants are unknown.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to any medications listed in the protocol.

          -  Subject with severely decreased Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) or severely
             impaired pulmonary function tests (PFT's)

          -  Uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
