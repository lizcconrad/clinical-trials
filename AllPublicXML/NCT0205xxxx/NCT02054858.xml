      This study aims to assess if applying an ischaemic insult to an arm before giving intravenous
      contrast will help decrease the incidence of developing contrast induced acute renal injury
      in patients undergoing contrast-enhanced CT Scans.

      The main research question is 'In adult in-patients undergoing contrast-enhanced CT scans,
      does remote ischaemic pre-conditioning (RIPC) induced by brief arm ischaemia and reperfusion,
      when compared to control, reduce the proportion of patients developing contrast-induced acute
      kidney injury in the first 3 post-scan days? '.

      Intravenous contrast for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions is a leading cause of
      hospital-acquired acute renal failure (1). Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI)
      occurs through a complex mechanism including toxic and hypoxic renal tubular injury,
      diminished renal parenchymal circulation and renal endothelial dysfunction with the
      production of oxygen free radicals due to post-ischaemia oxidative stress (2). With
      increasing numbers of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, the incidence of CI-AKI will
      rise over the next few decades. Already, 40% of general surgical in-patients undergo
      cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography (CT), largely using contrast (3). Optimal
      clinical care in many specialties such as oncology, emergency medicine and surgery relies
      upon information derived from contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging. In consequence,
      large numbers of patients are exposed to the risk of CI-AKI. Current CI-AKI preventive
      measures comprise identification of at-risk patients, minimisation of contrast dose and the
      use of intravenous volume expansion (4). Simple, cost-effective methods to reduce CI-AKI are
      required.

      Risk factors for CI-AKI include advanced age, diabetes mellitus, pre-existing renal
      insufficiency and congestive cardiac failure. Dehydration also increases the risk (5). While
      patients over the age of 65 years currently account for 11% of the Irish population, they
      account for 30% of surgical admissions (6). In a recent cohort study of 1800 surgical
      in-patients in a major Irish teaching hospital, acute renal failure was a common major
      complication, occurring in 2.4% of patients (6). Multivariate analysis of this cohort
      demonstrated that increasing age and emergency admission were both independent risk factors
      for complications (6). Emergency surgical patients constitute a high-risk group in whom
      simple methods to minimise complications are required.

      Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a simple technique whereby brief periods of
      skeletal muscle ischaemia and reperfusion triggers a period of resistance to
      ischaemia-reperfusion injury in distant tissues e.g. heart or kidney (7). It reduces renal
      damage following endovascular aneurysm repair, a procedure requiring considerable
      contrast-volumes (8). A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that RIPC significantly reduced
      post-procedure creatinine levels following cardiovascular procedures, though there was
      considerable clinical heterogeneity between the included trials (9). We hypothesise that RIPC
      induced using brief periods of upper limb ischaemia-reperfusion will reduce AKI in patients
      undergoing contrast enhanced CT scans.

      The hypothesis that RIPC will reduce CI-AKI was first explored by Whittaker and Pryzklenk
      (10). They utilised available data from a patient cohort undergoing emergency coronary
      angioplasty. Patients with 1 to 3 balloon inflations in the coronary artery served as the
      control group whilst those with &gt;3 balloon inflations served as the RIPC group.Both groups
      displayed an immediate improvement in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). However,
      the control group then displayed a statistically significant decrease in eGFR by day 3
      post-procedure (77 +14 ml/min/1.73m2 versus 70 +12 ml/min/1.73m2). The RIPC group displayed
      no such difference by day 3 (81 +21 ml/min/1.73m2 versus 80 +14 ml/min/1.73m2) despite having
      received a larger contrast volume. This observation implied a potential protective effect for
      RIPC.

      Greater availability of CT technology has led to a dramatic increase in the number of
      patients undergoing ce-CTAP in recent years. Between 1996 and 2010, the number of patients
      undergoing CT scans in the United States tripled, increasing by 8% per annum (11).
      Simultaneously, an increasingly elderly and sick population means that many patients now have
      multiple co-morbidities, increasing their risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury.
      Approximately 6.5% of patients undergoing ce-CT develop acute kidney injury defined as a &gt;25%
      increase in serum creatinine from baseline (12). Simple methods to reduce CI-AKI are
      required. We propose that the use of remote ischaemic preconditioning could be a simple,
      cost-effective measure that could decrease the incidence of CI-AKI in high risk patients
      undergoing contrast enhanced CT scans.

    <description>Preconditioning will be performed in the same manner as several previous trials. Immediately prior to having the CT scan a CE-approved blood pressure cuff will be placed around one arm of the patient. It will then be inflated to a pressure of 200mmHg for 5 minutes. For patients with a systolic blood pressure &gt;185mmHg, the cuff will be inflated to at least 15mmHg above the patient's systolic blood pressure. The cuff will then be deflated and the arm allowed reperfuse for 5 minutes. This will be repeated so that each patient receives a total of 4 ischaemia-reperfusion cycles.</description>
