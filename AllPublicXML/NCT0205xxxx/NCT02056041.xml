  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selection criteria for safe hepatectomy for HCC are not well established. The aim of this
      study was the validation of the selection criteria for safe hepatectomy for hepatocellular
      carcinoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All consecutive patients submitted to hepatectomy for HCC based on the same preoperative
      selection criteria from our prospectively-maintained liver unit database. Such criteria
      included the value of bilirubin (BIL), the value of cholinesterases (CHE), the presence of
      ascites, the presence of esophageal varices, and the rate of residual liver volume.

    <description>The primary endpoint was the validation of our selection criteria for safe hepatectomy for HCC in regards to postoperative complications. The role of total bilirubin and cholinesterases was analzyed together with other clinical parameters.</description>

    <description>The secondary endpoint was the testing of the most common score systems for HCC, which are the CPT score, the MELD score, and the APRI score.</description>
