  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Aging is associated with a progressive and generalized deterioration of physiologic
           systems and greater incidence of chronic conditions, which ultimately translates into
           functional impairment, disability and dependency.

        -  Physical activity and exercise have been recognized as key pillars for the management of
           chronic diseases in support of medical treatment, and essential to increase physiologic
           function, but there is only limited evidence indicating increased physical function,
           following exercise interventions. One of the greatest challenges in the science of aging
           and exercise is to understand whether and to which extent exercise and active life-style
           may postpone the onset of disability and/or reverse physical impairments.

        -  Maintenance/improvements of physical function and mobility should be considered as
           primary targets for independent living, active engagement in societal challenges, and,
           more in general, when promoting &quot;active ageing&quot;.

        -  The aim of this study is to collect preliminary data to identify the feasibility and
           sustainability of an &quot;active life-style intervention&quot; in older adults with reduced
           mobility receiving a preventive home visit from the public health care authority.

        -  This study will represent the base for a larger phase III parallel group study
           implemented in the public health care setting, with the specific aim of improving
           physical function and delay the onset of functional impairment in older adults.
