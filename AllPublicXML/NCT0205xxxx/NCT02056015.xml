      This study is a first-in-human (FIH), single-dose, open-label, phase 1 study designed to
      assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), distribution, and radiation dosimetry of
      [68Ga]MLN6907 after a single intravenous (IV) administration. Patients with Metastatic
      Colorectal Carcinoma who are scheduled for resection of liver metastases as part of their
      treatment plan will be eligible for enrollment.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          -  Male or female patients 18 years or older.

          -  Must be diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) with liver metastasis and eligible and
             scheduled for resection of liver metastases as part of their standard of care
             treatment plan. The planned surgery must occur greater than 14 days after the day of
             imaging.

          -  Patients must consent to provide the sponsor with tumor tissue samples from their
             resected liver metastases.

          -  Easter Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.

          -  Female patients who are post menopausal, surgically sterile, or agree to practice
             effective methods of contraception from the time of signing the informed consent form
             through 60 days after the dose of [68Ga]MLN6907 or agree to practice true abstinence.

          -  Male patients who agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire
             study treatment period and through 4 months after the dose of [68Ga]MLN6907 or agree
             to practice true abstinence.

          -  Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study-related
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may
             be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          -  Suitable venous access for the study-required, blood sampling (ie, including PK
             sampling)

          -  Adequate hepatic function as defined in the protocol.

          -  Adequate renal function as defined in the protocol.

          -  Hemoglobin â‰¥ 9 g/dL.

          -  Recovery from all adverse effects from prior antitumor therapy to at least Common
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (V4.03) Grade 1.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in the
        study.

          -  Female patients who are lactating and breastfeeding or have a positive serum pregnancy
             test during the screening period or a positive urine pregnancy test on Day 1 before
             the first dose of [68Ga]MLN6907.

          -  Any serious medical or psychiatric illness, condition, or personal circumstance,
             including severe claustrophobia, severe dyspnea, severe back pain, etc., that, in the
             judgment of the investigator or project clinician, might potentially interfere with
             the procedures required in this study.

          -  Involvement in an investigative radioactive or other research procedure within 4 weeks
             prior to administration of [68Ga]MLN6907.

          -  Major surgery within 14 days prior to administration of [68Ga]MLN6907 5. Serious
             infection (viral, bacterial, or fungal) within 14 days before administration of
             [68Ga]MLN6907 or evidence of active infection during screening.

          -  Life-threatening illness unrelated to cancer.

          -  Clinically significant central nervous system (CNS) metastases.

          -  Known inflammatory bowel disease.

          -  Known hepatitis B surface antigen-positive or known or suspected active hepatitis C
             infection (testing not required).

          -  History of any hypersensitivity to any component of [68Ga]MLN6907.

          -  Symptomatic cardiac disease, including ventricular dysfunction, coronary artery
             disease, or arrhythmias, if this would, in the opinion of the investigator or project
             clinician, interfere with assessment of efficacy or safety of [68Ga]MLN6907.

          -  Admission or evidence of addictive disorders (eg, illicit drug use, drug abuse, or
             alcohol abuse) that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Inability to lie flat for the duration of image acquisition.
