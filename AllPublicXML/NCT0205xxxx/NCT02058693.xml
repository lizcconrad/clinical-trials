  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase 4 trial we will study the safety, tolerability and efficacy of mixed salts
      amphetamine (MSA), trade name Adderall, augmentation of antidepressant therapy for Major
      Depressive Disorder (MDD) in depressed outpatient adults who are taking an antidepressant but
      have not had complete resolution of their symptoms.

      40 adult outpatients with MDD who failed at least one adequate trial of antidepressant
      monotherapy will be consented in a 63-day, cross-sequential, multicenter study comprising two
      treatment phases of 21 days each. The time frame from consent to baseline is 7 days. Patients
      will receive placebo or MSA in Phase 1, and in Phase 2, participants will receive MSA. There
      will also be a two-week follow up visit after the completion of Phase 2.

      We hypothesize that MSA will be safe and well tolerated, and will improve the patient's
      response to their antidepressant and provide superior symptom relief to antidepressant alone.
      The primary outcome measure is the Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive-Physical Function
      Questionnaire (MGH-CPFQ).
