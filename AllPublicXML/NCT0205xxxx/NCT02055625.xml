    <textblock>
      Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation (HSCT), and is classified as acute (aGVHD) or chronic (cGVHD). aGVHD
      onsets within the first 100 days after transplant or with clinical features including
      erythema, liver dysfunction and oral mucositis, whilst cGVHD or persistent GVHD occurs in
      approximately 30-60% of transplant patients who survive their first year . Long-term
      five-year prognosis for cGVHD patients is poor with a 70% mortality rate. cGVHD manifests as
      an autoimmune-like disease affecting multiple sites, including skin, mouth, eyes,
      gastrointestinal tract, liver, and joints. The oral cavity is the second most common site to
      be affected with symptoms in 45-83% of cases. In the mouth a diverse spectrum of clinical
      features can be found for example mucosal lesions can affect almost any site, salivary gland
      dysfunction and restricted mouth opening. Short-term patients can experience mucosal
      sensitivity, malnutrition, problems speaking, increased caries risk, xerostomia, oral pain
      and a diminished quality-of-life. Long-term complications include secondary malignancies and
      perhaps early death. Clinical management seeks to alleviate the symptoms and improve
      quality-of-life but 50% of patients fail front-line systemic steroid therapy. Oral cGVHD can
      be treated with topical high potency corticosteroids and oral rinses, however these
      treatments are not always effective and carry a risk of systemic absorption. Mesenchymal
      stem/stromal cells (MSCs) resident in adult and fetal tissues, such as the bone marrow have
      the capacity to form bone, cartilage, stroma, muscle and fat, are known to exhibit
      immunosuppressive and immunoregulatory properties both in vivo and in vitro. MSC infusions
      have been used to treat disorders such as osteogenic imperfecta, cardiovascular disease and
      to heal large bony defects. Indeed, the immunosuppressive capacity of MSCs have led to
      infusions being used as a second-line treatment for GVHD patients, and our group has shown
      within a Phase II clinical trial, 55% aGVHD patients who failed front-line steroid treatment
      responded to MSC infusion these studies are going with cGVHD patients. The goal of this
      project is to perform a pilot study to determine whether MSC injections directly into mucosal
      lesions in patients with oral cGVHD are able to alleviate the symptoms and facilitate the
      reparative process.

    <description>Allogenous mesenchymal stromal cells will be injected directly underneath the mucosal lesions at one side under local anesthetic at 2.5-4 million cells/ml. A total of approximately 1.7 ml will be injected divided in 2-3 injections around the lesion. Patients will be followed every second day up to 7 days afterwards and then routinely at 14 days, 1 month, 2 months and 6 months to assess the healing process.</description>
