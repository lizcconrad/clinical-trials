  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with changes in the composition and metabolic function of the gut
      microbiota. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), also known as &quot;fecal bacteriotherapy&quot; or
      &quot;fecal infusion&quot;, refers to the process of injecting a liquid suspension of stool from a
      healthy donor into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of a patient to cure a specific disease.
      However, since the recently established concept of human gut microbiome and its significant
      role in health and disease has caught on in the medical scientific world, this procedure has
      gained a great pathophysiological strength, meaning not only the simple infusion of stools,
      but the transplantation of a healthy gut microbiota in a patient with a disrupted one. In a
      recent dutch experience, FMT from lean donors was able to increase the insulin sensitivity in
      patients with metabolic syndrome.

      Our primary aim is to evaluate if FMT from lean healthy donors, in association to lifestyle
      changes, is able to reduce insulin-resistance more than lifestyle changes alone in patients
      with metabolic syndrome.

      All the patients with metabolic syndrome will receive lifestyle counselling (1400
      kilocalories diet and physical activity encouragement), than will be randomized to FMT from
      healthy lean donors by upper endoscopy (group A) or no treatment (group B)
