      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole in subjects
      with Bipolar 1 Disorder or Schizophrenia who have a history of suboptimal aderence and are
      currently on treatment with oral aripiprazole.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole in subjects
      with Bipolar 1 Disorder or Schizophrenia who have a history of suboptimal aderence and are
      currently on treatment with oral aripiprazole. This will be an open-label observational pilot
      trial to compare the PK profile of aripiprazole at Visit 1 of subjects who are receiving oral
      aripiprazole and who have the potential for suboptimal adherent behavior with their assigned
      medication.

      Information obtained in the current trial will be used to inform the conduct of a randomized,
      open-label, parallel-group trial to assess between-group change from baseline adherence using
      PK sampling in subjects receiving oral aripiprazole with or without the MIND1 System
      (Protocol 316-13-211).

          -  Male and female subjects 18 to 55 years of age (inclusive) at time of informed consent

          -  Subjects with a primary current Axis 1 disorder of bipolar 1 disorder or schizophrenia
             as defined by DSM-IV-TR criteria, who have been treated in the outpatient setting for
             at least 2 months before screening

          -  Subjects with a score of 1-7 on the Morisky 8-Item Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8)

          -  Subjects with bipolar 1 disorder who have a YMRS score of 10 to 25 (inclusive), or
             subjects with schizophrenia who have a PANSS score of 60 to 90 (inclusive)

          -  Subjects able to ingest oral medication

          -  Subjects currently prescribed oral aripiprazole for either bipolar 1 disorder or

             over the last 2 weeks

          -  Subjects who have an exacerbation of mood or psychotic symptoms when they are not
