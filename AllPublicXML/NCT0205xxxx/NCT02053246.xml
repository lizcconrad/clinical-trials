  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), is one of the leading causes of
      pulmonary hypertension (PH). Despite the severity of this disease, no established treatments
      exist for this class of PH. Nebivolol is a drug used in high blood pressure and heart
      failure, but not used in patients with PH. Due to some additional properties it possesses,
      the investigators believe nebivolol will improve disease severity in patients with PH
      associated with HFpEF. The hypothesis of this research study is that nebivolol improves PH
      severity in patients with HFpEF, as measured by hemodynamic and clinical parameters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study will be a prospective, open-label 18-week clinical study of nebivolol in
      patients with PH associated with HFpEF. Patients will be identified in clinic based on
      echocardiogram (TTE) and right heart catheterization (RHC) results (both part of standard
      clinical care) indicating PH and HFpEF.
