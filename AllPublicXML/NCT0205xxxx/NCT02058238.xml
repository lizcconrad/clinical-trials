  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To quantify potential short- and long-term benefits of robotically-guided minimally invasive
      (MIS) or open-approach spine surgery in adult patients undergoing multi-level spinal
      instrumentation surgery, in comparison to image- or navigation-guided instrumentation in a
      matching cohort of control patients, performed using a freehand technique, both in MIS and
      open approaches.

        Adult patients (age over 21 years) undergoing long (5 or more consecutive vertebrae) open
        or minimally invasive instrumentation, correction and fusion sugery in the thoracic, lumbar
        or sacral spine who have been found to have kypho/scoliotic curve, sagittal or coronal

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult patients (age 21 years and older), undergoing long (5 consecutive vertebrae or
             more) spinal fusion surgery, between T1 to the sacrum.

          2. Cases may include surgeries involving iliac screws (e.g., Galveston technique or S2AI
             screws) although these screws will not be included in the data analysis.

          3. Cases may include augmented cases (when one or more of the screws are inserted into
             vertebrae after a vertebral augmentation procedure, such as kyphoplasty or
             vertebroplasty).

          4. Patient capable of complying with study requirements

          5. Signed informed consent by patient

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Infection or malignancy

          2. Primary abnormalities of bones (e.g. osteogenesis imperfecta)

          3. Primary muscle diseases, such as muscular dystrophy

          4. Neurologic diseases (e.g. Charcot-Marie Tooth, Guillain-Barre syndrome, cerebral
             palsy, spina bifida, or neurofibroma)

          5. Spinal cord abnormalities with any neurologic symptoms or signs

          6. Spinal cord lesions requiring neurosurgical interventions, such as hydromyelia

          7. Paraplegia

          8. Patients who have participated in a research study involving an investigational
             product in the 12 weeks prior to surgery

          9. Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may either put the participants at risk because of participation in the study, or may
             influence the result of the study.

         10. Pregnancy

         11. Patient cannot follow study protocol, for any reason

         12. Patient cannot or will not sign informed consent
