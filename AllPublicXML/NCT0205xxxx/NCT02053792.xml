  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the long-term safety and efficacy of rIX-FP for the control and
      prevention of bleeding episodes in children and adults with severe hemophilia B. The study
      will include subjects who have not previously been treated with Factor IX products, subjects
      who previously completed a CSL-sponsored rIX-FP lead-in study and subjects requiring major
      non-emergency surgery who have not previously completed a CSL-sponsored rIX-FP lead-in study.

      A surgical prophylaxis substudy will examine the efficacy of rIX-FP in subjects with
      hemophilia B who are undergoing non-emergency major or minor surgery. An additional substudy
      will examine the safety and PK of subcutaneous (SC) administration of rIX-FP.

    <description>Subjects will administer rIX-FP by intravenous infusion as routine prophylaxis, prevention, and on-demand treatment during a treatment period of approximately 3 years.
The routine prophylaxis treatment interval for previously treated patients may be changed at each scheduled 6-month follow-up assessment. On-demand treatment with rIX-FP will be used for all bleeding episodes requiring treatment. Subjects (other than those in France) may participate in a surgical 'substudy' in which rIX-FP may be administered before, during and after surgery. An additional substudy will examine the safety and PK of subcutaneous administration of rIX-FP.
For previously untreated patients, subjects will administer rIX-FP intravenously as weekly prophylaxis and/or on-demand treatment during the first 12 months, and as weekly routine prophylaxis thereafter.
The dose of rIX-FP administered will be based on the subject's previous rIX-FP use and/or pharmacokinetic data.</description>
