  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators will conduct a phase I/II trial in recurrent (temozolomide
      resistant) glioma patients. The overall goal of this study is to provide a foundation for
      future studies with indoximod tested in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients with radiation
      and temozolomide, or in combination with vaccine therapies.

      The aim of this study is to identify the safety profile and the recommended dose for phase 2
      study of the combination of indoximod (portion 1, phase 1b study). Investigators will then
      evaluate the tolerability and the preliminary activity in patients with recurrent GBM in
      three different situations:

        -  Combination of indoximod and temozolomide (bevacizumab-naive patients)

        -  Combination of indoximod and temozolomide with bevacizumab

        -  Combination of indoximod and temozolomide with stereotactic radiation. Ancillary studies
           will be conducted to assess the correlation between intra-tumoral IDO expression or
           serum biomarkers (immune monitoring) and treatment efficacy.

      If the current study shows an acceptable safety profile and suggests preliminary evidence of
      activity, this will provide the justification for subsequent randomized phase 2 studies in
      refractory glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

    <description>Phase 1b component:
To determine the adverse event profile (event type, incidence severity, duration causality and treatment intervention) and identify regimen-limiting toxicities (RLT) of indoximod plus temozolomide in combination therapy.
Specifically, investigators define regimen-limiting toxicity (RLT) as a toxicity that delays the planned administration of the next cycle of the backbone chemotherapy. The goal of the trial will be to find the maximum dose of indoximod that does not induce RLT in more than 1/6 of patients treated with temozolomide.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven intracranial glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV glioma) or
             gliosarcoma. In addition, the Phase 1b cohort will include patients with progressive
             WHO grade III glioma. There must be imaging confirmation (with and without gadolinium
             contrast) of tumor progression or regrowth.

          -  Patients will be eligible if the original histology was lower grade glioma and a
             subsequent diagnosis of glioblastoma or gliosarcoma is made.

          -  Unequivocal radiographic evidence for tumor progression by MRI. It is understood that
             some patients may be resected prior to enrolling onto protocol

          -  Patients must have completed a course of radiation therapy and at least 2 adjuvant
             cycles of temozolomide for the phase 2 component.

          -  Patients enrolling onto Cohort 2b who have been taken off bevacizumab must have had at
             least a 28 day washout from any previous administration of bevacizumab. It is
             preferred that patients who fail bevacizumab prior to trial entry remain on
             bevacizumab in the trial.

          -  Prior temozolomide is not required for the phase 1 component; prior radiation is
             required for the phase 1 arm. It is suggested (but not required) that patients be at
             least 3 months post radiation to reduce the chances of pseudoprogression.

          -  Patients must be on a steroid dose less than or equal to 2 mg of dexamethasone daily
             (or equivalent), and this dose must not have increased for at least 14 days prior to
             obtaining the enrollment.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤1 or Karnofsky ≥70%.

          -  Age between 16

          -  Normal organ functions, which includes adequate:

        Bone marrow function as defined by the following laboratory values:

          -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 x 10^9/L

          -  Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL

               -  Renal function (creatinine level within normal institutional limit, or creatinine
                  clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above
                  institutional normal).

               -  Liver function (AST/ALT ≤2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal, Total
                  bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times ULN, INR within 1.5 times ULN (or if receiving
                  anticoagulant therapy an INR of ≤ 3.0 is allowed with concomitant increase in PT
                  or an aPTT ≤ 2.5 × control).

               -  Must be 28 days from the administration of any investigational agent or prior
                  cytotoxic therapy with the following exceptions:

                  o Must be 14 days from administration of non-cytotoxic agents (e.g., bevacizumab
                  (except COHORT 2b), interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid,
                  tyrosine kinase inhibitor, etc.).

               -  Patients with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy, Gliadel
                  wafer, or stereotactic radiosurgery must have confirmation of progressive
                  disease, rather than radiation necrosis, by PET scanning, Thallium scanning, MRI
                  spectroscopy, or surgical documentation.

               -  The effects of indoximod on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
                  reason and because indoximod may affect maternal immune tolerance of the fetus,
                  sexually active women of child-bearing potential must agree to use two forms of
                  contraception (hormonal and barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior
                  to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Use of contraception
                  or abstinence should continue for a minimum of 1 month after completion of the
                  study. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
                  participating in this study, she should discontinue the study drug and inform her
                  treating physician immediately. Also men should be discouraged from fathering
                  children while on treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior invasive malignancy that is not low-grade glioma, high-grade glioma,
             glioblastoma, or gliosarcoma (except non-melanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma in situ
             of the cervix) unless the patient has been disease free and off therapy for that
             disease for a minimum of 3 years.

          -  Patients on the phase 2 portion of the study may not have more than 2 prior regimens
             for recurrent disease for glioblastoma/gliosarcoma. Patients on the phase 1 portion of
             the study may not have had more than 3 prior regimens.

          -  Active systemic infection requiring treatment, including any HIV infection or
             toxoplasmosis.

          -  Systemic corticosteroid therapy &gt; 2 mg of dexamethasone daily (or equivalent) at study
             enrollment.

          -  Baseline QTc interval of &gt;470 at study entry or patients with congenital long QT
             syndrome.

          -  Systemic corticosteroid therapy &gt; 2 mg of dexamethasone daily (or equivalent) at study
             enrollment

          -  Patients with significantly altered mental status that would prohibit the
             understanding or rendering of informed consent and compliance with the requirements of
             this protocol must have a legally authorized representative (LAR) willing to
             participate and support the patient throughout the trial. Affected patients without a
             LAR are excluded from participation.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in
             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into
             this study.

          -  Active or history of autoimmune disease

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study, where pregnancy is confirmed by a
             positive serum hCG laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/mL); breastfeeding should be discontinued.

          -  Patients with known autoimmune thyroid disease or positive anti-TPO antibodies
             (anti-Thyroid Peroxidase) at time of screening.
