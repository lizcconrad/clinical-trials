  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, there has been a rising trend of delaying childbearing and hence more women are
      diagnosed with breast cancer before completing their families. Given the continuous decline
      in recurrences and death secondary to breast cancer and the reassuring data on the safety of
      pregnancy following breast cancer more women are inquiring into the possibility of preserving
      fertility following chemotherapy. The challenge remains in using a regimen that is devoid of
      cyclophosphamide, but is as effective as the standard regimens that incorporate
      cyclophosphamide. The combination doxorubicin (50 mg/m2) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) (AP)
      followed by 12 weeks of paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) (P) emerges as a treatment option with
      convincing results regarding its effectiveness in the early setting, and could be potentially
      associated with less ovarian toxicity being devoid of cyclophosphamide.

    <time_frame>At screening, after 4 cycles of chemotherapy, at the end of chemotherapy, at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months following chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>Ovarian function will be evaluated using serum FSH, estradiol and AMH. Ovarian failure is defined as serum FSH &gt;40 IU/L. Ovarian insufficiency is defined as serum FSH level from 20 - 40 IU/L. Ovarian reserve will be evaluated by serum AMH. Adequate ovarian reserve is defined as serum AMH &gt;1 ng/ml. Menstrual function will be evaluated by collecting information of the 1st day of last menstrual cycle, and cycle length (days between two menstruating periods).

    <description>In patients menstruating regularly after 12 months of chemotherapy cessation, information on menstrual cycles will be collected at 18, 24 and up to 60 months after end of chemotherapy, until developing menopause, disease recurrence or becoming pregnant, whichever occurs earlier. This information will include the date of last menstrual period, menstruation duration and if 2 or more consecutive menstrual cycles were missed, allowing to assess irregularity and possible cessation of menses.</description>
