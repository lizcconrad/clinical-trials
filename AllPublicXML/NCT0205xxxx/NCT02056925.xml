      · 2D Speckle Tracking echocardiography gained importance for the evaluation of ventricle
      contractility. Many indications have been developed in child population. However, the
      comparability of measurements between different software systems is not well defined. We
      choose to compare two software systems very often used in paediatric subjects : Echopac by
      General Electric and QLAB 9.0 by Philips. We offer a randomly second echocardiography to
      children which have normal heart. We compare Strain and Strain rate results between the two
      tests with a study of variability : ultrasound variability, operator variability, reader
      variability.

      · We select children addressed to paediatric cardiologist for not serious reason (heart
      murmur, chest pain, sport capacity…), which had normal heart after evaluation. If they
      satisfied all inclusive criteria (0 to 17 years old, parental agreement, social security
      fund) and neither exclusive criteria (cardiac, respiratory or muscular problems, chronic
      diseases, drug with heart impact, poor image quality), we randomly execute a second
      echocardiography. Echocardiography are done with Vivid 7 ultrasound (General Electrics)
      and/or IE 33 ultrasound (Philips) by one or two trained operators. Strain loops are taken on
      three standard apical views (two, three and four-chamber views), short axis midventricular
      and aortic views, sub-costal short axis aortic view and sub-costal four-chamber apical views.
      Strain analysis are done in a second steps by one or two trained readers with adapted
      software : Echopac (General Electrics) or QLAB 0.0 (Philips). Strain and Strain rate results
      are collected for each ventricle in each dimension.We compare results between the two tests
      and done statistical analysis with a study of variability : ultrasound variability, operator
      variability, reader variability (correlation coefficient). We also done a feasibility study
      with use of &quot;poor image quality&quot;exclusion criteria.
