    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to examine the safety and tolerability of nusinersen
      (ISIS 396443) administered intrathecally to participants with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)
      who previously participated in ISIS 396443-CS2 (NCT01703988) or ISIS 396443-CS10
      (NCT01780246). The secondary objective is to examine the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      pharmacokinetic(s) (PK) of nusinersen administered intrathecally to participants with SMA who
      previously participated in ISIS 396443-CS2 or ISIS 396443-CS10.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical signs attributable to Spinal Muscular Atrophy

          -  Satisfactory completion of dosing and all study visits in ISIS 396443-CS2
             (NCT01703988) or ISIS 396443 CS10 (NCT01780246) with an acceptable safety profile, per
             Investigator judgement.

          -  Able to complete all study procedures, measurements and visits and parent/participant
             has adequately supportive psychosocial circumstances, in the opinion of the
             investigator

          -  Estimated life expectancy &gt; 2 years from Screening

          -  Meets age-appropriate institutional criteria for use of anesthesia/sedation, if use is
             planned for study procedure

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have any new or worsening of existing condition which in the opinion of the
             Investigator would make the subject unsuitable for enrollment, or could interfere with
             the participant participating in or completing the study.

          -  Dosing in ISIS 396443-CS2 (NCT01703988) or ISIS 396443-CS10 (NCT01780246) within 180
             days (6 months) of screening, or longer ago than 396 days (13 months) from screening

          -  Hospitalization for surgery (i.e. scoliosis surgery) or pulmonary event within 2
             months of screening or planned during the duration of the study

          -  Presence of an untreated or inadequately treated active infection requiring systemic
             antiviral or antimicrobial therapy

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in hematology or clinical chemistry parameters

          -  Treatment with another investigational drug, biological agent, or device within
             1-month of Screening or 5 half-lives of study agent, whichever is longer. Any history
             of gene therapy or cell transplantation.

        NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
