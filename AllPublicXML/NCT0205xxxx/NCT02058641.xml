    <textblock>
      This will be an exploratory, open-label, single sequence, two part study (Part A and an
      optional Part B). The aim of this study will be to assess whether systemic inhibition of
      Lipoprotein associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) in humans, effected by 11 days of once
      daily dosing to steady state with 160 milligrams (mg) of enteric coated (EC) darapladib, will
      specifically reduce the number of macrophages and/or result in a higher proportion of M2
      macrophages in skin blisters induced by cantharidin (a chemical agent that causes blisters).
      In Part A of the study, a cohort of 8 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus will be
      recruited. In Part B of the study, a cohort of 8 additional healthy subjects with matching
      age (+/- 24 months) and gender to Part A may be recruited.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female between 18 and 60 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40
             milli-international units (MIU)/milliliter (mL) and estradiol &lt; 40 picograms (pg)/mL
             (&lt;147 picomoles per liter [pmol/L]) is confirmatory]. [Females on hormone replacement
             therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of
             the contraception methods listed in the protocol if they wish to continue their HRT
             during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4
             weeks should elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval
             depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal
             status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive
             method]; Child-bearing potential and is abstinent (abstinence from penile-vaginal
             intercourse must be consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject)
             or agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in the protocol for an
             appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior
             to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point.
             Female subjects must agree to use contraception until 42 days after the last dose of
             study medication.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) within the range of 19.0-35.0 kilograms per meter square (kg/
             m^2) (inclusive).

          -  QTc interval Fridericia correction (QTcF) &lt;480 milliseconds (msec) in all subjects,
             including those with bundle branch block at screening electrocardiogram (ECG). Note
             that if the initial QTc value is prolonged, the ECG should be repeated two more times
             (with at least 5 minutes between ECG readings) and the average of the 3 QTc values
             used to determine eligibility.

        Additional Criteria for Diabetic Subjects

          -  A diagnosis of T2DM as determined by a responsible physician based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, with
             onset at least 6 months prior to screening and on stable treatment for 3 months prior
             to screening.

          -  Subjects have no recent changes or anticipation of future changes in
             anti-hyperglycaemic therapies during the 3-month period before and during the study

             by physical examination.

             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, vital signs, complete
             blood count and clinical chemistry. A subject with a clinical abnormality or
             laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may
             be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the
             finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with
             the study procedures.

          -  Unable to refrain from the use of non-prescription drugs; these include vitamins,
             herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if
             the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to
             Day 1 of session 1 and continuing until the final follow up visit. Anticipated

             medications, antihypertensive medications, or other changes that in the opinion of the

             the 3-month period before and anticipated during the study. Poorly controlled
             hypertension refers to either systolic blood pressure &gt;160 millimeters of mercury
             (mmHg) or diastolic blood pressure &gt;110mmHg (mean of 3 measurements according to
             protocol-specified conditions). Patients may enter the study if the adjustment to
             blood pressure medications results in the improved control of hypertension at the
             Baseline visit).

             anti-coagulants/anti-platelet agents (low dose aspirin / NSAIDs are not permitted)
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator and/or the GSK Medical Monitor, will

             considered to be at risk of these conditions e.g. has undergone surgery resulting in
