    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this program of research is to develop and disseminate an efficacious
      intervention for weight concern that will significantly increase smoking cessation rates
      among women. The overall objective of this project is to develop this intervention and modify
      it based on piloting and feedback to ensure its feasibility and acceptability. These
      objectives will be accomplished by pursuing the following specific aim: 1) develop a
      group-based distress tolerance treatment for weight concern (DT-W) in female smokers and a
      comparison health education (HE) program and pilot both treatments with three groups of 10
      (total N = 30) female weight-concerned smokers (2 DT-W groups, 1 HE group).
