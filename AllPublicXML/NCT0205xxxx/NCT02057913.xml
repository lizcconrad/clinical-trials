    <textblock>
      VinCaP is a multicentre single-arm phase II trial. 22 patients will receive Vinflunine
      chemotherapy (Vinflunine 320mg/m2 given intravenously on day 1 of each cycle of 21 days, four
      cycles to be given prior to formal re-staging).

    <measure>Clinical Benefit</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the clinical benefit (objective response &amp; stable disease rate) and toxicity of vinflunine in patients with inoperable (locally advanced or metastatic) cancer of the penis and thus determine whether this drug warrants further research in this indication.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of patients having achieved partial or complete remission. The proportion of patients with objective response will be calculated and presented along its 95% confidence interval.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12 weeks on treatment, and at follow-up, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months (timed from end of last cycle of chemotherapy)</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicity will be evaluated, using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4 scoring, after each cycle, at the end of treatment and at follow up visits. The proportion of patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 toxicities at these time points and until progression will be reported as well as the Serious Adverse Events (SAEs).</description>

    <description>Progression-free survival will be defined as time from registration until the first of clinically or radiologically documented disease progression, or death from any cause death. Patients alive and progression-free at time of analysis will be censored at date last seen.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from registration until death from any cause, up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients alive at time of analysis will be censored at date last seen. Patients lost to follow-up will be censored at date last seen.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment Compliance will be defined as proportion of planned doses delivered. Reasons for non-delivery of planned doses (patient or clinician preference, toxicity and tolerability) will be collected.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male, ≥18 years.

          2. Measurable disease as determined by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors) criteria (version 1.1).

          3. Patients who present with purely cutaneous measurable disease should fulfill RECIST
             Criteria (see Appendix 1). Lesions should be a minimum size of 10 mm and measured
             using calipers by clinical examination.

          4. Histologically-proven squamous cell carcinoma of the penis.

          5. Stage: M1, or; M0, any T, N3 (i.e. involvement of deep inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes)
             or; M0, any T, N2 (i.e. involvement of multiple or bilateral superficial lymph nodes)
             or; M0, T4 (tumour invades other adjacent structures) any N.

             Notes:

               1. Patients with M0 disease may be considered if, in the opinion of the specialist
                  Multi Disciplinary Team (MDT), they are deemed unlikely to benefit from surgery
                  with curative intent and unlikely to tolerate combination chemotherapy due to
                  comorbidities and/or disease burden.

               2. Patients who have received prior radiotherapy to non-target lesions may be
                  included.

          6. Pre-treatment blood counts, haematology and biochemistry values within the following
             acceptable limits: Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3, Platelets
             ≥100,000/mm3, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥60ml/min. GFR to be assessed according
             to local practice (recommended technique of eGFR using the MDRD formula.

          7. Liver function: Patients must have (with or without the presence of liver metastases):

               -  A prothrombin time &gt;70% normal value (NV) AND

               -  Bilirubin &lt;1.5xUpper Limit of Normal (ULN) AND

               -  Transaminases &lt;2.5xULN AND

               -  GGT &lt;5xULN

          8. Performance Status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0, 1 or 2.

          9. Written, informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pure verrucous carcinoma of the penis.

          2. Squamous carcinoma of the urethra.

          3. Patients who do not have measurable disease as determined by RECIST (version 1.1).

          4. T1 N1 M0 disease.

          5. T2 N1 M0 disease.

          6. M0, T3, N1 (tumour invades urethra or prostate and single inguinal node involved).

          7. Unfit for vinflunine chemotherapy (as assessed by the multidisciplinary team).

          8. Previous chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.

          9. Contraindication to chemotherapy.

         10. Other malignancy (other than Squamous Cell Carcinoma or Basal Cell Carcinoma of
             non-penile skin) that has required surgical or non-surgical treatment in the last 5
             years. All patients with a previous cancer diagnosis must be discussed the Chief
             Investigator prior to entry into the trial.

         11. Patients who have received radiotherapy to target lesions and have no other lesions
             that can act as target lesions instead:

             e.g. Patients with recurrent pelvic lymph nodes that are deemed irresectable and who
             have had prior radiotherapy to those lymph nodes:

             i. are INELIGIBLE if the involved lymph nodes are the only site of disease.

             ii. are ELIGIBLE if they have other measurable sites of disease e.g. pulmonary
             metastases.

             If uncertain, please discuss with the Chief Investigator.
