      The purpose of this study is to measure the two-year rate of tooth loss in patients who have
      received external beam radiation therapy with curative intent for head and neck cancer. The
      study will also evaluate the sequelae of radiation therapy and oral complications that may
      occur as a result to receiving radiation therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study to document dental and other oral outcomes in patients who
      receive external beam radiation therapy with curative intent, as part of clinical care for a
      head and neck cancer. Five hundred and seventy-five participants will be enrolled. All study
      participants will receive a baseline oral examination prior to the start of radiation
      therapy. Follow-up examinations and data collection will be conducted at six-month intervals
      up to 2 years after the start of radiation therapy. The primary outcome will be the two-year
      rate of tooth loss. Secondary outcomes will include measures of dental caries, periodontal
      health, salivary flow, and exposed bone/osteoradionecrosis.

      The proposed research will provide more information to inform the community about the
      sequelae of Radiation Therapy (RT) in head and neck cancer patients, to refine current
      guidelines and to design future studies on the dental management of these patients.

    <description>The primary outcome measure is the two-year rate of tooth loss in patients who have received at least one session of external beam radiation therapy with curative intent for head and neck cancer.
&quot;Tooth loss&quot; will be defined as a dental extraction that has been performed or recommended. Since dental extractions are often avoided in this population because of the increased risk of osteoradionecrosis (ORN), tooth loss will also include teeth having a dental procedure to avoid extraction of a tooth that would otherwise have been extracted if the individual had not received RT and teeth recommended for extraction that have not been treated. The following categories will constitute teeth that would otherwise be recommended for extraction:
non-restorable because of fracture or extent of caries;
amputated crown with root remaining;
uncontrolled or persistent periodontal or odontogenic infection.</description>
