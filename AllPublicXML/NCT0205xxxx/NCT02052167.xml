      This study is planned to evaluate the human factor (HF)/usability of pediatric or adolescent
      JIA patients and the caregivers of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) patients with the
      Methotrexate Prefilled Pen (including a label comprehension assessment and a device
      robustness evaluation).

    <description>Test case scenarios were designed to determine if the potential risks associated with the use of the prefilled pen were mitigated by information contained in the patient leaflet and the training provided to each patient or caregiver. The test case scenarios with observation and performance measures will be evaluated.</description>
