      -  Ranibizumab can be a safe treatment for diabetic macular edema regarding maintenance of
           retinal ganglion cell function after repeated intravitreal injections.

        -  To evaluate the safety of intravitreal ranibizumab repeated injections in patients with
           diabetic macular edema regarding maintenance of retinal ganglion cell function.

        -  The primary endpoint for the study will be the changes in full-field and focal macular
           photopic negative response (PhRN) amplitude (in µV) over time, from baseline to month
           12.

    <description>The photopic negative response (PhNR) of the full-field cone electroretinograms (ERGs) is a functional indicator of retinal ganglion. The PhNR consists of a negative-going wave that follows the photopic cone b wave. The PhNR is selectively attenuated in patients with optic nerve disease and glaucoma, indicating that the PhNR can be an objective functional measure reflecting the sum of the total response of the retinal ganglion cells in the entire retina.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients, older than 18 years, who have signed an informed consent.

          -  Patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus and prior diagnosis of diabetic
             macular edema (DME), who had not undergone any previous treatment, either
             pharmacological or laser photocoagulation.

          -  Patients with visual impairment due to DME whom, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would benefit from treating with IVR.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to ranibizumab or any of its components.

          -  Previous participation in any clinical studies of investigational drugs within 1 month

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, including women whose career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation
             precludes intercourse with a male partner and women whose partners have been
             sterilized by vasectomy or other means, UNLESS they are using two birth control
             methods. The two methods can be a double barrier method or a barrier method plus a
             hormonal method. Adequate barrier methods of contraception include: diaphragm, condom
             (by the partner), intrauterine device (copper or hormonal), sponge or spermicide.
             Hormonal contraceptives include any marketed contraceptive agent that includes an
             estrogen and/or a progestational agent.

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.

          -  Inability to comply with study or follow-up procedures.
