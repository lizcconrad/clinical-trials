  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dual-energy CT (DECT) provides information on the blood volume in tumors and lymph nodes. As
      tumors respond to treatment, preliminary data suggests that the blood volumes changes as
      well. Investigators are therefore using DECT to test whether it can be used on radiation
      treatment to rapidly assess response to treatment.

    <measure>Change in the tumor's maximum iodine related attenuation (IRA) from baseline to on-treatment DECT.</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 1, 3, 5</time_frame>
    <description>This change in the maximum IRA will be compared with the change in the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max) between baseline PET-CT and follow-up PET-CT at 3 months after treatment. For patients undergoing surgery, this change in the maximum IRA will be compared between patients who have a complete pathologic response, and those patients who do not.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged greater than 18 years with a diagnosis of stage III non-small cell lung
             cancer.

          -  Planned treatment with either definitive chemoradiotherapy or preoperative
             chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical resection.

          -  PET-CT study within 4 weeks of next available DECT study.

          -  Patients must have measurable primary and nodal disease, defined by at least one
             lesion (primary and lymph node) greater than 1 cm.

          -  Kidney function sufficient to tolerate iodine-based CT contrast.

          -  No allergy to iodine-based contrast.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with a prior history of thoracic radiotherapy.

          -  Participants may not be receiving any other study agents.

          -  Inability to tolerate CT contrast

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because radiotherapy has the potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk
             of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             radiotherapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             radiotherapy. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.
