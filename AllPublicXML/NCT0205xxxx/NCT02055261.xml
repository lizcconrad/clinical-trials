  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The appearance of postural instability and gait disorders is a major turning point in the
      evolution of Parkinson's disease (PD). These axial symptoms are usually unresponsive to
      L-Dopa and represent a severe impairment for the patients due to frequent falls and reduced
      outside mobility. There is no effective pharmacological treatment available for these
      symptoms, and their pathophysiology is not well known : it is currently assumed that
      non-dopaminergic brainstem lesions participate to axial symptoms in PD. Surgically, these
      patients cannot benefit from high frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic
      nucleus (STN) since this operation tends to even aggravate axial symptoms unresponsive to
      L-Dopa in some patients. A dysfunction of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) might be at the
      origin of these axial symptoms, since the PPN participates in the maintenance of posture and
      motion in primates. In PD patients, recent reports have suggested that low frequency
      stimulation of the PPN may equally improve gait and posture. However, these results are
      debatable due to methodological limitations, insufficient clinical evaluation and uncertain
      anatomical targeting. Thus, our aim is to propose a low frequency PPN stimulation to six
      advanced PD patients according to the usual criteria for STN DBS who are, however, unsuitable
      for this operation due to gait and posture disorders. We will perform a randomized,
      double-blind and cross over design (two months periods with and without DBS randomly assigned
      to each patient). The targeting will be allowed by a a three-dimensional and deformable atlas
      of the basal ganglia fusioned with the stereotaxic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of each
      patient. Evaluations will comprise 1 month before surgery and in &quot;Off&quot; and &quot;On&quot; stimulation
      condition:

        -  clinical motor assessment in both &quot;Off&quot; and &quot;On&quot; drug state, including cardinal
           parkinsonian signs, gait and balance

        -  gait initiation physiological evaluation

        -  cognitive and behavioral testing If our hypothesis is confirmed, low frequency PPN
           stimulation may well represent a substantial improvement of our therapeutic options for
           advanced PD patients suffering from debilitating gait and posture disorders unresponsive
           to L-Dopa.
