      The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate adaptive goal setting and feedback
      interventions (Adaptive Interventions) to promote physical activity behaviors and compare it
      to static physical activity interventions (Static Interventions) using two levels of goal
      setting (Adaptive Goals vs. Static Goals) and two levels of reinforcement procedures
      (Praise/Rewards and No Praise/Rewards) in a 2 x 2 factorial randomized controlled trial. All
      four groups will receive the intervention via a semi-automated text message system developed
      by the investigators study team.

      The primary aim of this study will be to:

        1. Evaluate whether the adaptive interventions result in greater change in physical
           activity (pedometer-measured steps/day) compared to the static Intervention groups.
           HYPOTHESES: Participants in the adaptive interventions will increase their steps/day
           more than participants in the Static Intervention groups. The Adaptive Goals and
           Reinforcement Group will outperform the other 3 groups.

           The secondary aims of this study will be to:

        2. Evaluate the effectiveness of the adaptive and static goal interventions in improving
           anthropometric, cardiovascular fitness, and cardiometabolic risk factors. HYPOTHESES:
           Participants in the adaptive interventions will show greater improvements in fitness,
           lean and fat body mass, and serum biomarkers than participants in the Static
           Intervention groups. The Adaptive Goals and Reinforcement Group will outperform the
           other 3 groups.

        3. to assess participants' satisfaction with the overall program.
