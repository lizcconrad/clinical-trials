  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyslipidemia contributes greatly to the formation and progression of atherosclerosis (AS),
      which plays a dominant role in leading to CHD.

      Xuezhikang is a partially purified extract of fermented red yeast rice (Monascus purpureus).
      It is composed of 13 kinds of natural statins, unsaturated fatty acids, ergosterol,amino
      acids, flavonoids, alkaloid, trace element, and so forth. Xuezhikang has been recommended in
      a guideline for China adult dyslipidemia prevention.

      This study aims to evaluate the benefit and side effect of Xuezhikang, a potential
      alternative drug of statins, for patients with dyslipidemia, and thus provide further
      evidence for clinical application.
