      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of Chloroquine comparing with placebo for
      treatment of non- response HCV patients.. In this triple blind pilot study, 20 patients with
      confirmed chronic hepatitis C will be randomize into treatment group (Chloroquine 150 mg
      daily, for 8 weeks) or control group (placebo once daily, for 8 weeks). Patients who have
      receiving anti neoplastic, anti viral or Immunomedullator drugs during 6 months prior to
      study, have co-infection Hepatitis A,C,D or HIV, severe liver or renal dysfunction, are
      pregnant or breast fed, or refuse to sign informed consent will be excluded.. At the end of
      therapy (12 weeks) and at baseline, first, second and third month after receiving drug and
      placebo HCV Virus load, CBC LFT and biochemical parameters will be evaluated and compared
      between groups.
