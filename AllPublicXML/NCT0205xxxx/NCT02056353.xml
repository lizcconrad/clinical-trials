  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most critically ill patients are confronted with hyperglycaemia, which is associated with an
      increased mortality and morbidity risk. Normalising these elevated blood glucose levels by
      intensive insulin therapy may improve patient outcome, but is associated with an increased
      risk of hypoglycaemia. The LOGIC-2 study hypothesises that the LOGIC-Insulin computerised
      software algorithm will allow better (less hyperglycaemia) and safer (less hypoglycaemia)
      blood glucose control in critically ill patients than nurse-directed blood glucose control.
