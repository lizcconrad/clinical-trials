  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SAGE-547 in subjects
      in super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study consisting of a Screening period (1 day), 4-day treatment period
      (96 hours) followed by a 1-day dose taper period (24 hours), a 2-day acute follow-up period,
      and a 3 week extended follow-up period.

      On Day 1 of treatment SRSE subjects under seizure suppression or burst-suppression with a
      continuous IV AED (third-line agent) will be given a 1-hour IV loading infusion of SAGE-547
      followed by a maintenance infusion. After 48 hours of SAGE-547 treatment, the continuous IV
      AED (third-line agent) will be weaned while continuing SAGE-547 at the maintenance infusion
      for the remainder of the treatment period. After 96 hours (4 days) of therapy with SAGE-547,
      the dose will be tapered and discontinued over 24 hours.

      The subjects will have routine continuous EEG monitoring during the Screening period, and
      continuing until 48 hours after SAGE-547 treatment has completed. Subjects will then have
      follow-up examinations weekly for the next 3 weeks (Days 8, 15, 22, and 29), during which
      safety and functional assessments will be obtained. Apart from treatment with SAGE-547, all
      subjects will receive the standard of care for adults in SRSE along with ongoing treatment
      for all underlying medical conditions.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects 2 years of age and older.

          -  Subjects with an EEG-confirmed SRSE diagnosis under concomitant therapy with a
             continuous IV AED (third-line agent) for ≥ 24 hours. For this study, SRSE is defined
             by the following criteria and in accordance with those used at major epilepsy
             treatment centers:

               -  Failure to respond to the administration of at least one first-line agent (e.g.,
                  benzodiazepine or other emergent initial AED treatment), according to institution
                  standard of care, and

               -  Failure to respond to at least one second-line agent (e.g., phenytoin,
                  fosphenytoin, valproate, phenobarbital, levetiracetam or other urgent control
                  AED) according to institution standard of care, and

               -  Presence of one or more breakthrough seizures &gt; 6 hours after initiation of the
                  continuous IV AED/third-line agent (e.g., pentobarbital, midazolam, propofol)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with SRSE due to anoxic/hypoxic encephalopathy, children (subjects aged less
             than 18 years) with an encephalopathy due to an underlying progressive neurological
             disorder.

          -  Subjects with clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities.

          -  Subjects with a significant medical or surgical condition that may compromise vital
             organ systems, or other conditions that would place the subject at increased risk such
             as dialysis or acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe cardiogenic or vasodilatory
             shock requiring 2 or more pressors, fulminant hepatic failure, etc.

          -  Subjects who are receiving a continuous IV AED (third-line agent) for seizure
             suppression or burst-suppression that will require greater than 24 hours to wean.
