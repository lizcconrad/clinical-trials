      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a salt restriction diet improves immune
      parameters in patients with autoimmune hepatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is unknown although both genetic and environmental
      factors are thought to be involved. A defect in immune regulation affecting regulatory T
      cells (Tregs) has been demonstrated in AIH. Tregs function in the maintenance of immune
      homeostasis by controlling autoreactive immune responses to self-antigens.

      Rationale: the western diet has been postulated as a potential environmental risk factor for
      the increasing incidence of autoimmune diseases in developed countries. Data from the
      investigators' laboratory also suggests that increased dietary salt intake might represent an
      environmental risk factor for the development of autoimmune diseases through the induction of
      pathogenic Th17 cells. The dramatic in vitro effects of high salt on the induction of
      pathogenic Th17 cells from na√Øve human CD4 cells {Kleinewietfeld, Hafler. Nature. 2013 Apr
      25;496(7446):518-22. doi: 10.1038/nature11868.}, and block of in vitro Treg suppression, in
      line with in vivo effects on worsening murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
      (EAE), have prompted the investigators to examine the effects of increased dietary sodium
      chloride in a human in vivo system.

      The investigators hypothesize that excess dietary salt may function as an environmental
      trigger that favors induction and expansion of pathogenic Th17 cells and leads to functional
      impairment of Tregs, thereby favoring development of autoimmunity. The investigators aim to
      study their established in vitro model in humans by altering the salt intake in patients over
      a 20-day period.
