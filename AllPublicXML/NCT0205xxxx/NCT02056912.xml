    <textblock>
      Human lipodystrophies (lipoD) represent a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by
      generalized or partial fat loss, with fat hypertrophy in other depots when partial.3, 4
      Insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and diabetes are generally associated, leading to early
      complications. Acquired lipoD can be generalized, resembling congenital forms, or partial, as
      the Barraquer-Simons syndrome, with loss of fat in the upper part of the body contrasting
      with accumulation in the lower part. The most common forms of lipoD are iatrogenic. In human
      immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, some first-generation antiretroviral drugs were
      strongly related with peripheral lipoatrophy and metabolic alterations. Genetic forms are
      very uncommon: recessive generalized congenital lipoD result in most cases from mutations in
      the genes encoding seipin or the 1-acyl-glycerol-3-phosphate-acyltransferase 2 (AGPAT2).
      Dominant partial familial lipoD result from mutations in genes encoding the nuclear protein
      lamin A/C or the adipose transcription factor PPARgamma. Importantly, LMNA mutations are also
      responsible for metabolic laminopathies, resembling the metabolic syndrome and progeria, a
      syndrome of premature aging. Molecular genetic bases of many rare forms of genetic lipoD
      remain to be elucidated.

      The investigators have recently evaluated two sisters (index patients) affected by a syndrome
      associating diffuse leukoencephalopathy and partial lipoD. The investigators have analyzed
      numerous known genetic causes of leukodystrophies and lipoD but the investigators failed to
      identify a known cause for this syndrome which has never been previously reported. The
      investigators then switched their effort to analyses of exome using next generation
      sequencing in both affected sisters and their unaffected relatives (one sister and two
      parents). The investigators identified an excellent candidate gene with a homozygous missense
      mutation in both affected sisters. The investigators now aim to prove the involvement of this
      candidate gene in lipoD's determinism by a search of additional mutations in the candidate
      gene in a series of patients affected with lipoD (collaboration with Pr Capeau's Team)
      (LIPOGENE study) and by functional analyses performed in the two index patients on blood and
      skin samples (LIPOGENE sub-study).
