      The objectives of this study are: 1) to design new diagnostic criteria used to accurately
      define heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF); 2) to better define the risk
      factors associated with HFpEF; 3) to elucidate the clinical, cellular and molecular
      mechanisms involved with the development and progression of HFpEF; 4) to design and test new
      therapeutic strategies for patients with HFpEF.
