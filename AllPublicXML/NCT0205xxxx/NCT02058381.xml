  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the evidence acquired in the post-menopausal setting with everolimus and on
      pre-clinical evidences supporting the investigation of PI3K inhibitors, such as alpelisib and
      buparlisib, in combination with endocrine therapy in hormone receptor-positive MBC, the
      purpose of this phase Ib trial is to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the
      RP2D(s), to characterize the safety and tolerability, to determine the single and multiple
      dose PK profile and assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of alpelisib and buparlisib in
      combination with tamoxifen plus goserelin acetate in premenopausal hormone receptor-positive
      advanced breast cancer patientsgroup.
