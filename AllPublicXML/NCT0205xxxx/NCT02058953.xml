  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect and bank samples of blood and tissues (such as brain
      tissue or lymph nodes), as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is the fluid that bathes
      and cushions the spinal cord. The investigator will analyze DNA biomarkers in the samples.
      The investigator hopes that by studying the biomarkers, he can develop tests in the future
      that can detect central nervous system (CNS) metastasis in blood samples before they show up
      on x-ray and develop medicines that can specifically target CNS metastasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among the different sites to which melanoma can spread, the Central Nervous System (CNS) has
      the highest chance of developing metastases. Prognosis for metastatic melanoma involving the
      CNS is worse than that of CNS metastases from other cancers. Therefore, it is felt that early
      identification of this condition, even before it is found on x-ray (either MRI or CT scan),
      would be beneficial so that patients can undergo treatment earlier.

      The investigator hypothesizes that the tumor cell genetics, expressed proteins, and/or
      signaling pathways of melanoma brain metastases may exhibit features that distinguish
      melanoma brain metastases. The investigator further hypothesizes that melanoma brain
      metastases may be associated with changes in the cerebrospinal fluid, where protein fragments
      expressed by melanoma brain metastases may be shed that cannot be found in normal CNS
      tissues, extracranial metastases (MEM) or at the same levels in the peripheral blood.

CNS tumor specimens, specifically the remaining portion from the resected melanoma CNS metastasis
the remaining portion from the adjacent &quot;normal&quot; CNS tissue. No additional normal brain tissue will be collected for research purposes only, however the routinely collect peritumoral tissue will be retained.
melanoma specimens from other extracranial, clinically palpable metastatic sites.

        Patients with biopsy-proven melanoma who present with melanoma CNS metastases, a condition
        that has been previously either biopsy-proven or there is strong suspicion based on the
        radiologic imaging (brain MRI or brain CT with intravenous contrast) will be considered for
        the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have provided written Informed Consent prior to any study procedure.

          -  Regarding patients with distant metastatic melanoma and established melanoma CNS
             metastases who are scheduled for craniotomy:

               -  Histologically confirmed, primary cutaneous melanoma, metastatic to the CNS
                  (brain OR spinal cord OR carcinomatous meningitis) based on:

               -  Pathologic confirmation (i.e. prior craniotomy) OR

               -  Radiography (brain MRI or CT scan with intravenous contrast)

               -  Patients must have no contraindications for lumbar puncture for CSF collection

               -  Hemoglobin level of 8g/dL or higher within the prior 30 days

               -  FFPE tissue block containing a biopsy from the primary site available for
                  retrieval.

          -  Regarding patients with distant metastatic melanoma and established melanoma CNS
             metastases who are not having a craniotomy and before they undergo external beam
             irradiation or stereotactic radiosurgery (patient's and/or neurosurgeon's preference):

               -  Histologically confirmed melanoma (unknown primary, mucosal, ocular are allowed),
                  metastatic to the CNS (brain OR spinal cord OR carcinomatous meningitis) based on

               -  Pathologic confirmation (i.e. prior craniotomy) and/or

               -  Radiography (brain MRI or CT scan with intravenous contrast)

               -  Patients without contraindications to undergo lumbar puncture for the component
                  that relates to CSF collection as determined by the neurosurgeon. An external
                  ventricular drain (EVD) may be utilized if clinically indicated and the source of
                  CSF (LP or EVD) clearly recorded (this is not required for enrollment in the
                  overall protocol if there are any contra-indications to performance of this
                  procedure)

               -  Hemoglobin level of 8g/dL or higher within the prior 30 days

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For study subjects, patients with extradural lesions, i.e. those that originate from
             the bone (calvarium or vertebrae), will not be considered.

          -  Any significant psychiatric disease, medical intervention, or other conditions, which
             in the opinion of the Investigators, could impair proper discussion of the informed
             consent or compromise participation to the clinical trial.

          -  Active systemic treatment for metastatic melanoma within 2 days from the collection of
             specimens (brain tumor tissue, peripheral blood, CSF). Corticosteroids, other
             immunosuppressive anti-inflammatory and anti-epileptic medications are allowed.

          -  Patients who have undergone whole brain irradiation therapy within the last 30 days.
             Therefore neither CNS lesions nor CSF are considered suitable for collection.

          -  Patients with growing CNS lesions at an area that has previously undergone
             radiosurgery within 3 months prior to enrollment in this study. Therefore CNS tumors
             from previously irradiated areas using radiosurgery are not considered suitable for
             collection although CSF is allowed for collection.

          -  Brain abscess.

          -  Other conditions that at the opinion of the investigator are contraindicated.
