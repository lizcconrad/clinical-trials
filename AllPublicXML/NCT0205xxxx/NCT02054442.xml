    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a randomized phase II study to investigate if the addition of
      cetuximab to MTX is beneficial for the patient. Because no data on this combination are
      available the investigators will start with a phase Ib study to investigate the feasibility
      of the schedule.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The addition of cetuximab to cisplatin and 5-FU in recurrent or metastatic squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) showed an improvement of overall survival (OS),
      progression free survival (PFS) and response rate (RR). However, cisplatin and 5-FU are toxic
      cytostatics for the vulnerable recurrent or metastatic SCCHN patient. As one of the primary
      goals in these patients is palliation, in some patients treatment with cisplatin, 5-FU and
      cetuximab is not feasible owing to a low performance score (PS of 2) or the patient refusal
      to receive chemotherapy, i.e. cisplatin and 5-FU, possibly influencing quality of life
      negatively.

      Methotrexate is a cytostatic which has shown to have modest activity in recurrent or
      metastatic SCCHN. The RR is between 14 and 20%, the median PFS is 3 months, and there is no
      improvement in OS, which is only 6 months. Toxicity of MTX is very low. Patients with a PS of
      2 can be treated with MTX. Patients refusing treatment with cisplatin, 5-FU and cetuximab,
      frequently choose MTX as palliative treatment.

      No data are available on the combination of cetuximab and MTX. The investigators will perform
      a randomized phase II study to investigate if the addition of cetuximab to MTX is beneficial,
      i.e. an improvement in the PFS, for the patient. Because no data on this combination are
      available the investigators will start with a phase Ib study to investigate the feasibility
      of the schedule.

    <description>The difference in RR rates between both treatment arms will be analyzed using a stratified Cochran Mantel Haenszel test at a one-sided alpha-level of 0.05.

The impact of various demographic and disease characteristics (e.g. HPV positivity), on RR will be investigated using an exploratory logistic regression model.</description>
