    <textblock>
      Brugada syndrome is characterized by a ST shift on the surface ECG, and a specific morphology
      of the Twave. This ECG abnormality is called a type 1-ECG, and is variable in time. Patients
      presenting a Brugada syndrome are exposed to sudden cardiac death, although it's difficult to
      predict patients at high risk. It is suspected that the type 1-ECG burden might be correlated
      to the ventricular fibrillation risk of these patients, but there is no mean to record the
      ECG over a long period of time.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the correlation between ST elevation on the
      electrocardiogram (ECG) and ST shift on the intracardiac electrograms (EGM) recorded with the
      AnalyST ICD, to assess the ability of the device to detect the type 1-ECG. Patients enrolled
      in the study are patients already implanted with a defibrillator for their Brugada syndrome.
      During an Ajmalin test, which unmasks the type 1-ECG, both intracardiac EGM and surface ECG
      will be compared to assess the detection of the typical ST-shift by the ICD.

      To evaluate the correlation between ST elevation on the ECG and ST shift on the intracardiac
      EGM recorded with the AnalyST ICD, patients enrolled will have to be already diagnosed as
      presenting the Brugada Syndrome. They will undergo an ajmaline test, to unmask the type
      1-ECG, characteristic from the Brugada syndrome.During the test, both surface ECG and
      intracardiac signal will be continuously recorded; then the signals will be compared in terms
      of amplitude of the ST shift, duration of the shift, and recovery period.

    <description>Correlation between external ECG - ST elevation and device-recorded ST shift. The ajmaline is the reference method to unmask type 1-ECG in Brugada syndrome. During an ajmaline test, both surface ECG and intracardial EGM will be continuously recorded and compared to allow comparison of the signals in terms of amplitude and duration of the ST shift and recovery timing.</description>
