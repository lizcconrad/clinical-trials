  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) has many health consequences. A reduction in the ability to perform
      exercise in patients with CF is related to greater death rates, steeper decline in lung
      function, and more frequent lung infections. However, the physiological mechanisms for this
      reduced exercise capacity are unknown. The investigators laboratory recently published the
      first evidence of systemic vascular dysfunction in patients with CF. Therefore, it is
      reasonable to suspect that the blood vessels are involved with exercise intolerance in CF.
      This study will look at how 1) blood flow and 2) artery function contribute to exercise
      capacity in CF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most disturbing aspect of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the associated premature death. Low
      exercise capacity predicts death in patients with CF and is also associated with a steeper
      decline in lung function and more lung infections. A critical barrier to improving exercise
      tolerance in patients with CF is the investigators lack of knowledge regarding the different
      physiological mechanisms which contribute to their lower exercise capacity. We have
      compelling data to indicate that the blood vessels may contribute to the low exercise
      capacity in CF. The impact of this proof of concept investigation will test Phosphodiesterase
      Type 5 inhibitors (PDE5) inhibitors as a potential therapy in CF and will explore blood flow
      and endothelial function as potential mechanisms which contribute to exercise intolerance in
      CF. Improvements in exercise capacity will not only contribute to a better quality of live
      for patients with CF, it will also increase longevity in these patients.
