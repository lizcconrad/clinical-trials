    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare on day 0 the maximum Lyapunov exponent (lmax,
      an indicator of local dynamic stability) of chronic low back pain patients versus that of
      healthy volunteers matched for age (± 5 years), sex and body mass index (BMI ± 15% of low
      back pain patients).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      To compare lmax in the different experimental conditions within each group (chronic lower
      back pain patients, healthy volunteers).

      To compare changes in lmax for low back pain patients at D7 and 6 weeks.

    <description>The movement required is a flexion - extension where the subject touches a target (adapted to his/her morphology) with both index fingers: the target is positioned in front of the subject, inline with his/her outstretched arms and at knee height. This movement simulates a lifting task without weight. The movement is repeated 30 times with a return to the initial position at a frequency of 0.32Hz.</description>

        Patients will be recruited during consultations in the department of Physical Medicine and
        Rehabilitation at the Nîmes University Hospital for lower back (lumbar) pain. The study
        population will include patients with chronic low back pain (lasting for more than 6 months
        and not postoperative).

        Healthy volunteers will be recruited at the Faculty of Medicine and the University Hospital
        of Nîmes.
