  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to analyze and compare the clinical effects of using inhaled budesonide or
      intravenous dexamethasone in the treatment of postextubation stridor on children admitted to
      the pediatric intensive care units at Hospital Municipal do M´Boi Mirim and Hospital Albert
      Einstein.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to perform a prospective, randomized, controlled and double-blind
      non inferiority study enrolling 70 children with postextubation stridor. The population will
      be divided in two groups: group 1 will receive inhaled budesonide and IV NS (intravenous
      normal saline) and group 2 will receive IV (intravenous) dexamethasone and inhaled normal
      saline. The study aims to analyze and compare (I would just say compare) the clinical effects
      of using inhaled budesonide or IV dexamethasone in the treatment of postextubation stridor on
      children admitted to the pediatric intensive care units at Hospital Municipal do M´Boi Mirim
      and Hospital Albert Einstein.

    <measure>The decrease of stridor and respiratory discomfort</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the Downes-Raphaelly score as an objective measurement tool of degree of respiratory discomfort. The decrease of Downes-Raphaelly score will be considered as an improvement of patient condition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of patients with adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will consider hypertension, hyperglycemia, gastrointestinal hemorrhage as adverse events of the usage of dexamethasone.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The time frame of stridor's and respiratory discomfort's improvements</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will study if budesonide has the same time frame improvement treating stridor and respiratory discomfort.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The number of patients that will have extubation failure at each arm</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Extubation failure will be considered as a need for re-intubation during de 48 hours after extubation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The number of inhaled epinephrine doses used in each arms.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>The inhaled epinephrine will be used as rescue therapy to absence of improvement. The number of inhaled epinephrine dosage used on each patient will be a measure of efficacy of budesonide or dexamethasone.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The number of patients who need for non invasive mechanical ventilation or Heliox</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>The non invasive mechanical ventilation and Heliox are rescue therapies. The number of patients treated with those rescue therapies will be a measure of efficacy of budesonide or dexamethasone.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The numbers of bronchoscopies</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>The bronchoscopy will demonstrate the non-inflammatory causes of stridor, such as: vocal cord paralysis, granuloma formation, subglottic stenosis, cricoarytenoid joint disfunction. In these cases, neither dexamethasone nor budesonide will improve clinical conditions.</description>

    <description>The subjects will receive a 5 ml normal saline inhalation right after extubation and will be re-evaluated in 5 to 10 minutes. The ones who develop upper airway obstruction and stridor with a Downes-Raphaelly score of 2 or higher will receive 0.5 ml/kg of inhaled epinephrine 1:1000 diluted to a final volume of 5 ml with a maximum dose of 2.5 ml in children up to 4 years and 5 ml in children with 5 years and above, as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The subjects who do not show an improvement after the epinephrine treatment will then be randomized to receive 2 mg of inhaled budesonide and 3 ml of IV normal saline. If there is an improvement the following maintenance therapy will be instituted for 48 hs and the subjects will receive 2 mg of budesonide q12hs and 3 ml of IV NS q6hs.</description>
