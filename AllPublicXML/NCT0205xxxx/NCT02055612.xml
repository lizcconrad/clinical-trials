      The aim of the study is to find out prevalence of aged-related macular degeneration (AMD) in
      Slovak Republic. The outcome of the project will be epidemiology survey, prevalence of wet
      form of AMD in relation to demographic data, patient´s anamnesis, nutrition, co-morbidities
      etc.

  <detailed_description>

      It´s cross-sectional epidemiological survey, multi-centric, non-interventional

        1. Patients will fill a questionnaire with demography data, anamnesis, risk factors.

        2. Patients will be assessed by using Amsler grid.

        3. Patient´s back of the eye will be examined with fundus camera (searching for long-term
           back of the eye changes, retina vessels, macula and surrounding tissues) by retina
           specialist.

        4. Patient undergoes optical coherent tomography (OCT) examination (cross-section of fovea
           and macula) by retina specialist.

      The project actively screen patients with wAMD. All patients will sign an informed consent.

      The process of screening will be held in certain timeframe (cca. 2 months) and selected areas
      of Slovak Republic.
