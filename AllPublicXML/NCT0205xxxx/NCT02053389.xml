  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an educational intervention study testing the effects of decision aids in promoting
      patient participation in early stage prostate cancer treatment decision making. The purpose
      of this study is to compare patient-physician communication between patients who receive a
      DVD that models patient communication strategies vs. those who do not receive a DVD. All
      patients will also receive a written decision aid that describes treatment options for early
      stage prostate cancer. The Investigators hypothesize that the DVD will:

        -  increase patients' perceptions of the importance of their preferences to their decision
           making

        -  increase patients' perceptions of their intention to discuss their values and
           preferences with their urologists and radiation oncologists

        -  increase patients' actual engagement with their physician during the clinical encounter

        -  increase the concordance between patient decision making preferences and actual decision
           making outcomes

        -  increase long term satisfaction with decision on type of treatment selected

        -  increase patient satisfaction with their decision and the decision making process

        -  influence patient perception of his physician (e.g., trust) and of the diagnosis visit
