  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to assess the impact of a web-based health care cost and quality tool that
      is being implemented by a health plan for its members. The study will focus on members
      working for medium to large employers that have more than 90% of employees enrolled in
      deductible and tiered network health plans. The study will use an interrupted time series
      (ITS) design that includes random allocation of half of these employers to a study arm that
      will receive enhanced promotion of the tool and a $500 lottery incentive for its use in order
      to increase take-up. With these two study groups (a &quot;high-dose&quot; group receiving enhanced
      promotion and a lottery, and a &quot;low-dose&quot; group receiving routine promotion of the tool), the
      study will be able to evaluate whether access to a price transparency tool leads to reduced
      costs and more value-driven member behavior, and whether extra promotion increases take-up.

      Members in the high-dose group who use the tool will be eligible to enter a monthly lottery
      to win a $500 prize during the 12-month intervention period. In addition to the lottery,
      employers in the high-dose group will receive additional promotional strategies such as a
      mailing and messages through the plan's member web portal to promote the tool and the
      lottery, and e-mails and flyers for employers to promote the tool and lottery to employees.

      The aims of this project are to: 1) examine take-up of the tool and factors that predict
      take-up; and 2) to examine the impact of the tool on total and out-of-pocket health care
      costs and utilization
