      This randomized phase III trial studies imiquimod or fluorouracil to see how well they work
      compared to observation in treating patients with high-grade anal squamous skin lesions who
      are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive. Biological therapies, such as imiquimod, may
      stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known
      whether imiquimod or fluorouracil is more effective than observation in treating high-grade
      anal squamous skin lesions.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of intra-anal imiquimod 2.5% for treatment of anal high-grade
      squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) compared to observation only.

      II. To assess the efficacy of intra-anal topical 5-fluorouracil (fluorouracil) 5% for
      treatment of anal HSIL compared to observation only.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of intra-anal imiquimod 2.5% and topical
      5-fluorouracil 5%.

      II. To compare the efficacy of intra-anal imiquimod 2.5% and topical 5-fluorouracil 5%.

      III. To assess for partial response of intra-anal imiquimod 2.5% or topical 5-fluorouracil 5%
      as compared to observation only.

      IV. To evaluate the effect of intra-anal imiquimod 2.5% and topical 5-fluorouracil 5% on
      human papilloma virus (HPV) persistence.

      V. To evaluate anal HSIL outcomes at week 44. VI. To evaluate the effect of behavioral
      patterns including tobacco smoking and sexual activity on treatment efficacy, tolerability
      and HPV.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients apply imiquimod intra-anally once daily (QD) for 16 weeks.

      ARM B: Patients apply fluorouracil intra-anally twice daily (BID) on days 1-5. Treatment
      repeats every 2 weeks for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM C: Patients receive no treatment. Patients who still have HSIL at week 20 and who agree
      to randomization may cross-over to Arm A or B.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 20, 24, 26, 32, 40,
      and 44.

          -  Female participants who are pregnant or breastfeeding; women of childbearing potential
             must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to initiating
             study treatment; all women of childbearing potential must be willing to comply with an
             acceptable birth control regimen to prevent pregnancy while receiving treatment and
             for 3 months after treatment is discontinued as determined by the Investigator;
