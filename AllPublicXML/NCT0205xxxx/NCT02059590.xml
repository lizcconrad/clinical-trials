  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 14C-labeled cleavage product
      (BAL8728), in particular the routes of excretion and extent ot metabolism of the cleavage
      product following administration of a single intravenous dose of pyridinylmethyl-14C-labeled
      prodrug isavuconazonium sulfate (BAL8557). In addition, identify the metabolic profile of
      BAL8728 in human plasma, urine and/or feces after a single intravenous dose of
      pyridinylmethyl-14C-labeled BAL8557 and evaluate the pharmacokinetics of BAL8728 and BAL4815.
      Safety and tolerability after a single intravenous dose of pyridinylmethyl-14C-labeled
      isavuconazonium sulfate will also be evaluated.
