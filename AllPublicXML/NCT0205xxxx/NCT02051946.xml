      The purpose of this study is to identify whether or not injection of a study drug (ethacrynic
      acid) using the investigational Retroject device is able to lower eye pressures in patients
      with advanced glaucoma. 20 patients with advanced glaucoma with visual acuity less than
      20/200 and intraocular pressures (IOP) &gt;20mmHg on maximum medical therapy will be asked to
      participate in the study. The first five patients will have the Retroject device placed over
      their eye for 30 seconds and then removed. Assuming no issues, then it will be placed on the
      eye for one minute. The second group of patients (3 total) will have the Retroject device
      placed on the eye and then an injection of ethacrynic acid into the episcleral vein. The
      third group of patients (12 total) will have the Retroject device placed on the eye and then
      will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either an ethacrynic acid injection or a
      balanced salt solution injection. All 20 patients will then return for intraocular pressure
      measurements on days 1, 2, 3, and 7 as well as 6 weeks after injection. In addition, the
      patients will undergo pre and post intervention corneal endothelial assessments (endothelial
      cell count, shape analysis, and pachymetry). Potential safety issues are unlikely and include
      bleeding, infection, pain, ototoxicity, or temporary or permanent loss of vision.
