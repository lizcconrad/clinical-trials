    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      two dosing regimens of multiple, subcutaneous (sc) injections of ASP2408 in patients with
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) on Methotrexate (MTX) and to evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of
      ASP2408.

      This is an ascending dose frequency study. There are two cohorts of active and placebo
      patients. The first cohort is dosed every 4 weeks for a total of 3 doses. The second cohort
      is dosed every two weeks for a total of 3 doses.
