    <textblock>
      Delirium is common in older emergency department (ED) patients and often remains
      unrecognized. Existing instruments to detect delirium are often time consuming and therefore
      not feasible in the busy ED setting In this study the investigators tested the feasibility of
      the newly developed modified confusion assessment method (mCAM-ED).

    <description>Delirium was assessed by research assistants using the mCAM-ED. Patients with a positive delirium diagnosis were presented to a senior emergency physician (PI) who served as the reference standard. The final delirium diagnosis was based on the DSM IV criteria</description>
