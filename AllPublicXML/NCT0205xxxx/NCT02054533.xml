    <textblock>
      Understanding of how best to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has evolved over the last
      ten years. Evidence now suggests that the most effective therapy early in the course of
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) involves the use of immune suppressing
      medications such as the anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (anti-TNF) agents infliximab, adalimumab,
      and certolizumab. However, many CD and UC patients still ultimately require surgery despite
      the use of these medications. Side effects of the anti-TNF agents include increased risk of
      infections due to their effect on the immune system. Little is known about how use of these
      medications near the time of surgery may affect patients' risks of infection or other
      post-operative complications. The only available studies on this topic have given conflicting
      results. These studies have been limited by the fact that they have been small in size and
      retrospective. Retrospective studies primarily involve chart review as the method of
      identifying potential risk factors for infections and other complications after they have
      already occurred. This method limits both the type and quality of information/data that can
      be collected. The conflicting results have led to variance in practice patterns with regards
      to management of anti-TNF agents, the timing of surgery, and even the types of surgery.

      By enrolling patients at the time of their surgery, collecting extensive information may be
      possible than previously studied on potential risk factors for both infectious and
      non-infectious complications following surgery. Risk factors to be studied will include
      individual patient characteristics, disease characteristics, surgical methods, novel
      characteristics of CT scans and MRIs and extensive medication exposures. The primary
      objective is to determine if exposure to anti-TNF agents prior to surgery increases the risk
      of infection post-operatively. And evaluate exposure to anti-TNF agents by both patient
      history of use and measurement of anti-TNF drug levels at the time of surgery. Monitoring of
      drug levels at the time of surgery has never been utilized in this way to evaluate the risk
      of anti-TNF agents in IBD. However, this has been done to assess the risk of other
      medications in different diseases.

      If anti-TNF agents are found to pose a risk for infectious or non-infectious outcomes in IBD
      patients undergoing surgery, change maybe needed in the way these medications are used around
      the time of surgery. Additionally, by collecting comprehensive information on other potential
      risk factors besides medication use patients at greatest risk for bad outcomes can be
      identified and take protective measures when possible. The aims of this study address the
      CCFA challenge to better define the risks of medical and surgical therapies to improve the
      quality of care of IBD patients undergoing surgery.

      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational study designed to determine if
      pre-operative exposure to anti-TNF agents is an independent risk factor for post-operative
      infectious complications within 30 days of surgery in subjects with IBD.

      Patient Assessments:

      Patient assessments will occur at the Screening/Baseline Visit, Discharge Day, and 30-Day
      Telephone Follow-up (see Figure 1). Potential pre-operative predictors of post-operative
      infections will be assessed at the Screening/Baseline Visit through a brief patient interview
      and abstraction of medical records. Data will be entered into the electronic case report
      forms (eCRF). A second data abstraction will occur on the Discharge Day. At this time, all
      data from the day of surgery will be available including finalized operative reports,
      anesthesia records, and pathology. The post-operative medical record will also be reviewed
      for potential confounding factors related to post-operative infection (i.e. presence of
      central lines, foley catheters, antibiotic use, etc.). Additionally, the medical record will
      be reviewed for the occurrence of post-operative infection and the other non-infectious
      outcomes being studied. Data will be entered into the eCRF. The final assessment will occur
      on post-operative day 30 (within 1 week). A telephone interview will be conducted. The
      purpose of the interview is to assess for the occurrence of post-operative infection and
      non-infectious outcomes. If an infection has been identified, relevant medical records will
      be requested to confirm infection and abstract information pertaining to the infection. Data
      will be entered into the eCRF.

      Assessment of Anti-TNF Exposure:

      Exposure to anti-TNF agents will be defined in two different ways. The primary analysis will
      define anti-TNF exposure as patient report of use within 12 weeks of surgery pre-operatively.
      Confirmation of patient report will be through medical record abstraction. This definition of
      anti-TNF exposure is consistent with many of the retrospective, single center studies on
      post-operative infections related to IBD surgery. The 12-week cutoff point has been chosen to
      account for the washout of infliximab before surgery based on its half-life. However, the
      different anti-TNF agents have varying half-lives. Date of last administration prior to
      surgery will be recorded so that different cutoff points to define exposure such as 4 weeks
      and 8 weeks may be explored.

      The secondary analysis will define anti-TNF exposure by measured peri-operative levels in
      patients with a history of anti-TNF use in the six months preceding surgery. Anti-TNF levels
      and anti-drug antibodies will be checked at two time points in patients with recent anti-TNF
      use. An initial level will be drawn at the screening visit, which may occur peri-operatively
      up to post-op day 4. A second level will be drawn anytime between post-op day 4 and post-op
      day 7. The serum from these blood draws will be stored at -80 Celsius until the third year of
      the study at which time samples will be tested for drug levels and antibodies.
