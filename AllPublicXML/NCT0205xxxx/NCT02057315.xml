    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/ Phase 2, 12-week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, cross-over,
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ELS-M11 compared to placebo
      in 50 male and female subjects, aged 18 to 65 years that suffer recurring moderate-severe
      migraine headaches (2-8 per month).

      This study is designed to describe the efficacy and safety of ELS-M11 as compared to placebo.

    <textblock>
      Achelios is developing ELS-M11 for topical application for the acute treatment of migraine
      events in patients with a history of migraine with or without aura.

      To be eligible for the study, patients must have a one-year documented history of migraine
      headache (as defined by the International Headache Society IHS), with or without aura, with
      2≤8 moderate or severe migraine attacks per month in the 2 months prior to the screening
      visit.

      The total duration of the study is the completion of five migraine headaches per subject over
      a maximum 12 week period followed by a 3-14 day Follow-Up Period.
