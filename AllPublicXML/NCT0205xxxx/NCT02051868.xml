    <textblock>
      Anal cancer is a relatively uncommon disease and there is currently no standard chemotherapy
      treatment for patients with inoperable locally recurrent or metastatic disease. The aim of
      this phase II study is compare two well known and largely used chemotherapy regimens -
      Cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil vs Carboplatin plus Paclitaxel. The result of this study will
      set a standard of care for this disease and provide useful information for future Phase III
      trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study design: This is an international, multicentre, open label, randomised phase II trial.
      Patients will be randomised to receive either cisplatin plus 5-FU or carboplatin plus weekly
      paclitaxel. Region (Europe, North America, South America &amp; Australia), (Eastern Cooperative
      Oncology Group- ECOG) ECOG performance status (PS) (0-1 vs. 2), HIV status (positive vs.
      negative) and extent of disease (locally recurrent vs. metastatic) will be used as
      stratification factors. Overall response rate is the primary endpoint.

      Indication: First line treatment of patients with inoperable locally recurrent or metastatic
      squamous cell carcinoma of the anus.

      Length of study: Recruitment should be completed within 3 years. The estimated recruitment
      rate is between 4-6 patients per month once it is established at multiple centres.

      Primary Objective: To evaluate best overall response rate by 24 weeks post treatment in the
      cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil arm versus the carboplatin plus weekly paclitaxel arm

      Secondary Objectives: To evaluate: - Progression-free survival - Overall survival - Disease
      control rate (stable disease or better) at 12 and 24 weeks - Best overall response of
      metastatic lesions - Toxicity (graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE Version 4) - Quality of Life (using EORTC
      QLQ-C30 version 3 and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires).

      To assess: The feasibility of conducting a multicentre international study on squamous cell
      carcinoma of the anus and recruit within a reasonable time frame.

      Exploratory Objective: Explorative biomarker analysis including the collection of archived
      tumour tissue and blood sample at baseline and upon progression.

    <measure>Feasibility of conducting a multicentre, international study on squamous cell carcinoma of the anus and recruiting within a reasonable time frame.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The study will be conducted in approximately 50 international centres. This secondary endpoint will be measured by (i) the proportion of centres that successfully recruit at least one patient and (ii) overall recruitment rate. We anticipate and would be able to confirm feasibility if 80% of the centres fully engaged with the study. The aim would be to recruit 80 patients in 36 months (10 by month 6, 20 by month 12, 50 by month 24 and 80 by month 36).</description>

    <measure>Identification of potential tumour biomarker</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Archived tumour tissue (if available) and blood sample will be taken at baseline with a repeat blood sample taken upon progression. Patient can enrol in an optional biomarker study where an additional tumour biopsy would be requested when they progress. The aim of this exploratory analysis is to evaluate the expression of tumour biomarkers in the study population and investigate the association of these with treatment outcome.</description>
