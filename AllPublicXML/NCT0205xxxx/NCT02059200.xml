  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since a few years, Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has been used as treatment for
      patients suffering from recurrent depression. Though a number of studies show that MBCT is
      effective in this population and MBCT reduces the chances of relapse/recurrence in recurrent
      depressive patients, the chance of a new depression developing after end of treatment is
      still considerable. Ergo, there is room for improvement.

      Especially the development of a non-judging or compassionate attitude towards all experience
      seems to mediate the treatment effect. It is therefore our expectation that a follow-up
      intervention that focuses specifically on self-compassion could prove very useful in
      elaborating on the effects of MBCT.

      The research question of this research is therefore: what is the effect of compassion
      training in people suffering from recurrent depression who have already received MBCT
      training?
