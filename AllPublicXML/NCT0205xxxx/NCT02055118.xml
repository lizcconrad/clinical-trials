      Study HGT-HIT-094 is a multicenter study designed to determine the effect on clinical
      parameters of neurodevelopmental status of monthly IT administration of idursulfase-IT 10 mg
      for 12 months in pediatric patients with Hunter syndrome and cognitive impairment who have
      previously received and tolerated a minimum of 4 months of therapy with Elaprase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elaprase, a large molecular protein, is not expected to cross the blood brain barrier when
      administered intravenously. A revised formulation of idursulfase, idursulfase-IT, that
      differs from that of the intravenous (IV) formulation, Elaprase, has been developed to be
      suitable for delivery into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via intrathecal administration.

      Mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II) is a rare, X-linked, inherited disease that affects males
      nearly exclusively. The disease is caused by the absence of, or deficiency in, the activity
      of the lysosomal enzyme, iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S) which acts to cleave O-linked sulfate
      moieties from the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) molecules dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate.

      Study HGT-HIT-094 is a controlled, randomized, two-arm, open-label, assessor-blinded,
      multicenter study to determine the effect on clinical parameters of neurodevelopmental status
      of monthly IT administration of idursulfase-IT 10 mg for 12 months in pediatric patients with
      Hunter syndrome and cognitive impairment who have previously received and tolerated a minimum
      of 4 months of therapy with Elaprase.

      Pediatric patients under 3 years of age will be enrolled into a separate substudy to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of idursulfase-IT. The separate substudy is open label and single
      arm. Patients who are enrolled in the substudy will receive idursulfase-IT treatment and
      follow the same schedule of study visits.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible to be randomized into the
        pivotal study or enrolled in the separate substudy:

          1. The patient has clinically significant non-Hunter syndrome-related CNS involvement
             (such as Fragile-X syndrome) which is judged by the Investigator to be likely to
             interfere with the accurate administration and interpretation of protocol assessments.

          2. The patient has a large chromosomal deletion or complex rearrangement that includes a
             deletion of the FMR1 and/or FMR2 genes.

          3. The patient has a significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity(ies) that might
             affect study data or confound the integrity of study results.

          4. The patient has contra-indications for performance of lumbar puncture such as
             musculoskeletal/spinal abnormalities or risk of abnormal bleeding.

          5. The patient has a history of complications from previous lumbar punctures or technical
             challenges in conducting lumbar punctures such that the potential risks would exceed
             possible benefits for the patient.

          6. The patient has an opening CSF pressure upon lumbar puncture that exceeds 30.0 cm H2O.

          7. The patient has experienced infusion-related anaphylactoid event(s) or has evidence of
             consistent severe adverse events related to treatment with Elaprase which, in the
             Investigator's opinion, may pose an unnecessary risk to the patient.

          8. The patient has received a cord blood or bone marrow transplant at any time or has
             received blood product transfusions within 90 days prior to Screening.

          9. The patient has a history of poorly controlled seizure disorder.

         10. The patient is unable to comply with the protocol (eg, has significant hearing or
             vision impairment, a clinically relevant medical condition making implementation of
             the protocol difficult, unstable social situation, known clinically significant
             psychiatric/behavioral instability, is unable to return for safety evaluations, or is
             otherwise unlikely to complete the study), as determined by the Investigator.

         11. The patient is enrolled in another clinical study that involves clinical investigation
             or use of any investigational product (drug or [intrathecal/spinal] device) within 30
             days prior to study enrollment or at any time during the study.

         12. The patient has any known or suspected hypersensitivity to anesthesia or is thought to
             be at an unacceptably high risk for anesthesia due to compromised airways or other
             conditions.

         13. The patient has a condition that is contraindicated as described in the SOPH-A-PORT
             Mini S IDDD Instructions for Use (IFU), including but not limited to the presence of a
             CSF shunt device in the patient.
