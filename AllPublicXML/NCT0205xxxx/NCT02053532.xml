  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have abnormalities in the function of the
      amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (particularly anterior cingulate), in addition to
      abnormalities of hippocampal volume. In this pilot study we propose to use the combined
      positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) scanner and F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose
      (FDG, an analog of glucose, the most commonly used PET ligand) to examine brain function and
      directly correlate the data with the intrinsic functional connectivity of brain circuits that
      are responsible for social, emotional and cognitive processing in both individuals with PTSD
      and group-matched trauma controls (TC) and healthy controls (HC). Once the machine is
      validated, we will then use a more specific biomarker to better understand the neurochemical
      factors that contribute to individual differences in PTSD. Thus, the data obtained from this
      pilot study will guide our future molecular imaging studies. The link between general brain
      function, specific molecular target and the intrinsic functional connectivity of brain
      circuits that are responsible for social, emotional and cognitive processing in PTSD, TC and
      HC will be explored.
