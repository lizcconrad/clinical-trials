  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe Hypertension in pregnancy demands urgent treatment because of high mortality &amp;
      morbidity in obstetric patients. Hydralazine, the most commonly used agent, causes sudden
      hypotension and tachycardia. Labetalol because of combined α and β blocking effects lacks
      these side effects. Cochrane systematic review could include only three trials of comparison
      of hydralazine with labetalol. All three had sample size ranging from 20-60 obstetric,
      including 19-30 pregnant women. This review could not conclude about comparative effects due
      to insufficient data and suggested that further trials should compare hydralazine with
      nifedipine or labetalol, and to report severe persistent hypertension and adverse
      feto-maternal effects.

      OBJECTIVES:1) To compare efficacy of labetalol versus hydralazine for control of pregnancy
      related severe hypertension.2) To compare adverse maternal and fetal effects of the two
      drugs.

      3) Furthermore, to develop risk assessment model for response to treatment, in terms of
      patient and disease characteristics.

      STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.

      SETTING &amp; DURATION OF STUDY: Gynaecology Unit I, Civil hospital Karachi over a period of 1
      year.

      METHODS: Total one hundred eighty patients with, severe hypertension(systolic blood
      pressure(SBP)≥160 and/or diastolic blood pressure(DBP) ≥110 mm Hg) at greater than 28 weeks
      of pregnancy or upto72 hours after delivery, will be enrolled. In each group 90 patients will
      be allocated to intravenous labetalol or hydralazine using simple random sampling. Primary
      outcome measures will be lowering of SBP to &lt;160 mm Hg and DBP &lt;110 mm Hg and severe
      persistent hypertension. In addition maternal hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia, adverse
      effect on fetal heart, still birth and neonatal bradycardia will be measured.

      EXPECTED OUTCOME: Efficacy and side effects of labetalol against hydralazine, in our
      population will be determined. Assessment model for response to treatment, will help in
      choosing a drug with better efficacy and minimal side effect profile for different patient
      and disease profiles.

      Study Hypothesis:This is a non inferiority trial and study hypothesis is that labetalol is
      equal or better than hydralazine.

      Patients diagnosed to have severe hypertension(on repeat measurement of BP after 15 minutes
      of rest), admitted in 24 hour period of emergency, meeting inclusion criteria, will be
      included. One hundred eighty patients will be enrolled after informed consent and randomly
      allocated to each treatment arm by 1:1 randomization through simple random allocation.

      All eligible pregnant or post partum women with systolic blood pressure ≥160mm of Hg or
      diastolic BP ≥110 mm Hg, on repeat measurement after 15 minutes of rest, admitted through
      emergency and outpatients department, will be invited for participation in the study. They
      will be enrolled after informed consent. Drug treatment will be assigned using simple random
      sampling.

      INCLUSIONS CRITERIA Pregnant or post partum patients with systolic blood pressure ≥160mm of
      Hg or diastolic BP ≥110 mm Hg, on repeat measurement of blood pressure after 15 minutes of
      rest, meeting following inclusion criteria will be included.

        1. Pregnancy =&gt;28 wks with gestational hypertension, severe preeclampsia, chronic
           hypertension, chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia, eclampsia and
           unclassified hypertension.

        2. Postpartum patients, upto 72 hours after delivery, diagnosed as gestational
           hypertension, severe preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, chronic hypertension with
           superimposed preeclampsia, eclampsia and unclassified hypertension.

        3. Patients with singleton or multiple pregnancy.

        4. Patients of all ages and parity. EXCLUSION CRITERIA 1) Patients with asthma. 2) Patients
           with cardiac failure and heart block. 3) Patients with pacing device in place or any
           type of cardiac arrhythmia. DATA COLLECTION INSTRUMENT Data will be recorded on a case
           report form (CRF). Group A will receive intravenous(IV) labetalol bolus doses
           administered over 2 minutes, at 10 minutes interval. Initially dose of 20mg will be
           administered, and if required repeated in increments of 40 mg,80 mg,80mg,80mg every 10
           minutes till SBP becomes &lt;160 and DBP &lt;110 mm Hg, upto a maximum total dose of
           300mg(total 5 bolus doses).During this time pulse and blood pressure will be checked
           every 10 minutes. Failure to reduce SBP&lt;160 or DBP&lt;110 with consecutive maximum 5
           boluses (300mg) will be labelled severe persistent hypertension.In such case patient
           will be given alternate treatment with hydralazine 5 mg slow intravenous bolus, over 2
           minutes and blood pressure will be rechecked after 20 minutes. If SBP is still ≥160 or
           DBP ≥110 mm Hg then another bolus of 5 mg hydralazine will be repeated and consultation
           with medical/cardiovascular/critical care specialist will be sought. Blood pressure and
           pulse will be recorded at 10 minutes interval till blood pressure is reduced below
           threshold levels (SBP&lt;160 and diastolic &lt;110 mm of Hg).Once this level is achieved then
           monitoring will be continued every 15 minutes interval for two hours, every 30 minutes
           interval for 1 hour and thereafter at hourly interval for next 4 hours.

      Group B (control) will receive intravenous hydralazine bolus doses of 5 mg administered over
      2 minutes, at 20 minutes interval. Pulse and blood pressure will be checked every 10 minutes
      interval. If SBP threshold of 160 mm Hg or DBP 110 mm Hg is still reached after 20 minutes,
      then second bolus will be repeated. Similarly if after 20 minutes SBP is still ≥160 or DBP
      ≥110 mm Hg, then third dose will be given. If SBP or DBP thresholds are still exceeded after
      20 minutes then similarly 4th dose of 5 mg will be given. Failure to reduce SBP&lt;160 or
      DBP&lt;110 after consecutive maximum 4 boluses(total 20 mg) will be labeled as severe persistent
      hypertension.Once blood pressure is reduced below threshold level, pulse and blood pressure
      will be monitored similar to group A. Failure to reduce SBP&lt;160 or DBP&lt;110 after consecutive
      maximum 4 boluses(total 20 mg) will be labeled as severe persistent hypertension; which will
      be considered as treatment failure. In such case, patient will be given alternate treatment
      with labetalol 20 mg slow intravenous bolus over 2 minutes, and blood pressure will be
      rechecked after 10 minutes. If SBP is still ≥160 or DBP ≥110 mm Hg, then another bolus of 40
      mg labetalol will be repeated and emergency consultation with medical /cardiovascular
      /critical care specialist will be sought. Our use of alternate treatment for severe
      persistent hypertension in both groups is keeping in line with the most recent American
      College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologist's committee opinion 2011 recommendation.

      Cardiotocography (CTG) will be done in pregnant women on admission and it will be repeated 2
      hour after initiation of therapy.

      Primary outcome measures will be lowering of SBP&lt;160 mm Hg and DBP &lt;110 mm Hg in scheduled
      dosages of allocated treatment(primary end point of study) and severe persistent hypertension
      i.e treatment failure.

      Secondary outcome measures will be adverse drug effects i.e maternal hypotension,
      tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitation, headache, nausea vomiting, dizziness, bronchospasm,
      oliguria, adverse effect on fetal heart, and neonatal bradycardia.

      In both study arms, patient's monitoring and decisions for delivery of pregnant patients will
      be taken according to department protocol which is consistent with standard recommendations.

      2). Preeclampsia will be defined as BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg along with proteinuria ≥ 1+ on
      dipsticks in a previously normotensive, non-proteinuric woman, proven by antenatal record.

      3). Chronic Hypertension will be diagnosed by history of preexisting hypertension &amp; or by
      detecting persistent elevation of BP≥140/90 mm Hg. prior to 20 weeks of pregnancy.

      4). Severe preeclampsia will be defined as BP ≥160/110 alongwith proteinuria≥1+ on dipstick
      with or without one or more of the following features i.e headache, visual disturbance, upper
      right quadrant/epigastric pain, pulmonary oedema, elevated alanine aminotransfrease (ALT),
      raised creatinine, hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, intrauterine growth restriction(IUGR) in a
      previously normotensive non proteinuric woman, proven by antenatal record.

      5) Eclampsia will be diagnosed by generalized tonic clonic seizures in woman with
      hypertensive disorder not attributable to any other cause.

      6) Efficacy will be defined as lowering of systolic BP to &lt;160mm Hg and diastolic BP&lt;110 mm
      Hg.

      7) Severe persistent hypertension will defined by SBP≥160 or DBP≥ 110 mm of Hg after the
      administration of consecutive maximum (4 or 5)doses of allocated drug treatment.

      8) Maternal hypotension will be defined as systolic BP &lt;90mm Hg or diastolic BP&lt;60 mm Hg.

      9)Maternal tachycardia will be defined as heart rate &gt;100b/m in the absence of fever &amp;
      cardiovascular disease.

      10)Normal Cardiotocograph(CTG) Will be defined as having following 4 features i) Baseline
      heart rate 110-160beats/minute ii) Variability&gt;5-25 beats/minutes iii) aleast 2 accelerations
      of &gt;15 b/m lasting for≥15 seconds. iv) No decelerations.

      11)Adverse effect on fetal heart rate (FHR) will be defined as i)presence of any type of
      deceleration without uterine contraction ii)Reduced variability&lt;5 b/m for &gt;40 minutes, iii)
      Variable &amp; late decelerations, in the presence of uterine contractions iii) FHR&lt;110b/m or
      &gt;160b/m detected on CTG 2 hour after starting treatment, with a baseline normal CTG on
      admission.

      12)Placental abruption will be defined as clinical features of uterine tenderness with
      evidence of retroplacental clot at delivery.

      13) Oliguria will be defined as urinary output&lt;30 ml/hr for ≥4 hours. 14) Neonatal
      bradycardia will be defined as heart rate&lt;100b/m DATA ANALYSIS PLAN: Data will entered and
      analyzed through SPSS version 17. Continuous variables i.e age, parity, gestation, SBP, DBP,
      MAP at randomization will be presented as mean ± SD whereas mean reduction in MAP, number of
      boluses of antihypertensive, mean dose to achieve desired level of control will be analyzed
      by student's t test. Qualitative variables i.e control of BP, severe persistent hypertension,
      maternal hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia, headache, palpitation, nausea
      vomiting,dizziness ,oliguria, placental abruption, adverse effects on fetal heart rate, still
      birth, neonatal bradycardia, caesarean section, Apgar score &lt;7 at 1 and 5 minutes and
      neonatal intensive care admission will be analyzed by chi square, and if required, by
      Fischer's exact test. For analyzing adverse effect on FHR, patients with admission CTG
      showing fetal bradycardia &lt;110 b/m, tachycardia &gt;160b/m, variability &lt;5b/m for &gt;40 minutes,
      variable and late decelerations, will be excluded and stratification will be done for normal
      CTG and CTG with subtle abnormalities but with normal baseline FHR 110-160b/m on enrolement
      i.e i) Absence of accelerations ii) reduced variability &lt;5 beats/min for &lt; 40 minutes iii)
      early decelerations in the presence of uterine contractions. Adverse effect on FHR will be
      studied on all antenatal women and neonatal outcomes (Apgar, neonatal bradycardia) will be
      studied on patients delivering within 24 hours of enrolement.

      Furthermore assessment model based on logistic regression will be developed for response to
      either drug in terms of patient &amp; disease characteristics i.e ethnicity, age group, parity
      group, socioeconomic status(income groups), gestational age group, pregnancy status whether
      antepartum or post partum and disease characteristics i.e type of hypertension and blood
      pressure level on admission. Multinomial logistic regression will be applied and Odds ratio
      will be calculated for all these factors.
