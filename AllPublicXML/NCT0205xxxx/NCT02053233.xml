  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The robot assisted therapy is one of the new developed technologies for recovery after
      stroke. This study aimed to evaluating the effect of robotic gait therapy for motor recovery
      after stroke.

      This study designed an assessor-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical study. The
      participations followed the study protocol and were randomly divided into the control group
      and Walkbot group. The control group received conventional functional rehabilitation for 40
      min/session, 2 sessions/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks, 40 sessions in all. Whereas the Walkbot
      group received conventional physical therapy (session I for 40 min/day) companied with
      Walkbot training (session II for 30 min/day) 5 days a week for 4 weeks, 40 session in all.
      After 4-week intervention all subjects received conventional physical therapy only, 40
      min/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks. During the test period, general rehabilitation and drug
      treatment can be done at the same time.

    <description>Function ambulation category was used for evaluating gait function. The outcome variable were measured immediately before treatment start (pre-training), 4 weeks after treatment (post-training) and 4 weeks after robot-treatment (follow-up). All the evaluations were done by the same professional therapist who was blind to the two group assignment.</description>

    <description>Berg balance scale (BBS) were used for evaluating functional performance level after training. The outcome variables were measured immediately before treatment start (pre-training), 4 weeks after treatment (post-training) and 4 weeks after robot-treatment (follow-up). All the evaluations were done by the same professional therapist who was blind to the two group assignment.</description>

    <description>The physiotherapist typed patient's information then Walkbot would adjust itself to this data and the exoskeleton legs lengthen or shorten to the patient. The computer screen would provide information about speed, duration, cadence and distance. The monitor in front of the patient can offer image and feedback during the therapy process for patients.
The whole Walkbot training process was observed by one physiotherapist and should be always ready to adjust the unloading, duration, speed and guidance force of Walkbot according to patients' different situation such as muscle spasticity, gait quality, labor-consuming and observe the changes of patients' state.</description>
