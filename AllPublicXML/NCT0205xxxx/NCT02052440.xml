  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult medical/surgical inpatient hospital care is more difficult and more expensive when
      complicated by alcohol dependency (AD), especially for patients who develop alcohol
      withdrawal syndrome (AWS). AWS can be mild, moderate or severe. The Severity of Ethanol
      Withdrawal Scale (SEWS) is tool used to assess severity and is the current standard of care
      for both monitoring and treating AWS at Denver Health. Moderate/severe AWS (i.e., SEWS ≥ 7)
      has important clinical implications and requires pharmacological treatment. At present, there
      are no safe and effective options for preventing AWS in at-risk inpatients. Baclofen is a
      GABA-B receptor agonist that has been used in the alleviation of spasticity in patients with
      multiple sclerosis since the 1970s. Baclofen has shown promise in the management of alcohol
      dependency in preclinical and clinical studies. We propose to examine baclofen in the
      prevention/amelioration of AWS in adult medical inpatients. The investigators hypothesize
      that Baclofen, as compared to placebo, will significantly reduce the number of adult
      inpatients with AD who will develop moderate/severe AWS (SEWS ≥ 7) when assessed at 72 hours
      after enrollment. Further the investigators hypothesize that Baclofen, as compared to
      placebo, will significantly reduce the need for symptom-triggered benzodiazepine
      administration during the 72 hours of hospitalization. These hypotheses will be tested in
      adult inpatients who are determined to be at risk for alcohol withdrawal and are subsequently
      placed on the SEWS monitoring and treatment protocol. These patients will be randomized to
      baclofen 10mg three times daily vs placebo.

      See Brief Summary. Patients will recieve standard of Care treatment and monitoring for ETOH
      withdrawl per our insitution wide SEWS protocol. They will then be randomized to recieve
      baclofen 10mg tid vs placebo tid for the course of their hospital stay or 7 days, whichever
      comes first.

    <description>Prevention of progression to Severe Alcohol withdrawal as assessed by Severity of Ethanol Withdrawal Score (SEWS). A score of &gt; 7 represents moderate alcohol withdrawal and a score &gt; 12 severe alcohol withdrawal.

    <time_frame>Over 72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of alcholol withdrawal will be assessed by monitoring SEWS scores in both baclofen and placebo group. This score is reported as a cumulative unit on scale ranging from 0 to 23. A value of 1-6 represents mild alcohol withdrawal, 7-12 moderate and &gt;12 severe. Values will be measured 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours. A mean of these values was calculated.</description>

        <title>Reduced Severity of Alcohol Withdrawal as Measured by Severity of Ethanol Withdrawal Score. .</title>
        <description>Severity of alcholol withdrawal will be assessed by monitoring SEWS scores in both baclofen and placebo group. This score is reported as a cumulative unit on scale ranging from 0 to 23. A value of 1-6 represents mild alcohol withdrawal, 7-12 moderate and &gt;12 severe. Values will be measured 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours. A mean of these values was calculated.</description>
