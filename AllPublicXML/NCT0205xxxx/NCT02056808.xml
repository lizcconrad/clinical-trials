      The purpose of this study is to determine whether increasing doses of SMT C1100 are safe,
      well tolerated and achieve appropriate blood levels in patients with Duchenne Muscular
      Dystrophy (DMD).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be males of any ethnic origin with a genetic diagnosis of DMD.

          -  Children between 5 and 11 years of age.

          -  A parent/legal guardian must date and sign a written consent on behalf of the patient,
             according to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and local regulations.
             This person must understand the contents of the consent, requirements of the study and
             have had an opportunity to review questions with a medically trained member of the
             site study team.

          -  The patient is willing to give verbal or written age appropriate assent to
             participate.

          -  For safety reasons, the patient's parent/legal guardian must have a good understanding
             of the English language, as this is the only language the consent/assent forms are
             written in, and understand the requirements for reporting of any adverse event to the
             Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Enrollment or participation in any therapeutic clinical trial within the prior 3
             months or 5 times the half-life (whichever is longer).

          -  Initiation or change (other than dose modifications for body weight) of systemic
             corticosteroid therapy within 2 months prior to the start of dose administration or
             discontinuation of corticosteroids within 30 days prior to the start of dose
             administration.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the excipients of the study drug or a previous history of
             drug allergy.

          -  Use of the following therapies is prohibited during the study and for at least 5
             half-lives prior to the start of dose administration: Inducers of cytochrome P450
             CYP1A2 (eg, carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, rifampin, omeprazole, and
             barbiturates), and moderate and strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g., fluvoxamine,
             ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, mexiletine; propafenone, zileuton). Substrates of CYP1A2 with
             narrow therapeutic windows (e.g., tacrine, theophylline, methadone, mexiletine).
             Nicotine, including exposure to daily passive smoking to minimize cytochrome P450 CYP
             1A induction. Chargrilled food, cruciferous vegetables, caffeine, tea, and any
             xanthine containing foods, and drinks are prohibited from 36 hours prior to check-in
             until final discharge from study. Herbal supplements and homeopathic preparations
             (unless approved by medical monitor).

          -  Need for mechanical ventilation.

          -  Non ambulatory.

          -  Any clinically significant acute illness within 4 weeks of the start of dose
             administration.

          -  Any co-morbidity that, in the opinion of the Investigator, increases the risk of
             participating in the study.

          -  Symptomatic cardiomyopathy that in the opinion of the Investigator prohibits
             participation in this study.

          -  Abnormality in the 12-lead ECG that, in the opinion of the Investigator, increases the
             risk of participating in the study.

          -  Any clinically significant medical condition, other than DMD that in the opinion of
             the Investigator may increase the risk of participating in the study or interfere with
             the interpretation of safety or efficacy evaluations (e.g., concomitant illness,
             psychiatric condition or behavioral disorder).

          -  Exposure to daily passive smoking (including parent/legal guardian, siblings) so as to
             minimize environmental factors causing cytochrome P450 CYP 1A induction. For
             information SMT C1100 is metabolized by cytochrome P450 CYP 1A.

          -  Excessive exercise (Investigator opinion).
