  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a heart attack patients are routinely started on drugs to inhibit platelets. Ticagrelor
      is a powerful anti-platelet drug with clinical benefits. However it must be discontinued in
      some, because of increased risk of bleeding or intolerance. These patients need to be
      transitioned to another agent, such as Clopidogrel. At present, there is no clinical
      consensus on the optimal strategy for this switch. Some clinicians elect to give a bolus dose
      of clopidogrel with 600mg, while others start directly with a 75mg daily dose, with no
      evidence regarding the benefits or potential complications associated with each strategy. The
      present proposal will evaluate the pharmacodynamics of 2 strategies with specialized platelet
      function testing. We hypothesize that a bolus dose of clopidogrel during the switch will
      confer better ischemic protection without increasing bleeding risk for patients undergoing a
      switch in therapy.

      The overall objective is to evaluate the need for a clopidogrel bolus dose among patients
      being switched from a regimen of ticagrelor to clopidogrel. In a randomized pharmacodynamics
      study of 48 patients, we will conduct serial measurements of platelet function/inhibition
      using the Accumetrics Verifynow assay (platelet inhibition will be expressed as P2Y12
      reaction unit [PRU]). Platelet inhibition will be assessed at specific time points over the
      first 72 hours following the change in medications, which will enable us to determine whether
      patients in the 2 different strategies may be at increased ischemic or bleeding risks. We
      hypothesize that a bolus dose of clopidogrel during the switch will confer better ischemic
      protection without increasing bleeding risk for patients undergoing a switch in therapy.

      SPECIFIC AIMS:

        1. Primary Aim: To determine with platelet function testing the pharmacodynamics effects of
           a 600mg bolus dose of clopidogrel compared with no bolusing among patients being
           switched from ticagrelor to clopidogrel.

        2. To determine if patients receiving a clopidogrel bolus have improvement in ischemic
           protection relative to patients without a bolus dose.

        3. To determine if patients receiving a clopidogrel bolus may be exposed to increase
           bleeding risk relative to those without a bolus dose.

    <description>Post randomization, blood samples at scheduled time points will be collected. Samples would enable measurement of platelet inhibition using the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay. Blood samples will be collected at baseline (prior to clopidogrel dose), 12, 24, 48, 54, 60 and 72 hours post initiation of therapy. The primary endpoint is the difference in platelet inhibition between our 2 different groups (bolus vs no bolus), as measured by P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) using the VerifyNow assay. The PRUs have now been widely used and accepted as a measure of platelet function in the research setting. PRU will be collected at the above mentioned time points. The primary outcome will be platelet function expressed as PRUs as a continuous variable over the 72 hour time period and compared between the 2 groups.</description>
