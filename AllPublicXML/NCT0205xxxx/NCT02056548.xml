  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies dealt with patients who maintained antiviral drugs for 2 ~ 6 months after
      final chemotherapy and they revealed that many of the patients who stopped preemptive
      antiviral drug within 6 months experienced viral reactivation. Based on the study results,
      guidelines recommend that preemptive antiviral therapy should be maintained for at least 6
      months. Nevertheless, many clinicians apply the preemptive antiviral drugs for 1~2 years or
      longer after final chemotherapy without definite evidences, and this practice increases the
      medical expenditure a lot. Therefore, the investigators are going to find out the proper and
      safe duration of preemptive antiviral therapy which can be a good reference in the future
      practice.

    <textblock>
      HBV reactivation in cancer patients is important not only for directly affecting severe
      hepatic failure but also for delaying of the further cancer treatments which may cause
      reduction of overall survival. Thus the guidelines according to the previous studies and
      other follow-up of randomized studies revealed that patients with positive HbsAg should be
      administered with preemptive antiviral therapy at least 6 month or more.

      However, ideal duration for preemptive antiviral therapy to suppress viral reactivation and
      withdrawal hepatitis is not clearly identified at present time. It is because previous data
      just dealt with the efficiency of preemptive antiviral therapy, but most of them did not
      analyze the outcomes after withdrawal of antiviral therapy. Frequent late-onset reactivation
      hepatitis in association with preemptive antiviral therapy is mainly due to drug-resistance
      or post-withdrawal manifestation. Drug-resistance was mainly associated with lamivudine which
      is now substituted by entecavir or tenofovir which produce lower incidence of resistance (&lt;
      1.2% at 6 years). Therefore, the only issue at present is withdrawal hepatitis which may be
      due to early cessation of the antiviral drug.
