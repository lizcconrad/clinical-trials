  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In endotracheal intubation, it is essential that the trachea is intubated and not the
      esophagus. In suboptimal situations (outside an operating theatre), malpositioning of the
      endotracheal tube occurs frequently and is often fatal. The diagnostic tools that are
      available in the operating theatre are not appropriate for out-of-hospital situations because
      of several reasons. Moreover, these methods mostly take some time to provide the desired
      information and don't have optimal specificity and sensitivity. In order to allow fast
      diagnosis of this potentially fatal complication, we have developed a fully-automatic
      detection device to diagnose endotracheal tube malpositioning within 2 seconds.

      A high sensitivity/specificity of the algorithm for waveform-analysis was demonstrated in
      healthy patients and patients with pulmonary diseases (decreased pulmonary compliance).

      A new stand-alone device with integrated sensors and microprocessor was developed that gives
      immediate diagnosis, and stores data for subsequent research purpose. This device will be
      evaluated in perioperative situations to demonstrate the high sensitivity and specificity in
      patients in a clinical setting.

      The fundamental algorithm for waveform analysis is unchanged, but an additional detection
      algorithm is incorporated for improved detection of ventilation efforts. In addition, sensors
      are integrated, automatic feedback electronics are improved, and the device is made more user
      friendly to be appropriate for out-of-hospital situations in demanding environments.

      In addition, waveforms will be recorded for later analysis and evaluation of the diagnostic
      value of a thoracic push ( a gentle push on the sternum) to detect tube position.
