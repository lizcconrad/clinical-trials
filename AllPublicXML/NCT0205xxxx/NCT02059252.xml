  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SmartMatrix™ is a single layer dermal replacement scaffold for full thickness skin
      replacement. The scaffold consists of a porous matrix of cross-linked human fibrin plus
      alginate that has been designed and optimised to facilitate wound closure and healing through
      cellular ingress and rapid growth of new blood vessels.

      This proof of concept study will involve patients with surgical wounds resulting from the
      excision of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma SCC).
