  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the McGrath® MAC video laryngoscope is equal
      or superior when compared to the Glidescope® Ranger and the Macintosh laryngoscope for novice
      users in a simulated airway manikin.

      Investigators compared two portable video laryngoscopes (the GlidesScope® Ranger (Verathon
      Inc, Bothell, WA, USA) and the McGrath® MAC (Aircraft Medical Ltd, Edinburgh, UK)) and a
      German type Macintosh metal blade with a fiberoptic light. A blade size of 4 was used on all
      devices. All intubations using video laryngoscopes were performed according to the
      manufacturers' instructions. A specialised rigid stylet (the GlideRite®) was used with the
      Glidescope® and a flexible plastic stylet bent with a hockey stick curvature, was used with
      the McGrath® MAC and the Macintosh laryngoscope. A size 7.5 endotracheal tube (Mallinckrodt™
      Hi-Lo Oral/Nasal Tracheal Tube Cuffed Murphy Eye, Covidien, Ireland) was used with all the
      laryngoscopes.

      All participants were randomly divided into 3 device groups. Each group was allowed to
      attempt to perform endotracheal intubation five more times using the Laerdal® Airway
      Management Trainer (Laerdal Medical Korea Ltd., Seoul, Korea) with the normal airway setting.
      After completing the normal airway session, the participants performed another five attempts
      with the neck immobilisation setting using a neck collar.

      The sequence in which the three devices were used was randomly assigned, and all participants
      performed the same sequence at intervals of five weeks during the study.
