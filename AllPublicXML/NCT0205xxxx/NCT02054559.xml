             (+) are eligible. However, primary prophylaxis using antiviral agents (i.e.
             lamivudine, etc) is recommended for HBV carrier to prevent HBV reactivation during
             whole treatment period.)

          -  Prior history of malignancies other than lymphoma (except for basal cell or squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin, early gastric cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or
             breast or untreated prostatic cancer without any plan for a treatment) unless the
