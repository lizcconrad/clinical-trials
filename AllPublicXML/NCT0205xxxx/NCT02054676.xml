      Size of the research. Patients referred to the dentists and dental specialists in Lithuania
      and other centers participating in the study.Total sample size is not less than 80 - 100
      edentulous jaw segments. The duration of the study is one year of sample gathering (2014).

      Material and methods. Dental notation: World Dental Association (FDI) dental notation system.
      The length measurement system is metric (millimetres with integer numbers according to the
      mathematical rules). Non linear measurements values are provided: &quot;+&quot; - agreement, &quot;-&quot; -
      disagreement. Separate stages of the study should be documented - digital pictures (under
      protocol requirements) should be taken.

      The international study is based on classification (please find the first article in the list
      of publications). The investigation unit is edentulous jaw segment in aesthetic or non
      aesthetic zone. Aesthetic zone contains incisive, canine and premolar edentulous jaw
      segments. Molar region edentulous jaw segments belong to non aesthetic zone. The proposed
      classification accuracy is evaluated after edentulous jaw segment preoperative,
      intraoperative, early postoperative and late postoperative stages corresponding parameters
      comparison in the aesthetic and non aesthetic zone (the evaluation of the corresponding
      parameters are different at separate stages). The corresponding data collection in to
      appendices (Appendix 1, Appendix 2, Appendix 3) should be made by the calibrated and trained
      in the field investigator.

Cone-beam computed tomography preoperative evaluation will be made during preoperative stage. Intraoperative edentulous jaw segment parameters evaluation, endosseous dental implant placement parameters assessment during intraoperative stage will be made. Dental implant position evaluation during early postoperative stage will be made. Medications will be prescribed.

    <description>Procedure: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) preoperative evaluation (e.g. &quot;i-CAT&quot;, Imaging Sciences International, Hatfield, Pennsylvania, USA). CBCT voxel size is about 0,2 - 0,25 mm . Manufacturer recommended software is used. CBCT evaluation of partially edentulous jaw segments are made during preoperative stage (see Appendix 1):
Non aesthetic and aesthetic zone edentulous jaw segment parameters (height, width, length, mandibular canal walls identification/jawbone quality type visual identification) evaluation;
Every edentulous jaw segment parameter should be graded following: Type I (low risk), Type II (moderate risk), Type III (high risk).
All graded measurements provide overall risk evaluation for implant treatment in non aesthetic and aesthetic zone without aesthetic parameters evaluation. Dental implant is selected if surgery is possible.</description>

Intervention related study parameters are provided on Appendix 2. Aesthetic parameters related to implant treatment success are evaluated after mucoperiosteal flap elevation: alveolar ridge vertical position, mesial and distal interproximal bone peak height (in the aesthetic zone).
The additional parameters (non aesthetic) are evaluated after dental implant osteotomy preparation and implant placement:
implant drill slippage deeper than planned;

    <description>Endosseous dental implant (e.g. &quot;Bone Level SLA&quot; implant, Straumann AG, Basel, Switzerland) is placed if possible during intraoperative stage according to study protocol in the aesthetic or non aesthetic zone edentulous jaw segment. Optimally positioned dental implant is surrounded by at least 1 mm of bone for successful treatment outcome in the non aesthetic zone.
Aesthetic zone implant is placed in the optimal three dimensional position. It is surrounded by bone at least 1 mm from lingual side and at least 2 mm from buccal side for successful treatment outcome.
Dental implant apex is at least 2 mm away from anatomically important jaw vital structures.
Dental implant parameters (length, width) are individual (depends on edentulous jaw segment parameters).
Bone and soft tissue augmentation are made if necessary after dental implant placement.</description>

    <description>Periapical radiograph (e.g. &quot;Kodak RVG 6100 Intraoral Digital Imaging System&quot;, Carestream Health, Rochester, NY) evaluation is necessary (Appendix 2) to examine implant apex distance to anatomically important vital structures (possible injury) (mandibular canal, nose base) during early postoperative stage.
Digital periapical radiographs are used to assess the edentulous jaw segment after implant placement. The long cone paralleling technique should be used for taking periapical X-ray (prevention of possible creation of foreshortening and elongation).
Postoperative patient's neurosensory evaluation is necessary to assess possible inferior alveolar nerve and lingual nerve injury. After finishing of local anaesthesia patient should be contacted and if there are some sensory deficit complains, patient should be examined.</description>

The time after surgery is case depending before provisional and final crown placement.
Peri-implant soft tissue conditioning is recommended with screw retained provisional single-tooth implant crown for approximately 4 - 8 weeks.
Healing abutment placement after dental implant osseointegration is not recommended because of the treatment time saving.</description>
