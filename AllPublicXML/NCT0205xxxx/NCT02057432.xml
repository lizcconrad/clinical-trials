    <textblock>
      This research study is a pilot study designed to evaluate magnetic resonance imaging-guided
      therapy (MRT) as a possible treatment for breast cancer. In this pilot study, the
      investigators are studying if it is possible to use intra-operative MRI to guide surgery. The
      therapy takes place in the Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operating (AMIGO) suite at
      Brigham and Women's Hospital.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate if it is possible to perform the breast
      conserving surgery with the help of intra-operative magnetic resonance imaging in the
      advanced multimodality image guided operating suite. It is hoped that intra operative MRI may
      improve the surgeon's ability to know the exact margins of tumor. Currently, approximately
      40% of women need to come back to the operating room and have the margins of the cancer
      re-excised.

      The treatment being studied consists of standard lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy if
      indicated, or standard axillary dissection if clinically indicated. The study includes the
      additional use of MRI to guide the removal of the cancer. The MRI uses powerful magnets
      linked to a computer to create detailed pictures of the breast. The purpose of the current
      study is to find out whether performing the intra-operative MRI is possible, safe and
      practical. As part of the study the participant will need to have tests to show that they are
      eligible to participate in the research study.If the participant does not meet the
      eligibility criteria, they will not be able to participate in this research study.

      Surgery Day

        -  Wire localization with ultrasound, Mammogram or MRI in the non-palpable tumor is placed
           in the participant's breast. The presence of the wire in the tumor will then help guide
           the surgeon to the location of the tumor.

        -  The sentinel node biopsy or axillary dissection will be performed if indicated.

        -  Then the lumpectomy will be performed.

        -  The participant will undergo an intra-operative MRI scan in the AMIGO.

           ---If the MRI images indicate there may be tumor behind, more tissue will be removed
           from the respective margins. No additional MRIs will be performed.

        -  Most of these operations are outpatient. However, the need to stay overnight may occur
           if the recovery from anesthesia is slow or if the participant underwent an axillary
           dissection.

      Within six weeks after patient surgery. The participant will have the following procedures:

        -  History and physical exam

        -  Wound check

        -  The participant will also be informed of the final pathology, including margin
           status.The remainder of follow up will be as per standard of care after breast
           conserving surgery for breast cancer. The participant will be assessed by physical exam
           for possible complications and local recurrence. These visits will likely overlap with
           established oncology care team follow-up visits.

    <description>For the purpose of this pilot study, feasibility is defined as the ability to successfully complete the breast conserving operation in the
AMIGO suite. Feasibility must entail the following:
All necessary instruments for this operation are MRI compatible or are able to be used safely and then stored outside of the magnetic field when the intra-operative MRI is performed. The intra-operative MRI is performed without compromising the sterile operative field.</description>

    <description>Images will be obtained both before and after intravenous bolus injection with subsequent dynamic imaging. Dynamic contrast enhancement maps will be created for evaluation of residual tumor. Images will be reformatted into three orthogonal planes as well as into a 3D model for surgical orientation. All imaging protocols using contrast, contrast enhancement maps and reformatting, as described above, which will be applied to the intra-operative MRI performed in the AMIGO suite are consistent with the standard MRI breast imaging at Brigham and Women's Hospital.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have a pre-operative standard mammogram with or without ultrasound.
             These may be performed at outside institutions.

          -  Participants must have biopsy confirmed invasive breast carcinoma. If biopsy was done
             at an outside hospital, pathology will be reviewed at BWH/DFCI.

          -  Stage: Clinical Staging must be Stage I or II as outlined by the AJCC 7th edition.
             Pre-operative diagnosis of positive axillary nodes necessitating axillary dissection
             at the time of lumpectomy does not disqualify a patient.

          -  Pre-operative sentinel node biopsy also does not disqualify the patient.

          -  Participants must be candidates for definitive local therapy with breast conserving
             therapy (this takes into account tumor to breast size ratio appropriate for BCS, and
             the ability to undergo standard radiation therapy post-operatively).

          -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as one lesion that can be
             accurately measured by MRI. (More than one lesion will be an exclusion criteria for
             BCS; lesions not identified by MRI will also be an exclusion criteria).

          -  Age ≥ 18 years and &lt; 75.

          -  Completion of the magnetic resonance (MR) procedure screening form and clearance by
             the MR technologist that the patient does not have a pacemaker, brain aneurysm clip,
             inner ear implant, neurostimulator or metal fragments in the eye.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be
             eligible for admission into the study.

          -  Participants with a known BRCA 1 or 2 mutation.

          -  Participants with known Li-Fraumeni or Cowden's Disease.

          -  Participants with prior mantle radiation.

          -  Participants with locally advanced breast cancer such as inflammatory breast cancer or
             cancer grossly involving skin.

          -  Participants who are pregnant.

          -  Participants who enroll in a preoperative therapy trial or who have been treated with
             neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy can result in complete
             pathologic response, resulting in no signal on MRI.

          -  Participants with known, active collagen vascular disease.

          -  Participants who undergo breast surgery at an outside institution.

          -  Participants with prior history of breast carcinoma.

          -  Patients who have implants or any type of breast reconstruction.

          -  Patients who have biopsy confirmed multi-centric disease.

          -  Participants who have documented contra-indications for MRI.

          -  Participants who have documented allergic reaction to IV MRI contrast agent, or have a
             contraindication to the administration of IV contrast such as renal failure.

          -  Patients with diabetes will be excluded because of a higher risk to incur renal damage
             from the IV contrast.

          -  Participants who exceed the weight limit for the surgical table at AMIGO, 350 lbs or
             who will not fit into the 70 cm diameter bore of the MRI scanner at AMIGO or the 60 cm
             diameter bore of the pre-procedure imaging MRI scanner.
