  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One important issue in older adults with cognitive problems is the higher risk of fall due to
      decreased motor function and balance. The objective of this study is to evaluate the
      repercussions of mild cognitive impairment in balance in elderly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment is described as a transitional stage between normal ageing and
      dementia, and reflects the clinical situation where a person has memory complaints and
      objective evidence of cognitive impairment but no evidence of dementia. Mild cognitive is
      important in older people and it is also important to evaluate its repercussion in balance.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dynamic balance</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic balance is going to be measured using the Mini-Best test. This is a 14-item test that focuses on dynamic balance, specifically anticipatory transitions, postural responses, sensory orientation, and dynamic gait</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The cognitive impairment will be measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the Mini-Mental State Examination. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment is a test designed as a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. The Mini Mental State Examination is a 10-minute bedside measure of impaired thinking in undeveloped, uneducated, diseased, or very old populations.</description>

    <description>Attention is going to be measured with the Stroop test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The cognitive flexibility of patients is measured using the Trial Making Test. This test explores visual-conceptual and visual-motor tracking, and it is a frequently used neuropsychological test.</description>
