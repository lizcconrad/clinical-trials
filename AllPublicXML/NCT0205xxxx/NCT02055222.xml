  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the implementation of modern public health interventions, 1 in 5 adults in the United
      States are either current or former smokers and remain at risk for the development of chronic
      lung diseases. It is unknown how or why any one individual smoker can develop a wide range of
      lung diseases including chronic obstructive lung disease and/or pulmonary fibrosis. The
      purpose of this protocol is to collect clinical data, blood, urine, and bronchoalveolar
      samples from smokers and non-smokers in an attempt to establish phenotypic clinical profiles
      that correspond to divergent pathways in the expression of such proteins as the transforming
      growth factor-beta1 (TGF- &lt;=1). The information generated from this study will provide
      insight into the pathogenesis of smoking-related lung injury and potentially allow for the
      development of early therapeutic interventions.
