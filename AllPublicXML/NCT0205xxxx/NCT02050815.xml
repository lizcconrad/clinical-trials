  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I, multi-center, open-label, single oral dose, parallel group study to
      assess the PK and safety of MEK162 in subjects with impaired hepatic function and healthy
      subjects with normal hepatic function. Subjects will be assigned by hepatic function defined
      by elevation of serum total bilirubin and serum AST as determined at the screening and
      baseline visits. The study population will be healthy male and postmenopausal or sterile
      female subjects who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. A minimum
      of 24 evaluable subjects (6 subjects per group) will be enrolled. The groups are: Group
      1-healthy volunteers, Group 2-Mild hepatic impairment, Group 3-Moderate hepatic impairment
      and Group 4-Severe hepatic impairment. Once approved for enrollment, participants will be
      confined to the facility for 5 days, given a single dose of MEK162 and monitored for safety
      assessments, labs and PK will be assessed.

    <description>A minimum of 24 subjects (6 subjects per group) will be enrolled. Enrollment into Group 1 (control group with normal hepatic function) should be similar to the enrollment into Group 2, 3 and 4 with respect to age, gender, and body weight. Enrollment into Group 1 will remain open until the enrollment into the mild, moderate, and severe impairment groups are complete with matching controls for comparison. Serum level of total bilirubin and AST will be used to determine which group the hepatic impaired patient will be allocated l. Dosing of the different treatment groups will be staggered. Initially, 6 subjects in Group 1 (normal hepatic function) and 6 subjects in Group 2 will receive a single oral dose of MEK162 on Day 1.</description>
