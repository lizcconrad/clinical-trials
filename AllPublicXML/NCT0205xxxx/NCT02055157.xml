    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, sequential cohort dose-escalation study of BMN 111 in children
      with achondroplasia. The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of daily
      BMN 111 administered to children with achondroplasia.

    <measure>Efficacy measure</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months and approximately 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy will be assessed by change from baseline in height growth velocity (annualized to cm/yr), absolute growth, subject growth compared with ACH and non-ACH standardized pediatric growth curves, and change in body proportions. These will be assessed by anthropometric measurements and measurement ratios.</description>
