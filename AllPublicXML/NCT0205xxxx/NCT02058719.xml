    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about pulmonary complications of human immunodeficiency
      virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Even though antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      has dramatically decreased the number of opportunistic infections and deaths in HIV infected
      patients, pulmonary complications (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
      development and pneumonias resulting in decreased lung function) of HIV/AIDS continue to be a
      major cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. The mechanisms underlying the
      increased risk of COPD and decreased lung function in HIV infected individuals is not well
      understand and needs to be studied.

      The investigators hypothesize that the immunoregulatory consequences and immunosuppressive
      lung milieu secondary to HIV and cigarette smoke combine to increase the risk of lung
      infection and injury in HIV infected smokers, hastening the development of COPD. The
      mechanisms will be directly tested using blood and bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) cells from
      smokers and nonsmokers with and without HIV infection.

      The first component of this study will be a longitudinal, prospective, 24 weeks study of the
      effects of HIV-1 infection on innate and acquired immunity in the lung (Cohort A). The second
      component of this study will be a cross-sectional, case-control study of lung function and
      immune dysregulation of HIV-1 infected persons on long-term ART (Cohort B).

      Cohort A will consist of 120 subjects, stratified by HIV-1 and smoking status

      Cohort B will consist of 90 subjects stratified by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) and HIV-1 infection.
