  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proposed is a parallel-design randomized controlled trial to compare the effects of consuming
      two types of snacks on a daily basis for a 12-week period on health outcomes, diet quality,
      and self-reported satiety in a group of overweight adults. The types of snacks to be studied
      are KIND snack bars with almonds and typical American snack foods).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Snacking has been implicated in the obesity epidemic, but judicious snacking can help control
      appetite and calorie intake and add nutrient-dense foods to the diet. The investigators
      hypothesize that snacking on nutrient-dense, highly satiating snack foods (i.e. KIND snacks
      with almonds) as compared to snacking on nutrient-dilute, energy-dense foods (i.e.,
      conventional snack foods) will contribute to satiety, weight loss, and health improvements.
      The investigators further hypothesize that the benefits of healthful snacking are enhanced
      when portion is clearly defined and controlled by packaging. Finally, the investigators
      hypothesize that these effects will be seen even when study participants are given clear
      guidance about the calorie content of snack items, and how to make room for those calories in
      their diets.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Snacking on nutrient-dense, highly satiating snack foods (i.e. KIND snacks with almonds)
           as compared to snacking on nutrient-dilute, energy-dense foods (i.e., conventional snack
           foods) will contribute to satiety, weight loss, and health improvements.

        2. The benefits of healthful snacking are enhanced when portion size is clearly defined and
           controlled by packaging.

        3. These effects will be seen even when study participants are given clear guidance about
           the calorie content of snack items, and how to make room for those calories in their
           diets.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Mass Index</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated as weight (kg) divided by height in meters (m) squared. Waist circumference will be measured using guidelines of the National Obesity Expert Panel Report.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Composition</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Week</time_frame>
    <description>Body composition will be measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis, which uses the resistance of electrical flow through the body to estimate body fat. The Body Composition Analyzer measures weight and calculates body fat% and total body water% in addition to BMI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Waist circumference</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Week</time_frame>
    <description>The waist circumference will be measured using the U.S. government standard protocol. Waist circumference will be measured around the narrowest point between ribs and hips when viewed from the front after exhaling.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Week</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure will be measured by using a Dinamap Monitor Pro 100 (after sitting for 5 minutes). Both systolic and diastolic pressures will be calculated as the mean value of 2 readings 5 minutes apart for each participant at every time point of assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lipid Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Week</time_frame>
    <description>The lipid profile is determined as follows: Total cholesterol , triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein are obtained by direct measurements. Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) are obtained by calculation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diet quality/key nutrients</measure>
    <time_frame>12 week</time_frame>
    <description>Diet quality as measured by the Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI). A 24-hour recall will be used to assess dietary intake of all participants, and we will calculate an HEI score from each completed recall.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hunger/Satiety</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Week</time_frame>
    <description>Hunger and satiety will be assessed using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) which will ask participants a series of questions to be completed at a predetermined time relative to consumption of the treatment snack. The questions of the VAS require participants to rate on a scale the strength of specific sensations that they are feeling (i.e., hunger, thirst, amount of food that they could eat &quot;right now&quot;, nausea, and fullness) by placing a vertical mark on the scale in response to each question.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Week</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form (SF)-12 version 2.0 will be used to assess quality of life of our study participants. The SF-12 contains 12 items from the SF-36 Health Survey. The SF-12 contains one or two items that measure each of the eight concepts included in the SF-36. Like the SF-36, the SF-12 is available in standard (4-week recall) and acute (1-week recall) formats. The SF-12 standard will be used to assess the quality of life of participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 week</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) Short Form. The IPAQ is a valid and reliable tool to assess physical activity in adults. It is a more comprehensive tool containing information on weekly activities in household and yard-work activities, occupational activity, transport, leisure time physical activity and sedentary behavior.</description>

    <description>Daily inclusion of conventional snacks (as part of the participant's usual diet, with diet counseling to adjust for the calories from the snacks. The snacks will consist of cookies considered to be conventional snack foods that are nutrient-dilute (i.e. relatively low in nutrients) and energy-dense (i.e., relatively high in kcal). Examples of conventional snack foods will include: Nabisco Snackwell Creme Sandwich 1.7 oz pack, Nabisco Newtons Fig 2 oz pack, Nabisco Cips Ahoy! Chocolate Chip 1.4 oz pack, and Nabisco Oreo Double Stuff Chocolate 1.3 oz pack.</description>
