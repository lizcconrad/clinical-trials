      Evaluation of the laparoscopic approach of the Magenstrasse and Mill procedure in a
      prospective study of 100 patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The laparoscopy is performed under general anesthesia with a 5 ports access under 14mm Hg
      pressure. After opening of the gastrocolic ligament and division of any adhesions between
      stomach and pancreas a circular opening is performed at the junction of corpus and antrum of
      the stomach with a circular stapler. A tubular gastric pouch is then created along a
      calibration tube at the lesser curvature by a vertical stapling starting from the circular
      opening to the angle of Hiss.

    <description>The Magenstrasse and Mill procedure is a conservative vertical gastroplasty described in 1987 through a laparotomy. A tubular gastric pouch is created by a vertical stapling extending from the antrum to the angle of Hiss. In this study, we evaluate the laparoscopic technique of the procedure.</description>
