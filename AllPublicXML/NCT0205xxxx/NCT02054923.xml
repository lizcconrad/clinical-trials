  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Routine video recording of the colonoscopy examination has been proposed as a simple and easy
      to implement method that could improve the quality of colonoscopy. The purpose of this study
      is to investigate whether implementation of routine video recording of screening colonoscopy
      withdrawal is effective as a means of supporting quality performance of colonoscopy. The
      study will be performed in 8 screening centers within the framework of a national colonoscopy
      screening program in Poland (the Polish Colonoscopy Screening Platform; PCSP). Individuals
      aged 55-64 years are eligible to participate in the PCSP. In the run-in period colonoscopy
      quality measures will be monitored through a dedicated joint database. Then eligible
      screening centres will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the video recording group or
      the control group. Screening centres assigned to the video recording group will receive
      videorecorders and DVDs and will be asked to video record all screening colonoscopies (only
      withdrawal). Control group will be allowed to record colonoscopies on demand only. Then , the
      colonoscopy quality measures will again be monitored through a dedicated joint database. All
      the recorded DVDs will be reviewed to verify ceacal intubation and withdrawal time by the
      PCSP team.

    <description>All screening centres (clusters) assigned to the routine video recording group will receive an appropriate number of video recorders and DVDs for each colonoscopy room. Screening centre coordinators will be responsible for the implementation of routine video recording of all screening colonoscopies (only withdrawal) in the centres. Every three months screening centre coordinators will be asked to send back all recorded DVDs. All the recorded DVDs will be reviewed to verify ceacal intubation and withdrawal time by the PCSP team and then stored.</description>
