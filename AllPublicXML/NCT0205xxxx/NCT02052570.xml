      This is a qualitative study that will explore the experiences of school reentry following
      Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) in children ages 10-16 years of age, their parents,
      teachers and primary PBMT(Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplant) providers. This study will
      involve four focus groups: children post -transplant, parents, teachers and PBMT providers in
      an effort to understand the successes and challenges of returning to school following HSCT.

      This is a qualitative descriptive study using purposive sampling to form the four focus
      groups to encourage diversity in diagnosis (immunodeficiency, malignancy, bone marrow failure
      and inherited metabolic diseases), age and location. Each group will participate via
      conference call due to difference in location. There will be semi-structured questions for
      each group but also allow flexibility by participants themselves.
