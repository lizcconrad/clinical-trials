  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of administering a 20-day
      preoperative cognitive training intervention (Cog-Train) to a widely inclusive sample of
      cardiac surgical patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive outcomes remain poor after cardiac surgery. Data from the field of cognitive
      neuroscience suggests that cognitive training, which harnesses the brain's adaptive
      plasticity to improve, maintain, or restore function in a target area, can be used to
      strengthen brain resilience and improve cognitive outcomes following challenge. While its
      effectiveness has been demonstrated in older adults as well as in other (nonsurgical) patient
      populations, no training intervention like this has ever before been used in any surgical
      patient in the preoperative period. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility
      of administering a 20-day cognitive training intervention (Cog-Train) to a widely inclusive
      sample of cardiac surgical patients before their surgery. Data obtained will be used to
      design a full-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) on Cog-Train's effectiveness in
      improving postoperative cognitive outcomes.

    <description>Twenty-one days prior to surgery, patients will begin self-administering the intervention using an iPad tablet. This intervention will consist with daily sessions of at least 20 minutes of the Cog-Train task (the task and regimen used to obtain robust effects in previous studies by members of our group). Cog-Train is an n-back task - an adaptive working memory computer game that extends players' working memory capacity by getting progressively more difficult as the player's performance increases.</description>
