  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Developmental disability is a severe chronic disabled condition caused by mental or physical
      impairments. Children with developmental disabilities may face life-long difficulties in
      motor functioning, self-care, condition, communication, and independent living. They often
      receive rehabilitation services to promote daily functions and participation in home, school,
      and community lives.

      &quot;Family-centered&quot; service has been considered as &quot;best practice&quot; in pediatric rehabilitation.
      Therapists encourage children with developmental disabilities and their parents to
      participate in decision making and implementing process of intervention, and provide
      intervention plan that best fit their family needs. Research shows that for children with
      developmental disabilities, family-centered services can enhance children's development,
      decrease parenting stress, promote emotional wellness, and increase parental satisfaction to
      services. Though the &quot;family-centered&quot; concept has been considered as relevant in pediatric
      rehabilitation, there are still difficulties, as well as a lack of evidence regarding its
      implementation in practice.

      Reflecting the trend of family-centered medical care, the benefits of national health
      insurance in Taiwan for early intervention outpatient care will emphasize on family-centered
      intervention. The range of benefits may include communication with parents, parental
      education, consultation and instructions for home programs. Besides, outcomes of
      family-centered intervention will be treated as an important index for monitoring the quality
      of medical services.

      Given that there is a lack of investigation regarding the family-centered pediatric
      rehabilitation, the purposes of this one-year research project are to investigate the
      implementation of family-centered pediatric rehabilitation for children with developmental
      disabilities and to identify related influencing factors. This study will provide empirical
      evidence for family-centered services in Taiwan.

        Children with developmental disabilities (DD) aged 2-12 years. Children with DD refer to a
        diverse group of severe, chronic disability that is attributed to mental and/or physical
        impairments, resulting in substantial functional limitations in major life activity.
