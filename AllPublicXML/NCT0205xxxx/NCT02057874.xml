  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial examines how well different imaging biomarkers acquired using
      3-Telsa magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods perform in determining treatment response to
      transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Compared to
      conventional imaging, multi-parametric 3-Tesla MRI offers the ability to quantitatively
      measure tissue structural, functional, cellular, and molecular properties, providing a more
      robust, clinically relevant method for assessing cancer response to therapy.

    <measure>Correlation of changes in imaging biomarkers (Ktrans, ADC, MTR, and APTasym) as measured by DCE-, DW-, MT-, and CEST-MRI at 3 Tesla, respectively, with changes in tumor volume (mRECIST).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 12 weeks post-TACE</time_frame>
    <description>The following will be longitudinally measured using 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prior to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and 2-4, 4-8, and 12 weeks following TACE: 1) the volume transfer coefficient (Ktrans), measured by dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI; 2) the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), measured by diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI; 3) the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), measured by magnetization transfer (MT) MRI; and 4) the amide proton transfer asymmetry (APTasym), measured by chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI. We will use a general linear model (GLM) approach to measure the association between changes in each of the above imaging metrics (relative to pretreatment baseline) and changes in tumor volume (according to standard-of-care modified RECIST) at 3 or 6 month follow-up, accounting for the effect of potential confounders, e.g., age and size of the tumor at baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation of changes in Ktrans, ADC, MTR, and APTasym (measured by DCE-, DW-, MT-, and CEST-MRI at 3 Tesla, respectively) with time-to-progression (TTP).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 6 months post-TACE</time_frame>
    <description>Proportional hazard model will be employed to assess the ability of the longitudinal change (relative to pretreatment baseline) in each of the 3T MR imaging metrics (Ktrans, ADC, MTR, and APTasym) to predict patient survival outcomes, time-to-progression (TTP) and progression-free survival (PFS) as well as overall survival (OS). The calibration of prediction will be validated by computing the difference between predicted survival and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates at a fixed time, which estimates the over-optimism of the difference using bootstrapping.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation of changes in Ktrans, ADC, MTR, and APTasym (measured by DCE-, DW-, MT-, and CEST-MRI at 3 Tesla, respectively) with changes in the ratio of viable-to-necrotic tumor volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 12 weeks post-TACE</time_frame>
    <description>Longitudinal changes in 3T MRI-derived measures and the change in the ratio of viable vs. necrotic tumor will be assessed by using a GLM approach in which the underlying temporal correlation can be modeled via an autoregressive order one (AR(1)) structure, validated by computing Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) against the other common structures, e.g., unstructured and constant correlation.</description>

    <measure>Correlation of Ktrans, ADC, MTR, and APTasym (measured by DCE-, DW-, MT-, and CEST-MRI at 3 Tesla, respectively) with pathological response within explanted tissue following orthotopic liver transplant (OLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Subset of patients undergoing OLT: within 12 hours following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Histopathological features on explanted livers following OLT, including percentage necrosis and cellular density as determined by hematoxylin and eosin staining, as well as the extent of fibrosis as determined by collagen staining, will be assessed for correspondence with findings on ex vivo 3T MRI.</description>
