      The objective of the project is to investigate the influence of application of Kinesio Taping
      in young athletes in football, muscle strength and muscle activation in the performance of
      the Single Leg Hop Test tests and Triple Hop Test methods: will be conducted a randomized,
      placebo-controlled and double-blind. 24 individuals will be athletes who fit the criteria for
      inclusion will be randomized into 2 groups (Placebo, Kinesio Taping Taping) and will be
      submitted to the tests of Single Leg Hop Test, Triple Hop Test, the isokinetic evaluation and
      electromyographic of Rectus Femoris dominant lower limb. Then the intervention shall be
      carried out with application of Kinesio Taping for activation of rectus femoris muscle group
      and placebo intervention Kinesio Taping with application of Kinesio Taping of transverse way
      the rectus femoris without tension in the Placebo group Taping. The volunteers will be
      re-evaluated 30 minutes after application of the technique and 12:0 am after with the same
      tests for that later can be compared the results obtained in each group. Analysis: will be
      achieved statistical tests and adopted a significance level of 5 percent

      The method of bandage with Kinesio Taping created by Kenzo Kase in 1996, it is the
      application of a thin, elastic tape with a thickness similar to the epidermis, on the skin.
      Being that it can be stretched up to 140 of its original length making it elastic enough
      compared to the conventional bandages. Kenzo still claims that the tape is able to reduce
      pain, swelling, muscle spasms and prevent injury. As much as there is today a widespread use
      of this technique mainly in the context of sports and orthopedics, still lack reliable
      studies to support the theory described by this method. Objectives: to investigate the
      influence of application of Kinesio Taping in young athletes in football, muscle strength and
      muscle activation in the performance of the Single Leg Hop Test tests and Triple Hop Test
      methods: will be conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind. 24 individuals
      will be athletes who fit the criteria for inclusion will be randomized into 2 groups
      (Placebo, Kinesio Taping Taping) and will be submitted to the tests of Single Leg Hop Test,
      Triple Hop Test, the isokinetic evaluation and electromyographic of Rectus Femoris dominant
      lower limb. Then the intervention shall be carried out with application of Kinesio Taping for
      activation of rectus femoris muscle group and placebo intervention Kinesio Taping with
      application of Kinesio Taping of transverse way the rectus femoris without tension in the
      Placebo group Taping. The volunteers will be re-evaluated 30 minutes after application of the
      technique and 12:0 am after with the same tests for that later can be compared the results
      obtained in each group. Analysis: will be achieved statistical tests and adopted a
      significance level of 5 percent.

    <description>The volunteer must position themselves in foot with unipodal support in the dominant lower limb behind a line that will be demarcated on the ground and jump as far as possible, without support in the contralateral limb or imbalance. The distance will be measured with a tape measure, from the starting point (line demarcated on the ground) until the most proximal point of the heel of the foot fell on the floor.</description>

    <measure>Surface electromyography</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>During isokinetic evaluation will also be carried out a study of the electrical activity of the rectus femoris muscle. For the capture of the electrical signal of that muscle will be used the acquisition system with 8 channels (EMG System of Brazil Ltda ®), composed of active electrodes with bipolar won 20 times amplification, analog filter pass band of 20 to 500 Hz and common mode rejection of 120 dB, and one of the channels will be enabled to use the force transducer (EMG System of Brazil Ltda ®). EMG signals are sampled with 2000 Hz frequency, scanned for AD conversion plate (analog-digital) with 16 bits of resolution.</description>

    <measure>Isokinetic evaluation of knee Extensors</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately after heating and evaluation of jumps, the volunteers will perform the test of maximum voluntary contraction (CVM). Being they, positioned sitting on the seat of the isokinetic dynamometer (4, Biodex) the dominant limb is positioned to 60° of knee flexion (with 0° corresponds to total knee extension) and attached to the seat by means of a dynamometer belt. The non-dominant lower limb will also be positioned with 100° of flexion of hip and will also be attached to the seat with a belt. The volunteers will also be attached to the seat of the dynamometer through two belts across his torso. During the tests the volunteers will be instructed to place his arms across the trunk and the dynamometer axis is positioned parallel to the center of the knee joint. The CVM test will consist in the execution of three isometric contractions of knee extensors of the non-dominant lower limb with duration of 5 seconds, the highest torque value obtained in the three contractions (peak torque).</description>

In the sequence, the athlete will be oriented to remain at rest for 30 min to get a better grip on the tape and one of the first tests and rest, only after this period will conduct a new evaluation of jump tests (single leg Hop test and Triple Hop Test) and, finally, a new test of strength in the isokinetic dinamomêtro in conjunction with the electromyographic assessment.</description>
