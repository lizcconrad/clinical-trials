  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether vitamin D supplements given to children
      aged 1 month to 5 years, hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infection will
      improve symptoms and reduce the duration of hospitalization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized, double blind placebo controlled interventional study, children aged 1 month
      to 5 years, who are admitted with acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRTI) to Dr
      George Mukhari Academic Hospital will be enrolled. The children will randomized to receive
      2500 IU of vitamin D or a placebo. It is intended to enrol 320 children, 160 to receive
      vitamin D and the other 160 to receive a placebo. This sample size was calculated at 80%
      power and 5% significance. The children will be enrolled within 24 hours of admission and the
      intervention (supplement or placebo) will be daily until the child is discharged fron the
      hospital.

      The severity of ALRTI will be assessed using the modified Respiratory Distress Assessment
      Instrument (MRDAI) score. The thorough physical examination and classification of severity of
      the symptoms will be done at enrolment and daily until hospital discharge.

      Blood samples for vitamin D and calcium concentrations will be assessed at enrolment, before
      the child is given the supplement or placebo.

      The difference in the improvement in MRDAI score between the placebo and the supplement will
      be assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Similarly the difference in duration of hospital
      stay between the two groups will also be analysed using ANOVA. The association between the
      vitamin D levels and the MRDAI score on admission will also be assessed and analysed using
      ANOVA.

      All eligible children will be sequentially enrolled until the desired sample size is reached.
      A simple randomisation by means of computer generated numbers will be used to minimize
      selection bias. Both the study subjects and the investigators will be blinded to the
      allocation (treatment or placebo). The unblinding will be done only after the analysis has
      been completed.

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument score, involves the measurement of the child's respiratory rate, assessment of the use of accessory muscles, the child's color, and auscultatory findings; each of these is given a score from 0 to 3. The higher the score the more severe the clinical condition. This scoring system has been validated in a number of scientific studies.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of duration of hospitalization between vitamin D supplementation and placebo groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of hospital stay will be calculated from the day of admission to the day the child is assessed and deemed fit for discharge by the attending physician. All children at discharge will have a modified RDAI score of less than 3.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of correlation between vitamin D levels and modified Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument score</measure>
    <time_frame>On day 1, i.e. date of randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Blood for vitamin D levels will be obtained at enrolment and this will be used to assess whether a child is vitamin D deficient. Severity of ALRTI symptoms will also be assessed at enrolment using the modified RDAI. The correlation between vitamin D deficiency and severity of symptoms will be assessed.</description>
