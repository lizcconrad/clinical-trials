  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Athletes have to participate in screenings in order to reduce injuries. Up-to-now most
      screenings are purely clinically based. Literature, however, indicates the importance of
      knowledge on deviant movement patterns as possible risk factors for injuries. From this
      perspective, the current project aims to measure movement patterns, gait and running in young
      athletes to optimise training and prevent injuries.

      2D- and 3d registration methods, force plate data and pressure plate data will be used to
      document the performance of the athletes.

    <description>Angles at different joints will be investigated with 3D movement analysis methods. Kinetic data (joint moments) will be calculated with 3D movement analysis methods.
Center of pressure measures will be calculated on the basis of force plate data.
Gait, running, jumps, postural balance will be investigated. Plantar pressure parameters will be calculated on the basis of plantar pressure measurements.</description>
