    <textblock>
      This study is an acceptability and feasibility study of two adjunctive interventions: group
      education with stretching; and group acupuncture. The study population will be women with
      primary fibromyalgia who have not previously used acupuncture in the last 3 months. Both
      interventions will be 10 weeks in length and will be conducted at the Oregon Health &amp; Science
      University. The primary hypothesis is that both arms will be acceptable and feasible in the
      study population.

    <description>Group Education with Stretching will receive 10 small group educational classes at the Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU), based on the book &quot;Fibromyalgia (Biographies of Disease).&quot; Each chapter of Fibromyalgia covers different aspects of the disease and its treatment including global, economic, and risk statistics; a timeline of key events in the study of fibromyalgia; common symptoms and diagnostic indicators; natural history of fibromyalgia; pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments; associated disorders and syndromes; and impact of fibromyalgia at home, in the workplace and in society at large. Participants will be informed that they should not start additional treatments until the end of the study and complementary and alternative treatments won't be covered until the last session. Participants will also receive a digital video disk (DVD) covering stretching appropriate for fibromyalgia patients and will be asked to incorporate the DVD over the next 10 weeks.</description>
