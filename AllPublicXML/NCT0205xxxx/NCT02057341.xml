      This is a Phase 2 pilot study, involving a 48-week treatment period, designed to test the
      effectiveness of investigational study drug ARRY-371797 in treating patients with symptomatic
      genetic dilated cardiomyopathy due to a lamin A/C gene mutation, and to further evaluate the
      drug's safety. Approximately 12 patients from the US will be enrolled in this study.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and stable New York Heart Association
             (NYHA) Class II - IIIa congestive heart failure (CHF).

          -  Stable, guidelines-based medical and device therapy, without any CHF hospitalizations
             or change in heart failure drug dose with ≥ 50% reduction in dose or ≥ 100% increase
             in dose in the past 3 months.

          -  Left ventricular (LV) end diastolic diameter by trans-thoracic echocardiography of &gt;
             3.3 cm/m2 (for females) or 3.4 cm/m2 (for males) and/or LV ejection fraction ≤ 45%.

          -  Gene positive for a pathogenic mutation in the LMNA gene, as determined by a
             CLIA-certified clinical laboratory (mutations including but not limited to:
             splice-site, non-sense, deletion mutations, a mis-sense mutation in a highly conserved
             codon, a mis-sense mutation involving a major charge change, a mis-sense mutation
             previously associated with genetic dilated cardiomyopathy).

          -  Within 3 weeks prior to first dose of study drug, completed distance during six minute
             walk test of ≥ 100 m and ≤ 350 m AND/OR ≥ 100 m and ≤ 450 m AND ≤ 60% predicted
             distance AND patient is symptomatic for dilated cardiomyopathy per Investigator
             judgment.

          -  On the day before and day of first dose of study drug, completed distance during six
             minute walk test of ≥ 100 m and ≤ 400 m (with the greater value within 10% of the
             lesser value) AND/OR ≥ 100 m and ≤ 475 m (with the greater value within 10% of the
             lesser value) AND patient is symptomatic for dilated cardiomyopathy per Investigator
             judgment.

          -  Acceptable hematology, hepatic and renal function laboratory values within 3 weeks
             prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  Additional criteria exist.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unstable clinical cardiac symptoms requiring unscheduled hospitalization within 60
             days prior to study start.

          -  Clinically significant coronary artery disease, as per Investigator judgment.

          -  Currently receiving continuous intravenous (IV) inotrope infusion, or presence of a
             ventricular assist device, or history of prior heart transplantation.

          -  Any of the following within 60 days prior to study start: Myocardial infarction,
             cardiac surgical procedures, acute coronary syndrome, hemodynamically destabilizing
             cardiac arrhythmia, serious systemic infection with evidence of septicemia, any major
             surgical procedure requiring general anesthesia.

          -  Uncorrected, hemodynamically significant primary valvular disease.

          -  Initiation of cardiac resynchronization therapy within 180 days prior to study start.

          -  Likelihood, in the Investigator's opinion, of undergoing cardiac transplantation, left
             ventricular assist device or other device implantation, or other cardiac surgery
             within the next 6 months; or of requiring continuous IV inotropic treatment, or
             referral for hospice or end-of-life treatment.

          -  Active malignancy (except surgically-curative basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell
             carcinoma, or cervical carcinoma).

          -  Receiving chronic immunosuppressant therapy.

          -  Known positive serology for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active hepatitis B
             and/or hepatitis C.

          -  Participation in any other investigational study of drugs or devices within 30 days
             prior to study start.

          -  Additional criteria exist.
