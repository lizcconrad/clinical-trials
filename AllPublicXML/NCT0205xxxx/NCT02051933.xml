  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injections, at
      the time of surgery for pilon fractures, will improve ankle range-of-motion and
      functionality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine if the use of Botulinum toxin A intramuscular injections of the gastrocsoleus
      complex in patients with operatively treated tibial plafond fractures will result in:

        1. increased ankle dorsiflexion when compared to controls

        2. increased ankle functionality as measured by the FAAM, and quality of life as measured
           by the SF-36, when compared to controls

        3. a higher proportion of patients achieving at least 10 degrees of dorsiflexion when
           compared to controls

    <description>At the time of definitive fixation, the hospital's investigational pharmacy will provide four syringes containing 0.5mL Botulinum toxin type A. The dose of botulinum toxin will be calculated based on the patient's weight in kilograms, such that a total dose of 200U of Botox will be used for a 70kg individual. The dosage will scale linearly in proportion to the patient's body weight, such that each kilogram change results in a 3U change in Botox (rounded to the nearest 30U interval change from 200U, with a maximum of 300U).

    <description>At the time of definitive fixation, the hospital's investigational pharmacy will provide four syringes containing 0.5mL 0.9% sodium chloride solution . The dose of 0.9% sodium chloride will be calculated based on the patient's weight in kilograms, such that a total dose of 200U of Placebo will be used for a 70kg individual. The dosage will scale linearly in proportion to the patient's body weight, such that each kilogram change results in a 3U change in placebo(rounded to the nearest 30U interval change from 200U, with a maximum of 300U).

          -  Nerve, vascular, or tendon injury of the lower leg: injury to the tibial or peroneal
             motor nerves, injury to the posterior tibial artery requiring repair, or laceration of
             tendons that are involved in plantar flexion or dorsiflexion of the ankle which
             require repair

          -  History of prior lower extremity fracture to the tibia or ankle of the affected limb.

          -  Use of aminoglycoside antibiotics at the time of definitive fixation.

          -  Ipsilateral foot injury that will impair dorsiflexion exercises: Lisfranc injuries,
             fractures or dislocations of the talus, calcaneus, navicular, cuboid, cuneiforms, or
             metatarsals (phalanx fractures or dislocations will not be excluded).

          -  Patients receiving Botulinum Toxin A for other reasons.

          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to Botulinum toxin A.

          -  Gustilo Anderson type III B and C.
