    <textblock>
      This combined phase 1/2a clinical trial is to investigate the safety, dose limiting toxicity
      (DLT), and exploratory efficacy of three repeated intraventricular administrations of
      NEUROSTEM® (human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells) versus placebo via an
      Ommaya reservoir at 4 week intervals in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

      The study is divided into the 2 stages: dose-escalation in stage 1 and randomized and
      multiple-dose cohort parallel design in stage 2.The target population for enrollment in this
      study is patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
