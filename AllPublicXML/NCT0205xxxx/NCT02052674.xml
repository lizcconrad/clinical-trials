  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if there are differences in urine drainage between two
      types of indwelling bladder catheter systems (Foley catheter) in hospitalized patients. The
      difference between the two catheters is that one catheter is vented (the study catheter) and
      the other is a standard non-vented catheter. The vented catheter may drain urine better than
      a standard non-vented catheter.

      If a vented catheter drains the bladder better than a non-vented catheter it may lower the
      risk of retained urine in the bladder which could help prevent urinary tract infections.

      During hospitalization, while in the surgical intensive care unit beginning the day after
      surgery, measurements of the subject's urine drainage system will be taken at daily study
      visits: retained urine volume, dependent loops, incidence of bacteriuria, and thigh diameter.
