  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      G (guanine nucleotide binding) proteins associating with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)
      are key players in the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes and are targets of
      pharmacotherapeutic inter-ventions. In addition, G proteins binding to GPCRs either directly
      or permissively determine the efficacy of lifestyle interventions and drugs aiming at weight
      management and diabetes treatment. Polymor-phisms of the fat mass and obesity-related protein
      (FTO) gene have been also well characterised and linked to energy intake, body fat mass as
      well as CVD risk and the susceptibility to weight-reducing interventions. Stratifying
      patients according to G protein and FTO-related genotyping may enable a more accurate
      prediction of individual disease courses and responses to therapeutic interventions in terms
      of safety and tolerability as well as efficacy. Although the objectives primarily refer to
      the analysis of G pro-tein and FTO-related genotypes, also other genes of potential relevance
      for the evolution of obesity and/ or diabetes and the response to lifestyle and
      pharmacological interventions may be analysed.
