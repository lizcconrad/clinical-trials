  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aerosol delivery during mechanical ventilation has long been a long debated topic. As
      evidence- based knowledge about the delivery of aerosol to the lungs of mechanically
      ventilated patients increases, one piece of the puzzle has remained unexplored; measurement
      of clinically relevant outcomes. The primary aim of this research is to compare clinical
      outcomes (ventilator- associated events (VAEs), length of stay (LOS) in intensive care unit
      (ICU) and total days on mechanical ventilation) when using a traditional jet nebulizer versus
      a newer generation vibrating mesh nebulizer during mechanical ventilation. The secondary aim
      of this research is to identify source of bacteria by obtaining cultures of each nebulizer
      and ventilator circuit and plating them for colony growth and identification.

      This is a pilot study designed as a randomized, controlled trial comparing clinical outcomes
      and contamination rates in jet nebulizers versus vibrating mesh nebulizers. The sample size
      will be one of consecutive convenience over an entire year (September 2013-September 2014) to
      include all seasons. The study will be performed at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC) in
      Chicago, IL.

      Each mechanically ventilated patient within inclusion criteria, with a physician order for
      aerosol treatment, will be randomized to either the jet nebulizer or mesh nebulizer group
      using SPSS computer software. The respiratory care staff will place the nebulization device
      in the ventilator circuit per hospital protocol. Both devices, jet and mesh nebulizers, are
      currently standard practice, therefore hospital protocol will be followed regarding placement
      and administration of ordered aerosol treatment.

      The study subject will remain on the device in which they were randomized to for the duration
      of their hospital stay in order to obtain clinical outcome data. Study staff to be notified
      of patient extubation from mechanical ventilation, discharge from intensive care unit or
      expiration, this will conclude participant involvement in study. Retrospective clinical
      outcome data will be obtained from study subject's electronic medical chart at conclusion of
      study.
