    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of a novel advanced bolus calculator in
      subjects with Type 1 diabetes. Insulin bolus calculators have been developed to aid insulin
      dose adjustment and existing standard insulin bolus calculator consist of a simple algorithm
      that requires five subject-specific parameters as input to generate a recommended bolus
      insulin dose:

        -  current blood glucose (mmol/L)

        -  target blood glucose (mmol/L)

        -  insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (grams of carbohydrate per 1 unit of insulin)

        -  total grams of carbohydrate in meals

        -  insulin sensitivity factor (reduction in glucose per 1 unit of insulin)

      The Diabetes Technology team at Imperial College have developed a novel advanced bolus
      calculator. The complete integrated system consists of a commercially available smartphone
      that holds the novel advanced algorithm. The system requires regular updates of cases derived
      from retrospective blinded continuous glucose monitoring data and for this a commercially
      available glucose sensor will be used. Each new case includes information about the problem
      (e.g. capillary blood glucose, meal information and physical exercise), solution (recommended
      insulin dose) and outcome (blood glucose following a meal). The novel decision support
      algorithm is based on case-based reasoning (CBR). CBR is an artificial intelligence technique
      that tries to solve newly encountered problems by applying the solutions learned from solved
      problems encountered in the past.

      The end-product is therefore a subject specific insulin bolus calculator that continues to
      improve with time. The project utilises commercially available glucose sensors and
      smartphones (iPhone), integrated with a novel algorithm for insulin bolus calculation. The
      aim of the ABC4D is to minimise high and low glucose excursions which are associated with the
      complications of diabetes including blindness, kidney failure, nerve damage and
      cardiovascular disease.

      The clinical study has been designed to incrementally assess the device's ability to manage
      meal time insulin requirements at breakfast and lunch in a controlled supervised clinical
      environment over 8 hours (phase 1), followed by its use in the home environment over a 6 week
      period (phase 2) and finally over a 6 month period (phase 3).
