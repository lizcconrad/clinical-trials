      Background: Oral iron supplementation (OIS) is a widely-used strategy to treat iron
      deficiency anemia. However, absorption of OIS is often low and response is variable. To
      overcome this, large doses are given but this may reduce compliance due to gastric
      irritation. Thus, OIS doses should be low, while maximizing absorption. The prevailing serum
      hepcidin concentration (SHep) is the major determinant of iron absorption and erythrocyte
      iron utilization. Based on limited data in humans, SHep can be increased by a single OIS dose
      but the duration of the increase is uncertain: In a recent study conducted in our laboratory
      it has been found to last approx. 24 h. Also, there are few data on how the increase in SHep
      determines the absorption of further doses of oral iron. Is there a threshold SHep at which
      subsequent iron absorption is sharply reduced? Better understanding of this relationship
      would be valuable to design more effective and safer OIS regimens.

      Objectives: 1) Determine whether two consecutive dosages of 60 mg Fe differently affect
      hepcidin response and iron bioavailability (Study 1) 2) Compare the bioavailability of iron
      supplement dosages given at different times of the day (Study 2).

      Methods/Subjects: Healthy female subjects will be screened for low iron status. Anemic
      subjects will be excluded from the study. Thirty two subjects will be included with serum
      ferritin &lt;20 µg/L, C-reactive protein &lt;5 mg/L and Hemoglobin &gt;117 g/L. Subjects will be
      randomized in two groups and their Hepcidin (sHep) and iron status markers monitored at day 1
      (baseline). Subjects will receive iron supplement dosages of 60 mg with stable iron isotopes
      54Fe, 57Fe, 58Fe in form of 4 mg of FeSO4. Prior administration blood samples will be
      collected to monitor sHep and iron status markers.

      Outcome: The combined use of stable iron isotopes and a sensitive SHep assay will allow for
      better understanding of the iron-hepcidin relationship and this may enable design of more
      effective OIS regimens.
