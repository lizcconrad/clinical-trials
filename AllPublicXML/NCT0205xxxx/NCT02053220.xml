    <description>To assess the pattern of viral delivery and viral spread of ColoAd1 within tumour tissue when administered either by intra-tumoural injection or by intravenous infusion. Viral delivery and spread will be measured by immunohistochemical staining for ColoAd1 in tumour sections taken from patients. Presence of virus will also be detected by qPCR analysis of tumour tissue.</description>
