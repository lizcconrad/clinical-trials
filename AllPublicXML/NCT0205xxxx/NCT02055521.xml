    <textblock>
      Composite tissue allotransplants (CTA) involve transplantation of various tissues including
      vessels, nerves, skin, bones, and immune cells and entail a significant antigenic load. The
      large majority of recipients have been maintained on immunosuppression therapy similar to
      that used in solid organ transplantation that is associated with the complications usually
      reported in solid organ transplantation. The question whether risks associated with
      indefinite immunosuppressive are justified for a non-lifesaving procedure still remains
      unanswered. At present no CTA recipient proved to be spontaneously tolerant with any
      immunosuppressive protocol; indeed, until now all recipients who discontinued the
      immunosuppressive therapy rejected their graft. On the other hand CTA recipients showed a low
      incidence of chronic rejection despite the high incidence of acute rejection episodes.

      For all these reasons it should be of great interest to minimize the immunosuppression in CTA
      patients knowing their immunologic &quot;risk&quot;. The main outcome of this study is to search for
      the signature of tolerance in recipients of hand or face allotransplantation testing
      biomarkers previously identified in operational tolerant kidney transplant recipients.

      These markers have been developed studying tolerant kidney recipients and they were already
      tested in five bilateral hand transplantations and one face transplantation.

      The present study will include hand and face allograft recipients transplanted at least one
      year in several European institutions (Innsbruck, Lyon, Monza, Valencia): 11 bilateral hand
      transplantations, 4 single hand transplantations and 3 face transplantations. All the
      patients will undergo B cell phenotyping, TCR repertoire, molecular signature from
      operational tolerance and a skin biopsy with immunohistochemical staining of the specimens in
      order to show signs of acute or chronic rejection.

      The results could provide a valid tool to detect operationally tolerant recipients as well as
      recipients prone to develop chronic rejection.
