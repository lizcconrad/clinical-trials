      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether new novel markers from the clinical
      electrocardiogram (EKG), which have been used as non-invasive measures of heart disease, can
      detect coronary artery disease in patients with chest pain. The researchers are especially
      interested in studying how changes in these unique waves evolve over time with rest and
      activity. It is hoped that the findings will be helpful in differentiating patients with
      cardiac chest pain at emergency departments from those with non-cardiac chest pain, as early
      identification can accelerate treatment and save lives.

      Eligible participants are those age 18 and older who have been referred for a nuclear stress
      test at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Presbyterian Hospital to rule out coronary
      artery disease as part of their clinical care.

    <textblock>
      Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Differentiating ACS
      from other non-ischemic chest pain is imperative in emergency medicine and missed myocardial
      infarction remains one of the highest sources of medical malpractice in Emergency Departments
      (ED). At the same time, economic pressures and limited resources demand that physicians avoid
      hospital admission or protracted observation for every patient with chest pain or suspicious
      symptoms. In the absence of clear ST elevation (STE) on the electrocardiogram (ECG), ED
      providers have no reliable tools to quickly triage non-STE (NSTE) ACS patients. Current
      guidelines rely on blood biomarkers (e.g. cardiac enzymes) to identify this syndrome and do
      not completely describe ischemic ECG changes associated with it. ED Providers will need to
      delay the management of these high risk patients until cardiac biomarkers are withdrawn,
      analyzed, and interpreted. This results in greater mortality rates in NSTE-ACS patients and
      overburdens the healthcare system. The prolonged observation times at EDs and unnecessary
      admissions are just additional consequences that overuse nursing times and exacerbate nursing
      shortage.

      ECG changes other than ST elevation and dynamic ECG changes are a rich opportunity for
      improving diagnostics. This proposal intends to provide new insights into how ischemic
      repolarization changes evolve over time in the subacute phase of myocardial ischemia. Sixty
      patients with suspected coronary artery disease referred for nuclear cardiac stress testing
      will be included. Resting 12-lead ECGs will be obtained before the stress test and one after
      the stress test but before the nuclear scan. Alterations in novel, computerized T wave
      indices will be correlated with focal myocardial ischemia seen on nuclear scans. Repeated
      Measures ANOVA with between group comparisons, and Generalized Estimation Equation will be
      used in the analysis. The results will provide insight on the diagnostic value of different
      novel T wave indices to detect myocardial ischemia. Results from this study will provide
      tools for ED providers to distinguish ACS from non-ischemic chest pain patients early in the
      triage process, especially in the absence of STE that constitutes the common standard
      nowadays.

    <description>-- The study coordinator will then obtain a 5-minute baseline high resolution (1000 samples/second), 12-lead resting ECG stream using H12+ holter ECG machine (Mortara Instruments, Milwaukee, WI). This ECG will be performed before the subject completed their clinical stress test.
The patient will then complete the scheduled nuclear stress test that involves exercise treadmill testing followed by single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scan as per hospital protocols. The exercise treadmill test and SPECT nuclear imaging scan are clinical in nature, and therefore, separate from the research study.
After completing the scheduled exam, the study coordinator will obtain another 5-minute 12-lead ECG stream prior to removing the chest electrodes but before their nuclear scan.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  adults &gt; 18 years of age

          -  referred for nuclear cardiac stress testing for suspected coronary artery disease.

        There will be no restrictions to sex or race. Children and teens are less likely to have
        ischemic etiology of chest pain, justifying their exclusion. To optimize the clinical
        utility, there will be no exclusion criteria based on previous medical history,
        medications, or presenting chief complaint; all consecutive patients will be eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with un-interpretable ECGs or their ECG shows known secondary repolarization
             abnormalities (i.e. bundle branch blocks, ventricular hypertrophy, channelopathies,
             early repolarization) will be excluded. Of note, as per clinical guidelines, these
             patients do not get usually referred for exercise treadmill testing. This will improve
             the recruitment process of this study.
