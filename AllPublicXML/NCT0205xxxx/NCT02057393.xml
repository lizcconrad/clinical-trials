  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The initial treatment for most people with melanoma involves wide excision of the skin and
      sentinel node biopsy. As with other cancers, the status of the sentinel node provides
      important prognostic information to the patient and physician. Sentinel node biopsy was first
      developed using only a blue dye. Technetium99, a radioactive protein, was added later and
      provides the ability to image the patient and identify relevant lymph node basins. For the
      last 15 years or so, the standard method of SLN localization includes both tech99 and blue
      dye. While the rates of localization overall are excellent, these methods each have
      drawbacks. We are investigating a new method of finding sentinel nodes that uses a green dye
      that has an infrared signal. Our hypothesis is that indocyanine green (ICG) and real time
      lymphangiography is equivalent to technetium99 and methylene blue in identifying sentinel
      nodes (SLN) in patients with melanoma.

      Patients with melanoma of the trunk or extremities were prospectively enrolled in this trial.
      Patients with head and neck melanoma were excluded from this study based on our pilot
      experience. ICG is poorly visualized through muscle, and there seems to be high background
      uptake in the parotid gland; both of these features limit the utility of ICG and fluorescence
      imaging. All subjects had T1b or greater melanoma, and met current National Comprehensive
      Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for sentinel node biopsy. All subjects had injection of
      tech99 and lymphangiography prior to surgery, and injection of indocyanine green (ICG) and
      methylene blue dye (MB) in the operating room. We utilized methylene blue dye for all
      subjects due to poor availability of isosulfan blue for a period of time, and to maintain
      consistency in the trial. Up to 1ml of MB was injected, and 0.9ml ICG (2.5 mg/ml). The ICG
      and MB were injected into the dermis separately, after induction of anesthesia and prior to
      prepping the patient.

      Each lymph node basin was examined with the gamma probe and imaged with the SPY Elite
      (Novadaq) prior to making skin incision, with assessment of the visibility of ICG through the
      skin (yes or no). Once incision was made, the basin was periodically imaged with SPY, or
      dissection was carried out with real time lymphangiography until the sentinel node was
      identified. The camera of the SPY machine is positioned over the basin, with the image
      projected onto a monitor. Similar to laparoscopy, the surgeon can watch the image and operate
      at the same time. Each sentinel node was assessed for the presence of each dye. A lymph node
      with any one of the dyes present was considered a sentinel node, and was resected.
      Fluorescence and blue dye were measured as yes or no, and not quantitated. Additional data
      collected includes demographic data, the dose of ICG and MB given, adverse effects from any
      dye, the total number of sentinel nodes identified and the number of malignant sentinel
      nodes. Pair-wise comparisons were made between the three dyes regarding the number of
      detected sentinel nodes, and the number of detected metastatic nodes.

    <description>The primary outcome measure is the accuracy of indocyanine green (ICG) and real time lymphangiography to identify sentinel nodes (SLN) in patients with melanoma, compared to tech99 and methylene blue. Tech99 is considered the standard, for comparison. Accuracy is being determined by the number of sentinel nodes that are identified with ICG, compared to tech99 or methylene blue.</description>

             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is
             participating in this study, the patient should inform the treating physician
             immediately.

        <title>Equivalence of ICG and Real Time Lymphangiography to technetium99 and Blue Dye in Localizing Sentinel Nodes</title>
        <description>The primary outcome measure is the accuracy of indocyanine green (ICG) and real time lymphangiography to identify sentinel nodes (SLN) in patients with melanoma, compared to tech99 and methylene blue. Tech99 is considered the standard, for comparison. Accuracy is being determined by the number of sentinel nodes that are identified with ICG, compared to tech99 or methylene blue.</description>

            <description>Single arm study, each subject receives 0.9ml ICG, methylene blue and technetium 99.
Indocyanine green: Subjects receive 0.9ml of ICG subcutaneously about the primary melanoma. The ICG has an infrared signal that is detected with the SPY Elite system (Lifecell). The ICG travels through the lymphatics to the sentinel node.
Technetium99: Technetium99 is a standard, widely used radiopharmaceutical that is injected subcutaneoulsy about the primary melanoma site. Lymphoscintigraphy is performed to identify the draining nodal basin, and a gamma probe is used in the operating room to track the radioactive signal and find the sentinel node.
Methylene blue: Subjects receive 0.5-2ml of methylene blue subcutaneously about the primary melanoma at the time of surgery. The sentinel node should turn blue, which is visible with the naked eye.</description>
