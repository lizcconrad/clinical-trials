  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy in which the main risk factor is intraocular pressure (IOP).
      The search for other variables involved in glaucoma pathogenesis and progression has
      identified both systemic and ocular signs of vascular dysfunction in glaucoma patients, such
      as migraine, peripheral vasospasm, systemic hypotension and cerebral microvascular ischemia.
      Ocular blood flow studies using Color Doppler Imaging (CDI) technology has demonstrated blood
      velocities and increased vascular resistance (RI) to exist in such patients when compared to
      healthy controls. However, a CDI examination provides far more additional information, such
      as arterial pulsatility (PI) and mean blood velocities (MFV). While these have been used for
      decades now to study cerebral arteries vasoreactivity, little is known about how these
      variables are changed in glaucoma patients. We have recently demonstrated that these
      variables can be used to identify a change in the normal vascular activity when there is
      increased resistance. In glaucoma patients, a cutpoint in RI of the retrobulbar arteries
      could be determined beyond which PI increased significantly. This sharp increase in the PI
      has been used as an indirect signal that the vessel's ability to buffer a decreased perfusion
      pressure has been surpassed. The normal response to a decreased perfusion in a vascular
      territory with autoregulation is an increase in dilation in the downstream microcirculation,
      increasing cross section area in an attempt to keep a steady MFV. As PI is calculated using
      the vessel's MFV [PI = (PSV-EDV)/MFV], it is highly sensitive to changes in this variable. As
      such, the cutpoints we have identified in glaucoma patients are therefore an indirect
      assessment of the vessel's autoregulation limit.

      While our data could provide the rational as to why these RI values are associated with
      progression, the clinical question arises as to whether these cutpoints can be modulated by
      topical glaucoma therapy. As some medications such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors have been
      found to have a positive effect in disease progression in what appears to be a non-IOP
      related effect, we considered the hypothesis that these drugs could have a positive impact on
      the ocular's microcirculation vasoactive response, potentially enabling to keep a steady MFV
      into higher values of vascular resistance.

      Patients will be recruited from the glaucoma clinic at the department of Ophthalmology in the
      Leuven University Hospital.

      General study setup:

      Two cohorts of subjects will be included in the study: primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and
      normal tension glaucoma (NTG) patients. At the screening visit, eligible patients will have
      their topical therapy replaced by timolol 0.5% bid. At week 4, dorzolamide 2% will be added
      to the existing treatment in a fixed combination therapy (timolol 0.5%+dorzolamide 2% bid). A
      final visit at week 8.

      At the screening visit (day 0), the patients will undergo a complete ophthalmic investigation
      with visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy, tonometry, 90 D fundoscopy, automated perimetry,
      Heidelberg retinal tomography and color Doppler imaging. Blood pressure will also be
      measured. Topical monotherapy will be replaced by timolol 0.5% bid.

      At visit 1 and 2 (timolol - week 4, timolol+dorzolamide week 8, respectively), the patients
      will undergo ophthalmic investigation with visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy, tonometry,
      90 D fundoscopy, blood pressure measurement and color Doppler imaging.

      Only one eye will be selected for the study (eye with worst glaucomatous damage).
      Mann-Whitney test will be used in pairwise comparisons. Restricted cubic sp-lines will be
      used to verify if there is any evidence for nonlinearity in the relation between the RI and
      PI. Piecewise linear regression models will be used to determine the optimal cutpoint (i.e.
      the cutpoint yielding the highest likelihood) in all three visits (baseline, timolol and
      timolol/dorzolamide). Sensitivity analyses will be performed to verify if the result is not
      due to an (influential) subject with a high RI value. All data will be expressed in mean ±
      standard deviation. A two sided p-value &lt;0.05 is considered significant.

      Sample size calculations were made to address the primary outcome (i.e., a change in the RI
      cutpoints between baseline and last study visit) in the overall glaucoma population (POAG+NTG
      patients). Based on our previous results10, setting an α error to 5%, power at 80% and the
      allowable difference at 10% would require the recruitment of 40 patients. Further post hoc
      analysis will be made to identify differences between the two study cohorts.
