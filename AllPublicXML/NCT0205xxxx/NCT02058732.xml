      Study the cervical spinal cord and brain over time to assess changes and differences in
      subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

      Investigators will study cervical spinal cord chemical concentrations and cervical spinal
      cord and brain microstructure in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS) patients who have had a
      stem cell transplant compared to ALS patients who have not had a stem cell transplant.
      Investigators intend to determine cervical spinal cord chemical concentrations and cervical
      spinal cord and brain microstructure in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS) patients who have
      had a stem cell transplant and compare these to corresponding measures in amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis(ALS) patients who have not had a stem cell transplant.

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>1. The longitudinal changes in spinal cord metabolites in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS) stem cell treated patients will be compared to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS) non-treated patients using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Investigators hypothesize that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS) stem cell treated patients will demonstrate attenuated rates of decline in the levels of N-acetylaspartate(NAA), a measure of neuronal integrity, in the cervical spinal cord than amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS) non-treated patients.</description>

    <description>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS)subjects, who will be receiving stem cells, will undergo a brief clinical evaluation and questionnaire that will last approximately 20 to 30 min. Subjects will be asked to undergo magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)scans of the cervical spine and brain that will last approximately 60 minutes.</description>

    <description>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS)patient who will not be receiving stem cells, will have an MRI that lasts approximately 60 minutes. This MRI will be repeated at three different time points. Subjects will have an initial MRI, then another at both 6 and 12 months after the initial magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)scan. Subjects will also complete a clinical examination which will take approximately 30 minutes for each MRI. The follow-up magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)scans done for ALS patients who do not receive stem cells are part of routine clinical studies and therefore subjects will not be billed.</description>

    <description>Subjects will have an MRI that lasts approximately 60 minutes at the same time points as during the stem cell study schedule; once before the stem cell surgery, and again at 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months after receiving stem cells. This magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)scan will be of the cervical spine and brain.</description>
