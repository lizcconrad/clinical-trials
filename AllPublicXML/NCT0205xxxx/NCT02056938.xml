  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the following randomized open label trial is to demonstrate how low
      immunological risk patients (no anti HLA immunization and first kidney transplantation) but
      diagnosed at high-risk of delayed graft function (assessed by DGFS score) could benefit from
      induction with ATG for preventing delayed graft function compared to Basiliximab.

    <description>The first infusion of Thymoglobuline® begins before the kidney reperfusion. In case of a patient with a functional arteriovenous fistula or a high-flow venous catheter, the infusion of Thymoglobuline® can begin just after the randomization pre operatively. When the patient has no available arteriovenous fistula for the Thymoglobuline® infusion, it is necessary to install a high-flow vein (central vein) by the anesthesiologist, and to begin the perfusion as soon as possible intra-operatively before the reperfusion of the kidney. The dose of Thymoglobuline® per infusion is 1.5mg/kg. The duration of each infusion is between 6 to 24 hours.
The total duration of the Thymoglobuline® administration is 4 days (starting at and including the first day of the surgery).</description>

    <description>The first infusion of Simulect® begins within the two hours before the surgery. There is no need of central venous catheter or arteriovenous fistula to infuse the Simulect®. The duration of the infusion is 30 minutes. Each dose of Simulect® is 20 mg. The first infusion of Simulect® is displayed on Day 0 (within the two hours before the surgery) and the second infusion 3 days afterward (Day 4).</description>
