      This is a study to evaluate the effectiveness of using an established intervention for
      depressive symptom management in conjunction with a needs-based caregiver intervention for
      improving the psychological and physical health of family caregivers of persons recently
      diagnosed with a Primary Malignant Brain Tumor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have designed a needs-based intervention to improve neuro-oncology caregivers' health. Our
      novel approach treats depressive symptoms prior to implementing a needs-based intervention in
      a sample of PMBT family caregivers who score above threshold on depressive symptoms. Study
      outcomes are psychological responses (unmet needs, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and burden)
      and physical responses (levels of stimulated and circulating IL-6 and IL-1β, C-reactive
      protein, peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells, physical symptoms, and new diagnoses or
      exacerbations of co-morbid conditions). The proposed study addresses research priorities set
      by both NCI and NINR to improve the quality of life of patients and their families and NINR's
      emphasis on integrating bio-behavioral science and adopting, adapting and generating new
      technologies.

      Primary aims:

        1. Compare the efficacy of a) an intervention for depressive symptoms (Beating the Blues)
           delivered prior to a needs-based caregiver intervention (SmartCare©) versus b)
           SmartCare© alone versus c) enhanced care as usual (CAU+) in improving caregivers'
           psychological and physical responses.

           H1: At 4- and 6-months, caregivers who receive Beating the Blues prior to SmartCare©
           will display improved psychological and physical responses compared to caregivers who
           receive CAU+.

           H2: At 4- and 6-months, caregivers who receive SmartCare© alone will display improved
           psychological and physical responses compared to caregivers who receive CAU+.

           H3: At 4- and 6-months, caregivers who receive Beating the Blues prior to SmartCare©
           will display improved psychological and physical responses compared to those who receive
           SmartCare© alone.

        2. Compare the efficacy of Beating the Blues versus CAU+ in improving subjects' short-term
           psychological and physical responses.

      H1: At 2-months following baseline, caregivers who receive Beating the Blues will display
      improved psychological and physical responses compared to CAU+.

      Exploratory aims:

        1. Determine whether any changes in psychological and physical health resulting from
           receiving Beating the Blues prior to SmartCare© or SmartCare© alone are maintained at
           10-months after baseline.

        2. Evaluate whether the effect of Beating the Blues + SmartCare© (vs. SmartCare© alone) on
           4- and 6-month psychological and physical responses is mediated by 0- to 2-month changes
           in depressive symptoms.
