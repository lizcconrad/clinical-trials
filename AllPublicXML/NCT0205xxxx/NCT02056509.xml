    <textblock>
      Airway management and maintaining adequate ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation
      (CPR) are important. The rule of 30:2 compression-to-ventilation ratios before endotracheal
      intubation and keeping 1 breath every 6-8 seconds with advanced airway are generally accepted
      according to 2010 Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guideline. This recommendation
      emphasizes on the timing and frequency of ventilation during CPR. However, poor clinical
      evidence had been established concerning adequate volume, airway flow and pressure in each
      cycle.

      There are increasing evidence that hyperventilation during resuscitation reduces pulmonary
      venous return and, therefore, compromises cardiac output and circulation. Another research
      reported that using high flow oxygen mask alone during basic life support (BLS) results in
      better survival rate and overall outcome compared with conventional positive pressure
      ventilation.

      Our study applies flowmeter to measure ventilation parameters as frequency, duration, exhaled
      volume and airway pressure on intubated patients who received artificial ventilation during
      CPR. The parameters will correlate with information from accelerometry and capnometry
      simultaneously during resuscitation. . Investigators also focus on the influence of chest
      compression, which increases intra-thoracic pressure considerably. This effect may act
      against positive pressure ventilation and probably minimize the efficiency in each
      ventilation or circulation..

      Details about how to ventilate one patient during CPR include right timing, duration,
      adequate volume and coordination are in debate. Unfortunately, current practice based on
      clinical guidelines emphasizes little on this issue. Investigators are committed to refine
      contemporary practices and hopefully improve qualities of resuscitation.

      Investigators proposed the hypothesis that coordinate chest compression and ventilation may
      minimize the increasement of airway pressure and improve the effect of circulation
