  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) has been based on systemic outcome measures, however, little is known about the
      effectiveness of this intervention on patients' lung function. The forced expiratory volume
      in one second (FEV1), despite of being the gold standard for assessing lung function in COPD,
      is poorly responsive to pulmonary rehabilitation. Thus, an objective and responsive outcome
      measure to assess the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on lung function is needed.

      Computerized respiratory sounds have been found to be a more sensitive indicator, detecting
      and characterizing the severity of respiratory diseases before any other measure, however its
      potential to detect changes after pulmonary rehabilitation has never been explored.
      Therefore, this study aims to assess the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation on the
      characteristics of computerized respiratory sounds in patients with COPD.

      A randomized controlled study with one group undergoing pulmonary rehabilitation (n=25) and
      other group receiving standard care (n=25) will be conducted. The pulmonary rehabilitation
      program will included exercise training (3*week) and psychoeducation (1*week).

      Computerized respiratory sounds, lung function, exercise capacity, quadriceps muscle
      strength, health-related quality of life and health services use will be assessed in both
      groups, at baseline, immediately post-intervention and at follow-ups (3 and 6 months after
      PR).

      Descriptive and inferential statistics will be used.

      It is expected that significant changes occur on the characteristics of computerized
      respiratory sounds in patients enrolled in the pulmonary rehabilitation group, in comparison
      with patients receiving standard care. Thus, computerized respiratory sounds could provide a
      simple, objective and non-invasive measure to assess lung function changes after pulmonary
      rehabilitation.
