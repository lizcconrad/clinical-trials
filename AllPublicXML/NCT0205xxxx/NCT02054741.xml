      This cluster randomized clinical trial compares a geriatric assessment intervention with
      usual care for reducing cancer treatment toxicity in older patients with cancer that has
      spread to other places in the body. A geriatric assessment may identify risk factors for
      cancer treatment toxicity and may improve outcomes for older patients with advanced cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if providing information regarding geriatric assessment (GA) and GA-driven
      recommendations to oncology physicians reduces clinician-rated grade 3-5 toxicity in patients
      aged 70 and over with advanced cancer starting a new treatment regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Proportion of patients who are alive at 6 months after study entry. II. Evaluate whether
      providing oncology physicians with information regarding GA summary and GA-driven
      recommendations influences clinical care of older patients receiving treatment for advanced
      cancer.

      IIA. Compare treatment decisions (as measured by relative dose intensity of the agents
      administered in the first cycle).

      IIB. Compare the number and type of GA-driven recommendations implemented for older patients
      starting a new treatment regimen for advanced cancer.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether providing oncology physicians with GA information and GA-driven
      recommendations can slow functional and physical decline in older patients with advanced
      cancer.

      II. To examine the association between patient-reported symptoms (as measured by
      Patient-Reported Outcomes [PRO]-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]) and
      geriatric domains (as measured by geriatric assessment).

      III. To compare PRO-CTCAE and physician-rated CTCAE in a sample of older patients receiving
      chemotherapy or other agents with similar prevalence of toxicity.

      IV. To examine the association between PRO-CTCAE and treatment decisions. V. To examine the
      association between PRO-CTCAE and adverse outcomes (early discontinuation of chemotherapy or
      other agents with similar prevalence of toxicity, hospitalizations, and mortality).

      OUTLINE: Treatment sites are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (GA intervention): Patients complete a geriatric assessment. Patients and physicians
      are provided with the geriatric assessment information and recommendations.

      ARM II (usual care): Patients complete a geriatric assessment, but information other than
      clinically significant cognitive impairment and depression is not provided to the oncology
      teams.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, at 3 and 6 months, and at 1
      year.

    <description>A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) methodology will be used.

    <description>The effect of the intervention on decisional regret for both patient and physician will be compared using four linear mixed models (regret). For each model, Arm will be the fixed effect and NCORP will be a random effect (independent of residual error). Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) estimation will be used, and inference will be performed using the Kenward-Roger degrees of freedom adjustment procedure. The effect of the intervention on relative dose intensity (RDI) of treatment will be analyzed in the same manner. In this model, RDI will be the response.</description>

             similar prevalence of toxicity; patients who will receive monoclonal antibody therapy
             or other cancer therapies (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors) are eligible if other
             agents present a prevalence of toxicity similar to chemotherapy; patients who are
             receiving approved cancer treatment in combination with radiation are eligible; a
             patient may also be enrolled on a treatment trial and participate in this study, if
             all other inclusion and exclusion criteria are met. *Chemotherapy is defined as
             cytotoxic drugs; in addition, agents (e.g., monoclonal antibodies and targeted agents)
             that have a prevalence of grade 3-5 toxicity in older patients similar to chemotherapy
             (&gt;50%) will be allowed.

          -  Plan to be on chemotherapy or other allowable treatment for at least 3 months (minimum

             to not have decision-making capacity, a patient-designated health care proxy (or
             authorized representative per institutional policies) must sign consent by the
             baseline visit. If the participant is found to be impaired on the Blessed-Orientation
             Memory Concentration Test (BOMC) during screening; they must have a health care proxy
             or authorized representative to be eligible to enroll.
