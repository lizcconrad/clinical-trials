  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the literature, the effects of acute oxygen administration on exercise tolerance and
      related symptoms have often appeared to be contradictory. Some investigations have reported
      benefits from acute oxygen supply during exertion, including increased exercise performance,
      reduced dyspnea, and better cardiorespiratory adaptations, whereas other studies have
      reported no improvement. Recently, we advanced then the hypothesis that some patients would
      be non-responders and even worsen under oxygen treatment. The preliminary results confirmed
      our hypothesis since we demonstrated that while 56% of the patients were improved with
      supplemental oxygen, 16% were non-responders and 28% were negative-responders (decreased
      performance and increased dyspnea during endurance exercise with supplemental oxygen).
      However, this was a pilot study offering preliminary insights and tentative conclusions that
      must be confirmed in a larger case series.

      The aims of this retrospective study was :

        1. To confirm on cohorte and with clinical test (the 6-minute walking test - 6WT) the
           deleterious responses to acute oxygen supplementation in LTOT (long terme oxygenotherapy
           treatment) and non-LTOT patients who exhibit exercise desaturation.

        2. To identify the predictive factors among the clinical data (i.e., anthropometric,
           spirometric and gazometric data) and/or functional data recorded during rehabilitation
           program

      During this study, a retrospective data collection will be carried out using the informations
      contained in the medical folders of patients admitted in our centers for pulmonary
      rehabiliation program.

      We will select patients who meet the following criteria:

      A) patients having two 6WT early in their program B) who desaturate (SpO2 &lt;90% for 3
      consecutive min) during the first 6WT and who will have been properly corrected with a supply
      of oxygen during the second walk test.

      The analyzed parameters will be distance and dyspnea during the tests
