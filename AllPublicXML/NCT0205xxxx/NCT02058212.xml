    <textblock>
      ROS plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of many reproductive processes. High
      follicular fluid ROS levels are associated with negative IVF outcomes.

      is plasma level of reactive oxygen species is affected by antioxidant treatment in
      endometriotic women?

      Study design, size, duration: : prospective randomized controlled clinical trial 50 patients
      with endometriosis diagnosed by US prepared for ICSI were enrolled in the study after
      consent. they were randomized into 2 groups 25 received antioxidants before starting the
      protocol , 25 did not receive . randomization was done by closed envelop single blind for
      patient Participants/materials, setting, methods: was done in the Egyptian centre for IVF
      from March 2013 to October 2013 . 50 patients with endometriosis diagnosed by US prepared for
      ICSI were enrolled in the study after consent. they were randomized into 2 groups 25 received
      antioxidants before starting the protocol , 25 did not receive . all patients were subjected
      to plasma sample before start long protocol for induction and second on day of ovum pick up .
      embryo transfer was done according to embryo grading .
