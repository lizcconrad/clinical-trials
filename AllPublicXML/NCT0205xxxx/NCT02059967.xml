  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of image-guided adaptive radiation
      therapy using active breathing control when given together with chemotherapy and simultaneous
      integrated boost in treating patients with stage IIA-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer that
      cannot be removed by surgery. Image-guided adaptive radiation therapy aims radiation therapy
      right at the tumor so that higher radiation doses can be given without causing bad side
      effects. Giving these higher doses may help control the tumor better. Breathing causes organs
      and tissues, including the tumor, to move within the chest. Active breathing control may
      reduce the volume that needs to be treated. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel
      and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving image-guided adaptive radiation therapy
      using active breathing control with chemotherapy and simultaneous integrated boost may be an
      effective treatment for non-small cell lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of IGART.

      Patients undergo IGART using active breathing control (ABC) 5 days a week for 7 weeks, for a
      total of 33 fractions with simultaneous integrated volume adapted boost (SIVAB) during
      fractions 26-33. Patients also receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes once a week for 6 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.
