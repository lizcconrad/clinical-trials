  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than two-thirds of US adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have uncontrolled
      hypertension. Both hypertension and CKD are major independent risk factors for cardiovascular
      disease, which is the leading cause of death in the US. Fortunately, lowering blood pressure
      to recommended treatment targets not only slows the progression of CKD, but also improves
      cardiovascular outcomes. Controlling hypertension in this patient population, however, can be
      quite challenging. A lifestyle modification that effectively reduces blood pressure in both
      pre-hypertensive and hypertensive adults is the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
      (DASH) diet.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to (1) determine the extent to which the DASH diet lowers
      blood pressure in hypertensive adults with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) (estimated
      glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 30-59 ml/min/1.73m2) and (2) establish that the DASH diet
      can be safely consumed by this patient population.

      During a 7-day run-in phase, participants will first consume a control diet similar in
      nutrient composition to the control diet of previous DASH studies. The control diet, which is
      a diet typical of most Americans, is reduced in servings of fruits, vegetables, low fat dairy
      products and relatively high in total and saturated fat. Immediately following the run-in
      phase, participants will receive the DASH diet during a 14-day intervention phase. Both diets
      will have the same sodium content and caloric intake will be adjusted for each participant to
      keep weight stable. All study meals and snacks will be provided.

Participants will consume the largest meal of the day in a supervised setting at the study center and all other meals and snacks will be provided in &quot;to-go&quot; packages. Weight will be held constant by measuring participant weight daily and adjusting caloric content of meals. Adherence will be monitor by review of daily food diaries.</description>
