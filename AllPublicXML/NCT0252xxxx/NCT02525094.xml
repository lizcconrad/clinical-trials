  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of MEDI9929 administered subcutaneously to adult subjects with moderate
      to severe Atopic Dermatitis. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion and will be
      stratified at screening. Approximately 100 subjects are planned to be randomized at
      approximately 35 sites in 6 countries

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Greater Than or Equal to (&gt;=) 50 Percent (%) Reduction From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI 50) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The eczema area and severity index (EASI) evaluates 4 natural anatomical regions for severity (0 [none] to 3 [severe]) and extent of key disease signs and focuses on the key acute and chronic signs of inflammation (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification). The total score is the sum of the four body-region scores, maximum=72, minimum=0. The higher values indicating more severe disease. The EASI50 responder defined as a participant who achieved at least 50% reduction in EASI score from baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator's global assessment (IGA) allows investigators to assess overall disease severity at one given time point and consists of a 5-point severity scale from clear to severe disease (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, and 4 = severe disease). A participant has IGA response if they achieve a score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and at least a 2-grade reduction from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The scoring of atopic dermatitis (SCORAD) is a clinical tool for assessing the severity (that is, extent, intensity) of atopic dermatitis (AD). The tool evaluates the extent and intensity of the AD lesions, along with participant symptoms. The range of the SCORAD is 0-103, where 0 indicates no eczema. The higher values indicating more severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Average Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Pruritus is assessed using an Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) (0 - 10) with 0= no itch and 10= worst imaginable itch. Daily pruritus assessments were summarized as weekly peak score and a change from baseline in weekly peak score was calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in 5-D Pruritus Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-D pruritus scale is a brief questionnaire designed to assess itch. This scale takes into account the multidimensional nature of pruritus, its impact on quality of life, and is capable of detecting change over time. The 5-D pruritus scale included 5 domains (duration, degree, direction, disability, and distribution of pruritus). The total 5-D score was obtained by scoring each of the domains separately and then summing them together. 5-D total scores ranged between 5 (no pruritus) and 25 (most severe pruritus). The higher values indicating more severe pruritus.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From treatment administration (Day1) to 22 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse event is any unfavourable and unintended signs (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptoms, or diseases temporally associated with use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to investigational product. Serious adverse event is any AE that resulted in:death;inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;persistent or significant disability or incapacity;is life-threatening;is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in offspring of a study participant;or was an important medical event that may not have resulted in death, threatened life,or required hospitalization and that, based on appropriate medical judgment, may have jeopardized participant and may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of outcomes above. TEAEs are defined as AEs present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug, or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug until Week 22.</description>

The total score is the sum of the four body-region scores, maximum=72, minimum=0. The higher values indicating more severe disease. The EASI50 responder defined as a participant who achieved at least 50% reduction in EASI score from baseline.</description>

        <description>The SCORAD is a clinical tool for assessing the severity (that is, extent, intensity) of atopic dermatitis (AD). The tool evaluates the extent and intensity of the AD lesions, along with participant symptoms. The range of the SCORAD is 0-103, where 0 indicates no eczema. The higher values indicating more severe disease. The SCORAD 50 responder defined as a participant who achieves at least a 50% reduction in SCORAD score from baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in 5-D Pruritus Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The 5-D pruritus scale is a brief questionnaire designed to assess itch. This scale takes into account the multidimensional nature of pruritus, its impact on quality of life, and is capable of detecting change over time. The 5-D pruritus scale included 5 domains (duration, degree, direction, disability, and distribution of pruritus). The total 5-D score was obtained by scoring each of the domains separately and then summing them together. 5-D total scores ranged between 5 (no pruritus) and 25 (most severe pruritus). The higher values indicating more severe pruritus.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs)</title>
        <description>An Adverse event is any unfavourable and unintended signs (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptoms, or diseases temporally associated with use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to investigational product. Serious adverse event is any AE that resulted in:death;inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;persistent or significant disability or incapacity;is life-threatening;is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in offspring of a study participant;or was an important medical event that may not have resulted in death, threatened life,or required hospitalization and that, based on appropriate medical judgment, may have jeopardized participant and may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of outcomes above. TEAEs are defined as AEs present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug, or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug until Week 22.</description>
        <time_frame>From treatment administration (Day1) to 22 weeks</time_frame>

          <description>An Adverse event is any unfavourable and unintended signs (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptoms, or diseases temporally associated with use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to investigational product. Serious adverse event is any AE that resulted in:death;inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;persistent or significant disability or incapacity;is life-threatening;is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in offspring of a study participant;or was an important medical event that may not have resulted in death, threatened life,or required hospitalization and that, based on appropriate medical judgment, may have jeopardized participant and may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of outcomes above. TEAEs are defined as AEs present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug, or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug until Week 22.</description>
