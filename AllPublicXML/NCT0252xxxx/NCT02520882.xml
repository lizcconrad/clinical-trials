    <textblock>
      This is an open-label positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) study to
      investigate the diagnostic performance and evaluation efficacy of 68Ga-NOTA-Aca-BBN(7-14) in
      glioma patients. A single dose of 111-148 Mega-Becquerel (MBq) 68Ga-NOTA-Aca-BBN(7-14) will
      be injected intravenously. Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the
      PET/CT images.

    <textblock>
      Non-invasive imaging evaluation of GRPR expression would be of great help in drug
      development, patient stratification and therapeutic response monitoring. Various GRPR
      targeting imaging probes have been develop to meet the purpose. Bombesin (BBN) is an
      amphibian homolog of mammalian gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). BBN(7-14), with the amino
      acid sequence of Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2, has been extensively used for the
      development of molecular probes for the imaging of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR),
      after being labeled with various radionuclides. Multiple preclinical studies have
      demonstrated receptor-specific accumulation of the tracers in GRPR positive tumors. For
      interests in clinical translation of 68Ga-NOTA-Aca-BBN(7-14), an open-label dynamic
      whole-body PET/ CT study was designed to investigate the safety and diagnostic performance of
      68Ga-NOTA-Aca-BBN(7-14) in patients with glioma.
