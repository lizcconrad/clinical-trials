  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to build a device that will consistently ablate (destroy or
      remove) cavitary breast tissue after a formal breast cancer resection in order to mimic the
      tissue that is now irradiated after breast cancer lumpectomy. The device would be easier to
      handle, perform the ablation in less time and by so ablating this margin would avoid the need
      in many for reoperation to obtain negative margins and based on preliminary data avoid the
      need for radiation. This would be especially important in poor and rural patients and would
      lead to decreased costs of treatment in patients with favorable breast cancer.

    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Ablation depth is the extent to which tissue has been completely desiccated from the wall of the cavity. It will be assessed by pathologic analysis using H&amp;, PCNA, and Ki67 stains. The ablation depth of each slide processed is to be the smallest distance of completely necrotic tissue.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          -  Receiving bi-lateral mastectomy due to tumor in the breast, or by choice (prophylactic
             mastectomy). Only non-cancerous breast tissue will be included in the study.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those determined by the study investigator to have mental, physical, or medical
             conditions that would indicate that they should not participate.

          -  Because there is no patient contact with the device no medical contraindications are
             foreseen.
