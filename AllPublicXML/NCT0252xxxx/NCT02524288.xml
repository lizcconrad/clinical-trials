  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the contraceptive efficacy of the Etonogestrel (ENG) +
      17β-Estradiol (E2) vaginal ring in women between 18 and 35 years of age based on the number
      of in-treatment pregnancies as expressed by the Pearl Index (PI). The study will also assess
      the safety and tolerability of the ENG-E2 vaginal ring.

    This study was terminated by the Sponsor due to a business decision to discontinue product
    development for reasons unrelated to safety or efficacy outcomes.

    <measure>Number of In-Treatment Pregnancies Per 100 Woman-Years of Exposure in Participants 18-35 Years of Age (Pearl Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year (13 28-day cycles)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pearl Index is the number of in-treatment pregnancies with a conception date in any of the in-treatment cycles, divided by all treatment cycles in each participant from the first treatment cycle to the last treatment cycle (due either to discontinuation or completion), regardless of whether a treatment cycle was &quot;at risk&quot; or not. One woman-year is defined as 13 treatment cycles x 28 days. These efficacy results should be interpreted with caution. Due to the discontinuation of product development and early trial termination, the number of &quot;at risk&quot; treatment cycles in the denominator is based on uncleaned diary data.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With One or More Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From insertion of the first vaginal ring up to and including 14 days after removal of the last vaginal ring (up to approximately 1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an AE.</description>

        <title>Number of In-Treatment Pregnancies Per 100 Woman-Years of Exposure in Participants 18-35 Years of Age (Pearl Index)</title>
        <description>The Pearl Index is the number of in-treatment pregnancies with a conception date in any of the in-treatment cycles, divided by all treatment cycles in each participant from the first treatment cycle to the last treatment cycle (due either to discontinuation or completion), regardless of whether a treatment cycle was “at risk” or not. One woman-year is defined as 13 treatment cycles x 28 days. These efficacy results should be interpreted with caution. Due to the discontinuation of product development and early trial termination, the number of “at risk” treatment cycles in the denominator is based on uncleaned diary data.</description>

        <population>All participants assigned to treatment who inserted at least 1 ENG-E2 ring, and who had at least 1 “at risk” treatment cycle, or participants with a treatment cycle (at risk or not) in which a pregnancy had occurred (i.e., treatment cycle containing an estimated conception date for a pregnancy).</population>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor’s product, is also an AE.</description>
