      This Phase 3 pivotal efficacy trial will examine the effects of HLD200 (methylphenidate) in
      patients aged 6-12 years with ADHD in a naturalistic setting. Following a screening/washout
      period (Visit 1), subjects will randomized to double-blind placebo or HLD200 for a period of
      3 weeks (Visits 2-5) before assessing clinical study endpoints at last study visit.

    <measure>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale Based on DSM-IV Criteria (ADHD-RS-IV) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Last week of 3-week treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The ADHD-RS-IV was developed to measure the behaviors of children with ADHD. It consists of 18 items designed to reflect current symptomatology of ADHD based on DSM-IV criteria and was completed by the clinician. This measure served as the primary endpoint measure.</description>

    <measure>Before School Functioning Questionnaire (BSFQ) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Final week of a 3-week treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The BSFQ was developed as a hybrid measure to assess commonly reported areas of morning dysfunction—both behaviors and functions associated with the post-waking, early morning period—in children and adolescents with ADHD. This 20-item questionnaire was completed by the clinician and served as a key secondary endpoint measure.</description>

    <measure>Parent Rating Of Evening And Morning Behavior - Revised</measure>
    <time_frame>Final week (last two school days) of a 3-week treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a clinician-rating of at-home morning and evening functioning, based on interview of parent and child. Both morning (PREMB-R AM) and evening (PREMB-R PM) sub-scales served as key secondary endpoint measures.</description>

             clinical response to MPH.

          6. Parental or legal guardian confirmation of the child's before-school functional
             impairment and/or difficulties performing a morning routine of at least 30 minutes

          8. Subject must be considered clinically appropriate for treatment with MPH and HLD200,
             including ability to swallow treatment capsules.

          9. Subject must be in general good health based upon the medical history, physical, and
             laboratory examinations (including urine drug screen).

         10. Subject and parent or legal guardian must be able to read, write, and/or understand at
             a level sufficient to provide informed consent (parent/legal guardian) and assent
             (subject) prior to study participation and to complete study-related materials.
             Subject and parent or legal guardian must plan to be available for the entire study
             period.

         11. Female subjects of childbearing potential (i.e., post-menarche) are required to have a
             negative result on urine pregnancy testing at screening (and will be given specific
             instructions for avoiding pregnancy during the study).

             jeopardize subject safety, or may interfere with the satisfactory completion of the
             study and study-related procedures.

          2. Serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm
             abnormalities, or other cardiac problems that may place the subject at increased

             study-related procedures.

          5. Active suicidal ideation as evidenced by an ideation score of 2 or greater on the

          9. Use of prescription medications (except per protocol allowed medications) within 7
             days of Baseline (Visit 2), except for ADHD stimulant medication (72 hours) and
             monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (14 days), and over-the-counter medications
             (except birth control and allowed medications) within the 3 days preceding Baseline
             (Visit 2). Medications not covered in allowed medications or prohibited medications
             must be cleared by the medical monitor prior to enrolling the subject.

         13. Positive screening for illicit drug use or nicotine and/or current health conditions

             the subject.

         14. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject may have problems complying with the
             protocol or the procedures of the protocol, or for which the study could pose
             unnecessary safety risks. This includes current health conditions or use of
             medications that might confound the results of the study or increase risk to the
             subject.
