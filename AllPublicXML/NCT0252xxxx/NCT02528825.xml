  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smooth emergence is important for patient safety and satisfaction. Coughing during emergence
      is associated with detrimental effects like laryngospasm, sore throat, hoarseness, negative
      pressure pulmonary edema and bleeding at surgical site 1. Especially sore throat and
      hoarseness are most common complications after extubation 2,3 and closely related to patient
      satisfaction 4. Using double lumen tube (DLT) increase the incidence of hoarseness and airway
      injury than using single lumen tube for it has large size5,6. Various technique and drugs
      have been proposed for reducing coughing during extubation including smooth emergence 1,7-11
      and this is closely correlate with reducing sore throat and hoarseness 12. One of the
      proposed technique, the use of short acting opioids are prefered13-15 because it can be
      maintained during emergence with less respiratory depression. Remifentanil is a potent short
      acting opioid and several studies choose remifentanil combined with other anesthetic agents
      1,15,16. There is a study about the EC50 and EC95 of remifentanil in effect site Target
      controlled infusion(TCI) for preventing cough during emergence after thyroidectomy with
      propofol-remifentanil anesthesia 15 but no study about the proper dose of remifentanil for
      smooth DLT extubation.

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the EC50 and EC95 of remifentanil in effect-site
      TCI for preventing cough during extubation of DLT in total TIVA with propofol and
      remifentanil.

    <description>ASA I-II, aged 19-65 years undergoing general anesthesia with DLT for lung wedge resection were enrolled in this study.After completing the surgery, the propofol infusion was stopped, and effect-site concentration of remifentanil was titrated to predetermined concentration ( initial concentration being 1.5ng/ml for the first patient).The predetermined concentration was maintained at least 10 min throughout emergence for the effect site concentration and plasma concentration can be expected stable. The smooth emergence was defined as extubation without cough-a strong and sudden contraction of the abdomen. The predetermined concentration was decreased by 0.5 ng/ml for the next patient if the patient did not cough during emergence and similarly, if the patient coughed anytime during emergence, it was considered failed smooth emergence and predetermined concentration was increased by 0.5 ng/ml.</description>
