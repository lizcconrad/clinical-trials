      The primary objective of the study is to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of BIIB061
      in the new oral formulation in the fasted state in healthy male and female volunteers. The
      secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BIIB061 in
      the new formulation in this study population.

             hepatitis C virus antibody, or hepatitis B virus (defined as positive for hepatitis B
             surface antigen [HBsAg] or hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb]).

          -  Prior exposure to BIIB061.

          -  History of any clinically significant cardiac, endrocrinologic, hematologic, hepatic,
             gastric, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary, neurologic, dermatologic,

             biologic, device, or approved therapy for investigational use is administered or used
             within 30 days prior to the study

          -  Any live or attenuated immunization/vaccination given within 30 days prior to the
