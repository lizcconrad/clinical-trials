  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will pilot and assess feasibility of a prenatal intervention for obese pregnant
      women based on the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). Intervention group participants will
      meet with a clinic dietitian for 15 minutes at every prenatal appointment to complete a
      DPP-based curriculum and receive breastfeeding education. Control group participants will
      receive usual prenatal care. Outcomes include reach and dose of the intervention, gestational
      weight gain, dietary intake, physical activity, and breastfeeding in the first 6 weeks
      postpartum.

  <detailed_description>

      This study will pilot and test feasibility of a prenatal lifestyle intervention designed to
      limit gestational weight gain and prevent gestational diabetes. The intervention is based on
      the Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle intervention, will include prenatal breastfeeding
      education and online peer group support, and will be integrated into the participants'
      regular prenatal appointments. Women (n=24) will be enrolled in early pregnancy. After
      baseline assessments (demographics, maternal diet, physical activity, mental health), women
      randomized equally to the intervention or usual care conditions. Further data collection will
      occur at approximately 24 weeks gestation, 36 weeks gestation, and 6 weeks postpartum, and
      clinical data (weight, pregnancy and obstetric complications) will be abstracted from medical
      records at the end of the study. Outcomes include reach and dose of the intervention,
      gestational weight gain, dietary intake, physical activity, and breastfeeding in the first 6
      weeks postpartum. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will reduce gestational
      weight gain, improve maternal dietary intake, increase total energy expenditure, and increase
      breastfeeding exclusivity in the first 6 weeks postpartum.

    <description>Women randomized to the intervention group will meet with a dietary counselor for 15 minutes at every prenatal appointment. They will receive a dietary and lifestyle curriculum based on the Diabetes Prevention Program curriculum (11 lessons) with one additional lesson providing prenatal breastfeeding education. They will also have access to a private online Facebook page for additional education and peer group support.</description>

    <description>Usual prenatal care consists of regular clinical appointments, pregnancy ultrasounds, and recommendations to use prenatal multivitamins, eat a balanced diet, and remain physically active. Women with a pre-pregnant body mass index &gt; 30 complete early glucose screening (as early as possible after presentation at the clinic) to detect pre-existing diabetes, and all women undergo routine gestational diabetes screening at 24-28 weeks. Women who test positive for pre-existing diabetes or gestational diabetes are referred to a registered dietitian.</description>
