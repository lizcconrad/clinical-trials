      The study will be conducted in two arms:

      In arm I, participants diagnosed with depression. In arm II, healthy participants.

      Arm I - Participants that need to start or switch their pharmacological antidepressant
      therapy will be recruited. Their clinical status will be evaluated and their EEG
      characteristics will be collected.

      Arm II - Clinical and EEG characteristics of Healthy volunteers will collected on a similar
      timetable.

    <description>EEG evaluation will be done using two off the shelf EEG devices for research and consumer use. The first one is a device called MindWave by NeuroSky ltd (http://neurosky.com) the second called EPOC by Emotiv ltd (https://emotiv.com/epoc.php).
EEG evaluation will be conducted for a total duration of 20 minutes with and without auditory stimulation. The auditory stimulation will be performed using standard headphone or earphones to reduce external noises.</description>
