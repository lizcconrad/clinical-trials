    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand if people with certain genes are predisposed to
      develop severe skin reactions after they are administered Eslicarbazepine Acetate. Currently
      there is no information that suggests that certain individuals who use Eslicarbazepine
      Acetate are predisposed to develop severe skin reactions. However, previous research has
      shown that seizure medicines like carbamazepine (Tegretol®) and oxcarbazepine (Trileptal®,
      Oxtellar XR®) are more likely to cause severe drug related skin reactions in some people of
      Asian ancestry who have specific genes. These are genes found in an area of chromosomes
      called the Major Histocompatibility Complex. This association is called a genetic risk
      factor. The study objective is to compare information that is obtained from individuals with
      a history of seizure disorders who develop severe skin reactions while using Eslicarbazepine
      Acetate to a group of patients who also have a history of seizure disorders and do not have a
      history of a severe skin reaction after using Eslicarbazepine Acetate.

      This study is a genetic case-control study conducted in the United States. In case-control
      studies, cases with a condition of interest (in this case, individuals with SCAR [severe
      cutaneous adverse reactions] after initiating ESL); and controls, individuals known to not
      have the condition of interest (in this case ESL users without SCAR), are identified. Cases
      will be individuals with documented definite or probable Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS),
      toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), drug
      reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) or symptom onset consistent with one
      of these conditions within the first 4 months of using ESL (including up to 14 days after
      discontinuing ESL), ascertained through PPD Pharmacovigilance (PVG) (Sponsor CRO). Controls
      will be individuals who have used ESL for at least 6 weeks but did not develop any SCAR and
      will be matched by genetic ancestry classification in a ratio of up to 10 controls per case.
      Controls will be collected prospectively, so that a pool of ESL-tolerant patients will be
      identified independently of the collection of cases. Controls will be selected from among:

        -  Ongoing subjects in clinical studies of ESL; and

        -  Patients prescribed ESL who may be asked to participate by neurologists at
           high-prescribing practices with high ethnic diversity.

      Blood or saliva samples for genotyping ancestry markers (for matching controls to cases) and
      sequencing the HLA regions will be collected from cases and control subjects after they have
      provided consent for participation in a genetic study. In addition, a blood sample will be
      requested from subjects to assess the relationship with specific viral markers.
