  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to investigate whether repeated administration of a
      cardiac medication (diltiazem) can affect the pharmacokinetics (i.e., amount and time of
      presence in the blood) of ACT-541468
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because ACT-541468 appears to be mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, it is deemed of interest to
      investigate the potential influence of diltiazem, a well-known CYP3A4 inhibitor on the
      pharmacokinetic profile of ACT-541468.

      Safety of the concomitant administration of the two drugs will also be assessed
