  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that preeclampsia is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic
      hypertension, nephropathy and thromboembolism. The study's aim, subsequent to these
      informations, is to help prevent those consequences. Information tools have been known to
      enhance retention of information given orally. The objective of this study is to assess the
      knowledge and satisfaction of women after an episode of preeclampsia after reading an
      explanatory pamphlet on preeclampsia. The investigators also want to change their perception
      on cardiovascular risk, their risk of recurrence and preeclampsia's medium to long-term
      consequences and the ways to prevent them.

      This is a randomised-controlled trial. Women recruted will first answer a questionnaire
      assessing demographic data, knowledge about risks in the future, perception of cardiovascular
      risk, anxiety about that risk and satisfaction about information received or collected.

      Then, women in the intervention group will receive the pamphlet. One month after, women in
      both groups will receive a questionnaire similar to the first one assessing knowledge about
      risks in the future, perception of cardiovascular risk, anxiety about that risk and
      satisfaction about information received or collected, including the pamphlet for the
      intervention group.

      The pamphlet was validated by a multidisciplany team including patients, doctors, nurses,
      education specialists and communication specialists.

      The questionnaire was also validated by the same multidisciplinary team. Section on knowledge
      and anxiety were remodeled from previously validated questionnaires Section on perception of
      cardiovascular risk was reproduced and translated with permission from its author.

      Section on satisfaction was reproduced from the investigators' previous study where it was
      validated.
