    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of staged and combined
      phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation and Descemet membrane endothelial
      keratoplasty (DMEK) to treat cataract patients with corneal endothelial dysfunction. Surgical
      and postoperative complications, visual acuity and corneal endothelial cell density are
      evaluated.

      The prospective, randomized, controlled study involves the enrollment of cataract patients
      with corneal endothelial dysfunction. All the patients will be randomly assigned with equal
      probability to the following two groups: 1. Staged group: phacoemulsification + IOL
      implantation is performed individually and DMEK is performed secondarily according to the
      corneal status of patients. During cataract surgery, viscoelastic materials and anterior lens
      capsule are used to protect the compromised corneal endothelium during phacoemulsification.
      After phacoemulsification and removal of all the lens material, a one-piece foldable IOL is
      implanted into the lens capsule. 2: Combined group: phacoemulsification + IOL implantation
      and DMEK is performed simultaneously. Standard procedures of phacoemulsification + IOL
      implantation are the same as in the staged group.

      Patients enrolled into the study will be followed for one year and will have study visits at
      1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after each surgery.
