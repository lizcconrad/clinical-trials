  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human PapillomaVirus (HPV) are ones of the main causal agents of sexually transmitted
      diseases. Numerous HPV genotypes such as 16, 18, 31 or 45 are considered to be at high risk
      of oncogenicity especially for the anal and cervical mucosa. At the present time, no
      recommendations exist on the risk related to HPV during Medically Assisted Procreation (MAP)
      procedures. The main objective of this prospective multicentric cohort study is to evaluate
      the prevalence of transmission of HPV via the semen during MAP program. Secondary objectives
      are to evaluate (1) the prevalence of HPV DNA in the sperm fractions of men enrolled in MAP,
      (2) the efficacy of spermatozoal pellet preparation procedures to eliminate HPV, (3) the
      correlation between HPV and male infertility and (4) the correlation between HPV and success
      rate of procreation. Results could contribute to revise guidelines of MAP procedures and HPV
      vaccination policy.
