  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this feasibility study is to evaluate the ability of Electrical Impedance
      Tomography (EIT) for providing regional and quantitative information about the extent and
      nature of bronchial obstruction in patients with cystic fibrosis. It is not being conducted
      to diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any kind of disease. In electrical impedance tomography
      low amplitude, low frequency current is applied on electrodes, and the resulting voltage is
      measured and used to computed the electrical properties of the interior of the chest as they
      change in time. The computed properties are used to form an image, which can then be used for
      monitoring and diagnosis.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the ability of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT)
      hardware and software in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) for providing regional and
      quantitative information for identifying regions of obstruction and consolidation, and
      determine whether these measures will correlate with improvements seen after hospitalized
      treatment for a pulmonary exacerbation (PE). In particular, EIT will be used to identify
      regions of obstruction (air trapping) and consolidation comprised of atelectasis and airway
      occlusion (consequences of mucus plugging) in CF patients, and to determine whether EIT can
      demonstrate the beneficial effects of antibiotic treatment for CF patients with an acute PE
      by correlating changes in quantitative EIT measures with clinical measures known to improve
      following therapy, with patients serving as their own controls. Regional changes in air
      trapping and consolidation from pre to post treatment as indicated by the EIT images will be
      calculated, with subjects serving as their own control.

    <description>Subjects with CF between the ages of 2 and 21 who are either clinically indicated for a CT scan of the lungs or are scheduled for a pulmonary CT scan as part of their routine care. Electrical impedance tomography data data will be collected during tidal breathing, during 5 to 10 seconds of breath holding, during forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced expiratory flow (FEF) 25-75 spirometry maneuvers for subjects over age 8, and immediately before or after pulmonary CT scanning.</description>

Electrical impedance tomography data data will be collected during tidal breathing, during 5 to 10 seconds of breath holding, during FEV1 and FEF 25-75 spirometry maneuvers upon admission for a pulmonary exacerbation and following 7 to 14 days hospitalized treatment including IV antibiotics. Further data will be collected at the same time with CT scanning if the scan is part of the patient's standard of care.</description>

        There are three groups in this study. Group 1 consists of healthy controls between the ages
        of 2 and 21. Group 2 consists of persons with cystic fibrosis between the ages of 2 and 21
        who are either clinically indicated for a pulmonary CT scan or will receive one as part of
        their routine care. Group 3 consists of persons with cystic fibrosis between the ages of 8
        and 21 who are being started on IV antibiotics for a clinically diagnosed pulmonary
        exacerbation.

        Sampling is by convenience or invitation to volunteer.
