  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Th mechanism of action of dapagliflozin is via sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2)
      inhibition. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibition is associated with moderate weight
      (fat) loss, in addition to other health benefits, including decreased blood pressure,
      decreased inflammation, and decreased oxidative stress. It is unclear as to whether these
      health benefits are due to SGLT2 inhibition per se, or as a secondary effect of weight loss.

      This is a randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind, repeated measures study.
      92 overweight/obese adults (body mas index &gt; 27.5 kg/m^2) will be recruited for participation
      and randomly assigned to one of four 12 week treatments: 1) daily oral administration of
      dapagliflozin with ad-libitum dietary intake; 2) daily oral administration of dapagliflozin
      with supplemented dietary intake to achieve weight maintenance; 3) daily oral administration
      of a placebo plus dietary restriction such that weight loss is matched to participants in
      treatment 1; or, 4) daily oral administration of a placebo with ad-libitum dietary intake.
