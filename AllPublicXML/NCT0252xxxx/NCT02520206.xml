  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a translational study on the regulation of
      S-adenosylmethionine synthesis and cellular methylation reactions during chronic
      inflammation. Development of in vitro cell models may reveal the regulatory mechanisms by
      which specific inflammatory mediators cause metabolic changes and alter DNA methylation
      status. Metabolic and pharmacological studies in the in vivo models will enable us to better
      understand the regulation of inter-organ homeostasis of S-adenosyl methionine and help
      identify tissue specific biomarkers for methylation and epigenetic modifications in different
      stage of chronic inflammation. The clinical study in human subjects will help distinguish the
      impacts of autoimmune rheumatic disease, degenerated joint disease, or specific medication
      use on significant clinical and biochemical markers in folate and vitamin B6 metabolic
      pathways.The Investigators hope the present study can identify specific clinical markers for
      potential epigenetic changes in patients suffering from chronic inflammation, which will
      contribute to better clinical management of these diseases in humans.

      The significance of epigenetic alterations in autoimmune rheumatic diseases and degenerated
      joint diseases has drawn great attention among clinicians and researchers. Aberrant
      methylation status has been demonstrated in human chronic inflammation yet more efforts have
      focused on global and sequence-specific hypomethylation and overexpression of specific genes.
      Few studies investigated the regulation of S-adenosylmethionine homeostasis and regulation
      during inflammation. At present the relevance and regulation of the complex epigenetic
      profiles and their modifications among different tissues and organs during inflammation
      remain largely unknown.
