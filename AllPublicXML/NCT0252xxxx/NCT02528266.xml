  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to clinically assess safety and performance of the Polyganics nerve
      capping device for the treatment of symptomatic neuroma. There is sufficient clinical
      experience with regard to the safety of the commercially available nerve guide, NEUROLAC®.
      This new nerve capping device is identical in material and manufacturing. The exception is in
      design, where NEUROLAC® has two open ends, the nerve capping device has one closed (sealed)
      end. This study will be conducted to obtain data on the clinical performance of the capping
      device's ability to isolate the nerve end, resulting in a reduction of pain of experienced
      from the symptomatic neuroma and prevention of the reoccurrence of a symptomatic neuroma.
