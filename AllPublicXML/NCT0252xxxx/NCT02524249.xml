  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caffeine is routinely used in the management of apnea of prematurity. Extremely low birth
      weight (ELBW) infants are at higher risk of mortality and various neonatal morbidities such
      as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) for which caffeine has been shown to be beneficial in
      very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. The investigators' previous unpublished retrospective
      studies and recently published retrospective studies demonstrated that early caffeine given
      within 48 hours of age tended to decrease the incidence of death and BPD in ELBW newborns.
      Retrospective design can be biased as newborns with mild lung disease may have received
      caffeine early for extubation. There are several studies on pharmacodynamics and
      pharmacokinetics of caffeine. The data regarding cumulative dosage of caffeine, caffeine
      levels and BPD outcome is deficient.

      Primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that early caffeine given within 24
      hours of life will decrease incidence of mortality and BPD in ventilated ELBW newborns.

      This study will also test an additional hypothesis that higher caffeine dosage and caffeine
      levels are associated with decreased mortality and postnatal morbidities in studied newborns.

      Parents will be approached either prenatally for an impending delivery of ELBW newborn or
      within 16 hours of birth. 90 newborns will be randomized to receive early caffeine within 24
      hours of life (the &quot;study drug&quot;) and 90 newborns will receive a placebo. Either the early
      caffeine (the &quot;study drug&quot;) or placebo will be continued throughout the first 15 days of
      life. Newborns in the early caffeine group will receive an IV bolus of 20mg/kg followed by IV
      or PO 5mg/kg daily for 14 days. The clinical team can choose to give PO caffeine if the
      newborn tolerates &gt;75% of fluid goals by feeds. The clinical and research teams will be
      blinded; neither will know whether the newborn is receiving early caffeine or placebo. The
      clinical team will be allowed to use open labeled caffeine as deemed medically necessary
      after 24 hours of receiving either the early caffeine or placebo. Often this clinical need
      would be at the time of extubation (peri-extubation) and comprises the &quot;late&quot; caffeine group,
      which is also the placebo group. Perinatal and postnatal clinical characteristics will be
      prospectively collected. Clinical team may choose to hold study drug if newborns are placed
      on high frequency ventilation or if they need sedation drips for surgical procedures. Two
      blood samples will be collected one at day 7 and one at day 14 for caffeine levels. Data
      safety monitoring committee will be review mortality and morbidity in each group on a
      quarterly basis or after recruitment of every 30 newborns whichever happens earlier.
