  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of giving the
      combination of pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel to patients with high-grade
      epithelial non-mucinous ovarian, primary peritoneal, or Fallopian tube cancer. Researchers
      want to find out how the disease responds to therapy with pembrolizumab.

      This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA-approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of certain types of melanoma. Its use in patients with ovarian cancer is
      investigational. Carboplatin and paclitaxel are both FDA-approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. The study doctor can explain how the study drug
      combination is designed to work.

      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Treatment:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study and agree, you will have standard
      chemotherapy, your scheduled surgery, and then chemotherapy in combination with
      pembrolizumab.

      Neoadjuvant Treatment:

      You will receive standard chemotherapy treatment for three 21-day cycles, or possibly more
      cycles if the doctor thinks it is in your best interest:

        -  On Day 1 of each cycle, you will receive carboplatin by vein over 1 hour.

        -  On Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle, you will receive paclitaxel by vein over 3 hours.

      Surgery:

      You will then have your scheduled surgery. Some of the tissue removed during the surgery will
      be used for immune system testing and to compare to tissue collected before chemotherapy.

      Adjuvant Treatment and Maintenance:

      After you have recovered from surgery (about 3-6 weeks later), you will begin receiving
      chemotherapy again along with the drug pembrolizumab. You will receive the standard
      chemotherapy in the same way you received it during Cycles 1-3.

        -  On Day 1 of each cycle, you will receive pembrolizumab by vein over 30 minutes during
           Cycles 4-26. Cycles 7-26 are called the Maintenance Phase.

        -  You will receive carboplatin and paclitaxel during Cycles 4-6 only.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of each cycle during Neoadjuvant Treatment:

        -  You will have a physical exam. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will also
           have a pelvic exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be collected for routine tests. If you can become
           pregnant, urine will be collected and/or part of this blood sample will be used for a
           pregnancy test.

        -  In Cycle 1 only, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for biomarker testing. The
           biomarker tests in this study may include genetic biomarkers. Biomarkers are found in
           the blood and tissue and may be related to your reaction to the study drug.

      Study Visits during Neoadjuvant Therapy:

      On Days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle during Neoadjuvant Treatment, blood (about 1-2 tablespoons)
      will be drawn for routine tests.

      At your visit before the surgery:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.

        -  You will have a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease.

      You will sign a separate consent form for the surgery that explains the procedure and its
      risks. During the surgery, tumor tissue will be collected for biomarker and genetic testing.
      All samples will be stored at MD Anderson for an unlimited amount of time for testing related
      to this study.

      On the day of surgery, blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing.

      At your postoperative visit (visit after surgery):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing.

      Study Visits during Adjuvant Therapy:

      On Day 1 of each cycle during Adjuvant Treatment:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine testing. If you can become pregnant, part of this
           urine and/or blood sample will be used for a pregnancy test.

      On Days 8 and 15 of each cycle during Adjuvant Treatment, blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will
      be drawn for routine tests.

      Study Visits during Maintenance Therapy:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be collected for routine tests and to check your
           thyroid function.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine testing.

      Every 12 weeks, you will have a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      You will the receive study drug(s) for up to 23 cycles, or possibly more if the doctor thinks
      it is appropriate for you to have more than 3 Neoadjuvant Treatment cycles. You will no
      longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects
      occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      After you are no longer taking any study drugs, the study staff will continue to call you
      every 3 months to check the status of your health.

      Post-Treatment Visits:

      After the last dose of study drug(s), the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have a CT or MRI to check the status of the disease.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      About 30 days after the last dose of study drugs, you will have a physical exam.
