      To compare the results and efficacy of the self-assisted Boss-Holzach-Matter maneuver for
      anterior shoulder dislocation and the Spaso method performed by a physician.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: There are many described maneuvers in literature describing how to reduce an
      anterior shoulder dislocation. Most of these maneuvers are performed by a trained physician,
      however, seldom are these taught to patients in case of recurrence or accidental dislocations
      that may occur far from a trained professional to treat. The Boss-Holzach-Matter maneuver is
      a simple, easy to understand and easy to perform self assisted method that has not been
      compared to any other method.

      Hypothesis: The Boss-Holzach-Matter method is a less painful maneuver compared to the Spaso
      method assuming an equal success rate.

      Objective: To determine whether the Boss-Holzach-Matter method is a less painful method for
      anterior shoulder dislocations compares to the Spaso method assuming equal success rate.

      Methodology: Fifty six patients presenting acute anterior shoulder dislocation will be
      randomized, at the time of the admission , to either Spaso reduction method performed by a
      physician or the self-assisted Boss-Holzach-Matter method.
