    <textblock>
      This is a single centre randomized clinical outcomes study. The Symax stem or Accolade TMZF
      (Titan, Molybdenum, Zirconium, Ferrum) in combination with the Hemispherical Trident cup, X3
      inserts, 28 and 40 mm Metal heads are the primary components to be implanted for evaluation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Equality of 5 year wear in the 28mm and the 40mm metal femoral head sizes using HAS (Hip Analysis Suite, a software for the determination of polyethylene wear on digital radiographs).</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the clinical, radiographic outcomes and wear of the polyethylene X3 based on digital radiographs using HAS.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Harris Hip Score (HHS) patient questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative, at day of discharge (up to 5 days post-operative), 3 months, 1,2 and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Scores can range from 0 to 100 with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best score. A score of 80-100 is considered good-excellent and a score of less than or equal to 79 is considered fair-poor. 90-100 = excellent 80-89 = good 70-79 = fair 0-69 = poor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Merle D'Aubergine Score (MdA)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative, at day of discharge (up to 5 days post-operative), 3 months, 1,2 and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Merle D'Aubergine-Charnley Score is a simplified clinical scoring system for the hip. The overall score is determined by the sum of scores obtained from each dimension of pain, walking ability and joint mobility. The overall numeric score is given by adding the domain scores. Clinical grades: Excellent, 18, Good 15-17, Fair 13-14, Poor &lt;13.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and non pregnant female patients between 18-75 years of age.

          2. Patients requiring uncemented primary total hip arthroplasty (THA), suitable for the
             use of the Symax stem

          3. Patients with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), avascular
             necrosis (AVN) or post-traumatic arthritis (TA).

          4. Patients who understand the conditions of the study and are willing and able to comply
             with the post-operative scheduled clinical and radiographic evaluations and the
             prescribed rehabilitation

          5. Patients who signed the specific Informed Consent Form prior to surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who require revision of a previously implanted THA

          2. Patients who had a THA on contra-lateral side within the last 1 year.

          3. Patients who had a THA on contralateral side more than 1 year ago and the
             rehabilitation period outcome was considered unsatisfactory or not good. (Patients
             with contra-lateral THA &gt; 1 year ago with good outcome (Harris Hip Score &gt; 85) can be
             included in the study).

          4. Patients who will need lower limb joint replacement for another joint within one year.

          5. Bilaterally operated patient.

          6. Patients who have had a prior procedure of acetabular osteotomy.

          7. Patients with active or suspected infection.

          8. Patients with malignancy - active malignancy

          9. Patients with a diagnosed systemic disease that would affect the subject's welfare or
             overall outcome of the study (i.e. severe osteoporosis, Paget's disease, renal
             osteodystrophy) or is immunologically suppressed, or receiving steroids in excess of
             physiologic dose requirements.

         10. The patient has a neuromuscular or neurosensory deficit which would limit the ability
             to assess the performance of the device or the patient has a neurological deficit
             which interferes with the patient's ability to limit weight bearing or places an
             extreme load on the implant during the healing period.

         11. Female patients planning a pregnancy during the course of the study.

         12. Patients with systemic or metabolic disorders leading to progressive bone
             deterioration.

         13. Patients, who as judged by the surgeon, are mentally incompetent or are unlikely to be
             compliant with the prescribed post-operative routine and follow-up evaluation
             schedule.

         14. Patients with other severe concurrent joint involvements which can affect their
             outcome.

         15. Patients with other concurrent illnesses which are likely to affect their outcome such
             as sickle cell anaemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, Insulin dependent
             Type I diabetes or renal disease requiring dialysis.

         16. Surgeries to be performed with navigation and/or robot-assisted instruments.

         17. Patient with a known sensitivity to device materials.
