    <textblock>
      To assess the feasibility and usability of the VSP System in the in-patient hospital setting
      to monitor vital signs using a patch, brain, gateway, and console. The VSP System will be
      incorporated into the study site's Information Technology infrastructure.

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical feasibility study is to evaluate the feasibility of
      the Vital Signs Patch System (VSP). The VSP will be incorporated into the study site's
      Information Technology infrastructure and worn by in-patients for a minimum of 3 days and for
      the duration of their hospital stay up to 7 days.

      The VSP will take and monitor vital signs in addition to the normal equipment the facility
      uses to monitor and take vital signs. This study will not be assessing safety and no
      comparator groups will be used. As this study will not be treating any particular disease or
      condition, no randomization or blinding is required. Subjects will be chosen as they are
      admitted in accordance with the general population characteristics, inclusion and exclusion
      criteria and willingness to sign the Informed Consent.

      This clinical study involves a device with no additional drugs administered.

      During this study, a single VSP System patch will be worn for up to 48 hours. The first patch
      will be placed using the NEHB configuration. After the first 48 hours, the NEHB-configured
      patch will be replaced with a new patch in the PAL configuration. The second patch can remain
      on the subject for the duration of the subject's hospital stay, or up to seven (7)
      consecutive days. Individual patient use will determine the duration of time that the second
      patch can be worn.

    <measure>Composite Outcome Measure - Adhesive Performance - Measurement of skin irritation resulting from adhesive used with electrodes.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to seven days</time_frame>
    <description>Successful performance of the adhesive of the patch throughout the study for each subject. Subject skin will be checked daily to determine if irritation has resulted where the electrodes have been placed. The results will be either positive or negative for skin irritation. This is a composite outcome measure.</description>
