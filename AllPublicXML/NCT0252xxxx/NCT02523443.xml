  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) is
      a better method for managing pain after liver resection compared to patient-controlled
      analgesia (IV PCA). Currently, the standard pain control method for liver resection patients
      is IV PCA. There is not enough data on how epidural (PCEA) relieves pain and movement on a
      day to day basis after liver resection.

    <description>Patients in this group will have the epidural catheter placed by the anesthesia pain service team in the pre-surgical center (PSC) as performed routinely at MSKCC. The epidural will be used intra-operatively at the end of liver resection phase of the surgical procedure, once the specimen has been extracted, and continued subsequently in the post-operative phase for pain management.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (age 18 years or older) who are able to provide informed consent.

          -  Patients undergoing open elective liver resection for primary liver pathology (benign
             or malignant) or secondary metastatic liver disease, including patients undergoing
             concomitant surgical procedures (such as colorectal resection or debulking
             procedures), with no contraindication to the insertion of an epidural catheter
             (localized infection, septicemia, or pre-operative coagulopathy).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of documented anaphylaxis or contraindication to any of the
             study medications or standardized intra-operative medications. These include dilaudid,
             fentanyl, and bupivacaine.

          -  Patients with pain at rest or with movement measured by NRS &gt;2.

          -  Patients receiving high dose opioids on a chronic basis (greater than or equivalent to
             60mg of morphine per day).

          -  Patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) defined as an FEV1
             &lt;50%.

          -  Patients with significant cognitive impairment or documented psychologic impairment.

          -  Contraindication to epidural catheter placement including bleeding diathesis
             (essential thrombocythemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, von Willebrand
             disease, and hemophilia A or B), neurological dysfunction (multiple sclerosis,
             subacute myelo-opticoneuropathy or preexisting lower limb neurological deficit), prior
             extensive spinal surgery or major spinal deformity, pre-operative use of
             anti-coagulant with planned use of therapeutic dose of anti-coagulant in
             post-operatively, documented pre-operative coagulopathy (INR greater than 1.3 not on
             Coumadin or PTT greater than 42), platelets less than 100,000/Î¼L, or evidence of
             infection at potential epidural site.

          -  Cirrhotic patients. When incidentally discovered intra-operatively, patients will be
             excluded from the study and replaced, but will be followed for primary and secondary
             endpoints.

          -  Patients with poor performance status preoperatively such that they are unable to walk
             up two flights of stairs.
