  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty has been associated with poor acute and long-term outcomes after major surgery. We
      recently determined that nearly 70% of patients undergoing major thoracic surgery are
      pre-frail or frail. We are interested in assessing whether a strength training intervention
      for frail or pre-frail patients has an impact on surgical decision making and on surgical
      outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria: • Age ≥60 years, • Qualified to consent for participation in a research
        study, •Thoracic disease that may require major surgery (major anatomic lung resection,
        esophagectomy, repair of giant paraesophageal hernia, chest wall resection, extended
        pleurectomy/decortication, thymectomy or major surgery for other mediastinal process),• No
        obvious contraindications to surgery (end-stage heart disease, end-stage lung disease,
        severe dementia, other specific comorbidity that would prevent surgery), • Ability to
        participate in physical therapy and an independent exercise program for frailty mitigation,
        •No need for induction chemotherapy or radiation therapy, • Recent evaluation including
        computed tomography of the chest or chest/abdomen.

        Exclusion Criteria:• Age &lt;60 years, •Unable to provide informed consent, • No indication
        for major thoracic surgery, •Obvious contraindication to major thoracic surgery (end-stage
        heart disease, end-stage lung disease, severe dementia, other specific comorbidity that
        would preclude surgery),• Inability to participate in physical therapy and/or an
        independent home exercise for frailty mitigation, •Need for induction chemotherapy or
