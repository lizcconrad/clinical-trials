  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in pain perception by
      participants when the assistant port size varies by 50% (8 mm to 12 mm).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive approaches trade a single longer incision for 4-5 smaller incisions that
      allow abdominal access and abdominal insufflation through &quot;ports&quot;. The increase in operative
      times is mostly due to the need to pass suture, needles, cameras and instruments through the
      abdominal ports. While, it is intuitive that smaller abdominal ports will result in less pain
      at the incision site, the port size is also limited by instrument size and the size of the
      needle. When ports are smaller, it can take a little more time for a needle or instrument to
      be passed into the port.

      There is a paucity of research comparing different port sizes as they relate to participate
      pain and operative time especially in a randomized controlled trial setting. The
      investigators goal would be to determine if there is a difference in pain perception by
      patients when the assistant port size varies by 50% (8 mm to 12 mm).

    <description>Measured with Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain at 1) baseline pain prior to the procedure in the pre-operatively holding area, 2) 4-6 hours post-operatively in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), 3) on post-operative day 1(POD1) and 4) once two weeks post operatively.</description>

    <description>Participates will be randomized to have an 8 mm assistant port used during their surgery. The participate will be asked to specify the point that represents their level of perceived pain intensity and mark it on the scale at four time points: baseline pain prior to the procedure in the pre-operatively holding area, 4 to 6 hours post operatively, on Post Operative Day 1 (POD1). The final pain assessment will be at the two weeks postoperative clinic visit.</description>

The participate will be asked to specify the point that represents their level of perceived pain intensity and mark it on the scale at four time points: baseline pain prior to the procedure in the pre-operatively holding area, 4 to 6 hours post operatively, on Post Operative Day 1 (POD1).
