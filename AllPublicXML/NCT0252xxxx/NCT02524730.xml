      Evaluation of the effect of the component design on functional performance by comparing
      postoperative Knee Society Scores (KSS) with preoperative.

      Evaluate post-operative radiographic findings. Evaluate the effect of component design on
      patient activity by comparing postoperative Lower Extremity Activity Scale (LEAS) with
      preoperative.

      Evaluate patient satisfaction using Short-Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). Evaluate quality of
      life using Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and EuroQuol-5 dimension
      patient questionaire (EQ-5D).

    <time_frame>Pre-operative, at discharge (up to 6 days postoperative), 3 months, 1, 3, 5, 7 an 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee Society Clinical Rating System is comprised of two distinct sub-scores: one for pain, range of motion (ROM) and joint stability, and one for functional parameters. Sub-scores range from a potential minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 100 points. Although the specific scores are not distinguished as &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;fair,&quot; or &quot;poor,&quot; a higher value represents a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Investigation of clinical performance and patient outcome with the Lower Extremity Activity Scale (LEAS) patient questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative, at discharge(up to 6 days postoperative), 3 months, 1, 3, 5, 7 an 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The LEAS is completed by the participant to assess activity level. Activity levels were ordered in terms of intensity from 1 to 18, with 18 indicating the highest activity level.</description>

    <measure>Investigation of clinical performance and patient outcome with the Short Form - 36 Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative, at discharge(up to 6 days postoperative), 3 months, 1, 3, 5, 7 an 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a 36-item patient completed questionnaire to measure general health and well-being. It includes a physical and mental status component score; each ranging from 0-100. Low values represent a poor health state and high values represent a good health state.</description>

    <measure>Investigation of clinical performance and patient outcome with the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) patient questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative, 1, 5, 7 an 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS consists of 5 subscales: Pain, other symptoms, function in daily living , function in sport and recreation and knee related quality of life (QOL). The previous week is the time period considered when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is assigned a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms).</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-operative, at discharge(up to 6 days postoperative), 3 months, 1, 3, 5, 7 an 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D health questionnaire provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status.</description>
