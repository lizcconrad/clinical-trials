      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Pregnyl® when
      given in combination with standard immunosuppressive therapy in pediatric and adult patients
      with high-risk (Arm 1) or refractory/dependent (Arm 2) aGVHD.

    <description>Standard of care immunosuppression, plus Pregnyl® (hCG supplementation) at assigned dose subcutaneously every other day for up to 5 doses.
Individual patient dose reductions: If a patient has toxicity that meets the definition of dose limiting, the patient can drop down one dose level for the next injection and continue treatment. If the patient is enrolled in the phase I component, the event must be reported as a DLT per section 11. If the same patient experiences a second DLT, the patient will discontinue treatment.
Continue protocol treatment through day 7. Assess response at day 7:
If a complete or partial response, continue protocol treatment followed by hCG maintenance twice weekly for 10 doses beginning day 9 to 12.
If no response, the patient will be taken off study treatment.</description>
