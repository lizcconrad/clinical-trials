    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the performance of ColdZyme® mouth spray on prevention and alleviation
      of induced rhinovirus upper respiratory tract infection in healthy volunteers. Half of
      participants will receive ColdZyme® mouth spray while the other half will receive placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Common colds can be caused by a number of viruses, e.g. rhinoviruses, coronaviruses,
      influenza viruses and others. The majority of colds are however caused by rhinovirus
      infection, which is responsible for up to 80% of all common colds. This study evaluates the
      effect of creating a physical barrier on the pharyngeal mucosal membrane to prevent or reduce
      virus cell entry during common cold infection to reduce total virus load and common cold
      symptoms in vivo in relation to placebo.

             Reliable methods are hormonal contraceptives (combination pills, injections or
             implants), intrauterine device, condom or declared absence of sexual contact.

             malaise, nasal obstruction or cough.

          3. Presence of serum neutralising antibodies against human rhinovirus16 at screening.

             pet) and/or dust-mite allergy in skin prick test at screening.

          6. Nasal disease, e.g. nasal polyposis, significant septal deviation, chronic
             rhinosinusitis, etc.

          7. Females: Pregnant, breast-feeding or intentions to become pregnant during the study.
