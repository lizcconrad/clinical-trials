  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nociceptin/Orphanin is a novel opioid peptide system associated with inflammatory response.
      Currently is it uncertain as to the presence of absence of nociceptin in synovial fluid of
      patients. Nociceptin levels will be measured pre-operatively and post-operatively in plasma
      levels of patients receiving primary total knee arthroplasty. Nociceptin levels will also be
      measured in synovial fluid levels prior to surgical manipulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study where nociceptin levels will be drawn from the
      patient's serum as well as from the patient's synovial fluid. The blood draws will be
      completed by the anesthesia team and the synovial fluid and tissue will be obtained by the
      orthopedic team. The initial blood draw will be in the preoperative area and the second blood
      draw will be five minutes after the release of the tourniquet. The synovial fluid will be
      drawn by the surgeon with the first incision. There will be no randomization nor control
      group.

      Endpoints:

        1. The level or absence of nociceptin in synovial fluid in patients receiving total knee
           primary arthroplasty will be measured via ELISA in picograms per volume.

        2. The level or absence of nociceptin in plasma in patients receiving total knee primary
           arthroplasty both in the preoperative period (less than 1 hour prior to surgery and 5
           minutes after the tourniquet is removed) via ELISA in picograms per volume.

        3. Determine the changes if any of nociception plasma levels during the perioperative
           course of patients receiving total primary knee arthroplasty.

      Secondary Study Endpoints:

        1. Determine the effect if present of history of chronic pain and opioid use on the levels
           of nociception present in patients' synovial fluid and plasma receiving primary total
           knee arthroplasty.

        2. Determine the effect if present of demographic factors on the levels of nociception
           present in patients' synovial fluid and plasma receiving primary total knee arthroplasty
