  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Communication and teamwork failures are the leading causes of errors in healthcare settings.
      In situ mock code simulations are a potential means to train team-based skills using
      simulation within real clinical care environments where errors occur; however, debriefing
      discussions often focus on gaps in learners' clinical skills as opposed to team functioning.
      This study aims to determine whether learners who are pre-trained using just-in-time
      simulation regarding CPR quality and medication administration will exhibit improved
      performance with respect to these skills during in situ mock codes as well as improved team
      functioning.
