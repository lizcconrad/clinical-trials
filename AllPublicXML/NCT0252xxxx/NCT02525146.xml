      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a modified form of the ARTAS
      (Antiretroviral Treatment and Access to Services) intervention, adapted for HIV patients who
      have fallen out of care, can be successful in re-engaging patients in care and reducing HIV-1
      viral load.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Re-Engagement in Care: Post-Enrollment Linkage Visit + Meeting HRSA-HAB Guidelines for Retention in Care</measure>
    <time_frame>12-month</time_frame>
    <description>Using HIV primary care clinic attendance records, participants are assessed as to 1) whether or not an HIV Primary Care visit was completed post study enrollment and 2) following that visit, whether the participant made and kept appointments as necessary to meet HRSA-HAB guidelines constituting retention in HIV care. BOTH conditions must be present in order for participant to be considered &quot;re-engaged&quot; in care.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the intervention arm receive intensive social work case management based on the ARTAS (Antiretroviral Treatment and Access to Services) model. Patients may participate in 6-12 visits over a six-month period aimed at addressing barriers to re-engagement in HIV care. Participants complete a battery of research questions at Baseline, 6-months, and 12-months and HIV-1 viral load and CD4 count labwork at Baseline and at 12-months post enrollment.</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients randomized to the usual care arm are provide contact information for an HIV primary care clinic and for local AIDS service organizations. Patients are then encouraged to contact these organizations to re-establish care. Participants complete a battery of research questions at Baseline, 6-months, and 12-months and HIV-1 viral load and CD4 count labwork at Baseline and at 12-months post enrollment. Patients in the usual care arm are offered the intensive casework intervention after their 12-month followup is complete.</description>
