  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between 2012 and 2014, a cohort of 90 COPD subjects of disease severity grades GOLD I-IV as
      well as 60 healthy control subjects (30 smokers and 30 non-smokers) have been examined
      regarding different clinical and blood/ sputum derived biomarkers at the investigators'
      research center. This observation study will follow-up/re-examine all available subjects
      regarding disease course and treatment changes after 3 years (+/-6 months) for the
      investigation of ncRNA/ transcriptome biomarkers for their potential to indicate disease
      progression. In addition, biobanking of respective biosamples for potential future COPD
      biomarker research will be conducted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Past or present disease occurred since participation in &quot;11-03 Ribolution&quot;, which as
