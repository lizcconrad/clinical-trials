      This evaluation is part of a five country project to evaluate the benefits and costs of the
      use of two alternatives to food transfers: vouchers and cash (hereafter referred to as
      &quot;alternative modalities&quot;). The project will generate information on how outcomes such as
      household food expenditure and dietary diversity, relevant to both beneficiaries and WFP,
      change following the introduction of these alternative modalities; how benefits and costs of
      these are, relative to food transfers, distributed across and within households; and what are
      the critical operational issues that need to be addressed for these alternatives to be
      successfully implemented. More specifically, the project will answer seven questions:

        1. Do households benefit from receipt of the alternative modalities?

        2. Are these benefits greater, or less, when transfers are made using alternative
           modalities compared to food transfers. How does this vary across outcomes (such as
           nutrition, livelihoods, gender dynamics and intra-household resource allocation) that
           are of especial interest to WFP?

        3. How does the distribution of benefits differ across households when transfers are made
           using alternative modalities compared to food transfers?

        4. How does the distribution of benefits differ within households when transfers are made
           using alternative modalities compared to food transfers? Do certain household members
           (women, young children) benefit more from one type of modality? How do these modalities
           affect decision-making processes within the household?

        5. Why are these differences observed? How do the reasons for these differences affect the
           study's ability to generalize from these evaluations?

        6. Does the delivery of alternative modalities cost less than food transfers? What accounts
           for these cost differences? Are some costs (such as transport) really lower or are they
           transferred to beneficiaries? Within the household, who bears these additional costs?

        7. What is the benefit: cost ratios associated with these different modalities from the
           perspective of WFP? Is there a conflict between the modality &quot;preferred&quot; by WFP and the
           modality &quot;preferred&quot; by beneficiaries?

      These objectives will be accomplished through household survey data collection among a panel
      of households before and after transfer of alternative modalities. In addition, select
      countries will involve the collection of anthropometric, biomarker and cognitive testing.

      In Ecuador, the intervention consists of food, food vouchers or cash transfers to Colombian
      refugees and poor Ecuadorian households in four urban and peri-urban areas of Carchi and
      Sucumbios in northern Ecuador. The transfer is given monthly for 6 months. The program is
      conditional on attendance at nutrition and community trainings occurring once a month. In
      most cases the transfer recipient is the female head of household or spouse, however in some
      cases men may also receive the transfer.

      The study is a 2 stage randomized control trial where, first, 80 neighborhoods were
      randomized to either treatment or control group; second, treatment clusters (geographical
      units within neighborhoods) were randomized to either: cash, food voucher or food assistance.
      Approximately 20 - 28 participants from each of the 145 clusters were randomly selected for
      interviews. In addition to the household socio-economic survey, hemoglobin measures were
      taken from children between 6 months and 5 years of age and adolescent girls from age 10 to
      16 years in each household. The baseline survey occurred in April 2011 and the endline in
      November 2011.

      Interviews were conducted with female heads of households or spouses where possible, or with
      adult male head of households. In addition, hemoglobin was collected for all children ages 6
      months to 5 years and for adolescent girls residing in surveyed households.

    <measure>Dietary diversity as measured by dietary diversity index and food consumption score through a household questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary diversity index is the number of food items consumed in the household in the last week. Household questionnaire asks about 41 food items, and thus the index ranges from 0-41.
Food consumption score uses same information from food items consumed in the last week, groups them into 8 food groups (staples, pulses, vegetables, fruit, meat/fish, milk/dairies, sugar/honey, oils/fats), sums the number of days these eight different food groups were consumed, and then weights the different groups according to their nutritional value. The score ranges from 0-112.</description>

    <description>Hemoglobin concentration of whole blood will be determined using a portable hemoglobinometer (Hemocue AB, Sweden); a single drop of whole capillary blood from the tip of the middle or index finger will be transferred to the microcuvette using a glass pipette and results will be recorded to the nearest 1 g/L.</description>
