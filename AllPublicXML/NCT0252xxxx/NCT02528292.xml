    <textblock>
      This study will be an open label observational prospective study assessing the clinical
      efficacy of antiTNFα therapy and the alteration/impact on the synovial tissue, with specific
      regard to lymphoid aggregation, over a period of 12 months in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis.

      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most important chronic inflammatory disorders in the
      UK. It affects approximately 1% of adults and causes considerable morbidity, substantially
      reduces quality of life and has a significant mortality. It results in large direct medical
      costs as well as extensive indirect social costs. Despite the significant therapeutic
      progress following the introduction of antiTNFα, a cure for RA is still elusive. At present
      the reasons for the variation in clinical response are not known. The main aim of this study
      is to test the hypothesis that there are distinct molecular and cellular phenotypes present
      within the synovial tissue that define specific disease subsets and provide characteristic
      prognostic implications. In particular, the aim is to assess the relationship between the
      presence of ectopic lymphoneogenesis (ELN) within the rheumatoid synovial membrane and
      response to antiTNFα therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 years of age, with RA as defined by the 1987 revised ACR
             classification criteria.

          -  Patients must fulfill the National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidelines for
             TNF Blocking Therapy in RA.

          -  Patients must be on MTX for at least 4 months, with a stable dose of 7.525 mg/week for
             a minimum of 4 weeks.

          -  Men and women of childbearing potential must use adequate birth control measures (eg,
             abstinence, oral contraceptives, intrauterine device, barrier method with spermicide,
             or surgical sterilization) for the duration of the study.

          -  Patients must be able to adhere to the study visit schedule.

          -  Patients must be capable of giving informed consent and the consent must be obtained
             prior to any screening procedures.

          -  Must have a chest Xray within 3 months prior to commencement of antiTNFα with no
             evidence of malignancy, infection or fibrosis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast feeding.

          -  Use of any investigational drug within 1 month prior to screening or within 5

          -  Presence of a transplanted organ (with the exception of a corneal transplant &gt;3 months
             prior to screening).

          -  Malignancy within the past 5 years (except for squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has been treated with no evidence of recurrence).

          -  History of lymphoproliferative disease including lymphoma, or signs and symptoms
             suggestive of possible lymphoproliferative disease, such as lymphadenopathy of unusual
             size or location (such as nodes in the posterior triangle of the neck,
             infraclavicular, epitrochlear, or periaortic areas), or splenomegaly.

          -  Known recent substance abuse (drug or alcohol).

          -  Poor tolerability of venepuncture required blood sampling during the study period.
