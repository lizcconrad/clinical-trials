      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effects of combining physical exercise
      with a resveratrol supplementation on the physical function of older adults.

    <textblock>
      This investigation is a pilot study to investigate the potential of resveratrol, a
      commercially-available nutritional product, to enhance the efficacy of physical exercise in
      improving physical function among older adults with functional limitations. The overarching
      objective of this project is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an intervention combining
      resveratrol supplementation and physical exercise among sedentary persons aged &gt; 65 years
      objectively-measured functional impairments. A total of 60 participants will be recruited to
      participate in this three month intervention study. All participants will engage in a
      center-based exercise program 3/days per week and will be randomly assigned to consume 1)
      placebo, 2) 250 mg/day resveratrol, or 3) 1000 mg/day resveratrol. This study will provide
      critical information regarding the influence of the combination of resveratrol and exercise
      on objectively-measured and self-assessed indices of physical function. The study will also
      provide novel biologic information regarding the relative effects of the interventions on
      skeletal muscle mitochondrial function.

    <measure>Walking Speed changes between the groups at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change at Baseline, 6, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Walking speed is assess speed by asking the participants to walk at their usual pace over a 4 m course. Participants are to stand with both feet touching the starting line and to start walking after a verbal command is given, and the time needed to complete the entire distance will be recorded. The faster of two walks will be used.</description>

    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) changes between the groups at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change at Baseline, 6, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will assess lower-extremity function by asking the participants to perform a series of tasks including: walking at their usual pace over a 4 m course, repeated chair stands, and a balance test. Each task is scored from 0 to 4, with 4 indicating best level of performance and 0 the inability to complete the test. A summary score (0-12) is then calculated.</description>

    <measure>Skeletal Muscle Function assessed by a dynamometer will demonstrate changes between the groups at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change at Baseline, 6, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Isokinetic strength and endurance of the knee flexors and extensors of the dominant limb will be assessed by a standard dynamometer.</description>

    <time_frame>Change at Baseline, 6, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will assess exercise capacity of participants using the six-minute (6-min) walk test,</description>

    <measure>Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument changes between the groups at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change at Baseline, 6, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The instrument includes 16 tasks representing a broad range of disability indicators that assesses both frequency of doing a task and perceived limitation. The instrument uses a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher levels of function.</description>
