      This phase two, randomized, double-blind study is designed to demonstrate the enhanced
      efficacy of SVF-enriched autologous facial fat grafts, in relation to standard, non-SVF
      enriched, facial fat grafts by evaluating volumetric retention and contour of the engrafted
      region over the course of one year.

      Human Adipose Tissue is considered as a new source for Stromal Stem Cells and offers a large
      therapeutic potential for many rare and common diseases that impacts millions of patients
      worldwide. The Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) of Adipose Tissue is relatively easy to
      extract with minimally invasive procedures such as elective liposuction in large quantities
      and therefore may be a cost effective source for cellular therapies in a wide range of
      medical specialties.

      The term &quot;Facial Atrophy&quot; describes the lost of subcutaneous fat within the face and can be a
      result of the aging process as well as some pathological diseases. It can be corrected via
      autologous fat transfer but usually the majority of the grafted cells will die after 6-12
      months. Several publications demonstrate that the addition of SVF cells to the graft may
      enhance the graft survival.

      This double blind, randomized study aims to demonstrated the efficacy of Antria Cell
      Preparation Process in autologous facial fat grafting.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female or Male, Age 18 to 70 years old

          2. Subjects that are eligible for liposuction and facial fat grafting procedures for
             cosmetic purposes and facial atrophy.

          3. Subjects must require augmentation to the infra-malar region. Furthermore, facial
             engraftment to additional, non-study related regions is optional, but not required.

          4. Inframalar Atrophy Assessment Scale of 2 to 4

          5. Facial volume defect range: 2 to 10 mL

          6. Body Mass Index (BMI) between and including 22 and 29

          7. Able to understand and provide written and verbal informed consent

          8. Fitzpatrick Scale 1 to 6

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently taking or have taken None Steroid Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) within
             last two weeks or corticosteroids within the last six weeks prior to screening

             inability to return for subsequent visits, dementia, and/or otherwise considered by
             the Investigator to be unlikely to complete the study)
