    <textblock>
      In patients at risk of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), ICP measurements require
      invasive transducers, usually with insertion of a catheter into the cranium, or through a
      spinal tap. These invasive modalities involve risks and pain and they can be done only in
      specialized care units, with a high associated cost.

      A novel method for detecting changes in ICP has developed recently. The auditory hair cells
      emit sounds and electric signals in response to sound, which can be easily detected and
      measured non-invasively with the help of a microphone probe placed in the external ear canal
      or regular electrodes. Indeed, the cochlear aqueduct connects the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      spaces to the inner ear in such a way that ICP and inner-ear fluid pressure equalize within
      seconds.

      A symptom of intracranial pressure (ICP) was observed in glioma patient due to a combination
      of causes: the inflammatory reaction around the tumor, the mass effect of the tumor,
      secondary vascular changes, a change in the flow of CSF.

      The evaluation of intracranial hypertension by increased ICP (invasive) is not used in the
      monitoring of intracranial tumors. It is then detected by using routine clinical signs, in
      combination with a standard imaging method (MRI), but still subjective.

      The measurement of noninvasive ICP could allow earlier detection of relapse, and evaluate
      whether the increase in ICP precedes tumor clinical worsening and / or imaging.

    <description>Patients will receive a noninvasive measurement of ICP variations during each of their follow up consultation. These measurements will last until 30 minutes for the first consultation (parameters to determine) and 10 minutes for the others. A postural test will be performed during the ICP measurements when the patient condition will make it possible to do.
Measurements will be performed by a device with noninvasive acoustic probes placed in the ear, and in case of electrophysiological test, regular electrodes on the brow.</description>
