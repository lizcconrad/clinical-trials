    <textblock>
      The study will include 10 patients with HPV-associated ano-genital cancer (cervical, vulvar,
      vaginal, penile, anal) or HPV-associated head and neck cancer, who are planned to receive a
      cisplatin-based chemotherapy (alternatively a carboplatin-based chemotherapy may be selected
      by investigators choice). Patients will receive P16_37-63 peptide (100 µg) combined with
      Montanide® ISA-51 VG subcutaneously once a week for four weeks, followed by a 4 week rest
      period (1 cycle). The vaccination is to be started one week before the initiation or
      continuation of the cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Concurrent radiation is allowed and should
      be documented. The vaccination schedule will be repeated up to a total of 3 cycles (= 6
      months) or until progression or intolerable toxicity. If chemotherapy is withheld (e.g. for
      toxicity), vaccination treatment can be continued.

    <textblock>
      10 patients with HPV- and p16INK4a-positive cervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal or head
      and neck cancer will be enrolled. The p16INK4a-peptide (p16INK4a-37-63, 100 mcg) mixed with
      MONTANIDE ISA-51 VG (0.3 ml) will be administered subcutaneously once weekly for four weeks,
      followed by a 4-week rest period (1 cycle). This schedule will be repeated for a total of 3
      cycles (= 6 months) or until tumor progression or intolerable toxicity is documented. The
      first application will be done one week before chemotherapy initiation or continuation.
      Concurrent radiation is allowed and should be documented. If chemotherapy is withhold for
      toxicity, vaccination treatment can be continued.

      Patients will be seen at baseline/screening and at every visit for safety assessment until
      disease progression or discontinuation of trial therapy for other reasons. Immunological
      assessments will be made in all patients. The immunological assessment includes the delayed
      time hypersensitivity response (DTH) against the P16_37-63 peptide. Therefore in week 1, 9,
      17 and 25, 30 mcg P16_37-63 peptide solution without MONTANIDE ISA-51 VG will be injected at
      a separate site from the vaccination site intradermally. Immunological responses are
      evaluated at baseline and after vaccination in weeks 9, 17 and 25 (ELISPOT) and in weeks 1,
      3, 9, 11, 17, 19 and 25 (ELISA) and are compared to the antigen-specific immune response
      measured before vaccination (week 1). Radiological tumor assessment (CT, MRI) will be
      performed at baseline and then every 8 weeks (after every cycle). There will be a follow- up
      visit four weeks after the last vaccination for safety. Further follow-up regarding
      progression and death can be performed, e.g. via a phone call. Autoimmunity will be assessed
      every 8 weeks. Safety of the immunization will be analyzed as assessed by the number and
      severity of adverse events categorized according to CTC criteria
