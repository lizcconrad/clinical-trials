  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of using oral Glyburide (DiaBeta) in
      patients with acute traumatic cervical spinal cord injuries (SCI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will include patients between 18 and 80 years who have experienced acute traumatic
      cervical spinal cord injury (specifically ASIA A, B or C). Patients will then begin an oral
      drug regimen of Glyburide (DiaBeta), which must be started within 8 hours of injury and
      continued for 72 hours at a daily dose of 3.125 mg on Day 1, 2.5 mg on Day 2 and 2.5 mg on
      Day 3. If indicated, the patient will also have surgical intervention for spinal cord
      decompression and spinal stabilization. Every one who takes part in this study will have labs
      drawn and adverse events assessed through Day 14 or discharge (whichever is earlier), and be
      carefully monitored throughout their hospitalization. Study participation will last for 365
      days (+/- 30 days), with post-hospitalization follow up occuring on Days 28, 42, 84, 182 and
      365.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age: ≥ 18 years and ≤ 80 years

          3. No other life-threatening injury

          4. No evidence of sepsis

          5. Acute cervical SCI with ASIA Impairment Scale grade A, B or C on admission

          6. Non-penetrating SCI at neurologic level from C2 to C8

          7. Initiation of study drug within 8 hours of injury

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Unconsciousness or other mental impairment that prevents neurological assessment
             within the first 8 hours

          2. Acute SCI with ASIA Impairment Scale grade D or E

          3. Currently involved in another non-observational SCI research study or receiving
             another investigational drug

          4. History of hypersensitivity to sulfonylureas, in particular glyburide, or any of its
             components

          5. Other illness (including mental disorder) that could preclude accurate medical and
             neurological evaluation (at discretion of the site investigator)

          6. Unable to commit to the follow-up schedule

          7. A recent history of regular substance abuse (illicit drugs, alcohol), which in the
             opinion of the investigator would interfere with the subject's participation in the
             study

          9. Prisoner

         10. Severe renal disorder from the patient's history (e.g. dialysis) or baseline eGFR of &lt;

             drawn but are not yet available and the subject has no known history of liver disease;
             however, treatment with DiaBeta will be discontinued prior to the second dose if liver
             function tests indicate ALT &gt; 3 times upper limit of normal or bilirubin &gt; 2 times
             upper limit of normal
