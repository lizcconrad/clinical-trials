  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a dearth of research which takes a multi-compound approach to dietary interventions,
      in humans, aimed at improving outcome measures of cognition. Animal research in particular
      points towards fatty acids and flavonoids having a potentiating effect on each other, and
      possibly even being synergistic. Thus, study products will be administered in the present
      trial comprising both of these compounds, with a view to investigating their potential
      effects on cognition in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or subjective
      memory impairment (SMI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      240 participants, aged 55 or above, will be recruited (120 Norwich, 120 Melbourne; to include
      both MCI and SCI participants).

      Participants will be asked to take the study food each day for 12 months, and to come to the
      clinical assessment unit on 3 occasions, at baseline, 3 months and 12 months, to complete a
      cognitive task battery such that their performance may be investigated in the context of the
      intervention.

      Urine, blood and faecal samples will be collected and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will
      be applicable to half of each population (i.e to 60 MCI and 60 SCI, 30 of each at Norwich and
      Melbourne).

    <description>The CDR Computerized Cognitive Assessment System will be used to measure the cognitive effects of the treatments. The battery is sensitive to bidirectional cognitive change including trials in MCI, dementia and SMI. There is strong converging evidence that one particular aspect of performance, namely the number of false positive responses during a picture recognition task, is particularly sensitive to hippocampal integrity (based on activation of the dentate gyrus during the task, and specific decrements in conditions associated with poorer hippocampal function). This will form the primary outcome in this study.</description>
