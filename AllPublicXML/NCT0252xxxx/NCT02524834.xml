  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an early feasibility study that investigates the outcome of selected patients with
      complex thoracoabdominal aortic lesions who are suitable for endovascular (within the vessel)
      repair with a physician-modified Medtronic Thoracic Valiant stent graft. The Medtronic
      Valiant System includes a Valiant Thoracic Stent Graft, a self-expanding, tubular end
      prosthesis which is modified/customized by the Investigators to fit the patient's anatomy.
      The device is constructed by making a taper in the larger proximal thoracic device and
      attaching it to a smaller distal thoracic device. The Viabahn branches for the visceral
      vessels are sutured to holes made in the tapered section. The modified Valiant stent graft is
      advanced to the lesion site endoluminally via the iliac/femoral artery. Access for delivery
      of extensions to the device will be delivered through the left subclavian artery. Upon
      deployment, the stent graft self-expands at the target location, where it is designed to
      exclude the lesion by restoring blood flow through the stent graft lumen.

  <detailed_description>

      The study will be conducted with non-surgical or very high-risk patients who are considered
      suitable candidates for endoluminal repair and who are diagnosed with a Type IV complex
      thoracoabdominal aortic lesion. The total number of enrolled subjects is planned to be 15. It
      is a prospective evaluation of patients receiving the device to determine the proportion in
      whom successful implantation is achieved, as indicated by exclusion of the thoracic lesion
      and graft patency at implant, time of discharge, and 1, 6, and 12 months following
      implantation, and to determine the proportion of patients who die or experience adverse
      events during and after the implantation. Furthermore, the percentage of patients in whom
      technical and clinical success is achieved, will be determined. Patients will be followed for
      5 years after the surgery in which the stent graft is implanted.
