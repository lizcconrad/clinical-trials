  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of providing subjects who have attention deficits, with
      or without a formal diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with
      Working Memory computerized training and explore whether this training is a feasible way to
      help them better engage in a weight loss treatment program, thereby enhancing weight loss
      results. Half of the participants will receive five weeks of online adaptive WM training
      concurrently while attending an in-person 24-week behavioral weight management program and
      half will receive five weeks of a non-adaptive form of cognitive training concurrently while
      attending a 24-week behavioral weight management program in person.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Populations with ADHD or attention issues tend to have more weight loss attempts, struggle
      more with losing weight, and drop out of treatment more frequently than those without
      attention difficulties. Adaptive working memory training has been used to strengthen working
      memory and to mediate the symptoms associated with ADHD. The adaptive training becomes
      progressively more challenging as participants master each level of the training, while
      non-adaptive training remains at the same level throughout. Both groups will attend 24
      weekly, in-person weight management classes on the University of Vermont Campus. Both groups
      will do cognitive training on their own home computers five days a week for 30-40 minutes for
      five weeks concurrently while engaged in the weight loss program.

    <description>The experimental group will receive working memory training through a commercial computerized program: five weeks of adaptive working memory training concurrently with a behavioral weight loss program. Adaptive working memory training becomes progressively more challenging depending on an individual's performance on a given task. They will attend weekly classes of a behavioral weight loss program.</description>
