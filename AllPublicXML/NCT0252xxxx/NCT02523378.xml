    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn how easy participants think it is to complete a
      symptom questionnaire.

    <textblock>
      If participant agrees to take part in the study, basic information about them will be
      collected from their medical record (such as their age, gender, ethnicity, religion,
      diagnosis, marital status, educational level, performance status, and any drugs they may have
      taken in the past or are currently taking).

      Participant will also be given a list of words and asked to read them out loud. The research
      nurse or assistant will write down if participant pronounced the words correctly. This should
      take up to 7 minutes.

      Participant will then be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups.
      This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the
      other group.

        -  If participant is enrolled in Group 1, they will complete the symptom questionnaire
           alone and then a research nurse or assistant will go over their answers with them.

        -  If participant is enrolled in Group 2, they will complete the symptom questionnaire with
           the help of the research nurse or assistant.

      After participant has completed the symptom questionnaire, they will be asked if they
      preferred completing the questionnaire alone or if they preferred to have a nurse help them
      answer the questions. This should take about 1 minute to answer.

      Length of Study:

      It should take about 15 minutes total to complete the study. Patient's participation on this
      study will end after they have completed the symptom questionnaire.

      Additional Information:

      Participant is taking part in this study alone. Participant's family members will not be in
      the room with them.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 128 participants will be enrolled in the study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
