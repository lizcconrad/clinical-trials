  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in four deaths in the United States is due to cancer, and one in three women will develop
      cancer in her lifetime. Despite improvements in survival among other forms of cancer, ovarian
      cancer prognosis remains poor. Eighty percent of women with ovarian cancer will present with
      advanced disease (stage 3 or 4) where 5-year survival ranges from 18-34%.2 Among patients
      with stage III and IV epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), recurrence rates are high.4 Therefore,
      interventions focused on preventing recurrence or slowing progression of EOC is a critical
      problem in the field. The investigators have submitted an R21 to NCI for a dose response
      exercise intervention trial to examine the dose response effects of aerobic exercise on
      biomarkers relevant to ovarian cancer progression and recurrence. The reviewers would like
      assurance that the investigators can recruit ovarian cancer patients into an exercise study
      and that these women will do the exercise protocol we plan to prescribe in our high dose of
      exercise.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of stage III-IV EOC, completed surgery,

             pulmonary, or

          -  orthopedic history that would prohibit a program of walking for exercise;

          -  psychotic disorders,
