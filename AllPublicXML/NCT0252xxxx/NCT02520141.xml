      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive ramucirumab by
      vein over about 60 minutes on Day 1 of each 14-day study cycle.

      Study visits:

      On or before Day 1 of each cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

      On Day 1 of every 2 cycles, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for tumor marker
      testing. Tumor markers may be related to the status of the disease.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 4 and then every 4 cycles after that (Cycles 8, 12, 16, and so on), you
      will have a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after follow-up.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      Within 10 days after your last dose of study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  If you have not had one in the last 4 weeks, you will have a CT scan or MRI to check the
           status of the disease.

      About 30 days after your last dose of study drug, if you have not had one in the last 4
      weeks, you will have a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease.

      If you are not able to come to MD Anderson for the Day 30 follow-up visit, you will be
      contacted by phone and asked how you are feeling.

      Every 3 months after the 30-day visit, you will be contacted by phone or your medical record
      will be checked to monitor your health.

      This is an investigational study. Ramucirumab is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
      It is considered investigational to use ramucirumab to treat biliary cancer. The study doctor
      can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 50 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must have cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer or adenocarcinoma on liver
             biopsy with clinical features consistent with biliary primary/ cholangiocarcinoma.

          2. Metastatic or unresectable disease documented on diagnostic imaging studies.

          3. Must have received at least one regimen containing gemcitabine chemotherapy.

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 1.

          5. The patient has adequate hepatic function as defined by a total bilirubin =/&lt;1.5 mg/dL
             (25.65 μmol/L), and aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) =/&lt;
             3.0 times the upper limit of normal (ULN; or 5.0 times the ULN in the setting of liver
             metastases).

          6. The patient has adequate hematologic function, as evidenced by an absolute neutrophil
             count (ANC) =/&gt;1000/µL, hemoglobin =/&gt;9 g/dL (5.58 mmol/L), and platelets
             =/&gt;100,000/µL.

          7. The patient does not have: a. Cirrhosis at a level of Child-Pugh B (or worse) or; b.
             Cirrhosis (any degree) and a history of hepatic encephalopathy or clinically
             meaningful ascites resulting from cirrhosis. Clinically meaningful ascites is defined
             as ascites from cirrhosis requiring diuretics or paracentesis.

          8. The patient has adequate renal function as defined by a serum creatinine =/&lt;1.5 times
             the ULN, or creatinine clearance (measured via 24-hour urine collection) =/&gt;40
             mL/minute (that is, if serum creatinine is &gt;1.5 times the ULN, a 24-hour urine
             collection to calculate creatinine clearance must be performed).

          9. The patient's urinary protein is &lt;/=1+ (&lt;/=30-100 mg/dl) on dipstick or routine
             urinalysis (UA; if urine dipstick or routine analysis is &gt;/=2+ (&gt;/=100-300 mg/dl), a
             24-hour urine collection for protein must demonstrate &lt;1000 mg of protein in 24 hours
             to allow participation in this protocol).

         10. The patient must have adequate coagulation function as defined by International
             Normalized Ratio (INR) =/&lt;1.5 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) (PTT/aPTT) &lt; 1.5
             x ULN.). Patients on full-dose anticoagulation must be on a stable dose (minimum
             duration 14 days) of oral anticoagulant or low molecular weight heparin. If receiving
             warfarin, the patient must have an INR =/&lt;3.0 and no active bleeding (that is, no
             bleeding within 14 days prior to first dose of protocol therapy) or pathological
             condition present that carries a high risk of bleeding (for example, tumor involving
             major vessels or known varices).

         11. Because the teratogenicity of ramucirumab is not known, the patient, if sexually
             active, must be postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or using effective contraception
             (hormonal or barrier methods).

         12. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 7 days prior to enrollment.

         13. Patients must sign an Informed Consent and Authorization indicating that they are
             aware of the investigational nature of this study and the known risks involved.

         14. Patient is =/&gt; 18 years of age on the day of consenting to the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has experienced any Grade 3-4 GI bleeding within 3 months prior to
             enrollment.

          2. Prior therapy with any agent targeting the VEGFR pathway to include bevacizumab,
             pazopanib, and other anti-angiogenesis inhibitors.

          3. The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or any other
             significant thromboembolism, including portal venous thrombosis (venous port or
             catheter thrombosis, incidental pulmonary embolism diagnosed on imaging studies or
             superficial venous thrombosis are not considered significant) during the 3 months
             prior to randomization.

          4. The patient has experienced any arterial thromboembolic events, including but not
             limited to myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident,
             or unstable angina, within 6 months prior to enrollment.

          5. The patient has uncontrolled or poorly-controlled hypertension (&gt;160 mmHg systolic or
