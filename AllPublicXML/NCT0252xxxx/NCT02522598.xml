  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VVZ-149 is a novel analgesic drug candidate that shows a potential analgesic activity
      inhibiting GlyT2 and 5HT2A simultaneously. These target receptors have been known to play
      important roles in induction and transmission of pain signals. There have been many efforts
      to develop selective drugs to treat pain, but usually unsuccessful due to the lack of
      efficacy or limitations of single-target approach for new drug discovery. VVZ-149 is expected
      to be a dual-target drug, demonstrated having a potential synergism between GlyT2 and 5HT2A
      to maximize an antinociceptive effect in the in vivo animal models. In Phase 1 conducted
      among healthy subjects, safety and tolerability were confirmed. Phase 2 was designed as a
      randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of the analgesic drug VVZ-149 injection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VVZ-149 is a dual antagonist of GlyT2 and 5HT2A. GlyT2 blockage increases inhibitory synaptic
      transmission by glycine in the spinal cord, resulting in a reduction of pain transmissions to
      the brain. 5HT2A blockage decreases descending serotonergic facilitatory modulation on pain
      transmission by the brain and reduces nociceptor activation in peripheral nerves, which are
      primary sources of pain in post-surgical pain. VVZ-149 has been shown to have comparable
      efficacy to morphine in well controlled (blind, complete randomization with a positive
      control) animal studies using rat models of post-operative pain and formalin-induced pain.
      The PK/PD study in animals indicates that therapeutic plasma concentration in human subjects
      will be 600-1,900 ng/ml. A clinical Phase 1 study performed in healthy subjects has shown no
      clinically significant adverse events up to a plasma concentration level of 3,261 ng/ml other
      than brief symptoms of mild nausea or dizziness, and mild somnolence when the plasma exposure
      level is more than 2,000 ng/ml.
