    <textblock>
      Although combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) has dramatically improved quality of life and
      lifespan of HIV infected individuals, it still fails to eliminate viral reservoirs. The Gut
      Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) is the largest reservoir of HIV-1, as it harbors most of
      HIV target cells as activated memory Cluster of differentiation (CD)4+/CCR5+ T cells.
      Intestinal T and B cells express α4β7 integrin, a gut mucosal homing receptor which binds to
      gp120 HIV-1 envelope facilitating the infection of intestinal T cells and the early
      establishment of the gut HIV reservoir. Intensive viral replication in the GALT leads to an
      early impairment of mucosal immunity, due to the severe CD4+ T cells depletion, that could be
      also explained by a lack of recruitment in the gut. Among T cells, interleukin-(IL-)17
      secreting CD4+ T cells (Th17) are particularly depleted during HIV infection. This depletion
      could be associated with HIV progression since these cells play a crucial role in the
      maintenance of mucosal immunity. A dysbalance of the Th17/Treg ratio may reflect the loss of
      the intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. These damages are responsible for an increase in
      microbial translocation, which is associated with immune activation and progression to AIDS.
      Several recent studies have shown that cART initiation during acute or early HIV-1 infection
      reduces HIV DNA reservoir size and improves immune reconstitution in blood. Post-treatment
      controllers, who started long-term cART early after HIV infection, have very low levels of
      HIV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, similarly to elite controllers. Unlike most
      HIV-infected individuals, they maintain an undetectable plasmatic viral load after several
      years of cART interruption, suggesting that a weak reservoir is a prerequisite to achieve a
      functional cure. By extrapolation, it could be hypothesized that the gut viral reservoir is
      also decreased and that mucosal immunity is restored when cART is initiated during primary
      phase of infection. The gut viral reservoir begins to form within the first days after HIV
      exposure, and grows during acute HIV infection. Similarly, intestinal T cells are depleted
      very early after infection, due to high viral replication, host immune response and bystander
      effects. Most studies also concluded that long-term and optimal treatment can't fully restore
      mucosal immunity. These observations led us to study the impact of time of cART start on the
      size of viral reservoir and on immune reconstitution in the gut. For this, we analyzed the
      virological and immunological characteristics of the rectal HIV reservoir of long-term
      treated patients regarding their blood CD4+ T cells count at the time of cART initiation.
