  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) has been documented to be a powerful treatment in
      patients with severe congestive heart failure. However, 30-40% of patients receiving a CRT
      are non-responders. In this study the investigators will use a previously validated method to
      estimate myocardial segment work non-invasively by speckle-tracking echocardiography and
      blood pressure. Since segments which shorten in systole perform positive work, whereas
      segments which lengthen do negative work, the investigators will calculate wasted work as
      negative work in percentage of positive work. The main purpose of the study is to determine
      if wasted work can predict response to CRT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subject is indicated for CRT device according to current European Society of Cardiology
        (ESC) guidelines (2013):

          -  Before CRT is considered, the patient should receive guideline-directed optimal
             medical therapy for heart failure and LV function must be severely depressed (LVEF
             â‰¤35%). In addition the following criteria must be fulfilled:

               1. NYHA functional class II, III or ambulatory IV and in stable sinus rhythm last
                  two weeks.

               2. ECG: Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB) with QRS duration &gt;120 ms and non-LBBB with
                  QRS &gt;150 ms.

          -  Patient with conventional pacemaker in NYHA functional class III and ambulatory IV if
             high percentage of ventricular pacing.

          -  Subject is willing to sign informed consent form and is 18 years or older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Right bundle branch block.

          -  Permanent atrial fibrillation

          -  Recent myocardial infarction, within 40 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Subject underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or valve surgery, within 90
             days.

          -  Post heart transplantation, or is actively listed on the transplantation list, or has
             reasonable probability (per investigator's discretion) of undergoing transplantation
             in the next year

          -  Implanted with a LV assist device (LVAD), or has reasonable probability (per
             investigator's discretion) of receiving a LVAD in the next year

          -  Severe aortic stenosis (with a valve area of &lt;1.0 cm2 or significant valve disease
             expected to be operated on within study period).

          -  Complex and uncorrected congenital heart disease.

          -  Breastfeeding women or women of child bearing potential.

          -  Enrolled in one or more concurrent studies that would confound the results of this
