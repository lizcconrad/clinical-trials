    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies adaptive staged stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)
      in treating patients with spinal metastases that cannot be removed by surgery. SBRT is a
      specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the
      tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Adaptive SBRT
      uses information gathered during treatment to inform, guide, and alter future radiation
      treatments. Staged SBRT uses multiple treatments separated by 2-3 weeks. Giving adaptive
      staged SBRT may work better in treating spinal metastases that cannot be removed by surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of single-fraction radiotherapy to provide a short-interval
      treatment response in patients with metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC), such
      that additional stereotactic radiotherapy to full therapeutic doses can be delivered while
      respecting spinal cord constraints, based on the following metrics: shortest distance between
      gross disease and the spinal cord before and after treatment; epidural tumor volume before
      and after treatment; and extent of epidural compression before and after treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate pain control using the Numerical Rating Pain Scale (NRPS) before and after
      treatment.

      II. To evaluate patient quality of life using the Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-General (FACT-G) before and after treatment.

      III. To evaluate functional outcomes using ambulation score and standardized neurologic exams
      before and after treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo adaptive staged SBRT. Within 14-21 days, patients may undergo a second
      treatment of adaptive staged SBRT at the discretion of the treating physician based on
      clinical parameters, diagnostic interval imaging, and achievement of spinal cord dose
      constraints.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
