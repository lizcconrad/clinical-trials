  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to identify factors that enhance productivity and increase value
      delivered by hospitals drawing on concepts used in industry for quality and productivity in
      production and operations management literature. The investigators intend to look at surgeon
      experience, patient characteristics and pre-admission testing on operating room productivity.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgical Experience vs Average Completion times of surgical procedures</measure>
    <time_frame>intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>A measurement of the surgeon's experience (in years) since completion of training until the surgical procedure (Day of surgery/Day 1) will be compared to the surgeon's average time (measured in minutes) to complete the surgical procedure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Variability in Completion times of surgical procedures to predict scheduling difficulties.</measure>
    <time_frame>intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The length of time (measured in minutes) required to complete surgical procedures will be assessed for variability per surgeon. Extreme variability will be compared to the effect on the surgery schedule for that date.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preadmission Testing and how it relates to the surgical procedure: time to completion, delays in starting time and/or cancellation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Patients completing testing and assessment in the Pre Admission testing center will be compared to patients that were not tested or assessed in the Pre admission testing center to determine if there is a change in the completion time of the surgical procedure, increase the variability in the completion time for the surgeon, lead to delays or cancellation of the surgical procedures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Acuity vs Complexity of surgical procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The patient acuity level will be compared to the complexity of the surgical procedure as measured by an investigator assigned complexity scale and how it relates to the time to completion and its impact on operating room scheduling.</description>
