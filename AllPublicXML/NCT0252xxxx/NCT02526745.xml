  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and immunogenicity of live attenuated vaccine in adults aged
      50 years and older. Half of participants will receive high doses of the vaccine,while the
      other half will receive low doses of the vaccine in phase I clinical trial. At the phase II
      clinical trial, participants will be distributed equally to four groups(low、middle, high
      doses of the vaccine and placebo).
