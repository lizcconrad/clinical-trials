  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first time in human (FTIH), open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study designed
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and
      preliminary clinical activity of GSK3174998 administered intravenously to subjects with
      selected advanced or recurrent solid tumors.

      This dose-escalation study will assess the safety, activity of GSK3174998 as monotherapy
      (Part 1), in combination with pembrolizumab (Part 2), and potentially in combination with
      additional therapies.

      The study will be conducted in 2 parts, each part consisting of a dose-escalation phase
      followed by a cohort expansion phase. Part 1 will evaluate GSK3174998 monotherapy, while Part
      2 will evaluate GSK3174998 in combination with pembrolizumab.

      GSK3174998 will first be evaluated as monotherapy in escalating doses. Once a dose of
      GSK3174998 has been identified that is both tolerable and demonstrates pharmacodynamic
      activity, enrollment of Part 2 may begin. In Part 2, escalating doses of GSK3174998 will be
      evaluated with fixed doses of pembrolizumab.

      The study will enroll up to approximately 264 subjects with different tumor types
      (approximately 144 subjects in Parts 1A and 2A [dose escalation]; approximately 120 subjects
      in Parts 1B and 2B [cohort expansion]). The maximum duration of treatment with GSK3174998
      plus or minus pembrolizumab will be 2 years or 35 cycles, whichever comes first. The
      follow-up period for safety assessments will be a minimum of 3 months from the date of the
      last dose. The post-treatment follow-up period includes disease assessments every 12 weeks.
