      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the clinical outcome (up to 12
      months) of treatment by means of stenting with the RoadSaver (Terumo) in subjects at high
      risk for carotid endarterectomy requiring carotid revascularization due to significant
      extra-cranial carotid artery stenosis.

          -  is asymptomatic and has ≥ 80% stenosis via angiography.

               1. Target lesion located in the distal common carotid artery (CCA), internal carotid
                  artery (ICA), or carotid bifurcation.

               2. Arterial segment to be stented has a diameter between 4mm and 9mm
