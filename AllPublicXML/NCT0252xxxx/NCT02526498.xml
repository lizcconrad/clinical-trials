    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using
      high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy works in treating patients with breast cancer that has not
      spread beyond the breast or the axillary lymph nodes (early-stage) after surgery. Radiation
      therapy uses a type of energy to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Brachytherapy is a type
      of internal radiation therapy that provides radiation inside the breast to any remaining
      tumor cells next to the space where the tumor was removed, and is given over a shorter amount
      of time than standard radiation therapy. Giving accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI)
      using high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy may reduce the overall time that radiation is
      delivered to the tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity rate with shorter courses of accelerated partial breast
      irradiation (APBI) delivered with a breast brachytherapy applicator.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the 3-year actuarial local control rate with abbreviated accelerated partial
      breast irradiation (APBI).

      II. To assess the rate of excellent or good cosmesis at 2-years after shorter courses of APBI
      and to identify co-variants associated with and predictive of poor cosmetic outcome in women
      treated with an overnight treatment course of APBI.

      OUTLINE:

      Within 1-5 days after balloon placement, patients undergo accelerated partial breast
      irradiation (APBI) using high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy over 15-60 minutes for 2-3 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-8 weeks and then at least
      annually for 2 years.
