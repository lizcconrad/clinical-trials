      The purpose of this trial is to compare the severity of ISRs (Injection Site Reactions)
      following degarelix subcutaneous (s.c.) administrations with two different injection
      techniques and intramuscular (i.m.) administration in patients with hormone dependent
      prostate cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged â‰¥18 years with a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate (Gleason graded, all
             stages) where endocrine treatment is indicated.

          -  Caucasian origin.

          -  Able to provide written Informed Consent and willing and able to comply with trial
             procedures.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18.5-30 kg/m2.

          -  Has a life expectancy of at least one year.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current hormonal management of prostate cancer.

          -  Previous endocrine therapy for prostate cancer within 3 months prior to the screening
             visit.

          -  Any medical injection therapy that might interfere with degarelix injections.

          -  Patients with advanced muscle atrophy or cachexia which in the Investigator's opinion
             would preclude or pose risks of complications following ventrogluteal i.m. injection
             of degarelix.

          -  Any medical condition that could be aggravated or may cause extreme discomfort during
             the trial period or could cause a moderate risk to a patient (significant heart, renal
             or liver disease).

          -  Chronic pain syndrome or any continuous pain reported by the patient that, according
             to the judgement of the Investigator, could limit the evaluation of injection related
             pain.
