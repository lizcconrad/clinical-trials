      The study will evaluate device performance and user satisfaction in the UriCap-RM, an FDA
      cleared non-invasive urine collection device for men.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following various disease conditions such as trauma, orthopedic surgery, and infections etc.,
      patients may be bedridden and unable to void in a bedpan or to make their way to the toilet.
      Others may be incontinent of urine. In such situations an indwelling catheter is often placed
      to relieve patients while they are incapacitated; in many cases a catheter is placed despite
      lack of urinary retention. Indwelling catheters, although effective, are associated with
      discomfort, pain, and urinary tract infections. In other cases diapers or absorbent pads may
      be used, or a condom-type urine collection device. These may be associated with skin
      irritation and infection.

      The study will evaluate the UriCap-RM non-invasive urine collection device in hospitalized
      men.

    <description>UriCap-RM is comprised of a reusable part and a single use adhesive tape. The reusable part is applied over the urethral meatus and is held in position by a stabilizer and adhesive tape. It is connected to a standard urine collection bag. The UriCap-RM is used on male patients who would otherwise use diapers, a condom-type urine collection device or an indwelling catheter for urine collection.</description>
