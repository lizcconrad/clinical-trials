  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicentre phase II study to determine the safety and efficacy of EUS-guided nCLE in
      patients with suspected cystic tumours of the pancreas in whom endoscopic ultrasound-guided
      fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is clinically indicated. Patients will be recruited
      sequentially to undergo nCLE as part of their routine diagnostic evaluation, followed by
      standard surveillance. This part of the study will recruit 60 patients.

      A multicentre phase II study to determine the safety and efficacy of EUS-guided nCLE in
      patients with suspected cystic tumours of the pancreas in whom endoscopic ultrasound-guided
      fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is clinically indicated. Patients will be recruited
      sequentially to undergo nCLE as part of their routine diagnostic evaluation, followed by
      standard surveillance. This part of the study will recruit 60 patients. The study also
      includes a feasibility study to evaluate the role of intraoperative nCLE in the diagnosis and
      staging of pancreatic tumours. This part of the study will recruit a further 20 patients.

      Primary endpoint:

      Assess the diagnostic performance of the Cellvizio nCLE system in the characterization of
      pancreatic cysts, compared to standard diagnostic modalities.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Assess the safety and efficacy of EUS-nCLE.

        -  Assess the impact of the Cellvizio nCLE system on the management of patients with
           pancreatic cysts.

        -  Develop and validate interpretation criteria for nCLE in the pancreas.

        -  Assess the diagnostic performance of nCLE in characterising and staging pancreatic
           tumours intraoperatively.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A diagnosis of a pancreatic cystic tumour based on multidisciplinary review of imaging
             for which EUS-FNA is indicated.

          2. Pancreatic cystic tumour &gt;1cm in size.

          3. ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2.

          4. Estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          5. Age &gt;18 years.

          6. Capable of giving written informed consent.

          7. Has not has pancreatitis within the previous 3 months.

          8. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test in the week
             before nCLE, AND be using an adequate contraception method, which must be continued
             for at least 1 week after nCLE.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute pancreatitis in the last 3 months.

          2. Subject with multiple cysts

          3. Subjects for whom EUS-FNA or surgery are contraindicated

          4. Known allergy to fluorescein dye

          5. Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases or laboratory finding that in
             the view of the investigator makes it undesirable for the patient to participate in
             the trial.

          6. Any psychiatric disorder making reliable informed consent impossible.

          7. Pregnancy or breast-feeding.
