      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of supra-early
      post-surgery chemotherapy versus standard TEMODAL® regimen in treatment of patients with
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. The secondary purpose is to assess the efficacy of
      supra-early post-surgery chemotherapy in release brain edema.

    <description>4 weeks after surgery, patients are administered with radiotherapy that consisted of fractionated focal irradiation at a dose of 2 Gy per fraction given once daily 5 dyas a week over a period of 6 weeks. Concomitant TEMODAL® are administered orally at a daily dose of 75mg/m2 from the first day of radiotherapy until the last day of radiotherapy, but for no longer than 49 days. After a 4-week break, patients were then to receive up to 6 cycles of adjuvant TEMODAL® chemotherapy according to the standard 5-day schedule every 28 days.The dose is 150mg/m2 once daily for cycle 1 and is increase to 200mg/m2 at the beginning of cycle 2, so long as there were no hematologic toxic effects.</description>
