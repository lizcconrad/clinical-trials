  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of the study is to better understand how the investigators previously
      developed decision support (DS) tool can help people make decisions about health insurance
      plans available through the federal exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The
      investigators will evaluate the DS tool compared to the federal government website. The
      investigators will also evaluate the feasibility of disseminating this tool. There are two
      primary aims to be completed in this project: (1) examine the reach and effectiveness of the
      health insurance DS tool; and (2) collect stakeholders' feedback to improve the likelihood of
      implementation of the DS tool.

      First, for Aim 1 part 1, the investigators will recruit 40 key stakeholders (uninsured
      participants, health providers, community advisors, and health policy experts) to refine the
      DS tool through a series of individual semi-structured interviews. Next, the investigators
      will use their feedback to program the DS strategies into an online DS tool. After its
      initial production, the tool will be pilot tested with 30 individuals to assess readability,
      message clarity, format, and function of the tool as well as to test the randomized trial
      study procedures. Then, for Aim 1 part 2, the investigators will test the DS tool in a
      randomized trial with 362 participants eligible for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchanges.
      Half will use the DS tool and the other half will use the federal government site to learn
      about the exchanges. The investigators will use computerized random assignment to assign
      participants to study condition, after which they will all complete the same short survey.
      For Aim 2, the investigators will collect 40 stakeholders' feedback on likelihood of adoption
      and implementation of the DS tool to plan for dissemination and implementation. Stakeholders
      will be asked both open-ended and closed-ended questions in order to gather feedback about
      delivering the DS tool. These stakeholders will be different from those who were interviewed
      in Aim 1 as to ensure broader applicability of the DS tool.

    <measure>Decision Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed immediately after reviewing Decision Aid tool, taking about 5 minutes to complete.</time_frame>
    <description>The decision self-efficacy (DSE) scale measured participants' perceived ability to understand insurance info and resist unwanted decision pressure. The 6 items on the DSE scale were each rated on a 3-point scale (0=Not confident; 2=A little confident; 4=Very confident). The sum of the DSE items was divided by 6 and multiplied by 25 to obtain a score on a 0-100 scale. Higher values indicate more confidence in one's decision-making ability.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Confidence in Choice</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed immediately after reviewing Decision Aid tool, taking about 5 minutes to complete.</time_frame>
    <description>The 4-item SURE (Sure of myself; Understand information; Risk-benefit ratio; Encouragement) decisional conflict scale assessed confidence in plan choice. Each item could be answered dichotomously (1=yes; 0=no). Responses were summed and a group average was obtained. Higher SURE values indicate more confidence in choice. The scale ranged from 0-4.</description>

          <title>Subjective Numeracy (SNS)</title>
          <description>Three items from the Subjective Numeracy Scale (SNS) assessed numeracy skills. The SNS is a self-report measure scored from 1-6, with larger values indicating greater perceived ability with mathematical tasks. Scores from each of the three items were summed and averaged to obtain a composite score. Values for Range are the actual score range obtained from the study's participants.
One participant in the healthcare.gov condition did not complete the SNS or SILS (n=162)</description>

        <description>The decision self-efficacy (DSE) scale measured participants' perceived ability to understand insurance info and resist unwanted decision pressure. The 6 items on the DSE scale were each rated on a 3-point scale (0=Not confident; 2=A little confident; 4=Very confident). The sum of the DSE items was divided by 6 and multiplied by 25 to obtain a score on a 0-100 scale. Higher values indicate more confidence in one’s decision-making ability.</description>
