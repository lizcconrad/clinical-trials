  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of electro-kinetically modified water
      (EMW) beverage, consumed twice daily (BID) for 3 months in the management of endometriosis
      associated pain, and to evaluate the effect of EMW consumption on analgesic use for
      endometriosis associated pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized study to assess the
      efficacy of EMW versus placebo in the treatment of premenopausal women (16-49 years of age)
      with endometriosis associated pain. Approximately 40 subjects with endometriosis will be
      enrolled at Madigan Army Medical Center (MAMC). Subjects will be asked to consume EMW (or
      placebo) for three months. Subjects will record daily pain levels and other symptoms
      associated with endometriosis in an electronic diary. In addition to standard of care for
      this condition, the investigator will monitor the subjects at baseline, Month 1, and Month 3
      visits, which will consist of patient questionnaires, blood sampling, and Adverse Events
      monitoring.
