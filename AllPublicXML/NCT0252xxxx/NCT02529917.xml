  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Forty physically active men and women aged 18-45y will take part in an 8-week resistance
      training program, randomized (double blind) 1:1 into each of two groups. Twenty participants
      will be randomized to receive 60 g/d of hemp powder (containing approximately 40 g protein
      and 9 g oil) supplementation and 20 randomized to receive 60 g/d of soy supplementation
      (matched to the hemp for macronutrients and calories) during eight weeks of training. Each
      participant will complete testing before and after the intervention for assessment of body
      composition (lean tissue, fat, and bone mass), strength, central fatigue, markers of
      inflammation, and bone resorption. Over the 8-weeks of training, participants will train
      four-five days per week for 1-1.5 hours per session with exercises targeting all major muscle
      groups. The training will involve a &quot;two day split&quot; where different muscle groups are trained
      on two consecutive days (day 1 involves chest, back, and arms; day 2 legs, shoulders, and
      abdominals). Resistance training will provide the necessary stimulus for protein synthesis to
      optimize the effect of a protein-containing nutritional supplement. The hemp or soy powder
      will be consumed in two doses (i.e. 30 g powder containing 20 g protein per dose) immediately
      after exercise sessions and one hour after exercise. This dosing regimen is optimal for
      stimulating muscle protein synthesis and building muscle mass . On the one non-training day
      per week the two doses will be consumed with meals.
