  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomised, controlled, two period crossover phase Ib trial using an
      individualized standard meal with a fixed nutrient ratio in subjects with type 1 diabetes
      mellitus to investigate postprandial blood glucose control with BioChaperone insulin lispro
      compared to Humalog®. The assessments will be conducted before and after a period of multiple
      daily dose administrations for 14 days. The meal tolerance test will be performed on day 1-3
      and on day 14 of each period. Furthermore the study aims at investigating Post-prandial
      glucose (PPG) profiles with BioChaperone insulin lispro and Humalog® when injected at various
      injection meal intervals (-15min, 0 minutes, +15 minutes).

      Each subject will be randomised to a sequence of two treatments, either BioChaperone insulin
      lispro-Humalog® or Humalog®-Biochaperone insulin lispro, and three different sequences of
      injection-meal intervals. A blinded to patient continuous monitoring of glucose (CGM) will be
      performed during the 14 day treatment periods.
