  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of a one-time intranasal administration
      of the oxytocin, vasopressin, or placebo on prosocial decision making such as cooperation and
      competition in a healthy population of student controls.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Preferences for competitive vs cooperative compensations and monetary allocations as measured by participants monetary allocations and compensation choice</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 45 minutes after intranasal administration of vasopressin, oxytocin, or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>A group analysis will compare compensations preference (competitive vs. noncompetitive), performance and outcomes and monetary allocations on several economic games between the oxytocin, vasopressin and placebo groups.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Redistribution preferences as measured by participants' tax rate determination</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 45 minutes after intranasal administration of vasopressin, oxytocin, or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will choose redistribution of monetary units by determined tax rate (high vs. low). Each participant gets a different amount of monetary units (ranging from 10 to 150). Using a mixed 2 (above vs. below group mean of monetary units) x 3 (oxytocin, vasopressin, placebo) factorial design, comparisons of these tax rate preference will then be made for those in the oxytocin vs. vasopressin vs. placebo groups. Main effects of drug condition (oxytocin, vasopressin, placebo) and monetary condition (above, below group mean), as well as an interaction between drug condition and monetary condition will be analyzed at a significance level of p&lt;.05.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Willingness to compete as measured by participants compensation choice.</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 45 minutes after intranasal administration of vasopressin, oxytocin, or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Willingness to compete will be measured by participants' preference whether to compete against other participant for a monetary payment or to get a smaller payment for their non-competitive piece rate performance on maze solving task. We will analyses performance and payment preference (competitive vs. noncompetitive) between oxytocin, vasopressin and placebo at a significance level of p&lt;.05.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Monetary offers in public goods game</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 45 minutes after intranasal administration of vasopressin, oxytocin, or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Participants in two rival teams will offer monetary units for the right to take part in a lottery (higher team's offer = higher odds to win). Members of each team may, for a monetary cost, impose a tax on their team members. We will compare monetary offers and taxes' impose pattern between oxytocin, vasopressin and placebo groups at a significance level of p&lt;.05 .</description>

    <description>Number of positive hypothesis tests (compare to 'negative-test') out of 6 participants' generated tests. Analysis will compare number of positive tests (vs. negative tests) between oxytocin, vasopressin and placebo groups at a significance level of p&lt;.05.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and negative affect scale (PANAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately one hour and fifteen minutes after administration of oxytocin, vasopressin or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Positive and negative affect scale (PANAS) we will measure participants emotional reaction to Oxytocin, vasopressin and placebo. Participants will report their current mood by rate the level they feel 20 different emotions at the moment on a the PANAS scale, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear of negative evaluation (FNE) as measured by self reporting</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately one hour and fifteen minutes after administration of oxytocin, vasopressin or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will report their fear of evaluation by rate how much 12 statements characterize them. participants will use a scale ranging from 1 (&quot;Not at all characteristic me&quot;) to 5 (&quot;Extremely characteristic of me&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social value orientation as measured by monetary allocations preferences</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately one hour and fifteen minutes after administration of oxytocin, vasopressin or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will make decisions regarding the allocation of monetary units between themselves and other participants. We will measure the quantity of monetary units kept for themselves vs. given to other participants.</description>

             steroids, medications for psychiatric symptoms like anxiety or depression, stimulants,
             and medications for high blood pressure. Participants will be asked to tell the
             investigators of any medications or drugs that they are taking. The investigators will
             consider the drug interactions with oxytocin and vasopressin prior to study, and
             participants will not be able to participate in the study if the drug interactions
             could be dangerous.

          -  history of drug or alcohol addiction

          -  Pregnancy or Nursing Status: Because of the risk to an unborn fetus or infant, women
             who are pregnant or nursing are excluded from this protocol. All females will have a
             pregnancy test performed no more than 24 hours before each drug administration and
             will not be able to participate if the pregnancy test is positive.
