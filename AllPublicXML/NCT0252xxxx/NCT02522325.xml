    <textblock>
      This study will determine the initial efficacy of phendimetrazine as a pharmacotherapy for
      cocaine dependence. A rigorous, inpatient human laboratory study will be conducted in which
      the subjective, physiological and reinforcing effects of cocaine are evaluated during
      maintenance on placebo and phendimetrazine.
