  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of Nexvax2 preceded by dose titration period in patients with celiac disease
      currently on a gluten-free diet. The study will consist of a Screening Period, a Treatment
      Period, and a Follow-up Period. Eligible subjects will be enrolled in one of three cohorts
      according to whether they are homozygous or not homozygous for both genes coding for
      HLA-DQ2.5.

          3. Subject has been diagnosed with celiac disease on the basis of intestinal histology
             showing villous atrophy according to expert guidelines current at the time of
             diagnosis.

          4. Subject has HLA DQ2.5 genotype (HLA-DQA1*05 and HLA-DQB1*02).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has not been maintained on a gluten-free diet for at least 1 year.

          2. Celiac Dietary Adherence Test at screening indicates non-compliance to gluten-free
             diet (score &gt;12).

          3. Serum levels of both recombinant human transglutaminase (tTG)-specific

          5. Subject is or has been using an immuno-modulatory or immune suppressing medical
             treatment during the 2 months prior to Screening, for example azathioprine,
             methotrexate, or biological

               -  White blood cell count (WBC) outside the normal range and judged clinically
                  significant by the investigator

               -  Direct bilirubin outside the normal range

               -  Any other clinically significant abnormal laboratory values, as determined by the
                  investigator

         13. Subject is lactating, is known to be pregnant, has a positive pregnancy test at
             Screening or Treatment Day, intends to become pregnant, or is nursing.
