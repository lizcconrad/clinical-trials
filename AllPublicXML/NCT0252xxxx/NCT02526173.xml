  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will examine the beneficial impacts of applying of dHACM on the preserved
      neurovascular bundles (cavernosal nerves) and the prostate bed during robotic assisted
      laparoscopic prostatectomy. Such application can result in promotion of soft tissue healing
      and reduction of inflammation at the operative site and thus an acceleration of return of
      potency regulating cavernosal nerves.

      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of dehydrated human
      amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM) in reducing neurovascular bundle inflammation in prostate
      cancer patients undergoing bilateral full nerve sparing robotic assisted laparoscopic radical
      prostatectomy (RALP). Specifically, this study compares potency outcomes in patients who had
      full nerve sparing RALP procedures with dHACM application to the neurovascular bundles to
      that of full nerve sparing RALP without dHACM application to neurovascular bundles.

      Patients will be randomized to one of two possible treatment groups:

        -  Group 1 - Treatment Group ( Full Nerve Sparing RALP + AmnioFixÂ®)

        -  Group 2 - Control Group ( Full Nerve Sparing RALP alone)
