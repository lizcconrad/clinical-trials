  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common chronic inflammatory joint disease in adults and
      is characterized by chronic inflammation of the joints leading to their destruction,
      resulting in a major loss of function.

      The investigators propose a pilot study for studying changes in bone microarchitecture with
      High Resolution peripheral micro Computerized Tomography (HR-pQCT) in patients with RA
      treated with anti-TNF(Tumor Necrosis Factor), with the measurement of micro-architectural
      parameters in subchondral area near an inflammatory joint during the first 12 months of
      initiation of an anti-TNF therapy (Infliximab®, Etanercept®, Adalimumab®).
