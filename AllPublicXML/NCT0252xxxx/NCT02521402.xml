  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see if there is clinical benefit of using Biovance in
      reduction of the recurrence of keloids when used to revise them. It will also assess the
      postoperative complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess the performance of Biovance, patients will consulted regarding the history and
      previous treatment of their keloid. Once patients are deemed to be appropriate candidates,
      they will be enrolled in the study. Operatively, the old scar will be completely excised.
      Then the Biovance will be laid in the base of the wound. After this is performed, extensive
      undermining will be done to close the wound in layers.

      All post-revision complications (including infection, incision dehiscence, hematoma, seroma,
      and wound necrosis) will be assessed and recorded by the investigator. Patients will be
      reviewed to obtain demographic and risk factor (such as age, body mass index, smoking) data.
      Data on adjuvant therapy use (previous surgeries, treatments for keloid scar) will be
      collected. Surgical technique details (such as incision size and closure technique) will also
      be recorded for each patient. Photographs documenting the pre-, intra- and post-revision
      clinical course of patients will be collected.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The subject has:

          2. a keloid scar that is located on the face, neck, arm, trunk, or groin area

          3. is between the ages of 21 and 80 years old

          4. competency as an adult, per applicable state law who is willing to provide written

          5. the intent and ability to return for all scheduled and required visits and follow
             recommended standard post surgical treatment for keloid scar excision.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The subject has:

          1. clinical evidence of infection of the keloid scar

          2. any malignancy or a neoplasm at the keloid scar site
