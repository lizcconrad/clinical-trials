    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the use of specialized testing of solid tumors including
      sequencing. The process of performing these specialized tests is called tumor profiling. The
      tumor profiling may result in identifying changes in genes of the tumor that indicate that a
      particular therapy may have activity. This is called an individualized cancer therapy (iCat)
      recommendation. The results of the tumor profiling and, if applicable, the iCat
      recommendation will be returned.

      Patients with extra-cranial (not in the brain) solid tumors that are either difficult to
      diagnose or more difficult to treat are eligible to participate in this study. All enrolled
      patients will have targeted sequencing of tumor performed. Sequencing results will be
      reviewed for clinically significant findings including determination of whether any mutations
      exist that suggest potential for activity of a targeted therapy (iCat recommendation).
      Results will be returned to the patient's oncologist and follow-up data will be collected.

      In this prospective multi-center cohort study, the primary objective is to describe the
      outcomes of pediatric patients with advanced solid tumors according to whether or not they
      received of targeted therapy matched to an iCat recommendation. The primary clinical outcome
      of interest is the endpoint of overall survival (OS), with progression-free survival and
      response rate (RR) as key secondary clinical outcome measures. To address this hypothesis,
      825 patients will enroll from an anticipated 11 participating institutions over 3 years.
