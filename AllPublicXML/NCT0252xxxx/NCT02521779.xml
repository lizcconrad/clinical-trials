    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of different dietary fats (saturated or
      unsaturated) on postprandial endotoxemia and systemic low grade acute inflammation. The
      investigators hypothesized that meals rich in saturated or n-6 fatty acids would increase
      postprandial endotoxemia but meals high in n-3 fatty acids would decrease postprandial
      endotoxemia.Participants were recruited via email and randomized to treatment meal in this
      single-blind, cross-over study. Each test session participants reported to the laboratory
      right away in the morning. An indwelling catheter was inserted into the participant
      non-dominant arm by a qualified nurse and a baseline blood draw was taken. The participant
      was then provided with one of four test meals (a porridge-type meal containing a different
      dietary fat), which they ate in entirety within 15 minutes. The participants remained in the
      laboratory for the next five and a half hours and were not allowed to consume any food or
      drink except water. During this time, further blood draws were taken at intervals of one hour
      for a total of five hours after the consumption of the test meal. Collected blood was
      processed on-site and the serum fraction collected and tested for endotoxin, inflammatory
      biomarkers, and metabolites.
