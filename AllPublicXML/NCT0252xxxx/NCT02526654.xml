    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare standard automated perimetry (SAP) using the
      Heidelberg Edge Perimeter (HEP) with the Octopus Visual Field (OVF) analyzer and determine
      test-retest reliability of both parameters in detecting glaucomatous visual field losses. A
      secondary outcome measure is investigation of novel imaging parameters of the optic nerve
      head and a new automated structure-function report.

      After obtaining informed consent, each patient will undergo the following tests:

        1. Standard ophthalmic examination (usual care): Best-corrected visual acuity testing, slit
           lamp biomicroscopy, Goldman applanation tonometry, corneal thickness measurement and
           fundoscopy.

        2. G-top strategy using the OVF Analyzer (G-Top, Koeniz, Switzerland). The MD, PSD will be
           recorded.

        3. HEP SAP using the advanced staircase thresholding algorithm (ASTA). This will be
           performed once. The MD and PSD will be recorded.

        4. Spectralis OCT using the GMPE program will be performed twice in a non - dilated
           condition. The MRW and RNFL thickness in 6 sectors (SN, ST, IN, IT, N and T) along with
           the structure-function correlation will be recorded.

      The investigators will randomize the order of the HEP SAP III and the OVF, and the order of
      the eye tested (right vs. left) if both eyes of the patients meet the inclusion criteria.
      Forty eyes (40) of patients with glaucoma will be randomly chosen from this group and will be
      asked to return in 3-6 month for retesting HEP and OVF.

    <description>MD and PSD values obtained from HEP machine for glaucoma patients and controls will be compared to the MD and PSD values obtained from Octopus visual field machine to see if HEP can detect glaucoma as well as Octopus visual field. The closer the values of both parameters for both the machines the better comparable the two machines are to each other in detecting glaucoma.</description>
