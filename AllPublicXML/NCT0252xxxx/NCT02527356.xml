      The three purposes of this study are: 1) to examine the feasibility and effects of ride-on
      car training with two different postures on mobility and socialization in toddlers with
      disabilities; 2) to quantify whether toddlers with disabilities are able to have more
      exploratory behaviors and social interactions with ride-on car training through observation
      and wrist-worn accelerators; 3) to determine the critical factors of using the different
      modes of modified ride-on toy car on family perceptions and participation. Independent
      mobility is believed to be essential for perceptual-motor, cognition, language and social
      skill development. It is important to increase independent mobility in toddlers with
      disabilities and further enhance their development, especially socialization. Assertive and
      power mobility devices allow toddlers with disabilities to move independently within their
      environment and may increase the opportunities to explore environment and interact with
      people. However, issues to consider before prescribing an assertive device include factors
      such as age, accessibly to community environments, cost, and social acceptance of the device
      and the adaptability of the device to growth. To address these limitations and meet toddlers'
      needs, the concept of using modified ride-on toy cars (ROC) in therapy becomes a novel
      application. Studies have demonstrated the use of toy cars enhanced a child's motivation,
      socialization and family participation. Investigator preliminary results of the group study
      showed significantly increased mobility, socialization and decreased parenting stress level
      after the toy car training in toddlers with disabilities.

      More percentages of participants in the treatment group had clinical meaningful improvements
      on mobility and social function than the control group. Evidence supported that specificity
      of psychological changes associated with different modes of locomotion, particularly the loco
      motor experience involving motor activity, e.g., postural control; the perceptual information
      (e.g., periphery optical flow) and action experience affect psychological development.

      Therefore, this study is further to examine the effects of ride-on toy car training with two
      different postures, i.e., sitting and standing , on independent mobility, exploration and
      socialization through low-cost, family-centered approach. It will also improve family's
      understanding of children's capabilities, which improves their development. Based on the
      power analysis from the preliminary results of investigator group study, investigators will
      recruit 60 children with disabilities who are between 1 to 3 years old and diagnosed as motor
      delay (&gt;1.5 sd). They will be randomly assigned to one of the following three groups: ROC-Sit
      group, ROC-Stand group and regular therapy group. The whole study duration will be 24 weeks,
      including 12-week intervention and 12-week follow-up; the total amount of treatment will be
      equal for three groups. Standardized assessments are provided for a total of three times
      during the study, including the time before and after the intervention and in the end of the
      follow-up phase. The ROC-Sit and ROC-Stand programs will be administered by the therapist and
      include 120 minutes/per session, 2 sessions/per week. The research team will visit the
      hospital once/per week to provide 60 minutes videotaping and let participants wear wrist-worn
      accelerators. The regular therapy group will continue their regular therapy without any
      additional car driving training. The research team will visit them once/per week for the
      assessments. The assessments include standardized measurements and behavioral coding from the
      videotapes and accelerators.

      The findings of this study will provide a novel therapeutic tool (i.e., combining the
      low-tech modified ride-on cars with different postures) on advancing children's mobility,
      socialization, family participation and development.

      Spontaneous self-initiated actions have consequences, and experiencing these is very
      educational. Children require exploratory behaviors to understand the world and establish the
      knowledge to advance cognition and social interactions. Around the end of the first year,
      typical infants have increased exploration and display a number of advances in their
      interactions with objects and caregivers. Activities with objects become more intentional as
      infants engage with objects of their own choosing and take the lead in initiating object
      exchanges by showing and offering objects to adults. Showing and offering objects to adults
      may enable infants to extend periods of social interactions, thereby providing opportunities
      for infants to learn language and rules of social interaction such as turn-taking. During the
      same time that infants display advances in their interactions with objects and adults, their
      loco motor skills change dramatically. Independent mobility is believed to be essential for
      perceptual-motor and social skill development. Self-produced locomotion is an organizer of
      psychological changes in children's typical development, especially developmental changes in
      perceptions, social understanding, spatial cognitive, and emotions. Crawling and walking
      infants spend enormous time and energy interacting with the space and objects around them.
      When infants gain the ability to move around their environments independently, this milestone
      has been identified as one that transforms their social world by offering interactions that
      include a wider variety of objects and people as well as opportunities to consolidate
      attachment and social referencing skills. Infants' and children's exploratory experience,
      social behaviors and loco motor status are functionally related. There is convincing evidence
      that the use of powered mobility for children with disabilities has positive impacts on their
      overall development and increases their exploration. Studies are focusing on reducing the
      limitations in the areas of social, cognitive, perceptual, and functional development that
      are induced by lack of independent mobility in early ages. Limited evidence also demonstrates
      that early powered mobility training has positive impacts on the family participation,
      including decreasing parents' level of stress and increasing their satisfaction with their
      child's sleep patterns, ability to move out, and ability to interact and socialize with the
      family.

      Pediatric rehabilitation, through training and assistive technology (AT), seeks to provide
      children with disabilities with the same level of mobility, exploration, socialization and
      participation for children with typical development (TD). There are many basic barriers to
      achieving this high standard and no single AT or combination of AT can currently provide the
      level of mobility and exploration that children, families and therapists desire. Currently,
      the most critical barrier to including power mobility in EI programs is the lack of readily
      available power chairs for children younger than 2-3 years of age, the period when mobility
      is rapidly developing for children with TD. Certain characteristics of the most common
      commercial pediatric power wheelchairs limit their use in the home and community spaces such
      as playgrounds. These limitations include price, size and weight, transportation
      requirements, maintenance, aesthetics and social acceptance. Experimental power mobility
      devices (PMD) have the potential to address some of these limitations such as size, weight
      and infant use. Unfortunately these are likely years from commercial availability. Moreover,
      power wheelchairs have historically been designed to address a limited set of goals related
      to mobility with minimal consideration of socialization. Although of increasing interest,
      there is very little empirical evidence of the effects or even feasibility of early power
      mobility training on overall development and the family participation, particularly for
      socialization. Investigator believe there is a need for readily available mobility options
      for immediate use by very young children and their families that address some of the above
      limitations while expanding the role of PMD past simply mobility and into socialization.

      There are four strengths of using ride-on toy cars for mobility. First, the cost is
      comparable or less than most mobility devices. Second, most are relatively lightweight, small
      and easily transported in contrast to power chairs. Third, the child-friendly, colorful toy
      designs are more acceptable to adults and children and likely seen as simply a toy. This may
      be an important aspect for clinicians wanting to start early power mobility training with
      families hesitant to discuss powered chair options. Fourth, because toy cars are simple
      electromagnetically devices, they can be modified quickly and easily to match the child's
      current and/or future abilities and goals. The use of modified ride-on toy cars may provide a
      readily available, convenient and fun way for families, therapists and early educators to
      help young children improve their mobility starting within the first years of life.

      The preliminary study suggests a number of important findings: 1) early power mobility
      training can increase exploratory behaviors and benefit independent mobility; 2) the current
      early power mobility training program can improve socialization and the conventional therapy
      may have the similar effect; 3) the improvements of children's developmental level and
      caregiver's involvement in the training may decrease family stress level and increase family
      participation. The integration of object interaction, sitting and independent locomotion
      presents a grounded view of cognition, which also affects language and social development. In
      investigator preliminary group study, both the early power mobility training and conventional
      therapy provided the opportunity to sit loco mote and interact with various objects. The use
      of a ROC further expands the exploratory opportunities to various environments under the
      toddler's own control. The coordination between vision and posture becomes more finely tuned
      or coupled as experience with self-produced movement permits the functional mapping of
      perception and action. Anderson et al. had constructed their own PMD and pilot tested it
      extensively over two years with 7.5-month-old infants with TD. They noticed that infants were
      able to control forward motion in PMD and the development of postural compensation to
      peripheral flow was facilitated by such experience. The visual-postural coupling is highly
      linked to locomotor experience which further connects to psychological changes. However,
      coordination between vision and action found in one posture is unlikely to generalize to
      other postures.

      In this study, investigator will modify two types of ROCs for toddlers with disabilities for
      the use in clinical settings as part of a 24-week power mobility training program. In
      addition, investigator will compare the effects of applying early power mobility training to
      the regular therapy on development. Investigator will focus on four research questions.
      Specifically, can investigator: 1) use the modified toy cars with two different postures as
      effective power mobility training programs to improve the independent mobility and
      socialization; 2) select a set of dependent measures that quantify whether the children
      increase their exploratory and social behaviors; 3)conduct a hospital-based, power mobility
      training program that results in a high level of fun for the child and compliance by the
      family and therapists. In addition, investigator will examine whether the effects of
      increased independent mobility and socialization will affect toddler's function with the 3
      International Classification of Function (ICF) domains. If investigator results are generally
      positive and show significant differences on independent mobility and socialization among the
      early power mobility training programs with two different postures and regular therapy, it
      will provide us some alternative ways to advance independent mobility and socialization.
      Subsequently, the further randomized controlled trial studies can quantify the effectiveness
      and the feasibility with different treatment intensity and various pediatric populations.

      The specific aims of this study are: 1) to examine the feasibility and effects of ROC
      training with two different postures on mobility and socialization in toddlers with
      disabilities; 2) to quantify whether toddlers with disabilities are able to have more
      exploratory behaviors and social interactions with ROC training through observation and
      wrist-worn accelerometers; 3) to determine the critical factors of using the different modes
      of modified ROC on family perceptions and participation. Through the comparison among the two
      ROC training groups (i.e., treatment groups) and regular therapy group (i.e., control group),
      investigator hypothesize that both groups of ROC training will have more improvements on
      functional mobility, socialization and parenting stress than the control group. Specifically,
      the treatment group of ROC training with standing posture will have more increased social
      function than the sitting posture in the ROC training and control group. In addition,
      toddlers in both treatment groups will have more physical activity for exploration, in
      comparison with the control group. Investigator also hypothesize that ROC training with
      different postures will elicit different family perceptions on the child's capabilities and
      themselves, i.e., caregivers, in comparison with the regular therapy.

      Study Design: A multiple group pretest-posttest control group design will be applied. Three
      groups will be involved in this project: ride-on car with sitting posture (ROC-Sit), ride-on
      car with standing posture (ROC-Stand) and regular therapy. The participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of the three groups by using the well-sealed, opaque envelopes when they are
      recruited in the study. Once the participants are recruited in the study, the research team
      will modify a toy car based on each participant's group and capabilities during this
      pre-intervention phase (the first two or three weeks before intervention starts), e.g., seat
      and steering wheel modifications. All the modifications can be disassembled so they can be
      adjusted based on each participant's progress during the intervention. The study duration for
      each participant is 24-week, including 12-week intervention and 12-week follow-up.

      Participants in the study will be 60 infants or preschool children ages 12 months to 36
      months with motor delays (sd &gt; 1.5). The age group of infants/preschool children was selected
      based on the previous studies on early power mobility training in infants and preschool
      children. Power mobility training was typically offered to children between two and six years
      of age, with three years being the average age of the youngest child being recommended for a
      powered chair. However, studies showed that early power mobility training was feasible for
      7-month-old infants and 18-month-old children with mobility disabilities.

      Recruitment: The children will be recruited from self-referrals, health care practitioners,
      or the hospitals in Taipei and Taoyuan, Taiwan where children with motor delays (&gt;1.5 sd) are
      receiving outpatient rehabilitation. The research team will initially post flyers describing
      the study at clinical settings and contacted the therapists in the clinical settings to
      introduce the goals,criteria and general procedure of the study. Parents/guardians will
      obtain information about the study through the flyers and their therapists.
      Parents/guardians, who are interested and whose children met the criteria of diagnosis, age,
      capability determined by the doctor and their therapists, are given contact information for
      the investigator. After receiving contact information, the research team will contact the
      parents/guardian and/or therapists for scheduling a date of further testing by the research
      team at the hospital. When the research team contacts the parents, study will be explained
      and parents will receive a letter detailing the procedure and given an opportunity to ask
      questions. Parents/guardians will sign this informed consent form at the time of the first
      visit.

      Procedure: Before the pre-intervention assessments, the research team will modify the car's
      seat and acceleration to the hand switch-driven, which allows the car to be derivable for the
      participant who meets the inclusion criteria. Each participant of the ROC training groups
      will have either a customized, sitting-style toy car or a standing-style toy car, depending
      on the assigned group. In addition to the original design of the sitting-style toy car in
      investigator previous studies, investigator have added the seat height, extra seat belts and
      pipe frame to ensure the participant's safety and the whole device's stability during the
      standing mode of locomotion. The adaptations are all assembled by PVC pipes which can be
      adjusted easily during each training session. After modifications, they will receive
      pre-intervention assessments, including behavioral videotaping and developmental assessments.
      The developmental assessments will occur at the first and last week of the 12-week
      intervention, and the end of the 12-week follow-up phase. A therapist who does not involve in
      the intervention and is blinded to the study purpose will complete all the developmental
      tests. The driving and socialization behaviors will be videotaped by the research team for 1
      hour/per session, 1 session/per week before, during and after the intervention phase at the
      hospital. In addition, participants will wear two accelerometers on their wrists to monitor
      the physical activity during the 1 hour videotaping session. All videotapes will be coded by
      two independent coders, who are undergraduate students. Prior to making their ratings, the
      coder is instructed as to coding procedures by the PI, but he/she is not informed about the
      group assignment and the purpose of the study.

      Intervention The research team will ask caregivers to identify goals (before intervention),
      and measure progress using goal-attainment scaling (GAS) before and after the intervention
      for the three groups. All three groups will continue their regular therapy during the
      intervention phase.

      Ride-On Cars with Sitting Posture (ROC-Sit) The research team will ask caregivers to identify
      goals, and measure progress using goal-attainment scaling (GAS). The regular therapy group
      will continue the regular therapy, including physical, occupational and speech therapy. In
      addition, they will receive training program in a hospital for 2 hours/per session, 2
      sessions/per week for a total of 12-week intervention. The general propose of the training is
      to improve the developmental scales, mobility, socialization and upper limb use in functional
      tasks. The participants will also experience the two 30-minute car driving sessions during
      the whole 2-hour training. The difference between the regular therapy group and the two ROC
      groups is the experience of car driving is controlled by the therapist, i.e. passive
      locomotion. Investigator will discuss with the clinical therapist who will provide training
      program in a hospital for 2 hours/per session, 2 sessions/per week for a total of 12-week
      intervention. Each week the research team will videotape the child's natural play and driving
      performance for the first hour of training session during the intervention phase. The 2-hour
      training session is composed of two 30-minute driving sessions and two 25-minute natural play
      sessions, with a 10-minute break. Every week's treatment program will be preplanned and
      adjusted by the therapist and the caregivers through discussion and clinical observation of
      participant's performance in the previous session. Training will concentrate on building the
      concept of casual-effect on the switch and car motion, goal-oriented driving in a hospital,
      upper limb use in functional tasks with driving and hand use in functional tasks for
      exploration in natural play session, discussed by the family, the treating therapist and the
      research team. The car driving training includes 2 phases: I-car exploration and II-prompted
      driving. Participants can learn how to move and stop the car in the car exploration phase.
      Through prompted driving in phase II, they can use the car as a mean to explore environments
      (e.g., to the elevator, to different stores) and contact with people (e.g., drive to the
      caregiver and get the toy).

      Ride-On Cars with Standing Postures (ROC-Stand) Most of the guidelines are similar with
      ROC-Sit, except for the posture of driving. The training time and period is the same as
      ROC-Sit. The two 30-minute driving sessions can also be divided into 4 times of 15-minute
      sessions, depending on the child's standing ability with supported condition.

      Regular Therapy Program The research team will ask caregivers to identify goals (before
      intervention), and measure progress using goal-attainment scaling (GAS). The regular therapy
      group will continue the regular therapy, including physical, occupational and speech therapy.
      The general propose of the training is to improve the developmental scales, mobility,
      socialization and upper limb use in functional tasks. The research team will videotape the
      child's natural play and driving performance at the hospital for 1 hour/per session, 1
      session/per week during the 12-week intervention phase.

      Follow-up This period will focus on the 12-week follow-up after receiving a treatment
      program. No treatment programs will be delivered to the participants. The research team will
      still videotape the child's natural play and driving performance at the hospital for 1 hour
      /per session, 1 session/per week during the 12-week follow-up phase.

      Data Reduction and Analysis All videotapes will be coded by two independent coders, who are
      undergraduate students. Prior to making their ratings, the coder is instructed as to coding
      procedures, but he/she is not informed about the group assignment and the purpose of the
      study.

      From the 1 hour filmed session during intervention, each participant's 20 'most active'
      minutes of 2 trainings (i.e., 10 minutes of driving and 10 minutes of natural play) are
      selected for coding according to the following priority: first, all minutes when the
      participant is moving in space such as driving, and physically or verbally interacting with a
      caregiver, therapist or peer; second, all remaining minutes when the participant is moving in
      space without interaction; third, minutes of interacting while stationary but with body
      movement; fourth, minutes interacting while stationary with no body movement; fifth, minutes
      of body movement while stationary and not interacting; last, minutes stationary with no body
      movement and no interactions. Thus, the 20-minute 'most-active' minutes are categorized as
      10-minute 'Car Play' (from driving training) and 10-minute 'Natural Play'. Mobility Measures
      The following measures were obtained via video coding the 10-minute Car Play during
      pre-intervention, intervention and post-intervention phases to determine the feasibility of
      learning to drive the car:

        1. Driving Categories (time in seconds)

             1. Independent Mobility: When the child independently drives the car preceded by an
                independent switch contact without an adult's assistance.

             2. Assisted Mobility: When an adult puts the child's hand on the switch but he
                independently pushes the switch to begin driving.

             3. Caregiver Mobility: When the child drove with an adult's hand directly on top of
                his hand.

        2. Visual Attention to Switch: The frequency (number of times) that the child looked at the
           switch during the 10-minute driving.

        3. Stopping Categories (number of times divided by total times goal was presented)

             1. Independent Stop: When the child independently moves his hand off the switch and
                makes the car stop within one car length of the goal location.

             2. Stops with Verbal Cues: When the child moves his hand off the switch as the car
                arrives the goal only after verbal cues given from an adult

             3. Stops with Tactile Contacts: When the child moves his hand off the switch as the
                car arrives the goal only after tactile cues (e.g., touching his hand or moving his
                hand off the switch) given from an adult Socialization Measures

      To examine the impact of independent mobility on the socialization during the 10-minute
      Natural Play and 10-minute Car Play, the following measures will be obtained via coding video
      footage during pre-intervention, intervention and post-intervention:

        1. Reaching for toy/person: The frequency (number of times) that the child initially
           extends arms to the play toy/interacting person.

        2. Initiation of contact with others: peer-directed or adult-directed: Target
           child-initiated contacts with others are counted whenever two conditions are met: (1)
           the target child initiates the contact with another individual without any observable
           prompting or initiating behavior on the part of another person and (2) the target child
           independently vocalizes (with either comprehensible words or other vocalizations,
           including shouting, laughing, grunting, etc.) or physically points to, touches, or
           indicates that he or she wants something from another individual. Target child-initiated
           contacts and vocalizations are divided into two categories: (a) peer-directed and (b)
           adult-directed.

        3. Other initiated contacts: contact by peers or by adults: Peer-initiated contacts are
           defined as any child initiating any type of contact with the target child (e.g., talking
           to the child, touching the child or a mobility device the child is using, giving a toy
           or item to the child, taking a toy or item away from the child). Adult-initiated
           contacts with the target child are: (a) carrying, moving, or otherwise touching the
           child or the device in which the child is seated (e.g., swing, wheelchair, toy car); (b)
           taking a toy or item away from the child

        4. Facial Expression: The frequency (number of times) of both positive and negative facial
           expressions appeared during interaction. Positive was determined to include smiling and
           laughing. Negative was determined to include discomfort, crying and unhappy facial
           expression.

        5. Vocalization/Gesture: The frequency (number of times) that the child vocalizes/gestures
           to a play toy or person, including grunting, shouting, vowel-type sounds (e.g., ee, i,
           ah, oo u).

      Repeated measure one way ANOVA will be used to compare the mean difference of using different
      toy cars on mobility, socialization and exploratory behaviors before and after the
      intervention, and after 12-week follow-up, i.e., within group comparison. One way ANOVA will
      be used to compare the mean difference of all developmental tests, participation and physical
      activity for exploration among three groups before and after the intervention and the end of
      follow-up phase.
