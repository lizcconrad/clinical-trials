  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a common chronic musculoskeletal pain disorder of unknown
      etiology, characterized by generalized body pain, hyperalgesia and other functional and
      emotional comorbidities. Women are predominantly affected. Long term prognosis of FMS might
      be severe by its physical and psychological consequences. The etiology of FMS remains unknown
      but recent studies suggest a disorder of central pain modulation, neurotransmitters,
      sympatho-adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system and peripheral muscles issues.
      Indeed, muscular abnormalities with a decrease of ATP and micro vascularization have been
      reported, inducing muscle weakness and local biochemical changes that participate to pain
      hyper sensitivity. Treatment of FMS is only symptomatic, often difficult, associating
      pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies. Massages are largely used in FMS and are
      included in chronic pain management recommendations.

      Massages are recognized as haptic when the hands of the practitioner move on the skin of the
      patient; haptic massage is superficial if the pressure applied on the skin is similar to the
      weight of the hand and it's a deep haptic massage when the pressure applied is over the
      weight of the hand, allowing reaching deep muscle structure. Deep haptic massages are largely
      used for athlete to improve muscle recovery and treat tendinitis. All massages evaluate in
      FMS are superficial haptic massage; they are recognized as efficient on pain, anxiety and
      depression if they are performed at least on 5 weeks but these effects are transient et
      remain to be optimized. The efficacy of deep haptic massage has not been evaluated in
      pathological conditions. The investigators hypothesize that, in FMS patients, deep
      intramuscular maneuvers may solicit sensitive receptors, stimulating large caliber fibers A
      lemniscal conveyed by the way that bypass chronic pain information carried by the C fibers of
      the extra-lemniscal pathway: this is the &quot;Gate Control&quot; theory for inhibiting pain
      information.

    <time_frame>At the end of 6 weeks of deep haptic massage at 2 sessions of 30 minutes per week.</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effectiveness of the Massage Haptic in 20 women with FMS (defined according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology and active disease defined by a Widespread Pain Index (WPI)vscore ≥ 7 and a symptom severity score (SS) ≥ 5 or WPI between 3 and 6 and SS score ≥ 9), recruited in the clinics of the Rheumatology Department of Nice, after 6 weeks of deep haptic massage at 2 sessions of 30 minutes per week.
Primary endpoint: overall score of impact questionnaire fibromyalgia (QIF). Indeed, in the fibromyalgia studies QIF is used as a criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of drug treatments like non-drug treatments.</description>
