      The research questions are:

        1. What is the proportion of women undergoing hysterectomy after hysteroscopic
           sterilization or laparoscopic tubal ligation?

        2. What is the proportion of women undergoing salpingectomy, salpingostomy, or hysteroscopy
           after hysteroscopic sterilization or laparoscopic tubal ligation?

        3. What is the proportion of women who have a diagnosis of pelvic pain after hysteroscopic
