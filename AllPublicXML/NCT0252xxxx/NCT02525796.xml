      This study will evaluate whether blocking the mineralocorticoid receptor, alone, or in
      combination with the calcimimetic cinacalcet, can lower parathyroid hormone and calcium
      levels in primary hyperparathyroidism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized intervention study to investigate
      whether mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonism, alone or in combination with cinacalcet,
      is an effective therapy for primary hyperparathyroidism (P-HPTH).

      Hypothesis: MR antagonism, as a monotherapy or in combination with a calcimimetic, is a
      mechanism to lower parathyroid hormone (PTH) in primary hyperparathyroidism (P-HPTH).

      Study Design: Sixty subjects with P-HPTH will be enrolled to randomly receive eplerenone (a
      potassium-sparing diuretic that directly blocks the MR), amiloride (a potassium-sparing
      diuretic that does not directly block the MR), or placebo for 4 weeks. Thereafter, all
      subjects will receive cinacalcet therapy (a calcimimetic that lowers PTH) in addition to
      their randomized intervention for an additional 2 weeks.

      Anticipated Results: In this proof-of-concept study, eplerenone therapy will lower PTH, serum
      calcium, and markers of bone resorption in P-HPTH, when compared to placebo. The PTH response
      to amiloride will resemble that of placebo, suggesting that the eplerenone mediated
      reductions in PTH are specific to interactions with the MR. Combination therapy with
      eplerenone + cinacalcet will result in additive or synergistic reductions in PTH, when
      compared to placebo + cinacalcet or placebo + amiloride.

      Implications: MR antagonism (alone or in combination with cinacalcet) may be a mechanism to
      lower PTH and calcium in P-HPTH, thereby identifying a new potential option in the limited
      medical therapies for P-HPTH.
