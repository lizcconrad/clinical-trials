  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in Denmark, annually 4,200 men and women
      are diagnosed and approx. 2000 patients die of their colorectal cancer. As with other
      cancers, the risk of colorectal cancer increases with age, and the median age at diagnosis is
      71 years. Improved treatment has increased the number of survivors with an expected 5-year
      survival rate of 50-60%. Characteristic of this group of patients is that at the time of
      diagnosis they often live with comorbidities and have limited leisure time physical activity.

      There is evidence that rehabilitation in the form of physical exercise for cancer patients
      after their initial treatment has a positive effect on a number of physical and psychological
      parameter such as health-related quality of life, physical capacity and physical function,
      fatigue, anxiety and depression. However, the most frequently studied diagnosis group is
      women with breast cancer. Until now only few studies have evaluated the effects of physical
      activity among colorectal cancer patients receiving chemotherapy

      The purpose of this study is: to examine the effect of two different training initiatives -
      12 weeks progressive, high-intensity training versus low intensity exercise intervention - on
      physical, emotional and social habitus, in sedentary patients with colorectal cancer during
      adjuvant chemotherapy.

      The hypothesis of the study are: 1. That both interventions will show a positive association
      between increased physical capacity (measured by aerobic capacity VO2-peak / peak oxygen
      uptake) and improved physical function, reduced fatigue and anxiety in the included sedentary
      colorectal cancer patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy.

      Participants: Patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer who have
      self-reported physical activity level below the national recommended levels (less than 150
      min/week of moderate leisure time physical activity, and exercises at least 20 minutes of
      strenuous physical activity twice a week).

      Benefits and risks of participating: Possible benefits of the interventions: to reduce
      treatment related symptoms and side-effects, increase vitality and well-being and promote
      lifestyle changes among sedentary colorectal cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.
      At participation in the interventions minor sports injuries may occur.
