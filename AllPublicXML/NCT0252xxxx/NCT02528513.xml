      The purpose of this study was to evaluate effects, safety and cost of midazolam used alone or
      sequential use of midazolam and propofol/dexmedetomidine for long-term sedation in critically
      ill, mechanically ventilated patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that sedation is frequently required as a component of compassionate care in
      critically ill patients. Until now, there is no ideal sedation drug and every sedation drug
      has its advantage and disadvantage for long-term sedation in critically ill, mechanically
      ventilated patients. The sequential use of midazolam and propofol for long-term sedation was
      associated with a faster recovery, earlier extubation, shorter mechanical ventilation time
      and less cost of total ICU treatment compared with midazolam alone, The protocol was
      associated with less cost of pharmaceutical sedation compared with propofol alone. But,
      propofol and midazolam may cause respiratory depression and delirium. Both drugs should be
      stopped after the patient passed the screen of weaning from mechanical ventilation, then it
      would induce the stress response and agitation, it would cause prolonged sedation and delay
      extubation.

      Dexmedetomidine is a centrally acting a2-receptor agonist, has less effect on arousability
      and respiratory depression. The purpose of this study was to evaluate effects, safety and
      cost of midazolam used alone or sequential use of midazolam and propofol/dexmedetomidine for
      long-term sedation in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients.
