      A multiple-center, open-label, randomized, daily dose, two-sequence, two-way crossover
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) study of BiDil XR capsules and commercial
      BiDil tablets in Self-identified Black Patients, who are Slow Acetylators, with Heart Failure
      and have not received BiDil, isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), or hydralazine hydrochloride (HCl)
      for at least 30 days prior to screening. The study consists of two doses of BiDil XR capsules
      (dosed at 0 hr and 9 hr) and three doses of BiDil tablets (dosed at 0 hr, 6 hr and 12 hr).
