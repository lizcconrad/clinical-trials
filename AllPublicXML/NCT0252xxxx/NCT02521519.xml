    <textblock>
      This study compares the efficacy of medial branch block (MBB) vs. paravertebral deep
      intramuscular (PDI) injection for pain relief in chronic low back pain. Based on
      randomization in first intervention session, one side receives MBB and the other side takes
      PDI and in second session the pattern reverses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain relief following medial branch block (MBB) might be due to facet joints desensitization
      and/or myofascial trigger points' desensitization. Patients will be randomized to two groups.
      The first group receives MBB in one side and paravertebral deep intramuscular (PDI) injection
      in the other side of the back. Next week the pattern of injection will be reversed so the
      side which had received MBB will take PDI injection and PDI side will take MBB. Second group
      takes the intervention in reverse order.

    <description>medial branch block (MBB): Using sterile conditions, 25 gauge needles will be placed in the desired position. In its final position for the L3 and L4 vertebrae the needle tip should reside at the junction of the superior articular process and the transverse process. At the L5-S1 level the needle tip should reach the junction between the sacral ala and the superior articular process of S1. Following a negative aspiration 0.5ml of injectate will be injected into each site.</description>

    <description>These injections will target the deep para-spinal muscles between the spinous process and inter-pedicular line of the L3-5 vertebrae. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 25-gauge needle will be advanced, directed towards the lamina at the mid-distance between inter-pedicular line and the spinous process of the L3, L4 and L5 vertebrae, until touching the bone. A straight forceps will be attached to the junction of the skin and the needle; the needle will then be withdrawn by 1.4cm, to reside inside the muscle bulk. A five ml syringe diameter will be used to point 1.4 cm withdrawal. Following a negative blood aspiration, each level will be injected with 0.5 ml of the injectate.</description>
