  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the evidence that periostin is specifically involved in intra-cortical remodeling
      control, our working hypothesis is that assessment of its concentration in the serum would be
      helpful in identifying patients with severe cortical porosity, a critical parameter in bone
      fragility. Periostin expression by osteoblasts and osteocytes is part of the bone cortical
      response to anabolic stimuli such as mechanical strain or intermittent increase in
      parathyroid hormone. However, it remains unknown whether this expression may participate as
      well to mechanisms that will lead to exaggerated intra-cortical remodeling and subsequent
      bone loss.

      In rare clinical situations in which trans-iliac bone biopsies will be necessary to better
      understand their bone status in addition to densitometry and biological bone markers
      assessment, specific analyses using immune-staining techniques will be performed on the bone
      sample. Data from routine follow-up every six months will be also collected in this specific
      sub-group.

      High resolution peripheral quantitative computerized tomography (HR-pQCT) gives the
      opportunity of performing a virtual bone biopsy providing information on trabecular and
      cortical microarchitecture in vivo. These microarchitectural parameters allow a more accurate
      evaluation of the alteration of the bone structure and therefore of the fracture risk as
      compared to current tools used in clinical practice such as densitometry. However, the
      availability of such HRpQCT facilities is limited and there is on-going development on the
      best way of measuring porosity for example. The definition of a biological profile including
      key proteins such as periostin and sclerostin involved in porosity mechanisms is therefore of
      great interest. A better understanding of the relationship between bone matrix components and
      parathyroid hormone effects also appears as critical. Follow-up of routine evaluation
      parameters reflecting bone status in a subgroup of specific patients could also provide new
      and additional information.
