    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) is commonly encountered in primary and
      secondary-care practice. There are various triggers including diet. There is a growing number
      of people taking a gluten-free diet (GFD) of their own volition even in the absence of
      coeliac disease (CD). The investigators aim to assess whether a GFD could be of benefit to
      patients with IBS-D, previously naive to the effects of gluten and in whom CD has been
      excluded as per normal duodenal biopsies. The investigators will also assess whether certain
      factors may predict a clinical responder such as the presence or absence of at-risk coeliac
      serology.

    <measure>Assess whether patients opt to continue with a GFD of their own volition</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 years</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of the six-week GFD trial period, patients will be asked whether or not they plan to continue with a GFD of their own volition. This will be assessed by a &quot;yes/no&quot; answer. Those who choose to do so will now be followed-up under routine clinical care over the next 1-2 years. This will allow the investigators to assess whether symptom-remission is maintained by using the same questionnaires mentioned in outcomes 1 to 4. It will also allow the investigators to monitor well-being in the form of body-mass index and serum haematinics (vitamin B12, folate, ferritin, albumin, haemoglobin).</description>

    <description>Patients with IBS-D will commence a gluten-free diet for 6 weeks following dietetic input. They will be informed they do not have coeliac disease. They will however be blinded to whether or not they have any markers of at-risk serology. They will self-complete validated questionnaires over 6 weeks. Any subjects who opt to continue with a gluten-free diet thereafter of their own volition will be kept under observation as per routine clinical care.</description>
