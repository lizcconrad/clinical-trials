  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many type 2 diabetic men have low serum testosterone levels. Our aim in this trial is to
      check if there is a correlation between serum or hair testosteron levels and serum or hair
      cortisol levels in type 2 diabetic men. We'll also examine whether there is a correlation
      between serum and hair testosterone levels and cortisol levels and serum inflammatory
      markers.

      If such correlation will be found- then it is possible that excess cortisol or an abnormal
      inflammatory status- may cause the low testosterone levels that seen in type 2 diabetic men.

      Eligible participants are type 2 diabetic men who visit our clinic, as part of their routine
      medical surveillance, and other 10 healthy volunteers (men) as a control group.

      All the participants will sign an informed consent form. The study will include 30 type 2
      diabetic men, (40-55 years old) and 10 healthily volunteers (same age group).

      In addition to routine blood test of blood count, kidney function and liver enzymes will be
      taken blood samples of total testosterone serum levels, total cortisol serum levels and serum
      inflammation markers levels, and also a sample of head-hair for cortisol and testosterone
      levels (1 cm of occipital hair weighing 50 mg).

      Optional: from patients who will agree to visit the clinic after 8 hours-fast will be also
      taken one additional blood sample of fasting glucose, insulin and C-peptide levels, in order
      to estimate their insulin resistance status, and it's possible correlation to the other
      measures.

      From the 10 healthy volunteers In addition will be taken blood and hair samples of the above
      parameters, as a control.
