  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a study to learn more about the spread of HIV infection
      within different geographic regions and populations in San Diego County, with the goal of
      demonstrating that early use of HIV treatment can reduce the number of new infections in our
      community. At the study visits, participants will be examined by the study staff and asked to
      donate some blood. Participants will also be asked several questions about themselves, their
      background, behaviors, health, and the general geographic area in which they live. By
      collecting information about antiretroviral treatment choices that are made by study
      participants, the investigators will be better able to measure how effectively HIV treatment
      can interrupt (i.e., block) the spread of HIV. All of the information gathered at the study
      visits will be de-identified and analyzed. Study staff will use the information to better
      understand in which groups of people, and in what areas of San Diego, HIV is spreading most
      quickly. This information will be used to determine how well Antiretroviral Therapy (HIV
      treatment) by certain individuals can control the spread of HIV within the population.

      Blood Draws: Approximately 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of blood will be taken for blood tests and
      storage at each visit. Participants' blood will be tested for:

        -  CD4+/CD8+ T-cell Count. This is a measure of the immune system; T-cells help the immune
           system fight infections.

        -  HIV-1 RNA (Viral Load). This measures the amount of HIV in the blood.

        -  HIV pol sequence. This measures the type of HIV in your blood.

        -  Blood will be collected for storage for future HIV testing, studies to measure the
           amount of residual HIV that remains in people who are doing well on HIV treatment,
           genetic testing of the HIV virus and possible HLA genotype testing as determined by the
           results of this and future studies.
