      The main objective is to evaluate the concentration of allergen extract of Betula verrucosa
      that elicit a papule equivalent to that produced by a solution of histamine dihydrochloride
      10 mg / ml in size.

    <description>The investigational product contained the allergen extract of the pollen of Betula verrucosa and will be tested by administration onto skin. The test will be carried out on the forearm following prick test technique.
The allergen extract of the pollen of Betula verrucosa will be tested in four concentrations (100, 50, 25 and 10 HEP/mL).</description>

          -  Subjects who have previously received immunotherapy in the last 5 years for the
             treatment of asthma or the allergic rhinoconjunctivitis induced by allergens that may
             interfere with the allergen from Betula extract verrucosa
