  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a heterogeneous disorder with multifactorial pathophysiology.
      Patients with FD have visceral hypersensitivity to mechanical and chemical stimuli. Several
      previous studies have described an increased chemosensitivity to oral capsaicin ingestion.
      Capsaicin is a natural agonist of TRPV-1 receptors present on afferent sensory neurons.
      Activation of the TRPV-1 receptor by capsaicin or other agonists results in the release of
      several neuropeptides (i.e. substance P, somatostatin). Besides, increased duodenal
      permeability and disruption of tight junction structure in FD patients compared to healthy
      volunteers has been reported in a recent study. In this observational study investigators
      will evaluate the role of the TRPV-1 neuropeptide pathway in patients with functional
      dyspepsia and healthy controls.

    <measure>TRPV-1 neuropeptide pathway (TRPV-1 and mucosal neuropeptides)</measure>
    <time_frame>Test day 1: mucosal biopsies are taken during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is the TRPV-1 neuropeptide pathway which includes both TRPV-1 and mucosal neuropeptide concentrations (e.g. substance P, somatostatin), assessed with real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and radioimmunoassay respectively.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom scores for psychopathology</measure>
    <time_frame>14-day period between testday 1 and testday 2</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and GAD-7 questionnaires will be used for the assessment of depressive and anxiety disorders respectively.
During 7 consecutive days a digital device will be carried out for assessment of symptoms several times a day (experience sampling method/ESM).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom scores for dyspepsia</measure>
    <time_frame>14-day period between testday 1 and testday 2</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspeptic symptoms will be measured with two questionnaires to acquire more detailed information about complaints in patients with functional dyspepsia. The dyspepsia symptom questionnaire and the symptom checklist of the Nepean Dyspepsia Index will be used to grade the presence and intensity of dyspeptic symptoms.
In addition, participants will report dyspeptic symptoms during 14 consecutive days in an end-of-day diary.
During 7 consecutive days a digital device will be carried out for assessment of symptoms several times a day (experience sampling method/ESM).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom scores for quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>This questionnaire is fulfilled once, in the 14-day period between testday 1 and testday 2</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed with the Health Survey 26 (SF-36) questionnaire.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postprandial symptoms after ingestion of a standardized meal</measure>
    <time_frame>Testday 2: Postprandial symptoms are scored using a Likert scale at 15-minute intervals for a period of 240 minutes postprandial.</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>In vivo gastroduodenal and small intestinal permeability</measure>
    <time_frame>Day before testday 2</time_frame>
    <description>Gastroduodenal en small intestinal permeability will be assessed with a multisugar test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Transcription of genes encoding for proteins involved in mucosal barrier function and symptom perception</measure>
    <time_frame>Testday 1: gastric and duodenal biopsies are taken during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serotonin metabolism in plasm</measure>
    <time_frame>Testday 2: blood samples for serotonin analyses are taken preprandial and every 30 minutes after intake of a standardized meal during 240 minutes postprandial.</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastric emptying for solids using the 13C-sodium octanoate stable isotope breath test</measure>
