    <textblock>
      Two-month randomized trial comparing three groups: self-refraction with adjustable glasses,
      receiving adjustable glasses; subjective refraction by an expert refractionist after computer
      optometry and receiving custom standard glasses; subjective refraction by an expert
      refractionist after computer optometry and receiving ready-made glasses.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  11-16 years old middle school students from two locations in Guangdong Province.

          -  With ≤ -1.00 Diopter of myopic refractive error in each eye.

          -  With uncorrected vision ≤ 6/12 in both eyes thought to be due to refractive error
             (that is, correctable to at least 6/7.5 with subjective refraction by an optometrist).

          -  With informed consents(There are two types of informed consents. One of them is
             whether the parents of the students agree their kids to participate in the project.
             The other informed consent is whether the parents agree their kids to have the
             cycloplegic refraction. If the students were admitted to participate in project but
             without being agreed to have cycloplegic refraction by their parents , they would have
             non cycloplegic retinoscopy.).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those corrected VA can not up to 6/7.5 with subjective refraction by an optometrist.

          -  Those with significant strabismus or vision abnormality (keratopathy, cataract,
             vitreous macular diseases ), or with vision deficiency ( amblyopia ) children are to
             be excluded.

          -  Children developing acquired vision problems other than myopia.
