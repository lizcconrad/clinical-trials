  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate respiratory parameters of a person in the simulated
      avalanche snow and consequent use of the measured data for development of a
      mathematical-physical model of breathing during increasing hypercapnia in the avalanche.

      The study is a part of a university research project aimed at studying physiological
      conditions and development of breathing parameters of a person breathing in the simulated
      avalanche snow. Presence of an air pocket and its size play an important role in survival of
      victims buried in the avalanche snow. Even small air pockets facilitate breathing, yet they
      do not provide a significant amount of fresh air for breathing. The investigators hypothesize
      that the size of the air pocket significantly affects the airflow resistance and work of
      breathing. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of the air pocket volume on gas
      exchange and work of breathing in subjects breathing into the simulated avalanche snow and to
      test, whether it is possible to breathe with zero air pocket.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants were volunteers from the Czech Army forces, studying at the Military
             Department of the Faculty of Physical Education and Sport, Charles University in
             Prague. All subjects were healthy and fit, classified as ASA I, all without a smoking
             history. The volunteers were highly motivated to participate in the experiment. The
             entrance examination, completed before the start of the study, included these tests:
             electrocardiography, blood pressure, spirometry, and assessment of the health
             conditions and family anamnesis by a physician with a specialty in anesthesia and
             critical care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The exclusion criteria were Tiffeneau Index less than 0.70 and any cardiovascular or
             respiratory condition.
