  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1A/B study consisting of three parts. Part A is a non-randomised, open-label,
      sequential evaluation of the safety, pharmacokinetics, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and
      recommended dose (RD) of ETC-1922159 in patients with advanced or metastatic, or unresectable
      solid malignancies, for whom no approved treatment option or standard of care is available.
      Dose escalation, with the goal of identifying the MTD and RD, will be guided by an ordinal
      continual reassessment method (oCRM) model with a cohort size of one patient.

      Part A extension is a non-randomised, non-comparative, open-label evaluation of the safety
      and tolerability of ETC-1922159 together with the bone protective treatment (denosumab) in
      patients with advanced or metastatic, or unresectable solid malignancies, for whom no
      approved treatment option or standard of care is available.

      Part B will be a non-randomised, non-comparative, open-label evaluation of the safety and
      tolerability of the RD of ETC 1922159 in patients with advanced or metastatic, or
      unresectable solid malignancies, for whom no approved treatment option or standard of care is
      available, with a molecular phenotype that is expected to make them sensitive to PORCN
      inhibitor treatment.

      It is anticipated that the study will take approximately 42 months to complete (approximately
      30 months for Part A and Part A extension, and approximately 12 months for Part B).
