    <textblock>
      The goal in this study is to determine if there is a significant difference in the quality of
      sedation between two standard sedation techniques and between two doses of dexmedetomidine
      for children undergoing (TTE).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatients scheduled to receive sedation for transthoracic echocardiography

          -  Subject must be a candidate for both types of anesthetic and both doses of
             dexmedetomidine

          -  Must be 3 months to 36 months of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a history of cardiac conduction system disease (e.g. 1st or 2nd degree
             AV block) or channelopathy (e.g. long QT).

          -  The subject is taking digoxin, alpha-adrenergic or beta-adrenergic agonist or
             antagonist (e.g., clonidine, propranolol, albuterol), anti-arrhythmic medications, or
             vasodilators (e.g. ACE inhibitors)

          -  The subject has received a dose of any other sedative within 48 hours.

          -  The subject has life-threatening, medical conditions (American Society of
             Anesthesiologists Physical Status 4, 5). The American Society of Anesthesiologists
             (ASA) classification scale is a measure of physical status or how healthy the patient
             is. For our study, we will focus on children which are defined as ASA I, II or III
             which means a healthy child (ASA I), a child with a systemic disease that is mild and
             well controlled (ASA II) or a child with systemic disease that is severe and
             controlled (ASA III).

          -  The subject is allergic to or has a contraindication to any of the drugs used in the
             study.

          -  The subject has previously been treated under this protocol.

          -  The subject has severe coarctation of the aorta (risk of exaggerated vasoconstriction)

          -  The subject has Moyamoya disease (risk of recurrent stroke)
