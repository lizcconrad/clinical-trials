    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the investigators assessment, based on a complete
             medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (BP - Blood Pressure, PR
             - Puls Rate), 12-lead ECG (Electrocardiogram), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 45 years (incl.)

          -  BMI (Body Mass Index) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with GCP and local legislation

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including BP - Blood Pressure, PR - Pulse Rate
             or ECG - Electrocardiogram) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant
             by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 45 to 90 bpm

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy and/or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy and
             simple hernia repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  Further exclusion criteria apply
