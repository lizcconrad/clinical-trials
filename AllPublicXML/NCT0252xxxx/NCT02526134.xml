  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the rate of patients in whom a significant change in
      the area to be irradiated will be observed between the assessment before and after laying the
      evaluation of Trustees.

      The centering of radiotherapy is done with the pre-radiation scanner for tracking the
      implementation of target skin markers. On this scanner, it is often difficult for the
      radiation therapist to pinpoint the target volume. To improve the definition of the target
      volume, image fusion techniques with other imaging tests were developed.

      To improve the pre-radiotherapy identification, setting up markers echo-endoscopy has been
      described without major complications. The impact on targeting radiotherapy was mainly
      described for the prostate.

      The marking of digestive tumors was described by the establishment of Trustees, radiopaque
      markers in the lymph nodes, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and bile ducts.
