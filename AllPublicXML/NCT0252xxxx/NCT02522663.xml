  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic Valve Replacement (AVR) surgery for aortic valve disease continues to increase in
      numbers. With better surgical techniques and equipment, also older patients can be operated
      on, resulting in an growth of the older population. AVR is characterized by high rates of
      hospital readmissions, resulting in suboptimal care planning and higher health care costs.
      Hence, it is important to develop strategies to reduce hospital readmissions following AVR.
      The purpose if this study is to develop and test the efficacy of a 24/7-phone support in the
      reduction of readmissions after AVR treatment. Secondary outcomes are a reduced level of
      anxiety, less depressive symptoms and a better health related quality of life.
