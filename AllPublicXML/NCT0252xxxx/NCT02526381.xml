      Clinical study on patients with turbid phlegm and blood stasis syndrome and Qi -Yin
      Deficiency syndrome of coronary artery disease (CHD) compared with normal cases will be
      launched. Detection of lipid metabolism, inflammation medium, endothelial cell injury, blood
      coagulation function evaluation of the relationship between disease and biochemical basis,
      detect plasma metabonomics and the gene expression profile chip, with &quot;phlegm - lipid
      metabolic disorder&quot;, &quot;stasis - microcirculation disorder&quot;, &quot;alternating knot - inflammation
      mediated&quot; and other system related to the biological basis. With Danlou Tablet for treatment,
      the investigators can observe result/effect index of turbid phlegm and blood stasis syndrome.
      Through comprehensive comparison of multi-level, multi-targets and multi-date biological
      index to discuss its sickness-syndrome-prescription corresponding relation and its biological
      basis.
