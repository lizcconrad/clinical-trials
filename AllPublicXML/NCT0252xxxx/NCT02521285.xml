      This randomized phase II trial studies the safety of and how well aspirin works in preventing
      Barrett's esophagus from returning after it has been successfully eliminated by
      radiofrequency ablation. Studying samples of tissue from patients with Barrett's esophagus
      for the levels of a specific protein that is linked to developing Barrett's esophagus may
      help doctors learn whether aspirin can prevent it from returning after it has been
      successfully treated.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled phase II chemoprevention trial,
      investigating whether supplementation with aspirin 325 mg/day for 12 months is safe and
      reduces the expression of CDX2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) (a biomarker which has been
      associated with the risk of developing Barrett's esophagus [BE]) in comparison to placebo
      after successful radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess safety at 12 months. II. To assess differences in the expression of CDX2 at 18
      months, activation status of NF-kB by assessing levels of total and phosphorylated
      (phospho)-p65 and cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation of phospho-p65 which is likely to be
      affected by aspirin.

      III. To assess the prostanoid marker, prostaglandin E2, and prostaglandin synthases, which
      are known to respond to aspirin and to correlation with clinicopathological factors in the
      esophageal cancer.

      IV. To assess differences in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines known to induce
      activation of NFkB, i.e., TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-23 will be measured.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive aspirin orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 12 months.

      ARM B: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 12 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18
      months.
