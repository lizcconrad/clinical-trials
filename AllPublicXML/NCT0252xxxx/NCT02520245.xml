        The target population for this study is patients who have participated in any REGN2810
        clinical study.

        Inclusion Criteria for Patients Receiving Re-treatment:

          1. Tolerated prior treatment with REGN2810 with no unacceptable toxicity (except select
             reversible irAEs) requiring discontinuation of REGN2810

          2. Developed documented progressive disease after first demonstrating clinical benefit
             from their initial treatment

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1

          4. ≥18 years old

          5. Hepatic function:

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN; if liver metastases ≤ 3 x
                  ULN)

               -  Transaminases ≤ 3 x ULN (or ≤ 5.0 x ULN, if liver metastases)

               -  Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (or ≤ 5.0 x ULN, if liver metastases)

               -  For patients with hepatic metastases or hepatic malignancies, exclude patients
                  with concomitant 3 x ULN ≤ aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine
                  aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 5 x ULN and 1.5 x ULN ≤ total bilirubin ≤ 3 x ULN

          6. Renal function: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN

          7. Bone marrow function:

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L

               -  Platelet count ≥ 75 x 10^9/L

        Inclusion Criteria for Patients who Will not Receive Re-treatment:

        Patients must have completed participation in any REGN2810 clinical study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A patient who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from receiving
        re-treatment with REGN2810:

          1. Ongoing or recent (within 5 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that
             required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk
             for irAEs.

          2. Patients who experienced an irAE in while participating in another REGN2810 protocol
             who were unable to have their corticosteroid dose reduced to &lt;10 mg per day prednisone
             equivalent within 12 weeks of toxicity.

          3. Patients who developed ≥ Grade 2 uveitis in a prior REGN2810 protocol

          4. Immunosuppressive corticosteroid doses (&gt; 10 mg prednisone daily or equivalent) within
             4 weeks prior to the first dose of REGN2810

          5. Active infection requiring therapy, including known infection with human
             immunodeficiency virus, or active infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus.

          6. History of pneumonitis within the last 5 years.

          7. Any investigational or antitumor treatment within 30 days prior to the initial
             administration of REGN2810.

          8. History of documented allergic reactions or acute hypersensitivity reaction attributed
             of Grade ≥ 3 severity during or directly following an REGN2810 infusion

          9. Known allergy to doxycycline or tetracycline. (precaution due to presence of trace
             components in REGN2810)

         10. Breast-feeding

         11. Positive serum pregnancy test

         12. History within the last 5 years of an invasive malignancy other than the one treated
             in this study, with the exception of resected/ablated basal or squamous-cell carcinoma
             of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or other local tumors considered cured
             by local treatment.

         13. Acute or chronic psychiatric problems that, under the evaluation of the investigator,
             make the patient ineligible for participation

         14. Unwilling to practice adequate contraception during the study until 6 months after the
             last dose of study drug
