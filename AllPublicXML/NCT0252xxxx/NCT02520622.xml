  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to determine the impact of using digital photographs on a mobile device
      versus printed photographs on skin self-examination rates. The ease-of-use and overall
      satisfaction with the two exam modalities will be evaluated. Secondarily, the impact on
      melanoma thickness at detection, melanoma detection, biopsy, and office visit rates will be
      evaluated. The study involves patients in the Pigmented Lesion Clinic that have received
      total body photography for skin monitoring.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Skin self-examination rates</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate if printed photographs alone versus skin self-examinations supplemented with digital photos on a mobile device, or digital photos with reminders, social support networks, or both, lead to improved self-examination rates. This outcome is assessed by survey, before and after the intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Features important to a skin self-examination tool</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Identify the features of digital or printed photograph use that are important to patients to have as part of a successful adjunct skin self-examination tool. This outcome is measured via survey after the intervention where participants rank on a Likert scale a series of features from critical to not important.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Melanoma thickness at detection</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determine if using printed photographs alone versus skin self-examinations supplemented with digital photos on a mobile device leads to differing melanoma thickness upon detection. This outcome will be assessed at the group level using descriptive statistics to calculate a mean thickness between the two groups where a Student's t-test will be used to assess significance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Office visit rates</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determine if using printed photographs alone versus skin self-examinations supplemented with digital photos on a mobile device leads to differing office visit rates. This outcome will be assessed at the group level where the number of office visits over the course of the study will be compared for each group using a proportion's test or a chi-squared association test to assess if the rates between the two groups differ significantly.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biopsy rates</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determine if using printed photographs alone versus skin self-examinations supplemented with digital photos on a mobile device leads to differing biopsy rates. This outcome will be assessed at the group level where the number of biopsies over the course of the study will be compared for each group using a proportion's test or a chi-squared association test to assess if the rates between the two groups differ significantly.</description>

    <measure>Melanoma detection rates</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determine if using printed photographs alone versus skin self-examinations supplemented with digital photos on a mobile device leads to differing melanoma detection rates. This outcome will be assessed at the group level where the number of new melanomas detected over the course of the study will be compared for each group using a proportion's test or a chi-squared association test to assess if the rates between the two groups differ significantly.</description>

    <measure>Study/technology implementation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the study/technology implementation process using the implementation sciences RE-AIM framework to categorize and describe as follows:
Reach
Number of skin exams
Number of first time skin exams
Percent of patients offered/recommended full body photography
Effectiveness a. (Please see the primary outcome variables)
Adoption
a. Percent opting for total body photography of whom it is offered/recommended
Implementation
Number and extent of changes to patient surveys
Number and extent of changes to educational/training materials
Number and percent of patients expressing interest in, or inquiring about the study
Time spent educating patients on how to conduct a skin self-examination
Time spent educating clinicians on the study
Maintenance
Number and percent of repeat skin exams
Number and percent of patients abandoning a particular modality
