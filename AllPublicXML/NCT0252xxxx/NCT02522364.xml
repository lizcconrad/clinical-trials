      Postoperative atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (POAF) is the most common complication
      after cardiac surgery requiring intervention or prolonged hospital stay.

      POAF is associated with higher mortality and higher risk of thromboembolic events.

      However, It is yet unknown whether a now event of postoperative atrial fibrillation is an
      indication of a chronic arrhythmic disease - a tendency towards developing recurrent atrial
      fibrillation or merely a response to the stress of surgery with not recurrence. This
      distinction is critical to determine the appropriate therapy. Since recurred events of atrial
      fibrillation (Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation) are associated with long term risk for stroke
      and thromboembolic evens patients with PAF are treated with long term anticoagulation.
      Missing the long term recurrence of arrhythmia may result in under-treatment and pose a
      significant risk of stroke.

      Bio-Monitor is a subcutaneous implanted device that automatically detects arrhythmias and
      stores electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. It will enable the detection of atrial
      fibrillation over a period of years and allow correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

      The purpose of the study is to study the long term behavior of POAF, determine the likelihood
      of developing paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with POAF and to define the risk
      factors for this eventuality

      Clinical background:

      Postoperative atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (POAF) is the most common complication
      after cardiac surgery requiring intervention or prolonged hospital stay . Affecting 10-65% of
      patients , this arrhythmia is associated with increased mortality, considerable morbidity
      including systemic therombo-embolism and hemodynamic deterioration. Often it will prolong the
      hospital stay and increase health costs. Notably, the incidences of POAF is increasing
      resulting from an increase in the average age and arrhythmic risk factors in patients
      undergoing cardiac surgery.

      Although a lot of POAFs occur in patients with a history of PAF, there is an important
      portion of POAF in patients who have never experienced AF before. In some of these patients
      POAF may be the first manifestation of a tendency to fibrillate (that may have been silent
      prior to surgery) whereas in others it may be an acute response to the peri-operative stress
      that may never recur after the acute phase. A recent study has shown that patients with a
      first detected AF episode precipitated by a secondary event (the most common of which was
      cardiothoracic surgery) are very likely to have recurrent events. In fact the risk of
      recurrence was similar to that of patients with an AF event with an obvious precipitating
      factor Current guidelines mainly address the acute management of arrhythmia. Most conclude
      that anti-thrombotic therapy is indicated in POAF (IIA) usually if the arrhythmia persists
      for at least 48 hours. However this recommendation is based on very limited evidence as there
      is no substantial data describing the long term natural history of this complication. POAF
      was described as self-terminating but frequently recurrent with a complete resolution within
      6-12 weeks . However, this observation was based on electrocardiogram follow-up with no
      continuous long term monitoring (ECG holter or loop recorder) and are therefore of limited
      validity. Emerging data suggests that AF recurrence rates may be significate ranging up to
      24% over 6 years . Still, it is currently unknown how many of the patients presenting with an
      acute episode of POAF will develop recurrent events and when, as a result, there are no clear
      recommendations regarding the duration of anticoagulantion treatment. The current practice in
      cases of POAF of significant duration is to administer anti-coagulation therapy combined with
      antiarrhythmic (most often with amiodarone) for 6-12 weeks. The only guideline based
      recommendation that is based on poor evidence is to administer OAC to AF patients following
      CABG for at least 3 months . Holter ECG is routinely performed prior to the end of this
      period and if normal and clinical evaluation is normal the treatment is discontinued, usually
      with no additional evaluation.

      Technical overview:

      This study will be executed using the following devices and services:

        -  BioMonitor is a subcutaneous implanted device that automatically detects arrhythmias and
           stores electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. It is implanted in a small subcutaneous
           pocket, similar to a pacemaker but without the need for inserting electrodes. It
           provides high quality ECG recording and has longevity of 6.4 years. In addition it has
           wireless capabilities and may transmit data to an external modem (CardioMessenger) and
           though it to an internet based network - the Home-Monitoring.

        -  HomeMonitoring is an Internet-based, automatic, remote, monitoring system that uses the
           cellular phone network to enable transmissions of recorded data and alerts from the HM
           Service Center to a predefined email address, fax or a cellular phone.

      Study propose The investigators hypothesize that the intermediate and long term burden of
      newly diagnosed POAF is significantly greater than currently described. We further
      hypothesize that it may be a marker for affected atria representing a greater risk for
      chronic arrhythmia. Therefore, we believe that a substantial group of patients presenting
      with POAF will have atrial fibrillation recurrences (paroxysmal, persistent or permanent)
      requiring long term anticoagulation We also believe that with the help of ILR we will be able
      define a subgroup of POAF patients in whom POAF is related to the acute phase and are not
      prone to recurrence nor do they need long term anticoagulation In this pilot study we propose
      to use an ILR to diagnose both symptomathic and asymptomatic events of atrial fibrillation in
      subjects after cardiac surgery. We intend to define the natural history of post-operative
      atrial fibrillation and to identify the predictors for recurrent events.

      Study aims:

        1. To evaluate the incidence of recurrent AF events, during long term follow-up in patients
           presenting with newly diagnosed POAF discharged in sinus rhythm.

        2. To identify predictors for the development of recurrent AF events

        3. To verify the use of implantable loop recorders (ILRs) as tools in detection of AF and
           anticoagulant management in POAF

        4. To evaluate rates of mortality and major adverse events (CVA, systemic thromboembolism,
           rapid AF requiring hospitalization) among patients presenting with POAF discharged in
           sinus rhythm.

        5. To identify predictors for mortality and major adverse events.
