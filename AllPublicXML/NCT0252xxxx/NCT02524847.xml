    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study of the efficacy of UVADEX® (methoxsalen)
      Sterile Solution in conjunction with THERAKOS® CELLEX® Photopheresis Systems in pediatric
      patients with steroid-refractory aGvHD. The study is composed of Screening, Treatment, and
      Follow-up Periods.

      Screening:

      After the informed consent/assent form (ICF) is signed, the screening assessments will be
      performed in a single visit to establish the eligibility of the patient, based on inclusion
      and exclusion criteria, as well as aGvHD grading. Scheduling of the first week of ECP
      treatments and the arrangements for availability of typed and cross-matched donor packed red
      blood cells (PRBCs) for transfusion, if required, will be made in advance of patients
      entering the Treatment Period.

      Treatment Period:

      Once eligibility is established, patients will enter the 12-week ECP Treatment Period. The
      availability of typed and cross-matched donor PRBCs for transfusion during treatment, if
      needed, should be established prior to the scheduling of ECP treatments.

      Patients will be allowed to continue standard aGvHD prophylaxis regimens (e.g., cyclosporine,
      tacrolimus, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil) without the addition of new therapies.
      Patients will be allowed to discontinue prophylaxis regimens for reasons of toxicity, and
      will also be allowed to switch to another prophylaxis medication within the same class (e.g.,
      the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus) for reasons of toxicity.

      All patients enrolled in this trial will have received corticosteroids for the treatment of
      aGvHD. After entering the treatment period on study, tapering of steroids by total weekly
      decrements of 12.5% to 25% of the steroid dose at initiation of ECP therapy is permitted
      after a sustained response of aGvHD has been observed for at least 3 consecutive days, with
      the suggested goal to decrease the starting steroid dose by at least 50% 4 weeks after
      initiation of ECP.

      Follow-Up Period:

      After completion of the 12-week Treatment Period, patients may continue ECP treatment on
      commercial product at the Principal Investigator's discretion. Acute GvHD status will be
      assessed 4 weeks after completion of the Treatment Period. Patient survival will be assessed
      by passive follow-up (chart review) 26 weeks after initiation of ECP treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion:

          1. Male or female 1 to 21 years of age at the time of consent

          2. Steroid-refractory grade B-D aGvHD.

               -  Steroid-refractory is defined as a failure to respond to steroid treatment, with
                  failure to respond defined as any grade B-D (IBMTR grading) aGvHD that shows
                  progression ≥ 3 days, or no improvement by 5 days of treatment with 12 mg/kg/day
                  methylprednisolone or equivalent in subjects with lower GI or liver disease, or
                  skin disease associated with bullae. Grade D organ involvement will be limited to
                  skin and liver.

               -  Steroid refractory may also be defined as a failure to respond to 1 mg/kg/day of
                  methylprednisolone or equivalent in subjects with disease confined to upper GI
                  disease or lesser degrees of skin GvHD.

               -  Subjects with lack of complete response after 2 weeks of steroid treatment.

          3. A Lansky scale Performance Status score ≥ 30.

          4. Laboratory values are within the following limits, assessed within 3 days of the first
             study treatment:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 0.5 × 10^9/L.

               -  Creatinine level &lt; 2 times the upper limit of normal.

          5. For patients with isolated upper GI symptoms, pre-Screening biopsy results to confirm
             diagnosis of aGvHD.

          6. Female patients of childbearing potential and nonsterilized males who are sexually
             active with a female partner must be practicing highly effective, reliable, and
             medically approved contraceptive regimen throughout their participation in the study
             and for 3 months following the last ECP treatment. Or, for the US only, abstinence may
             be used in place of an approved contraceptive regimen. Females of childbearing
             potential are those who have reached the onset of menarche, or 8 years of age,
             whichever comes first. Approved contraceptive methods for female patients of
             childbearing potential or nonsterilized males who are sexually active with a female
             partner are as follows:

               -  Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.

             albinism) or aphakia.

         16. Coagulation disorders that cannot be corrected with simple transfusion.

         17. Co-existing melanoma, basal cell, or squamous cell skin carcinoma.

         18. Previous splenectomy.

         19. White blood cell count greater than 25,000 mm3.

         20. Currently being treated with any systemic immunosuppressive or biologic therapy for
