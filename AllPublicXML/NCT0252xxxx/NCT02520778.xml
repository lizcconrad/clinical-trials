      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of osimertinib and navitoclax when
      given together and to see how well they work in treating patients with previously treated
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive non-small cell lung cancer that has spread
      to other places in the body or has not responded to previous treatment with initial EGFR
      kinase inhibitor. Osimertinib and navitoclax may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving with osimertinib together with navitoclax
      may work better in treating EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of AZD9291 (osimertinib) in combination with
      navitoclax in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following
      resistance to prior EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI).

      II. To evaluate the feasibility of treatment with AZD9291 plus navitoclax for patients with
      T790M-mediated acquired resistance to EGFR TKI.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the pharmacokinetic profile of the combination of AZD9291 plus navitoclax.

      II. To observe and record anti-tumor activity.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study plasma genotype levels as a response biomarker in patients with EGFR-mutant lung
      cancer.

      II. To explore tissue biomarkers of apoptosis and their association with treatment response.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study followed by a dose-expansion study.

      Patients receive navitoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and osimertinib PO QD on
      days 4-28 (days 1-28 during dose-expansion). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
