  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the strong business case of hiring people with disabilities, a significant proportion
      of youth with disabilities leave high school and neither work nor continue their education
      and are unprepared to meet the demands of a work environment. Although youth with
      disabilities have much to gain from employment readiness programs, they are often excluded
      from, or have limited access to school and community vocational programs. One encouraging
      approach to address gaps in vocational programming is through peer mentoring, which may
      facilitate a smoother transition to adulthood by offering support to enhance coping skills.
      Despite the increase in online communities, little is known about their impact on vocational
      mentoring for youth with physical disabilities and their parents. The purpose of this study
      is to develop, implement and assess the feasibility of an online peer mentor employment
      readiness intervention for youth with physical disabilities and their parents to improve
      their self-efficacy, career maturity and social support.

      Our primary OBJECTIVE is: (1) to develop, implement and assess the feasibility of an online
      peer mentor employment readiness intervention for youth with physical disabilities and their
      parents to improve their self-efficacy, career maturity and social support.

      A mixed methods feasibility randomized controlled trial design will be conducted to develop
      and assess the usability of &quot;Empowering youth towards Employment&quot; intervention. Youth (aged
      15-25) with physical disabilities and their parents will be randomly assigned to a control or
      experimental group (12-week, interactive intervention, moderated by peer mentors). A
      qualitative thematic analysis will be conducted to analyze the content of discussion forums.
      Interviews with youth, parents and mentors will also be conducted about their experiences in
      the intervention.
