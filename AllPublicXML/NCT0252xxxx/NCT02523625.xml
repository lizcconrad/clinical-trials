  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is an inflammatory disease causing new, unaccustomed headache in
      the elderly and which can lead to blindness in 20-30% of untreated cases. The study group
      have previously shown that ultrasound is a viable non-invasive alternative to temporal artery
      biopsy in diagnosing GCA. However, there is significant variation in ultrasound assessment
      (measuring a dark &quot;halo&quot; around the abnormal blood vessels) between sonographers in different
      centres, requiring a labour intensive and time consuming training programme. The study group
      propose to standardise the training programme, and use ultrasound and clinical evaluation to
      define changes occurring over time and with treatment in patients with a diagnosis of GCA
      made based on ultrasound changes alone. The study group will explore the use of algorithms to
      automate or semi-automate image interpretation.

      Objectives and Project Plan:

        -  Project Purpose:

      The purpose of the project is to develop the technology to reliably acquire and analyse
      ultrasound images through the use of a training programme which are comparable to those from
      scanning by an expert sonographer in the diagnosis (i.e. as a diagnostic tool) and monitoring
      of patients with GCA following treatment (i.e. as a response indicator), and patient
      stratification according to initial or early scan changes to determine the most appropriate
      treatment (i.e. as a prognostic tool).

        -  End Point:

      The end point will be the production of an effective training programme which can be used to
      obtain reproducible accurate ultrasound images of the temporal artery which can be
      automatically analysed and used in real time in the management of patients with suspected or
      confirmed giant cell arteritis.

        -  Milestones:

      The project is in 3 phases. In phase 1 (0-12 months) the study group will create a bank of
      images for training from healthy volunteers and patients with GCA; in phase 2 (13-18 months)
      the study group will test the programme on sonographers assessing patients with GCA; in phase
      3 (19-42 months) the study group will acquire serial images, clinical data, serum and plasma
      from cohorts of patients with newly diagnosed and flaring GCA so that they can analyse and
      develop new software algorithms. The study group can use images already acquired from a
      previous diagnostic study in GCA, and test the algorithms on the new cohorts..

    <measure>Size of halo detected (mm) on ultrasound of temporal arteries</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The study group will compare computer algorithms to analyse the halo size from video images of ultrasound scans with observer defined measures of halo size (mm) from healthy volunteers, patients with headache but not due to GCA, patients with newly diagnosed GCA and in patients with GCA who are followed serially and re-imaged over time in response to therapy. The study group will test the value of algorithms incorporating clinical and serological data together with the imaging findings to determine their added effect on the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for diagnosis and monitoring of GCA. Halo size varies from 0 (undetectable) to greater than 1mm. Cut-off values for abnormal values have not been formally established or published yet.</description>
