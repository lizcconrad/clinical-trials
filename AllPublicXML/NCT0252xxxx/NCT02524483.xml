  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Outcomes from the investigators' recent exploratory investigation suggested that
      a high dosage of challenging physical therapy exercises can result in clinically relevant
      improvements in the postural balance and walking speed of individuals with MS.

      Objective: The investigators anticipated that the promising results were due to the novel
      challenging postural balance and mobility exercises. The purpose of this investigation was to
      test this notion by evaluating the mobility and postural balance improvements that could be
      achieved in a cohort of individuals with MS who participated in a therapeutic protocol that
      consisted of activity based exercises, and a cohort of individuals with MS that participated
      in the challenging physical therapy protocol.

    <measure>Changes in Balance Using the Sensory Organization Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Sensory Organization Test consists of six different conditions that measure each subject's ability to integrate visual, somatosensory, and vestibular feedback to reduce the overall amount of postural sway and improve balance.</description>
