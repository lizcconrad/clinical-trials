      Regardless of age, the quality of hospital care, the confidence that the young can have in
      the health care team, joining parents are pivotal elements and influence followed. Family
      support is all the more important as 14% of young people realize a new suicidal act within
      three months of hospitalization for attempted suicide, and that the essential predictors
      appear to be the young age and quality of intra-family relationships.

      The main objective of this study is to determine, through the construction of an instrument
      to quantify the therapeutic alliance, defined by the characteristics of the mobilization of
      the entourage and the mutual commitments in the care of nursing teams and the entourage, the
      role of early therapeutic alliance with the entourage of suicidal youth 13-40 years, whether
      primosuicidants or repeat offenders, on short and medium term recurrences and early
      mortality.
