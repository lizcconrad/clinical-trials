    <textblock>
      Non-invasive measurement of blood pressure is an instrument governed nursing routine care.
      The use of an automated oscillometric cuff is a common technique and validated if this is
      done on the arm with a suitable cuff, positioned opposite the brachial artery and up to the
      right atrium (the brachial site) . If cons-indication to use the brachial site, measurements
      are frequently performed at the ankle, calf or thigh. Among the blood pressure values
      measured on the 3 sites of the lower limb (thigh, calf or ankle), it may be a specific
      property of which the observed values are closest to the reference values (brachial).

      The objective of this study is to measure the non-invasive blood pressure values at three
      sites of the lower limb, to compare the reference value to determine which alternative site
      should be preferred when the reference measurement is not feasible .

      We want to determine the alternative site to obtain values as close as the measured values of
      the reference site. The three study sites are the thigh, calf and ankle. The reference site
      recommended for monitoring non-invasive blood pressureis the arm.

      It is also assessing the impact of certain parameters on the primary endpoint:

        -  Physiological parameters: gender, weight, height, age, systolic blood pressure
           reference, listed measures.

        -  A parameter related to measurement: discomfort felt when the blood pressure outlet.

        -  Exposure setting: smoking.

      Primary Outcome: The difference in systolic blood pressure, diastolic and mean simultaneously
      measured in the arm and each of the three sites in the lower limb.

      Secondary endpoints: The difference in systolic blood pressure, diastolic and mean
      simultaneously measured in the arm and each of the three sites in the lower limb in the
      following subgroups:

        -  Male / Female

        -  BMI &lt;25 / BMI&gt; 25

        -  Size &lt; 160 cm / size [160-169] cm / size [170-180] cm / size [181-190] cm / size ≥ 191

        -  Systolic Blood Pressure value (SAP) the reference site &lt;100 mmHg / 100 mmHg and ≥ NOT
           value of the reference site &lt;140 mmHg / ≥ 140 mmHg

      Discomfort level depending on the measurement site of blood pressure in the general
      population.

        -  Discomfort level for each measurement of blood pressure site in each of the following
           subgroups:

        -  Male / Female - BMI &lt;25 / BMI&gt; 25

        -  size &lt;160 cm / size [160-169] cm / size [170 -180] cm / size [181-190] cm / size ≥ 191
           cm - Age &lt;25 / age ≥ 25 years

        -  blood pressure value (SAP) reference site &lt;100 mmHg / 100 mmHg and ≥ NOT Value reference
           site &lt;140 mmHg / ≥ 140 mmHg

        -  hemibody studied Right / Left

        -  Smoking / No Smoking

      Methodology:

      Experimental design:

      This is an observational study, prospective, multicenter, comparative on healthy volunteers,
      each individual is his own witness. Reports of non-invasive blood pressure values of 3
      different sites of the lower limbs, compared to a reference value. For each individual, the
      side which will be carried out blood pressure measurements will be drawn. After 5 minutes
      rest in the supine position, it will be realized the measurement of blood pressure
      non-invasively systolic, mean and diastolic 2 automated oscillometric measuring devices
      identical and calibrated simultaneously the arm and thigh ipsilateral / arm and calf
      ipsilateral / arm and the ipsilateral ankle.

      Each measurement is repeated once after 1 minute.

      Statistical analysis:

      Systolic, mean and diastolic pressures are analyzed separately, and expressed by their
      average with standard deviation and 95% confidence intervals. The concordance of BP
      measurements between the arm and each of three sites in the lower limb was analyzed by the
      method Bland and Altman, calculating the average difference, its approval limits, as well as
      the confidence interval 95 % upper and lower limits of approval subject to a Gaussian
      distribution of the difference between the measurements.

      The search for the best AP measurement site to the lower member is made by comparing the
      differences between each of the three sites and the reference site, for a global test
      (variance analysis or test Friedmann according to the distribution of differences), then by
      comparisons with 2-2 adjusting the p-value.

      The chosen site is one for which this difference is significantly weaker. All tests are
      conducted bilaterally with a risk of first species set at 5%. In an earlier study, the
      largest variance found regarding the difference in systolic BP between calf and arm.

      Based on the most pessimistic scenario (s = 12.76) to highlight a difference of 5 mm Hg with
      an alpha risk of 5% and a power of 90% and taking into account the multiple comparisons
      considered, 176 patients necessary. Given the characteristics of this study, its educational
      value as part of training in clinical research nursing students, and the coupling of the
      study to medical visits firefighters, recruitment opportunities are important.

      7 Nursing Schools, with 3 100 students on average promotions, and counting on a 70% of
      nursing students over 2 years, 1470 will bring healthy volunteers. The Departmental Fire and
      Rescue and the Fire Brigade of Paris can potentially bring respectively 1,500 and 3,000
      healthy volunteers per year. To the extent that the increase of the workforce does not
      generate additional costs, investigators want to include 1,000 women among the Nursing
      Schools students and 1,000 men among firefighters.

      Total duration of study: 36 months Period of inclusion: 24 months Duration of participation
      for voluntary: 30 minutes Number of participating centers: 9 centers
