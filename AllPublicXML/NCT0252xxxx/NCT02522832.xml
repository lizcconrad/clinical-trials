      Human Rhinovirus infection is an important precursor to asthma and chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease exacerbations and the Human Viral Challenge model may provide a powerful
      tool in studying these and other chronic respiratory diseases. In this study we have reported
      the production and human characterisation of a new HRV-16 challenge virus produced
      specifically for this purpose.

      An HRV-16 isolate from an 18 year old experimentally infected healthy female volunteer
      (University of Virginia Children's Hospital, USA) was obtained with appropriate medical
      history and consent. We manufactured a new HRV-16 stock by minimal passage in a WI-38 cell
      line under Good Manufacturing Practice conditions. Having first subjected the stock to
      rigorous adventitious agent testing and determining the virus suitability for human use, we
      conducted an initial safety and pathogenicity clinical study in adult volunteers in our
      dedicated clinical quarantine facility in London.
