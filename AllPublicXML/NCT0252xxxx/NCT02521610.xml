  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose, parallel-group study will
      evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects, pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of one week
      of RG7625 dosing in healthy male and female volunteers. Each participant will receive a
      single dose of RG7625 or placebo followed by one week of dosing with the same treatment. Each
      participant will also receive intradermal administration of 4 recall antigens at Screening
      and on Day 7 of treatment to assess study drug effects on delayed-type hypersensitivity
      (DTH).

    <description>Healthy volunteers will receive the placebo equivalent to RG7625 as oral capsules once or twice daily for 8 days. Each cohort will receive intradermal administration of 4 antigens (tetanus toxoid, tuberculin purified protein derivative [PPD], Candida albicans, and Trichophyton species) and a negative control at Screening and on Day 7 of treatment to assess for DTH.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo a series of Screening visits prior to treatment and 7- to 14-day follow-up. Healthy volunteers will be enrolled in up to 4 cohorts and will receive RG7625 as oral capsules once or twice daily for 8 days. The first cohort is planned to receive 100 milligrams (mg) on Day 1, followed by 100 mg twice daily on Days 3 to 9. Subsequent dose and frequency decisions will be based upon observations in previous cohort(s). Each cohort will receive intradermal administration of 4 antigens (tetanus toxoid, tuberculin PPD, Candida albicans, and Trichophyton species) and a negative control at Screening and on Day 7 of treatment to assess for DTH.</description>
