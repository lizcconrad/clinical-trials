    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of NEUROPHARMAGEN pharmacogenetic test in the selection of
      the pharmacological treatments for patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), both with
      and without psychiatric comorbidities. Patients will be randomly asigned to test-guided
      treatment prescription or to treatment as usual ina a 1:1 ratio; the results of the test will
      not be disclosed to the later until the end of the 3-month follow-up period. The study will
      compare the rate of treatment responders among both groups, based on patient-reported
      improvement collected by blind telephone interview.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NEUROPHARMAGEN is a genetic test developed by AB-BIOTICS S.A. that enables the specific
      analysis of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms related to the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of different psychoactive drugs. The aim of the test is to provide the
      psychiatrist with information that can help him/her identify the most suitable medication for
      each patient.

      In the study group, the psychiatrist will have the results of the NEUROPHARMAGEN test as
      supporting information to help him/her select the best treatment for the patient. In the
      control patient group, the treatment will be selected and prescribed in accordance with
      routine clinical practice.

      This is a naturalistic, double-blind, randomized, multicentric clinicaltrial carried out in
      Spain at psychiatry departments of several public hospitals. The study aims to include a
      total of 520 patients with MDD, including patient with significant psychiatric comorbidities
      such as anxiety or substance abuse.

      The study will compare groups based on the rate of treatment responders, defined as a score
      of 2 or less (i.e. &quot;Much better&quot;/&quot;Very much better&quot;) in the Patient Global Impression of
      Improvement scale (PGI-I). This scale will be collected by blind telephone interviewers, so
      as to have a double-blind assessment (patient and interviewer).

    <description>The PGI-I scale (Patient Global Impression of Improvement) reports the patient's own assessment of improvement after the therapeutic interventions. It is a single-item questionnaire that assesses the change experienced using a 7-point Likert scale that runs from 1 (very much better) to 7 (very much worse). A sustained response will be considered when the patient reports a PGI-I score of 2 or less, on at least two consecutive assessments, maintained until the end of the follow-up.</description>

    <description>The PGI-I scale (Patient Global Impression of Improvement) reports the patient's own assessment of improvement after the therapeutic interventions. It is a single-item questionnaire that assesses the change experienced using a 7-point Likert scale that runs from 1 (very much better) to 7 (very much worse). A patient will be considered a responder when reporting a PGI-I score of 2 or less (i.e. &quot;much better&quot;/&quot;very much better&quot;).</description>

    <measure>Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>HAM-D rates the clinical severity of depression. It has 17 questions, each with three to five possible answers, with scores ranging from 0 to 2 or from 0 to 4, respectively. The total score ranges from 0 to 52 and cut-off scores can be used to classify the depressive disorder.</description>

    <measure>FIBSER Scale (Frequency, Intensity and Burden of Side Effects Rating)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scale consists of 3 questions with scores ranging from 0 (no side effects / no impairment) to 6 (intolerable / unable to function / present all of the time).</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S is a descriptive scale that provides qualitative information on the severity of the patient's illness. It assesses the severity of the illness using a 7-point Likert scale that runs from 1 (not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients). In this study, both the self-rated (whereby the patient rates his/her own situation) and the doctor-rated versions will be administered so that the doctor can assess the severity of the condition.</description>

    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction with Medicines Questionnaire (SATMED-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 17-item questionnaire and is a valid scale for any chronic or long-term condition. It is a self-administered questionnaire on treatment satisfaction and it assesses the following areas or dimensions: side effects; effectiveness of the medication; convenience of the medication; impact of the medication on everyday life; medical follow-up of the disease; and the patient's general opinion regarding his/her condition and the medication. All items are assessed using a 5-point Likert scale that runs from &quot;no, not at all&quot; with a value of 0 to &quot;yes, very much&quot; with a value of 4.</description>

    <measure>Sheehan Disability Inventory (SDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>SDI is a questionnaire that can be self-administered to measure the disability of patients with mental disorders. It has 3 sub-scales that are scored independently (disability - 3 items, stress - 1 item and perceived social support - 1 item). As each item is scored using a Likert scale from 0 to 10, the maximum possible score is 30.</description>
