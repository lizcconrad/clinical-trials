      Corneal topography allows the measure of the radii of curvature and of the thickness of the
      cornea. It is essential for diagnosis in ophthalmology and allows to highlight corneal
      irregularities such as a keratoconus, or too thin corneas which are a contra-indication for
      laser refractive surgery.

      Several types of corneal topographers are commercially available. Some as the Orbscan(r),
      operate by analyzing the image of the patterns of a Placido disk associated with a light
      slit, allowing the collection of thousands of points of the anterior and posterior surface of
      the cornea. More recent systems such as the Pentacam(r) are based on automatic rotary cameras
      which capture images of the whole anterior segment of the eye. The aim of this study is to
      compare two topographs, the Pentacam(r) and the Orbscan(r) and, more specifically, the
      central corneal pachymetry measurements measured pre- and postoperatively.
