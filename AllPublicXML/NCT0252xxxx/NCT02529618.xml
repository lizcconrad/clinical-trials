  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess a new screening tool for sideline evaluation of
      concussion injuries in athletes. iDETECT is a new technology that combines several elements
      of recommended concussion screening tools into a single, portable device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the research is to evaluate the use of a multimodal platform (iDETECT) for
      immediate post-injury neuropsychological, balance and oculomotor assessment, and to evaluate
      the iDETECT platform as a return-to-play assessment tool during the post injury management
      period following concussion.

    <description>All football athlete participants in this arm will take the integrated Display Enhanced Testing for Cognitive Impairment and mild traumatic brain injury (iDETECT) test. Participants who sustain a concussion during the football season will complete the iDETECT test and a standing balance test (BESS assessment) four times after injury. Participants in this arm are eligible to receive the Riddell High Impact Technology (HIT) System or the i1 Biometrics Vector Mouth Guard.
NOTE: Football athletes who sustain a concussion during the football season will be evaluated and managed according to standard concussion screening and return-to-play (RTP) protocols. Performance on iDETECT or other study related tasks will NOT be used to make diagnosis, management, or return to play decisions. Study staff will not assist with or influence diagnosis, management, or return-to-play decision making by teams' medical personnel.</description>

Participants will be asked to take the iDETCT test up to 5 more times during the season. Participants who sustain a concussion during the athletic season will be asked to take additional iDETECT tests four times after the injury.
NOTE: Non-collision sport athletes who sustain a concussion during the season will be evaluated and managed according to standard concussion screening and return-to-play (RTP) protocols.
