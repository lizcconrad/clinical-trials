  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ONC201 is a new drug candidate that kills cancer cells but not normal cells in laboratory
      studies and has been previously evaluated in a phase I clinical trial in advanced cancer
      patients. This clinical trial will enroll patients with recurrent glioblastoma or recurrent
      WHO Grade IV gliomas with the H3 K27M mutation.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        For Arm A, B, and C: Histologically confirmed World Health Organization Grade IV
        glioblastoma. WHO Grade IV gliomas will be allowed on protocol.

        For Arm D and E: WHO Grade IV glioma as per above and tumor must harbor a histone H3 K27M
        mutation as evidenced by testing any tumor sample with a immunohistochemistry or DNA
        sequencing test.

        Unequivocal evidence of progressive disease on contrast-enhanced brain computerized
        tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as defined by Response Assessment in
        Neuro-Oncology Criteria (RANO), or have documented recurrent glioblastoma on diagnostic
        biopsy.

        Previous first line therapy with at least radiotherapy and temozolomide.

        For Arm A: Any number of recurrences are allowable. For Arm B: First recurrence (only)
        glioblastoma who had a complete tumor resection at first diagnosis. For Arm C: Patients
        must have clinical and/or radiographic evidence of first recurrence of glioblastoma (only)
        and be eligible for salvage surgical resection as deemed by the site Investigator.

        Must be 12 weeks from radiotherapy. If patients are within 12 weeks of radiotherapy, then
        the progressive lesion must be outside of the high-dose radiation target volume or have
        unequivocal evidence of progressive tumor on a biopsy specimen.

        From the projected start of scheduled study treatment, the following time periods must have
        elapsed: 5 half-lives from any investigational agent, 4 weeks from cytotoxic therapy
        (except 23 days for temozolomide and 6 weeks from nitrosoureas), 6 weeks from antibodies,
        or 4 weeks (or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter) from other anti-tumor therapies.

        All adverse events Grade &gt; 1 related to prior therapies (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or
        surgery) must be resolved, except for alopecia.

        Male or Female age ≥18 years.

        Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 60% (see Appendix A).

        Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below, all screening labs should be performed
        within 14 days of treatment initiation:

          -  leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL

          -  absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL

          -  platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL

          -  hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 mg/dL

          -  total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 x upper limit of normal

          -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤2.5 × upper limit of normal creatinine OR creatinine clearance
             ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above normal.

        CT or MRI within 14 days prior to start of study drug.

        Corticosteroid dose must be stable or decreasing for at least 5 days prior to the scan. For
        Arm B: Corticosteroid dose must be stable or decreasing for at least 2 weeks prior to study
        entry.

        The effects of ONC201 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of
        childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
        barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of
        study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or
        her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
        immediately. Male subjects should agree to use adequate method of contraception starting
        with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of therapy.

        Archival tissue for evaluation of correlative objectives (if available). Archival tissue is
        required for Arms B and C.

        Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
        composition to ONC201 or its excipients.

        Current or planned participation in a study of an investigational agent or using an
        investigational device.

        Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
        infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
        requirements.

        Active infection requiring systemic therapy.

        Prior stereotactic radiotherapy, convection enhanced delivery (CED) or brachytherapy must
        have had a biopsy to confirm radiographic progression is consistent with progressive tumor
        and not treatment-related necrosis. If the recurrent lesion is outside of any prior
        high-dose radiation target volume or distant from the prior CED or brachytherapy site,
        subjects will be considered eligible

        Pregnant women because ONC201 is novel agent with unknown potential for teratogenic or
        abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in
        nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ONC201, breastfeeding should be
        discontinued if the mother is treated with ONC201.

        Known HIV-positive test on combination antiretroviral therapy.

        Known history of cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, tachyarrhythmias or
        bradycardia. Receiving therapeutic agents known to prolong QT interval will be excluded.
        History of CHF, or MI or stroke in the last 3 months will be excluded.

        Active illicit drug use or diagnosis of alcoholism.

        Prior bevacizumab for treatment of glioblastoma. The rationale for restricting enrollment
        to patients who have not had prior bevacizumab therapy is that data regarding the efficacy
        of any therapy after progression on bevacizumab therapy are lacking.

        Tumors with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or IDH2 mutations as determined by
        immunohistochemistry for the IDH1 R132H variant or by direct sequencing. IDH1/2-mutant
        gliomas have a markedly longer overall survival rate compared to those with IDH1/2-wildtype
        glioma (Parsons et al., 2008; Yan et al., 2009), indicating IDH1/2-mutant gliomas have a
        distinct natural history.

        Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment within 3 years
        of start of study drug. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell
        carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative
        therapy.

        Any surgery (not including minor diagnostic procedures such as lymph node biopsy) within 2
        weeks of baseline disease assessments; or not fully recovered from any side effects of
        previous procedures.

        Concomitant use of CYP3A4/5 inhibitors during the treatment phase of the study and within
        72 hours prior to starting study drug administration.

        Concomitant use of potent CYP3A4/5 inducers, which include enzyme inducing antiepileptic
        drugs (EIAEDs) (see Appendix B), during the treatment phase of the study and within 2 weeks
        prior to starting treatment.

        Planned concurrent use Optune™. Prior use of the device is allowable.

        For Arm D: Evidence of leptomeningeal spread of disease.
