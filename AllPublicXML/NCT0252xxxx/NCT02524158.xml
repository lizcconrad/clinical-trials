  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a prevalent condition among VA patients, but many current
      treatment options have limited effectiveness. In addition to chronic pain, people with
      chronic low back pain experience increased disability, psychological symptoms such as
      depression, and reduced health-related quality of life. This randomized controlled study will
      examine the impact of yoga therapy for improving function and decreasing pain in VA patients
      with chronic low back pain. Although not every VA patient with chronic low back pain will
      choose to do yoga, it is an inexpensive treatment modality that is increasingly appealing to
      many VA patients. If yoga is effective, it could become an additional low-cost option that
      the VA can offer to better serve Veterans with chronic low back pain.

    <measure>Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcomes is the change in Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score between baseline and 12-weeks. The questionnaire consists of 24 questions that ask about back pain-related functional limitations experienced for a variety of daily activities . Scores can range from 0-24. Higher scores indicate more impairment, and when considering the change from baseline to follow-up assessments, negative scores indicate improvement. The scale has been shown to be reliable and is well validated. It has been used in another yoga RCT, allowing for comparisons.</description>

    <measure>Pain Intensity - Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The short version of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is a self-rated questionnaire designed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions in the past day and week. The BPI takes about 5 minutes to complete and has been validated with low back pain patients. It has been shown to respond to both behavioral and pharmacological pain interventions. The BPI measures severity of pain, impact of pain on daily function, location of pain, pain medications, and amount of pain relief. Items are answered utilizing a scoring algorithm, with the mean of the 4 severity items used as measures of pain severity. Scores range from 0-10, with higher scores indicating more pain, and when considering the change from baseline to follow-up assessments, negative scores indicate improvement.</description>

    <measure>Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale (CES-D 10)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale (CES-D 10). Derived from the full CES-D, there are 10 items that ask about the frequency of mood symptoms, rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Never) to 3 (All of the Time). Scores range from 0 to 30, and higher scores indicate greater depression. A number of items are reverse-scored and a score of 10 or greater is considered depressed. Normative data on people with assorted chronic illnesses are available for comparisons.</description>

    <measure>Brief Anxiety Inventory (BAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Anxiety Inventory (BAI) measures the severity of anxiety symptoms, particularly those that distinguish anxiety from depression. The BAI consists of 21 items, is self-administered and can be completed in 5 to 10 minutes. Items are scored on a scale of 0 to 3 and are summed to generate a total score. Scores range from 0 to 63, and higher scores indicate greater depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short-form 12 (SF12)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life will be measured using the Short-form 12 (SF12). Based on the longer SF-36, the SF-12 was developed with the objective of finding a short yet meaningful measure of generic HRQOL or global health status. The 12 items were selected from the SF-36 and tested through a series of stages. The PCS-12 and MCS-12 show similar levels of precision to the summary scores derived from the longer 36-item measure. PCS-12 and MCS-12 scores are transformed to a 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy for Managing Low Back Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy for controlling CLBP reflects levels of confidence in the ability to influence the intensity of back pain symptoms and the impact that CLBP has on daily life. The questions are based on self-efficacy items developed for the Medical Outcomes Study in mixed chronic diseases. The wording of the items has been adapted to be specific to CLBP. The measure consists of 6 items, rated on a 6-point Likert scale, with each item ranging from 0-10. The total score is the mean of the 6 items with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy for managing CLBP.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue (absence of energy) will be measured with the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The FSS is a self-administered instrument developed to assess the impact and severity of fatigue. It consists of 9 items describing the functional impact of fatigue on daily life rated on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) with the total fatigue score ranging from 9-63 or an average score ranging from 1.0-7.0. Higher scores reflect greater fatigue severity and less energy.</description>

    <measure>Attendance/ Home Practice</measure>
    <time_frame>total # of sessions attended and minutes of home practice at end of 12 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Two indicators of the amount of yoga practiced by each participant will be used. Actual attendance of yoga sessions will be assessed using VA medical record data. Attendance can range from 0-24 sessions attended for those participants randomized to yoga. Self-reported practice of yoga at home will be assessed using a weekly participant yoga log. The self-report yoga log assesses whether they practiced yoga each day, the amount of minutes practiced, the use of instructions, the difficulty of poses, and the estimated level of physical activity or exertion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Spinal Range of Motion (ROM) will be measured using a Saunders Digital Inclinometer, a portable device which isolates lumbar ROM (flexion and extension). The device is placed along the spine and uses a precise optical angular scanner. Forward bend angle measures how far forward and downward a person can bend at the waist, from a fully erect and/or normal standing position. The value typically ranges from 0-180 degrees, with higher values indicating greater flexibility.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Grip strength in both hands of each participant will be measured using an adjustable, hydraulic grip strength dynamometer (Jamar Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer). Three trials will be conducted for each hand. In cases of current pain flare-ups or recent procedures to a hand or wrist, the affected hand is not tested, and the result of the one other hand is used. If both hands are used the best performance of two trials will be selected for each side, and the average of the left and right hand will be used for analysis. The value measured is pounds of force exerted and typically ranges from 0 - 150 lbs, with higher numbers indicating greater grip strength.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lower Limb Strength and Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Single Leg Stance (SLS) is a commonly used measure of both lower leg strength and balance. A total of four trials were conducted - left and right leg with both eyes open and eyes closed. Each trial will be timed from the moment the participant lifts one foot off the floor until the moment they need to place it on the floor again. If the participant is able to stand on one leg for 60 seconds the trial will be stopped and they will be asked to switch side. The average of time balanced with the left and right leg will be recorded separately for the open and closed eyes condition. Values range from 0 - 60 seconds with greater values indicating better balance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lumbar Spine Stabilization Endurance</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Prone and supine bridge maneuvers will be used to assess core stabilization. Research staff recorded the length of time in seconds each pose is held until fatigue or pain prevents its maintenance. If patients cannot get into either one of the positions, record the respective time as zero. Recorded values range from 0 - 90 seconds in each position, with more time indicating greater core strength.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a validated measure of sleep quality. The global PSQI score has a range of 0-21, with higher scores indicating worse sleep quality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EuroQOL 5D (EQ5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ5D is a preference-based measure of health-related quality of life. The measure produces a single score ranging from 0 (death) to 1.00 (optimal health). Scores can be integrated with time to calculate Quality Adjusted Life Years.</description>

          <description>The yoga intervention consisted of 2x weekly, 60-minute Hatha Yoga classes for 12 weeks, geared toward a CLBP population. Classes begin with a few minutes of simple seated breathing exercises. Depending on their mobility, participants can sit either on the floor or on a chair. This is followed by gentle warm-up stretches. Participants are then led through a series of standing postures, seated postures and floor postures. The difficulty of the poses will gradually increase over the duration of the 12 weeks, and appropriate modifications are offered to participants whenever needed. Deep and rhythmic breathing will be emphasized throughout. Each class will end with a supine resting pose.</description>

        <title>Pain Intensity - Brief Pain Inventory</title>
        <description>The short version of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is a self-rated questionnaire designed to assess the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions in the past day and week. The BPI takes about 5 minutes to complete and has been validated with low back pain patients. It has been shown to respond to both behavioral and pharmacological pain interventions. The BPI measures severity of pain, impact of pain on daily function, location of pain, pain medications, and amount of pain relief. Items are answered utilizing a scoring algorithm, with the mean of the 4 severity items used as measures of pain severity. Scores range from 0-10, with higher scores indicating more pain, and when considering the change from baseline to follow-up assessments, negative scores indicate improvement.</description>

        <description>Self-efficacy for controlling CLBP reflects levels of confidence in the ability to influence the intensity of back pain symptoms and the impact that CLBP has on daily life. The questions are based on self-efficacy items developed for the Medical Outcomes Study in mixed chronic diseases. The wording of the items has been adapted to be specific to CLBP. The measure consists of 6 items, rated on a 6-point Likert scale, with each item ranging from 0-10. The total score is the mean of the 6 items with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy for managing CLBP.</description>

Attendance can range from 0-24 sessions attended for those participants randomized to yoga. Self-reported practice of yoga at home will be assessed using a weekly participant yoga log. The self-report yoga log assesses whether they practiced yoga each day, the amount of minutes practiced, the use of instructions, the difficulty of poses, and the estimated level of physical activity or exertion.</description>

Three trials will be conducted for each hand. In cases of current pain flare-ups or recent procedures to a hand or wrist, the affected hand is not tested, and the result of the one other hand is used. If both hands are used the best performance of two trials will be selected for each side, and the average of the left and right hand will be used for analysis. The value measured is pounds of force exerted and typically ranges from 0 - 150 lbs, with higher numbers indicating greater grip strength.</description>

A total of four trials were conducted – left and right leg with both eyes open and eyes closed. Each trial will be timed from the moment the participant lifts one foot off the floor until the moment they need to place it on the floor again. If the participant is able to stand on one leg for 60 seconds the trial will be stopped and they will be asked to switch side. The average of time balanced with the left and right leg will be recorded separately for the open and closed eyes condition. Values range from 0 - 60 seconds with greater values indicating better balance.</description>
