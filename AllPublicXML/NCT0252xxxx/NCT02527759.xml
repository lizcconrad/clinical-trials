      The purpose of this study is to examine the relative predictive ability of the derived
      monitoring instrument to determine post discharge instability and 30-day outcomes in patients
      discharged with HF. The primary hypothesis is that variables in the monitoring instrument,
      individually and combined, identify risk for 30-day outcomes. Clinical indicators of dyspnea,
      fatigue, orthopnea, dyspnea with exertion, daily weight, edema, heart rate, blood pressure,
      mental condition, medication adherence, and overall well-being will be reported by
      participants on a daily basis and considered indicators for 30-day outcomes of stability,
      re-hospitalization, or mortality.
