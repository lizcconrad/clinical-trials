    <textblock>
      Drug-coated balloon technology (DCB) has recently attracted considerable interest as a
      promising alternative treatment option, particularly in the setting of in-stent restenosis
      (ISR). Optical coherence tomographic finding of restenosis lesions in drug-eluting stents
      (DESs) after Balloon Angioplasty with Two Different Paclitaxel-Coated Balloons will be
      compared between two paclitaxel-coated balloon devices; Pantera Lux™ and SeQuent® Please.

    <description>Patient will be considered to be enrolled if ISR in DES was found by angiography. After randomization, patients will be treated with Pantera Lux for treatment of ISR. OCT will be performed just after balloon angioplasty for ISR lesion. Information will be collected and recorded on the treated study vessel including angiographic and OCT parameters. Follow-up OCT at 9 month will be performed.</description>
