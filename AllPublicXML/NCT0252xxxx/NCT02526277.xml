  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the MMF07 Foot Massager and/ or heat therapy
      may improve symptoms of restless legs syndrome (RLS). It will also assess the effect of the
      MMF07 Foot Massager and/ or heat on quality of life and sleep in people affected by RLS.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups;

        1. MMF07 Foot Massager device

        2. Heat therapy

        3. Heat therapy and the MMF07 Foot Massage device

        4. Neither heat nor MMF07 Foot Massager device (no treatment group)

    <textblock>
      Few clinical trials have looked into non-pharmacological, non-invasive treatments for
      restless legs syndrome, despite reports that massage, baths and vibrations can alleviate RLS
      symptoms. We would like to assess whether the MMF007 Foot Massager device and/or heat therapy
      is associated with improved severity of RLS symptoms.

      For this study the investigator will enroll 40 participants who have been diagnosed with
      restless legs syndrome, who will be followed over the course of four weeks and asked to
      complete two in person study visits. In the study the investigator is comparing the use of
      the MMF007 Foot Massager device and/ or heat therapy to a non treatment group to assess if
      the symptoms of RLS improve.
