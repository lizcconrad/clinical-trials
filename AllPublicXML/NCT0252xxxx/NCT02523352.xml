  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this study is to better understand pathophysiology of the alteration of respiratory
      mechanics and cardiovascular function in obese volunteer subjects. The investigators plan to
      test this hypothesis with a physiological, interventional study conducted on volunteers by
      using Electrical Impedance Tomography in a group of patients and magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) in another group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obese subjects are prone to develop respiratory insufficiency when requiring mechanical
      ventilation. Atelectasis is the primary responsible for respiratory insufficiency and
      impossibility to wean obese patients from respiratory support. The investigators do believe
      that the respiratory system derangements observed in the previous study during the critical
      illness are already present, although in lower severity, in the obese patients in their basal
      condition.

      This study will help to understand the standard cardiac and respiratory function of an obese
      non critically ill subject to better target the therapies during the management of the
      critical illness to reestablish the homeostasis of the system:

      The investigator's hypotheses are:

        -  To demonstrate if morbidly obese patients show atelectasis at spontaneous breathing in
           the supine position and whether the increase in lung volume following PEEP titration is
           due to alveolar recruitment rather than overdistention.

        -  To measure regional variations in ventilation/perfusion coupling at different ventilator
           settings

        -  To investigate the role of diaphragm position in the development/treatment of
           respiratory insufficiency due to increased pleural pressure

        -  To test if reopening of lung atelectasis through the application o a recruitment
           maneuver and titrated PEEP level would lead to an improvement in right heart function.

        -  To assess pulmonary circulation at different levels of PEEP.

The study is divided in two phases: the first phase will evaluate the PEEP in 12 consecutive obese subjects using Trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) and Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT).
