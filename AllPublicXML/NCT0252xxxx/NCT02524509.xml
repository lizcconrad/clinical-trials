  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of Chondron(autologous cultured
      Chondrocyte) by comparing between Chondron implantation and Microfracture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is an open clinical trial. Among the patients who received autologous cartilage cell graft
      using CHONDRON (autologous cartilage cells) in the past (investigational group) or
      microfracture (control group), the subjects who agreed to participate in the trial
      voluntarily will undergo the screening process that assesses the suitability of the subjects
      to the clinical trial and participate in the clinical trial. During the clinical trial
      period, the subjects should follow the instruction of clinician in charge. Hospital visit is
      total 2 times* regularly. At the visit, to evaluate the efficacy according to the protocol,
      the subject will be examined by clinicians, MRI test, and X-ray. If the selection time and
      the visit time are same, hospital visit will be one time*.

        Total 50 patients. Patients who received autologous chondrocyte implantation using CHONDRON
        (autologous cultured chondrocyte) for knee osteoarthritis or patients underwent
        microfracture. There are total 28 patients who get CHONDRON grafting until now. Considering
        dropout rate, the selected number of investigational group is total 25, and 25 of
        equivalent control group is planned.
