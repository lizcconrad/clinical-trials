    <measure>Primary efficacy as measured by Acute Procedure Success (APS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At discharge or at 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>APS is defined as successful implantation of the AVJ-514 device(s) with resulting MR severity of 2+ or less as determined by the Echocardiographic Core Laboratory (ECL) assessment of a discharge echocardiogram (30-day echocardiogram will be used if discharge echocardiogram is unavailable or uninterpretable). Patients who die or who undergo mitral valve surgery before discharge are an APS failure.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT is a practical simple test that requires a 100-ft hallway but no exercise equipment or advanced training for technicians. This test measures the distance that a patient can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes (the 6MWD). It evaluates the global and integrated responses of all the systems involved during exercise, including the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, systemic circulation, peripheral circulation, blood, neuromuscular units, and muscle metabolism. It does not provide specific information on the function of each of the different organs and systems involved in exercise or the mechanism of exercise limitation, as is possible with maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The self-paced 6MWT assesses the submaximal level of functional capacity.</description>

             Regurgitation (DMR) or Functional Mitral Regurgitation (FMR) determined by assessment
             of a qualifying transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) obtained within 90 days and
             transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) obtained within180 days prior to subject
             registration, with MR severity based principally on the TTE study and confirmed by the
             ECL. The ECL may request a TEE.

          3. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) is ≥ 30％ within 90 days prior to subject
             registration, assessed by the site using any one of the following methods:
             echocardiography, contrast left ventriculography, gated blood pool scan or cardiac
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Note: The method must provide a quantitative readout
             (not a visual assessment).

          4. New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification is class II, class III, or ambulatory
             class IV.

          5. Subject is deemed difficult for mitral valve surgery due to either Society of Thoracic
             Surgery (STS) surgical mortality risk for mitral valve replacement of ≥ 8% OR due to
             the presence of one of the following risk factors:

               -  Porcelain aorta or mobile ascending aortic atheroma

               -  Post-radiation mediastinum

               -  Previous mediastinitis

               -  Functional MR with LVEF &lt; 40%

               -  Over 75 years old with LVEF &lt; 40%

               -  Two or more prior cardiothoracic surgeries

               -  Hepatic cirrhosis

               -  Other surgical risk factor(s)

          6. Mitral valve area ≥ 4.0 cm2 assessed by ECL based TTE within 90 days prior to subject
             registration. The ECL may request a TEE.

          7. Left Ventricular End Systolic Dimension (LVESD) is ≤ 60mm assessed by site based on
             the TTE obtained within 90 days prior to subject registration.

          8. The primary regurgitant jet is non-commissural based on TEE, and in the opinion of the
             AVJ-514 implanting investigator can successfully be treated by the AVJ-514. If a
             secondary jet exists, it must be considered clinically insignificant.

          9. Transseptal catheterization and femoral vein access is determined to be feasible by
             the treating physician.

         10. The subject or the subject's legal representative has been informed of the nature of
             the study and agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent as
             approved by the Institutional Review Board of the respective clinical site.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must not meet any of the following exclusion criteria:

          1. LVEF is &lt; 30%

          2. Leaflet anatomy which may preclude AVJ-514 implantation, proper positioning on the
             leaflets or sufficient reduction in MR by the AVJ-514 based. This evaluation is based
             on TEE evaluation of the mitral valve within 180 days prior to subject registration
             and includes:

               -  Insufficient mobile leaflet available for grasping with the AVJ-514 device

               -  Lack of both primary and secondary chordal support in the grasping area

               -  Evidence of significant calcification in the grasping area

               -  Presence of a significant cleft in the grasping area

          3. Life expectancy &lt; 1 year due to associated non-cardiac co-morbid conditions

          4. Need for emergent or urgent surgery for any reason

          5. Prior open heart mitral valve leaflet surgery or any currently implanted prosthetic
             mitral valve or any prior transcatheter mitral valve procedure.

          6. Echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac mass, thrombus or vegetation.

          7. Active endocarditis or active rheumatic heart disease or leaflets degenerated from

             free from infection prior to treatment. Any required dental work should be completed a
             minimum of 21 days prior to treatment.

         20. Intravenous drug abuse or suspected inability to adhere to follow-up.

         21. Patients in whom TEE is contraindicated.

         22. A known hypersensitivity or contraindication to study or procedure medications which

             pacemaker or pacing leads would interfere with placement of the test device or the
             placement of the test device would disrupt the leads.

         24. Subject intends to participate in any other investigational or invasive clinical study
             within a period of 1 year following the AVJ-514 procedure.

             not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current
             study endpoints. (Note: Trials requiring extended follow-up for products that were
             investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not considered
             investigational trials).

         26. In the opinion of the investigator or designee, subject is unable to comply with the
             requirements of the study protocol or is unsuitable for the study for any reason.
