  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-dose,
      single-center, non-randomized study of JNJ-56021927 in participants who either have hepatic
      impairment or qualify for the control group. The study consists of 3 Phases: Screening Phase
      (21 Days), open-label treatment Phase (8 Days) and follow up Phase (49 Days). The duration of
      participation in the study for each participant is approximately 78 Days. Primarily the
      pharmacokinetics of JNJ-56021927 will be measured. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
