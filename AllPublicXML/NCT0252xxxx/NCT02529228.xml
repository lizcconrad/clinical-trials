      This study examines the effect of meal frequency and meal composition on risk factors of
      cardiometabolic disease.

    <textblock>
      Cardio-Metabolic Disease (CMD) is the leading cause of death globally &amp; in Singapore. Large
      scale epidemiological evidence confirmed that elevated postprandial Glucose, Insulin,
      Triglycerides are major risk factors for CMD. Recent evidence suggests benefits from high
      protein diets but the health effects of eating smaller meals remain enigmatic. The aim of
      this study is to examine Meal frequency (2-large vs 6-smaller isocaloric meals), under High
      or Low Protein loads on acute postprandial health biomarkers . The investigators hypothesized
      that Higher Protein &amp; Higher Meal Frequency would be beneficial for cardiometabolic health.
