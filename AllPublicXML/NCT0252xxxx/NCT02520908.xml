  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidermotropic T-cell lymphomas (ETCL), i.e. mycosis fungoides (MF) and its leukemic variant,
      Sézary syndrome, are the most frequent subtypes of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. MF typically
      runs an indolent course in its early stages. By contrast, advanced-stage ETCLs share a very
      bad prognosis: Patients usually show early relapses after chemotherapy, prolonged complete
      remissions exceptionally occur and quality of life is severely affected. Several publications
      have reported durable responses following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT) in advanced-stage ETCLs. This study aims to investigate the role of allogeneic HSCT in
      treating advanced-stage ETCLs. An observational, prospective, multicenter, controlled study
      will compare the outcomes of patients who receive reduced-intensity conditioned allogeneic
      HSCT from a sibling or 10/10 HLA-matched unrelated donor to those of patients who receive
      standard of care in patients with advanced-stage ETCL with poor prognostic features, will be
      performed. Patients are included at the time of donor search irrespective of the results, and
      compared on a donor versus no donor basis. It is an observational study since no intervention
      is made except the comparison of outcomes of groups that receive usual care (HSCT if donor
      available, or not).

    <description>Patients with an available sibling or 10/10 HLA-matched unrelated donor who undergo reduced-intensity conditioned allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), will be included in the study. The reduced-intensity conditioning usually includes Fludarabine 90 mg/m2 IV and Melphalan 140 mg/m2 IV. As usual care, patients will receive peripheral blood stem cells from their sibling donor if available, otherwise from their 10/10 HLA-matched unrelated donor</description>

    <description>Patients with no available sibling or 10/10 HLA-matched unrelated donor who therefore do not receive allogeneic HSCT but receive best standard of care treatment, will be included in the study, as the control group</description>

      During the blood samples usually performed in routine patient management, 30 ml of peripheral
      blood will be collected at inclusion and one year after inclusion and sent to the
      investigator's central collection laboratory (INSERM UMRS 976, Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris,
      France).
