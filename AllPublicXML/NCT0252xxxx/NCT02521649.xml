  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open, dose-ranging, multiple dose, multi-centre study in patients with Stage I-III or
      Stage IV gastric cancer. Twelve patients in each of 5 treatment groups were to receive three
      injections at weeks 0, 2 and 6 with provision for a single booster injection in an extension
      study period.
