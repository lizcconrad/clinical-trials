  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase 2 study was conducted of &quot;sandwich&quot; protocols, with earlier RT after an initial 2 of
      P-CHOP (Pegaspargase, cyclophosphamide,vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone ), followed
      by further two &quot;consolidation&quot; cycles,to explore the appropriate mode of combined modality
      therapy (CMT) in early stage ENKTL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) shows high local or systemic failure
      rates when radiotherapy (RT) is taken as the primary treatment, suggesting a role for
      chemotherapy (CT) added to RT for this disease. However, the appropriate mode of combined
      modality therapy (CMT) has not been fully defined.We conducted a prospective phase II study
      of &quot;Sandwich&quot; Pegaspargase, cyclophosphamide,vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone
      (P-CHOP) regimen in combination with radiotherapy.The &quot;sandwich&quot; protocols, refer to earlier
      RT after an initial 2 cycles of P-CHOP followed by further two &quot;consolidation&quot; cycles.
