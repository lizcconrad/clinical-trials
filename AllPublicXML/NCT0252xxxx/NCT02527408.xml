      This study will address the feasibility of using wrist-worn fitness trackers to monitor
      hospital inpatients. The study is being conducted in the Intensive Care Unit where patients
      are closely monitored, in order to provide gold standard measurements of heart rate, and
      accurate estimates of sleep quality.

      Overall Hypothesis:

      The use of wearable personal fitness trackers to monitor physiologic signals in hospital
      inpatients is feasible, reliable, secure, and cost effective.

      Specific Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the feasibility of applying a wrist-worn personal fitness tracker to
           hospital inpatients for the purpose of monitoring heart rate and sleep quality during
           the night.

        2. To determine the accuracy and completeness of high-frequency heart rate measurements
           recorded from personal fitness trackers in hospital inpatients.

        3. To compare measurements of sleep quality generated by personal fitness trackers with
           clinical assessments by nursing staff among hospital inpatients.

        4. To develop a workflow and data analysis pipeline for downloading, storing, analyzing,
           and visualizing data generated by personal fitness trackers worn by hospital inpatients.

        5. To evaluate the feasibility of a larger prospective multicenter trial examining the
           utility of personal fitness trackers among hospital inpatients, including recruitment
           rates, inclusion/exclusion criteria, data management protocols, and outcomes measures.
