    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the influence of alveolar recruitment maneuver, protocolized liberation
      from respiratory support and monitoring of Integrated Pulmonary Index on the duration of the
      mechanical ventilation and the number of pulmonary complications in the early postoperative
      period after cardiac surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The outcome of elective off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) can be significantly
      compromised due to early postoperative pulmonary complications. The risk of pulmonary
      complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), atelectases, and early
      ventilator-associated pneumonia remains inappropriate. Therefore, the maneuvers improving
      pulmonary aeration and the early restoration of spontaneous breathing activity can be of
      clinical value. Protocol-driven liberation from mechanical ventilation (CMV) can decrease the
      duration of CMV as well as the number of pulmonary complications. INTELLiVENT-Assisted
      spontaneous ventilation (INTELLiVENT-ASV) is a new approach, that may be as effective as
      conventional protocol-driven liberation from CMV.

      In parallel, the thorough postoperative monitoring of pulmonary function during both
      postoperative mechanical ventilation and spontaneous breathing is also of a great value. One
      of the novel approaches to respiratory monitoring is Integrated Pulmonary Index (IPI). The
      Integrated Pulmonary Index merges four vital parameters including end-tidal carbon dioxide
      (EtCO2), respiratory rate, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) measured by capnography
      and pulse oximetry into a single index value utilizing fuzzy logic model .

    <description>Active comparator: Discontinuation of mechanical ventilation in postoperative period will be provided using automatically driven mode - INTELLiVENT-ASV. In the INTELLiVENT-ASV mode target EtCO2 will be 30-35 mm Hg, target SpO2 - 94-98%, quick wean option - activated.</description>

    <description>Active comparator: Discontinuation from mechanical ventilation in postoperative period will be provided using physician driven protocol. The synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) mode settings will be as follows: PEEP 5 cm of water, FiO2 to achieve SpO2 &gt; 94 %. Inspiratory pressure will be adjusted to deliver a tidal volume (VT) of 8 mL/kg predicted body weight; pressure support will be 2 cm of water higher. Respiratory rate (RR) will be adjusted to provide EtCO2 of 30-35 mm Hg. Respiratory rate and inspiratory pressure will be decreased gradually every 30 minutes. After decrease of inspiratory pressure to 6 cm of water (8 cm of water in case of BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2) and respiratory rate to 6/min, the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be started.</description>
