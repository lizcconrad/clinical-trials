  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized-controlled, crossover pilot trial is to evaluate the
      feasibility, acceptability and effects of a non-deceptive (open-label) administration of
      placebo pills for treating cancer related fatigue (CRF). If significant effects are found,
      the investigators will later determine if the presence of a COMT Val18Met genotype variant
      predicts placebo responses.

      The investigators will conduct a pilot randomized-controlled, crossover trial to evaluate the
      feasibility, acceptability and effect of the open-label administration of placebo pills on
      CRF and associated psychosocial factors (e.g., emotional health, social health, quality of
      life, etc.) for cancer survivors (CSs) who have completed all cancer treatments yet continue
      to experience CRF. Additionally, in an exploratory manner, the investigators will collect DNA
      saliva specimens that will be analyzed for potential biomarkers that may predict placebo
      responses. To do this, investigators will use a 7-week, single site, two-parallel arm,
      randomized controlled crossover pilot study to determine the feasibility, acceptability and
      effects of an Open Label Placebo Intervention (OLPI) on CSs who completed cancer treatments
      at least 6 months prior to enrollment in the study and report a fatigue score of 4 or greater
      on a 0-10 scale. Investigators will enroll 80 eligible CS participants who will be randomized
      into two groups of 40 (Group1 and Group2 ). In this crossover study, participants in Group1,
      will receive an OLP (placebo pill) for 21-days (Period 1)and Group2 (Observational Controls)
      will not. After a 1-week washout period, Group2 will receive the OLP for 21-days (Period 2)
      and Group1 (Observational Controls) will not.

    <description>An open-label placebo intervention is an administered placebo that is fully disclosed to participants. It is delivered with a script that tells participants they are receiving placebos; placebos have been found to have effects that are comparable to some clinical treatments; placebos work because of conditioning, expectancies, interactions with care team and biochemical factors (i.e., dopamine, endorphins). Participants are given placebos to take for a 3-week period and will not receive placebos for a 4-week period (including a one-week washout period).</description>
