  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called trebananib (AMG 386). Trebananib (AMG 386) is
      being tested to treat people with advanced solid tumors.

      This study will look at the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of
      trebananib and response to treatment.

      The study will enroll approximately 18 participants. Once enrolled, participants will be
      assigned sequentially into 1 of the 3 cohorts:

        -  Trebananib 3 milligram/kilogram (mg/kg),

        -  Trebananib 10 mg/kg,

        -  Trebananib 30 mg/kg.

      All participants will receive trebananib via 60 minute intravenous infusion. This study will
      be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study is 14 weeks or more.
      Participants will attend the end-of-treatment visit 28 days after the last dose of study
      drug.

    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>DLT is defined as any treatment-related, grade 4 or higher hematologic or grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity (according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version 3.0; hematologic toxicity means any toxicities which are categorized in blood/bone marrow category of CTCAE), except for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and infusion reaction, occurred during the first 28 days after the initial administration (before examination on Study Day 29).

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. Treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or congenital anomaly; or a medically important event.</description>

PD: at least 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline smallest sum of longest diameter or appearance of 1 or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

DLT also includes AST or ALT: &gt;10*upper limit of normal (ULN) international units per liter (IU/L).</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. Treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or congenital anomaly; or a medically important event.</description>

        <description>Best overall response for a participant is the best observed post-baseline disease response as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 criteria. Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. Partial Response (PR): at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameter. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the baseline smallest sum of longest diameter; persistence of 1 or more non-target lesion(s) or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. PD: at least 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline smallest sum of longest diameter or appearance of 1 or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

        <title>Systemic Clearance at Steady State (CLss) for AMG 386</title>
        <description>CL is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the body. Systemic clearance at steady state (CLss) was calculated as the ratio of dose administered to AUC (0 – tau), where AUC (0 – tau) is the area under the serum concentration-time curve during a dosing interval, where tau is the length of the dosing interval (168 hours for once weekly regimen). CLss was normalized to participant’s body weight.</description>
