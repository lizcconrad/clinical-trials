    <textblock>
      While the duration of renal transplant function has increased over the last decade kidney
      transplanted patients (KTP) still exhibit a fracture risk 4 times higher than in the general
      population. Fracture risk remains increased despite the improvement of immunosuppressive
      therapies (IST) that allowed the reduction of steroid administration. Potential explanations
      for this could be 1) that Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) induces renal osteodystrophy that
      occurs before kidney transplanted, impairs bone metabolism and promotes bone fragility ; 2)
      that kidney transplanted patients are older and older (14% of kidney transplanted patients
      were older than 70 in 2011 in France), ageing being a major risk factor for fractures 3) IST,
      besides steroid, may have deleterious effects on bone and 4) that secondary
      hyperparathyroidism, a risk factor of fractures, persists after kidney transplanted . Thus,
      the pathophysiology and epidemiology of bone fragility of kidney transplanted patient remains
      insufficiently characterized. Despite these data, and contrarily to what is done for patients
      candidates for cardiac transplantation, there is no general consensus for performing bone
      evaluation before kidney transplanted . Thus it's necessary to individualize the management
      of bone fragility and prevent fractures according to strategies that remain to be defined,
      provided that patients at risk are better detected.

      Bone fragility is determined by quantitative parameters (bone mass) and qualitative
      parameters including macro- and micro-architecture (especially cortical porosity and
      thickness). The Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA ) measurement of Bone Mineral Density
      (BMD) is a robust predictor of fracture risk in the non-uremic population. Micro and
      macro-architecture can be measured with High Resolution peripheral micro Computerized
      Tomography (HRpQCT) at the ankle and the wrist . Some recent studies suggested that HRpQCT
      could be a better fracture predictor than DEXA in uremic populations. In this context, the
      aim of our project is to describe in a cross sectional study the bone status of CKD patients,
      candidates for kidney transplanted . It will be 1) calculated the prevalence of cortical
      osteoporosis as assessed by cortical thickness at the ankle and the wrist (primary end
      point), 2) analyzed other HRpQCT microarchitecture quantitative parameters and 3) defined the
      biological and clinical factors associated with bone degradation (secondary endpoints). This
      population will be compared to age and sex matched normal subjects (collaboration with Pr
      Rizzoli, Geneva, Switzerland). The DEXA and HRpQCT will be compared for detection of patients
      at risk for fracture.
