    <textblock>
      Bone marrow biopsy is a frequently performed procedure to diagnose and evaluate hematologic
      diseases. It is estimated that over 700,000 bone marrow procedures (BMP's) are performed
      annually in the U.S. Most of them are performed by practicing hematologists/oncologists in
      their offices or hospitals. However, a significant number are performed by
      hematologists-in-training (H-I-T's) in teaching hospitals. However, the incidences of
      complications associated with bone marrow biopsy are largely unknown. This study has two
      goals:

        1. The first goal is to objectively determine by CT and clinical assessment, the actual
           risk to patients of the bone marrow biopsy and the rate of pelvic injury in an
           unselected group of hematology patients requiring a bone marrow biopsy, as performed by
           hematologist-in-training.

        2. The second goal is to determine the quality of bone marrow biopsies obtained, using the
           lateral angulation technique.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have a hematological or oncological condition which requires a bone
             marrow aspiration and biopsy procedure, and no alternative procedures are available
             for diagnosis, staging, monitoring or follow up of their disease.

          2. Subjects must be able to understand the risks/benefits and provide written informed
             consent to participate in the study, and be willing to participate in all required
             study activities for the duration of the study.

          3. Subjects must be 40 years of age or older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients unable to give consent because they are decisionally impaired or have a
             language barrier that cannot be overcome.

          2. Psychiatric or cognitive illness or recreational drug/alcohol abuse that, in the
             opinion of the investigator would effect subject safety and/or compliance.

          3. Patients with uncontrolled bleeding disorders.

          4. Pregnant and lactating females (due to radiation exposure during the CT scans).
