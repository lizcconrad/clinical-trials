  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this research is to improve the effectiveness of buprenorphine
      maintenance treatment (BMT) within primary care.

      Investigators propose that providing BMT as part of a group medical visit (instead of an
      individual visit) will improve treatment outcomes for patients with persistent opioid abuse,
      because members become accountable to the group, are exposed to beneficial habits of others
      (i.e. positive deviance), and can receive efficacious behavioral interventions concomitantly
      with medical management
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators have developed a preliminary model of BMT group medical visits, conducted focus
      groups with BMT patients and providers, and will use this data to develop a manualized
      group-based BMT intervention (G-BMT). Investigators will then conduct a randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) of the G-BMT intervention within primary care to preliminarily test its efficacy,
      acceptability, and feasibility. Participants who have persistent opioid abuse while receiving
      BMT in primary care will be randomized to the G-BMT intervention (40 participants in 5
      groups) or to intensify BMT (treatment as usual) with their individual primary care physician
      (40 participants).

      Hypothesis: In a 16-week RCT of G-BMT, participants who receive the G-BMT intervention (vs.
      treatment as usual) will have higher abstinence rates (primary outcome, efficacy), fewer HIV
      risk behaviors (efficacy), and greater satisfaction with treatment (acceptability) and
      adherence to medical visits (feasibility).

    <measure>Efficacy - Opioid abstinence (composite measure, yes/no)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Opioid abstinence will be based on 30 day self-reported opioid use at 8 weeks and the results of observed urine toxicology tests at 8 weeks following protocol initiation. Abstinence (yes) will require no self-reported opioid use, and negative urine toxicology test for opiates, methadone, and oxycodone.</description>

    <measure>Retention in treatment (yes/no)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Retention is defined as having a medical visit or active buprenorphine prescription 12-16 weeks (3 month retention) and 24-28 weeks (6 month retention) after protocol initiation.</description>

    <description>The AIDS risk inventory will be used to measure sexual and injection-related risk behaviors at completion of the G-BMT intervention and 2 months later.</description>

    <measure>Feasibility (percentage of visits attended)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visit adherence will be measured as the number of buprenorphine visits attended divided by the number of buprenorphine visits required per protocol</description>
