      This study aims to investigate whether substitution of Efavirenz (EFV) as the
      Tenofovir/Emtricitabine/Efavirenz (TDF/FTC/EFV) fixed-dose combination (FDC) Atripla, with
      Rilpivirine as the tenofovir/emtricitabine/rilpivirine (TDF/FTC/RPV) fixed-dose combination
      (FDC) Eviplera, leads to resolution of covert Central Nervous System (CNS) toxicity
      associated with EFV, continued virological suppression and immunological reconstitution and
      whether this is associated with an improvement in quality of life, sleep, anxiety/depression
      and neurocognitive function; the impact of switch on adherence will also be investigated.

      Protocol Summary

      Study Title: SSAT 058 - A phase IV, open-label, multi centre pilot study to assess the
      prevalence of objective neurocognitive abnormality in patients without perceived Central
      Nervous System (CNS) symptoms on tenofovir/emtricitabine/efavirenz Atripla® and the effect of
      switching to a fixed dose combination of tenofovir/emtricitabine/rilpivirine (Eviplera®).
