    <measure>Investigation of clinical performance and patient outcome with KSS (Knee Society Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative, 3 months, 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee Society Clinical Rating System is comprised of two distinct sub-scores: one for pain, ROM and joint stability, and one for functional parameters. Sub-scores range from a potential minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 100 points. Although the specific scores are not distinguished as &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;fair,&quot; or &quot;poor,&quot; a higher value represents a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Investigation of clinical performance and patient outcome with KOOS patient questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative, 3 months, 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS (Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score) consists of 5 subscales: Pain, other symptoms, function in daily living, function in sport and recreation and knee related quality of life (QOL). The previous week is the time period considered when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is assigned a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms).</description>

    <description>Triathlon Cruciate Retaining knee (CR) with a tibial keel of standard length randomised against Triathlon Cruciate Retaining knee (CR) with a tibial part with a short keel, both system will be used with cemented fixation.

This study is aimed to evaluate if the short tibial keel will have equal fixation and migration properties as the standard keel.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients suffering exclusively from OA, Stage II-V [Ahlbäck-Traumascore, 1968 391]
             will be operated.

          2. Patients requiring knee prosthesis, suitable for the use of Duracon and Triathlon knee
             system

          3. Patients who understand the conditions of the study and are willing and able to comply
             with the post-operative scheduled clinical and radiographical evaluations and the
             prescribed rehabilitation.

          4. Patients who signed the Ethics Committee approved Informed Consent Form prior to
             surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous major knee surgery

          2. Other significant disabling problems from the muscular-skeletal system than in the
             knees

          3. Obese patients where obesity is severe enough to affect subject's ability to perform
             activities of daily living (body mass index, kg/m2: BMI above 35).

          4. Patients with active or suspected infection.

          5. Patients with malignancy - active malignancy.

          6. Patients with severe osteoporosis, Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy.

          7. Patients immunologically suppressed, or receiving steroids in excess of physiologic
             dose requirements.

          8. The patient has a neuromuscular or neurosensory deficit which would limit the ability
             to assess the performance of the device or the patient has a neurological deficit
             which interferes with the patient's ability to limit weight bearing or places an
             extreme load on the implant during the healing period.

          9. Female patients planning a pregnancy during the course of the study.

         10. Patients with systemic or metabolic disorders leading to progressive bone
             deterioration.

             compliant with the prescribed post-operative routine and follow-up evaluation
             schedule.

         12. Patients with other severe concurrent joint involvements, which can affect their
             outcome.

         13. Patients with other concurrent illnesses, which are likely to affect their outcome
             such as sickle cell anaemia, systemic lupus erythematosus or renal disease requiring
             dialysis.

         14. Patients under the protection of law (e.g. guardianship).
