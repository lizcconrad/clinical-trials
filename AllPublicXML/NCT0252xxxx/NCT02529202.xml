      The goal of this proposal is to profile the pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine in newborns
      ≥36 weeks post-menstrual age during therapeutic hypothermia for hypoxic-ischemic
      encephalopathy.

    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dexmedetomidine (DEX)
      in newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) receiving therapeutic hypothermia (TH)
      for moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). In newborns with HIE, TH for 72
      hours is the standard therapy to mitigate brain damage. Most HIE patients receive mechanical
      ventilation during TH and are thus sedated with morphine. Unfortunately, morphine has
      negative side effects and does not specifically prevent shivering. Prevention of shivering is
      critical to success of TH, as shivering negates cooling. DEX is a particularly promising
      alternative sedative because it does prevent shivering and is already used in NICUs for
      sedation and pain management. In newborns, DEX PK data in the setting of TH is not available
      and needs to be determined to properly dose DEX for HIE patients.

             Children's Hospital neonatal intensive care unit.

          2. Cooled infants who are initially intubated and mechanically ventilated.

          3. Infants anticipated to require 72 hrs of continuous sedation and/or treatment to
             prevent shivering.

          4. Subject's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) has/have voluntarily signed and dated the
             informed consent document approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent
             Ethics Committee (IEC).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known chromosomal anomalies.

          2. Newborns without central lines (e.g., lines not needed or unable to be successfully
