  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with an increased risk of kidney failure, with
      high levels of glycohaemoglobin (HbA1c) presenting a sharper decline in renal function and an
      increase in the risk of mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Polyphenols may improve
      renal insufficiency in patients with diabetes with chlorogenic acids (CGA) one of the
      principle polyphenol groups in the diet - coffee/tea, stone fruits (especially plums/prunes)
      and some vegetables (artichoke, chicory). CGA (3-4 cups of coffee) has been associated with
      25% lower risk of T2DM and a favourable reduction of HbA1c, blood pressure, and oxidative
      stress levels. This randomised controlled trial, therefore, aims to evaluate the effect of
      high CGA food on glycation and oxidative stress in T2DM subjects with early renal
      insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate of 35-60 mL/min) as well as progression of renal
      insufficiency and the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

      The study will have two phases - phase I, an interventional study of 3 months followed by
      phase II, an observational study of 21 months.

      In phase I, subjects will be randomized into 2 groups: CGA-enriched diet group, or control
      (habitual) diet group. The treatment group will be provided with a chlorogenic acid-rich food
      (coffee) with instructions to achieve an intake of 400 mg per day (equivalent to 3-4 coffee
      cups per day) for 12 weeks. The control group will receive a conventional coffee low in
      chlorogenic acid.

      Participants will attend three sessions during phase I; baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. At
      baseline, general information, medical history, dietary habits and medication use will be
      recorded and a Food Frequency Questionnaire completed. Urine and blood samples will be
      collected and blood pressure, waist circumference, height and weight recorded. Participants'
      diet over the previous 3 days will be assessed by estimated food diary analysis.

      In phase II, written dietary recommendations will be provided at three time points (months 6,
      12 and 24) - treatment group to achieve a CGA-rich diet (total polyphenol intake of at least
      1g per day, and at least 400mg per day of CGA) and standard dietary advice for the control
      group. Anthropometric/dietary data will be collected as well as blood and urine samples to
      assess markers of renal function, glycation and oxidative stress, and proteomic markers of
      cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease and diabetes.
