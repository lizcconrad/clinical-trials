  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of once daily
      application of IDP-123 Lotion to Tazorac Cream, 0.1%, Vehicle Lotion, and Vehicle Cream in
      subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 12-week study designed
      to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of IDP-123 Lotion in comparison with Tazorac
      Cream, Vehicle Lotion, and Vehicle Cream in subjects with moderate to severe acne. Treatment
      success will be evaluated by changes in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts, as
      well as treatment success using an Evaluator's Global Severity Score. IDP-123 is a lotion for
      the topical treatment of acne.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute change in mean inflammatory lesion counts at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Facial area lesion counts will be taken from the subject's face by the Evaluator at each visit and the change at week 12 from baseline will be calculated. Facial inflammatory lesions (pustules, papules, and nodules) will be counted as follows: pustules and papules will be counted and recorded together, not separately; nodular lesions will be counted and recorded separately.
Inflammatory lesions are defined as follows:
Papule - a solid, elevated lesion less than 5 mm; Pustule - an elevated lesion containing pus less than 5 mm; Nodule - palpable subcutaneous lesion greater than 5 mm; has depth, not necessarily elevated</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute change in mean non-inflammatory lesion counts at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Facial area lesion counts will be taken from the subject's face by the Evaluator at each visit, and the change at week 12 from baseline will be calculated. Non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) will be counted and recorded together.
Non-inflammatory lesions are defined as follows:
Open comedones (blackhead) - plugged hair follicle with dilated/open orifice, black in color; Closed comedones (whitehead) - plugged hair follicle: small opening at skin surface</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of subjects who achieve at least a two-grade reduction from baseline and are Clear or Almost Clear at Week 12 in the Evaluator's Global Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At each visit the severity will be determined based on evaluator-blinded evaluations of the signs and symptoms of acne vulgaris. Evaluations will be scored on a scale of 0-4 (Evaluator's Global Severity Score), with 0 being clear and 4 being severe. Please see below for complete definitions.
0 - Clear - Normal, clear skin with no evidence of acne vulgaris
Almost clear- Rare non-inflammatory lesions present, with rare non-inflamed papules
Mild- Some non-inflammatory lesions are present, with few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules only; no nodulocystic lesions)
Moderate-Non-inflammatory lesions predominate, with multiple inflammatory lesions evident: several to many comedones and papules/pustules, and there may or may not be one nodulocystic lesion
Severe- Inflammatory lesions are more apparent, many comedones and papules/pustules, there may or may not be up to 2 nodulocystic lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean percent change in inflammatory lesion count from baseline at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At each visit the Evaluator will count the total number of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules) on the subject's face, and the percent change will be calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean percent change in non-inflammatory lesion counts from baseline at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12.</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At each visit the Evaluator will count the total number of non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones), and the percent change will be calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of subjects with at least a two grade improvement in the Evaluator's Global Severity Score from baseline at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12.</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At each visit the severity will be determined based on evaluator-blinded evaluations of the signs and symptoms of acne vulgaris.

0 - Clear - Normal, clear skin with no evidence of acne vulgaris
Almost clear- Rare non-inflammatory lesions present, with rare non-inflamed papules (papules must be resolving and may be hyperpigmented, though not pink-red)
Mild- Some non-inflammatory lesions are present, with few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules only; no nodulocystic lesions)
Moderate-Non-inflammatory lesions predominate, with multiple inflammatory lesions evident: several to many comedones and papules/pustules, and there may or may not be one nodulocystic lesion
Severe- Inflammatory lesions are more apparent, many comedones and papules/pustules, there may or may not be up to 2 nodulocystic lesions.</description>
