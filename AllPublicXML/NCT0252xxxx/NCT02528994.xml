    <textblock>
      This study will test the effect of short-term, high-dose dietary serine supplementation on
      circulating levels of serine. Individuals with risk factors for type 2 diabetes will be
      recruited into the 2 week study. Effects of dietary serine supplementation on glycemic
      measures will also be explored.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, nutritional intervention study in adults.
      Subjects will have three visits to the Massachusetts General Hospital Clinical Research
      Center (CRC) during the 2 week study.

      At the first study visit (Visit 1), the following will occur: informed consent; medical and
      nutritional history assessment; blood pressure, weight and height, fasting blood draw and
      blood work during a 2 hr oral glucose tolerance test; explanation and instructions for
      completion of a 4-day food log; randomized assignment to dose of dietary serine
      supplementation (6g, 12g, 24g, or 48g); provide 7 days of dietary serine supplements; take
      first dose of supplement with snack; schedule Visit 2 and Visit 3.

      Between Visit 1 and Visit 2, participants will complete the Food Log and take the assigned
      dose of dietary serine supplementation 3 times daily.

      Visit 2 will occur 7 days after Visit 1. Subjects will not take dietary serine
      supplementation prior to Visit 2 activities. At Visit 2, the following will occur: weight and
      blood pressure; fasting blood draw; administration of assigned dose of dietary serine
      supplementation with snack after blood work; review of the 4-day food log; provide 7 days of
      dietary serine supplements completion of anonymous survey to assess tolerability of
      supplement. Participants will continue to take the assigned dose of dietary serine
      supplementation 3 times daily between Visit 2 and Visit 3.

      Visit 3 will occur 7 days after Visit 2. At Visit 3, the following will occur: weight and
      blood pressure; review of the 4-day food log; fasting blood draw and blood work during a 2 hr
      oral glucose tolerance test; completion of study survey to assess tolerability of the
      supplement.
