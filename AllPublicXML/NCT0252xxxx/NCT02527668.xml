  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young postmenopausal women with osteopenia / or women with osteoporosis and a FRAX score
      below pharmacologic treatment indication have limited treatment options in the prevention of
      osteoporosis/treatment of osteopenia. Further, there is a concern about long-term side
      effects of bisphosphonate treatment among young postmenopausal women, and hormone replacement
      therapy has been controversial. In a pilot study 20 microgram Calcifediol Hy.D improved
      several muscle related function in this target population within 4 months of treatment, which
      can help to prevent falls and associated bone fractures. Thus the main aim of this study is
      to test whether Calcifediol Hy.D at a daily dose of 20 Î¼g / day improves muscle function
      (lower extremity test battery) compared with (1) placebo and compared with (2) 3200 Vitamin
      D3 IU per day, at 3 and 6 month follow-up. As a secondary and exploratory objective of this
      study, the investigators will compare the beforementioned doses on muscle strength and the
      quality of the bones, beside muscle mass, body composition and systolic and diastolic blood
      pressure measurements.

    <description>The &quot;lower extremity function&quot; test battery consists of: 8-meter walk test, repeated sit-to-stand test and knee flexion and extension strength test). A repeated measures analysis across all four test battery components simultaneously documenting the difference in proportion of those who improved or maintained function compared to those who declined in function by treatment group (comprised endpoint on lower extremity function) will be performed. Calcifediol Hy.D will be compared with (1) placebo and compared with (2) 3200 Vitamin D3 IU per day -for the time points baseline 3 and 6 months. Outcomes of the individual tests are subject to the secondary outcome measures.</description>
