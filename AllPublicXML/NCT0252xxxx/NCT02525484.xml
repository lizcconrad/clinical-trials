  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, randomized, four-treatment period, four-sequence, single-dose,
      crossover pharmacokinetic study to determine the bioequivalence of pirfenidone after
      administration of tablet and capsule dosage forms under both fed and fasted conditions.
