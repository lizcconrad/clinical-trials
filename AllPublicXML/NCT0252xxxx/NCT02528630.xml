      Background: Hand osteoarthritis (OA) is highly prevalent, affecting 55-70% of the population
      over 55 years with an age-related progressive increase. The OA of interphalangeal (IF) and
      carpometacarpal joints may have varying degrees of deformity associated with pain, decreased
      of grip and pinch strength, decreased range of motion and functional impairment. Systematic
      reviews and meta-analyzes have shown the beneficial effect of exercise for lower limb OA,
      however for hand OA exercise is still used based on recommendations based on clinical
      experience and low quality studies, not allowing a conclusion about the effects of exercise
      in pain, function and strength in hand OA patients.

      Objective: assess the effectiveness of progressive resistance strength training program on
      pain, function and strength in hand OA patients.

      Methods: diagnostic of hand OA according to American College of Rheumatology of at least
      1year, age over 50 years, both genders, pain in IF joints between 3-8 cm on a 10-cm numerical
      pain scale (NPS). Sixty patients who meet the eligibility criteria were randomized into
      exercise group (EG) and control group (CG). Both groups performed a session regarding joint
      protection and energy conservation before randomization. The EG performed a progressive
      resistance strength training program for intrinsic muscles of the hand for 12 weeks. The
      outcome measures were NPS; Australian/Canadian (AUSCAN) Hand Osteoarthritis Index and Cochin
      Hand Functional Scale for hand function; grip and pinch strengthening using the Hydraulic
      Hand Dynamometer and a pinch gauge dynamometer and satisfaction with the treatment using a
      Likert scale. A blinded evaluator performed the evaluations at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks after
      treatment baseline.
