  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized trial is to determine the superiority of utilizing radioactive
      seed localization (RSL) over wire-guided localization (WL) for palpable or non-palpable
      malignant lesions in patients undergoing breast conservation surgery (BCS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consented and eligible subjects will be randomized to either radioactive seed localization or
      wire localization and stratified by surgeon and invasive versus DCIS prior to localization.
      Subjects on both arms will undergo breast conservation surgery including surgical specimen
      removal. Specimens will be grossed according to standard of care procedures. Localization,
      breast conservation surgery, and post-operative appointments will follow standard of care
      guidelines. Surveys will be administered according to the study calendar to the radiologist,
      surgeon, pathologist, and subject for data collection.

    <description>The primary objective for this study will be the comparison between Radioactive Seed Localization (RSL) and Wire-Guided Localization (WL) based on negative margins in malignant breast disease. This is defined as no tumor on ink in invasive disease and greater than or equal to 2mm from the inked margin in non-invasive disease (DCIS).</description>
