      Charts of contact lens wearers with diagnosed dry eye who are being treated with Restasis
      will be evaluated to determine success in treatment by retrospectively looking at various
      outcome measures including but not limited to schirmer, staining and osmolarity levels

          -  Subject was previously diagnosed (prior to Baseline Visit) with mild to severe dry eye
             disease (ITF level 1, 2 or 3) which required continuous medical therapy with Restasis®
             for a minimum duration of 6 months post-Baseline (Visit 1); or Subject was newly
             diagnosed (at Baseline Visit) with mild to severe dry eye disease (ITF level 1, 2 or
             3) which required continuous medical therapy with Restasis® for a minimum duration of
             6 months post-Baseline (Visit 1);

          -  Subject was prescribed Restasis® therapy at Baseline Visit (Visit 1) and commenced
             dosing immediately after Baseline Visit (Visit 1)

          -  Baseline Visit occured between 01 July 2012 and 01 January 2014;

          -  Subject had corneal staining and at least one dry eye sign (i.e., Schirmer's Test
             score &lt;10 mm, decreased tear lake, TBUT &lt;10 seconds, conjunctival staining, tear
             osmolarity &gt;310 mOsmol/L

          -  Subject had charted tolerability and efficacy data reflecting at least one follow-up
             visit following Restasis® treatment initiation; and

          -  Subject wore contact lens(es) concurrently while receiving Restasis® treatment for a
             minimum duration of 6 months post-Baseline (Visit 1)
