  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Significant concern regarding the safety of general anesthesia in children has arisen due to
      myriad animal studies suggesting neurotoxicity of commonly used anesthetic agents.
      Inflammation of the central nervous system after anesthesia may have a significant role in
      the pathogenesis of anesthetic-induced neural injury. To evaluate this hypothesis, the
      investigators propose to randomize healthy infants undergoing elective surgery to one of two
      anesthetics: 1) spinal anesthesia only; or 2) general inhalational anesthesia with
      isoflurane, laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or endotracheal tube (ETT), and single-shot caudal
      block. Primary endpoint will be serum inflammatory biomarkers and transcriptome analysis and
      secondary endpoint will be neurocognitive outcome at 6 months and 1 year.

    <time_frame>Blood will be drawn before surgical incision, at the conclusion of the surgery (typically ~1 hour after incision), and at arrival to the PACU (typically 10-30 minutes after end of surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples will be analyzed for a composite measure of systemic inflammation caused by the anesthetic agent. MicroRNA (miRNA) expression will be compared between the time points for each patient and between arms.
Total RNA will be extracted from whole blood using a commercially available kit. RNA will then be assayed for transcriptome analysis using microarray technology.
Serum cytokines will be analyzed using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α), Interleukin one beta (IL-1β),Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein one (MCP-1), Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-ĸB), transcription factor p65, and S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B). miR-155, miR-146a, miR-146b, and miR-142-3p will be quantified using quantified polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).</description>
