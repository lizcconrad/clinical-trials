      Four concentrations of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae allergen
      extracts, together with a positive and negative control, using 10 mg/ml histamine
      dihydrochloride solution and a glycerinated phenol saline solution, respectively, will be
      tested in every patient in duplicate on the volar surface of the forearm..

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical history positive inhalation allergy (rhinitis I rhinoconjunctivitis I asthma)
             against Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus or Dermatophagoides farinae.

          -  A prick-test positive (average of the papule ≥ 3 mm diameter) with a summary of the
             same allergen I presence against the allergen specific Immunoglobulin E.

          -  The average area of the papule obtained by histamine dihydrochloride to 10 mgml must
             be greater than or equal 7 mm2.

          -  Age: over 18 years of age.

          -  Both sexes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects outside of the age range.

          -  Individuals who have previously received immunotherapy in the last 5 years for the
             treatment of asthma or the allergic rhinoconjunctivitis induced by allergens that may
             interfere with the extract mixture of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus or farinae.

          -  Subjects with important symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis I bronchial asthma in which
             the suspension of the antihistamine treatment for systemic is contraindicated.

          -  Subjects that have previously submitted a serious secondary reaction during skin prick
             test diagnostic tests.

          -  Subjects in treatment with ss-blockers.

          -  Unstable subjects of clinical point of view (asthma acute, febrile, etc.).

             dermatitis, sunburn, eczema, lesions of psoriasis in the area of realization of the
             prick test (risk of false positives).

          -  Subjects with viral infection activates the herpes simplex or herpes varicella-zoster
             in the area of realization of the prick test.

          -  Subjects that have some pathology in which the administration of adrenaline
             (hyperthyroidism, hypertension, heart disease, etc.) is contraindicated.

          -  States of the subject that can not offer cooperation and severe psychiatric disorders.
