  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and metabolic disease result when energy intake consistently exceeds energy
      expenditure. One appealing new target for treatment is the activation of brown adipose tissue
      (BAT), an organ recently found to be functional in adult humans. Brown adipocytes selectively
      express uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which renders the inner membrane of mitochondria leaky,
      thereby diverting chemical energy from ATP generation to heat production. Interest in BAT has
      been spurred by the recognition that in addition to classical BAT depots, other
      brown-fat-like cells are present in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) in animals
      and also in humans.These cells have structural and functional properties that resemble brown
      adipocytes, and they are referred to as beige or 'brite' (brown-in-white) adipocytes.
      Interestingly, browning of WAT can be induced in animals and humans by physiological stimuli
      such as cold exposure, which increases adrenergic tone, and by exercise, which selectively
      drives WAT browning through irisin, an exercise-induced myokine. In addition b-adrenergic
      drugs and other pharmacological agents,such as prostaglandins, can induce browning of white
      adipose tissue. More recently, one study showed that treatment of C57BL/6 mice with
      phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil (12 mg/kg/d) for 7 d caused 4.6-fold increase in
      uncoupling protein-1 expression and promoted establishment of a brown fat cell-like phenotype
      (&quot;browning&quot;) of WAT in vivo. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that sildenafil can
      promote browning of white adipose tissue and improves insulin sensitivity in human adults.

      The study subjects will be taken placebo (first stage) and sildenafil (second stage)
      intervention for 7 days, respectively afterward.Subcutaneous fat tissue and muscle samples
      will be obtained by biopsy from some individuals and measure the browning of white adipose
      tissue and insulin signaling.The insulin sensitivity will be tested by insulin clamp assay
      before and after each intervention, respectively. In addition,blood samples for biochemical
      analysis will be obtained before and after each intervention, respectively.

      The browning of white adipose tissue will be measured by the expressions of peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), PPARγcoactivator 1α (PGC-1α), uncoupling protein 1
      (UCP-1), the second messenger cyclic guanosine-3', 5'-monophosphate (cGMP),PR domain
      containing 16 zinc finger transcription factor (Prdm16) and deiodinase, iodothyronine, type
      II (DIO2).The metabolic makers will be measured by blood pressure, heart rate, thyroid
      functions, resting metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, blood cGMP, blood insulin and blood
      glucose.
