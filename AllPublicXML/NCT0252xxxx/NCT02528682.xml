  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is a potent treatment, and sometimes the only
      curative treatment for aggressive hematological malignancies. The therapeutic efficacy is
      attributed to the graft-versus-tumor (GVT) response, during which donor-derived CD8+ T cells
      become activated by recipient minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA) presented on dendritic
      cells (DC). Consequently, these alloreactive donor T cells clonally expand, acquire effector
      functions and kill MiHA-positive malignant cells. However, in a substantial number of
      patients persistence and recurrence of malignant disease is observed, indicating that
      insufficient GVT immunity is induced. This is reflected by our observation that not all
      patients develop a productive CD8+ T cell response towards MiHA mismatched between the
      recipient and donor. We found that the PD-1/PD-L1 co-inhibitory pathway is involved in
      dampening MiHA-specific CD8+ T cell expansion and function post-transplantation. Therefore, a
      promising strategy to induce or boost GVT immune responses is pre-emptive or therapeutic
      vaccination with ex vivo-generated donor DCs loaded with MiHA that are exclusively expressed
      by recipient hematopoietic cells and their malignant counterparts. In contrast to pre-emptive
      donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) with polyclonal donor T cells, this MiHA-DC vaccination
      approach has less risk of inducing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the potency to induce
      more efficient GVT-associated T cell immunity. In addition, the potency of this DC vaccine
      will be further enhanced by interference with the PD-1/PD-L1 co-inhibitory pathway, using
      siRNA mediated PD-L1/PD-L2 silencing.

    <measure>The generation and magnitude of an immunological response</measure>
    <time_frame>From day 0 until day 84</time_frame>
    <description>When after DC vaccination &gt;1.0% of all CD8+ lymphocytes at any time point are specific CD8+ T cells to the used MiHA vaccine target, a complete response will be considered to be present. When the percentage is between 0.02% and 1%, but has been doubled during two weeks, a partial immune response will be considered to be present.</description>

    <measure>Changes in chimerism</measure>
    <time_frame>day 0, day 14, day 28, day 64, day 84</time_frame>
    <description>When chimerism changes towards donor or disease load decreases according to objective standard clinical criteria after vaccination, this will be considered as a clinical response.
Chimerism in PBMC will be measured by SNP Q-PCR analysis according to standard practice in the molecular diagnostic unit of Department of Laboratory Medicine. When chimerism changes towards complete donor, this will be considered as a clinical response.</description>

    <measure>Disappearance of residual disease</measure>
    <time_frame>day 0, day 14, day 28, day 64, day 84</time_frame>
    <description>In the case of presence of detectable residual or persistent disease before DC vaccination, clinical effects will be investigated by monitoring residual disease by quantitative real-time bcr-abl PCR (CML, Ph+ ALL), WT1-specific PCR (AML, MDS), M-protein (MM), immunophenotyping (CLL, AML, ALL, MDS) and radiological examination (NHL) after vaccination. When disease load decreases according to objective standard clinical criteria after vaccination, this will be considered as a clinical response.</description>
