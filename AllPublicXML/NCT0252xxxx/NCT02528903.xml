             12-lead ECG, and vital signs

          -  Clinical laboratory evaluations should be within reference range for the test, unless
             deemed not clinically significant by the investigator and sponsor at screening

          -  Willing to abstain from using drugs of abuse while enrolled in the study

          -  Willing and able to comply with protocol-specified criteria in regard to contraceptive
             protection

          -  Able to comply with the study protocol, in the investigator's judgment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or clinically significant manifestations of metabolic, hepatic, renal,
             hematologic, immunodeficiency, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urologic,
             neurologic, or psychiatric disorders

          -  History of anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity or drug allergies, unless approved by the
             investigator and sponsor

          -  History or presence of an abnormal ECG, which, in the investigator's or sponsor's
             opinion, is clinically significant (including evidence of previous acute myocardial
             infarction, complete left bundle branch block, second-degree heart block, or complete
             heart block)

          -  History of significant alcohol abuse within 1 year prior to screening or regular use
             of alcohol within 6 months prior to the screening visit

          -  History of significant drug abuse within 1 year prior to screening or use of soft
             drugs (such as marijuana) within 3 months prior to screening visit or hard drugs (such
             as cocaine, phencyclidine [PCP], and crack) within 1 year prior to screening

          -  Current tobacco smokers (positive history within 3 months before initiation of dosing
             on Day 1), or those with positive cotinine test at check-in

          -  Positive drug screen at screening or at check-in

          -  Positive pregnancy test result at screening or Day -1 or breast feeding during the
             study

          -  Any serious medical condition or abnormality in clinical laboratory tests that, in the
             investigator's judgment, precludes the participant's safe enrollment in and completion
             of the study

          -  Unwillingness to comply or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would interfere with the ability to comply with the study protocol
