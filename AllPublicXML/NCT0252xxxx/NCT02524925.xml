    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized clinical study, with cross-sectional comparisons and correlations
      was conducted from May 2012 to July 2015 with a sample of 231 patients who have undergone
      hepatectomy or pancreatectomy, randomized into 2 groups. In group A was applied
      postoperatively the protocol Fast-track, while in group B the conventional postoperative
      care. Demographic and clinical data were collected. In 170 patients, Neuropeptide Y (NPY),
      Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)/Cortisol plasma levels were measured by ELISA method: a)
      at the day of patient's admission, b) the operation day, c) the 3rd postoperative day or
      prior to discharge.

      Pain levels were assessed by Puntillo scale (behavioral observation scale) which has ranges;
      0-1 &quot;no pain&quot;, 2-4 &quot;aching&quot; 5-7 &quot;moderate pain&quot; 8-10 and &quot;severe pain&quot;.

      Patient stress levels were evaluated by: a) scale I.C.U.E.S.S. which evaluated environmental
      stress during their stay in hospital and takes values; 40-80 &quot;no environmental stress&quot; 81-120
      &quot;mild to moderate environmental stress,&quot; 121-160 &quot; Moderate to severe environmental stress &quot;,
      b) three questions of self- experienced feelings (with a score of 0 = None and 10 =
      Completely) like &quot;How sad you feel right now?&quot; &quot;How stress do you feel right now?&quot; &quot;How
      optimist do you feel right now about the future?&quot; The data collected in three phases: a) the
      day of hospitalization, b) the day of surgery, and c) the third postoperative day or before
      discharge.

      Depression levels were evaluated with Zung scale (Zung self-rating depression scale), which
      assesses depression levels with a score 25-49 for &quot;normal level mood,&quot; 50-59 for &quot;mild
      depression&quot;, 60-69 for &quot;moderate depression&quot; and 70 + for &quot;severe depression&quot;.
