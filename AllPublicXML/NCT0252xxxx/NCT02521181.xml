    <textblock>
      The two doses of sodium bicarbonate being tested are 0.5 and 0.8 mEq/kg-lean body weight
      (LBW) per day. Sodium bicarbonate, also known as baking soda, may help prevent kidney failure
      in people with chronic kidney disease. However, the dose to prescribe in order to test this
      possibility in a clinical trial is uncertain. The BASE pilot clinical trial will help
      determine the best dose of sodium bicarbonate to prescribe in a future study that will test
      the long-term safety and efficacy of sodium bicarbonate as a treatment to preserve kidney
      function in individuals with chronic kidney disease.

    <description>The prescribed dose for each participant at the end of 28 weeks will be determined by the safety and tolerability of each dose during the intervention period. The primary assessments will examine the percentage of participants in each dose arm who are prescribed (i) the full randomized sodium bicarbonate dose according to the protocol at the end of 28 weeks and (ii) at least 25% of the randomized sodium bicarbonate dose according to the protocol at the end of 28 weeks. The two doses of sodium bicarbonate being tested are 0.5 and 0.8 mEq/kg-lean body weight per day.</description>

    <measure>Change in Urinary ammonium excretion in mEq/L from baseline to 28 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sodium bicarbonate reduces urinary ammonium excretion (mEq/L). This outcome will determine if the 0.8 mEq/kg-lean body weight per day dose lowers urinary ammonium excretion more than the 0.5 mEq/kg-lean body weight per day dose.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Serum bicarbonate 20-28 mEq/L at screening (the average of the two most recent values
             in Baseline must be 20-28 mEq/L prior to randomization)

          2. Moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) at the time of screening, defined as
             one of the following:

               -  eGFR 20-44 ml/min/1.73m2 or

               -  eGFR 45-59 ml/min/1.73m2 plus random urinary albumin:creatinine (ACR) ≥100 mg/gm
