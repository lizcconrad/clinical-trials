  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Tardive dyskinesia and dystonia (TDD) are severe side effects of dopamine blocking
      agents, particularly antipsychotics. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown to be effective
      in the treatment of TDD in psychiatric patients, but only reported in case reports and small
      clinical trials and with little attention to possible psychiatric or cognitive complications
      or positive effect on psychiatric symptoms.

      Objective: To assess whether treatment with DBS can reduce or resolve TDD and if DBS can
      induce beneficial or side-effects in particular psychiatric symptoms.

      Study design: A delayed onset double blind randomised controlled trial. Study population:
      Adult patients with a current or previous psychiatric disorder and antipsychotic induced TDD
      with a stable psychiatric status during the past 6 months.

      Intervention: All patients will be treated with DBS in the posteroventrolateral GPi. The
      groups will be randomised into immediate stimulation or delayed stimulation after 3 months.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary objective, improvement on the movement rating scales
      BFMDRS. Secondary objectives improvement on the quality of life measured on the SF-36,
      psychiatric stability as measured on the BPRS and the MADRS and cognitive effects as measured
      on the MATTIS Dementia Rating Scale, Nederlandse Leestest voor Volwassenen (NLV), 15 word
      test, Facial Expression of Emotion S+T (FEEST), Groninger Intelligentie Test woordopnoemen
      (GIT), category and letter fluency test, Trail Making Test part A and B and the Stroop colour
      and word test
