  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have shown the benefits of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with
      biventricular pacing in patients with heart failure with left ventricular dysfunction. CRT
      restores contraction coordination between different regions of the left ventricle, which
      yields a significant improvement in LV systolic function, symptoms, exercise tolerance and
      quality of life. In the longer term, treatment with resynchronization induces a reverse
      remodeling of the left ventricle and a decrease in mortality and morbidity (hospitalization
      for heart failure). Nevertheless, even if a majority of patients treated with CRT feel the
      benefit, some (up to 40% depending on the response criteria of CRT) do not experience
      significant improvement (nonresponders). Echocardiography and imaging have not so far
      demonstrated their added value to optimize delivery of CRT. Monocentric promising work on
      limited numbers of patients, however, were carried out. Meanwhile, equipment for delivering
      CRT evolves and new probes with four poles stimulation of the left ventricle are now used.
      The objective of this research is to validate new sequences of ultrasound processing
      estimating the CRT. These tools are based on usual echocardiographic examination of patients

      Pilot study for testing tools pre and post-treatment images echocardiography but also MRI
      with a descriptive purpose and identification of the computed parameters should be
      secondarily test a large multicenter cohort . Patients in the study will be explored in
      RICART preimplantation as then in the manner used in current clinical routine. The use of
      data by cons will focus on the study of new tools ever compared in the same patients.

      Data echocardiography (as with other techniques) are those used in clinical routine. Then,
      the data processing to be carried characterized the asynchrony posteriori, regardless of
      initial clinical data on a dedicated search software. Each quantitative parameter will be
      compared with others in order to predict the response to resynchronization. Response
      prediction of threshold values to the resynchronization can be obtained and compared to each
      of the tools. The value of relative and an addition to another may be tested.

      The predictive value of the change (delta) of each parameter between the pre- and
      post-implantation to predict response to al resynchronization, will be evaluated.
