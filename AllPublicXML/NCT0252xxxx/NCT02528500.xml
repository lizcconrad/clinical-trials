      This study will assess the initial feasibility of the GORE® EXCLUDER® Thoracoabdominal Branch
      Endoprosthesis (TAMBE Device) in the treatment of Aortic Aneurysms Involving the Visceral
      Branch Vessels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized study designed to assess the feasibility of the TAMBE
      Device in the treatment of patients with aortic aneurysms involving the visceral branch
      vessels. A maximum of 10 Subjects will be treated under this Protocol. This clinical study
      will include up to six sites in the US. Each enrolled subject will undergo periodic follow-up
      evaluations involving physical exams, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of chest,
      abdomen and pelvis, creatinine measurement, abdominal ultrasound (optional) at specific,
      protocol-defined intervals for a period of five years following the GORE® EXCLUDER®
      Thoracoabdominal Branch Endoprosthesis impant.

    <description>Components of Device Integrity: Loss of functional patency in any treated branch component due to thrombus or mechanical failure of branch component, loss of functional patency in main body component(s) due to thrombus or mechanical failure of main body components(s) , separation of treated branch component from the main body component(s), separation of the main body component(s) from the accessory components</description>

    <description>Primary Patency - Blood flow without occlusion maintained through the device without an intervention. Assisted Primary Patency: Blood flow maintained through the device after implant regardless of re-interventions performed. Secondary Patency - Blood flow through the device (following occlusion) regardless of re-interventions performed and freedom from surgical bypass.</description>

    <description>Study designed to assess the feasibility of the GORE® EXCLUDER® Thoracoabdominal Branch Endoprosthesis (TAMBE Device) in the treatment of patients with aortic aneurysms involving the visceral branch vessels. Patients with thoracoabdominal or pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysms are eligible for screening for participation in the study. The particular characteristics of the patient's aneurysm and anatomy will determine ultimate eligibility for enrollment. Only patients who meet all of the eligibility criteria will be enrolled.</description>
