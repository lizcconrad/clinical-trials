  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intimate partner violence (IPV), also known as domestic abuse, is a leading cause of
      non-fatal injury in women worldwide. 1 in 6 women attending surgical fracture clinics have a
      history of IPV in the past year. Given the high prevalence and costs associated with IPV,
      there is a need to identify health outcomes associated with IPV, the incidence of new and
      worsening cases of IPV, and resource use among IPV victims. This prospective cohort study of
      women with fractures and dislocations will assess differences in injury-related outcomes
      (time to fracture healing, injury-related complications, and return to pre-injury function)
      between abused and non-abused women. This study will also determine whether a musculoskeletal
      injury can lead to new or worsening abuse by an intimate partner and how patterns of IPV
      change over time following musculoskeletal injuries.Finally, the proposed study will also
      inform the feasibility of a larger multinational cohort study.

      Number of Participants:

      250

      Primary Research Objectives:

      Feasibility

      Secondary Research Objective:

      The secondary objectives are to determine:

        1. How a history of IPV affects injury-related complications;

        2. How a history of IPV affects return to pre-injury function;

        3. Incident cases of IPV after a musculoskeletal injury, if the injury was not the result
           of IPV;

        4. How a history of IPV affects health care and support service use after a musculoskeletal
           injury;

        5. How a history of IPV affects health-related quality of life after a musculoskeletal
           injury;

        6. How patterns of IPV change over time after a musculoskeletal injury;

        7. How abused women's stage of change changes over time after a musculoskeletal injury

      Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria:

      The inclusion criteria are:

        1. adult females (at least 16 or 18 years of age depending on local ethics requirements);

        2. patients presenting to participating fracture clinics within 6 weeks of their
           musculoskeletal injury;

        3. patients presenting with a fracture or dislocation which is being managed with either
           surgical or non-surgical treatment.

      The exclusion criteria are:

        1. unwilling to or unable to provide consent;

        2. unable to complete the study questionnaires in a private location, due to safety and
           confidentiality;

        3. unwilling or unable to follow the study protocol or their attending surgeon has concerns
           about their ability or willingness to follow study protocols;

        4. does not speak and write in English or the dominant language of the local clinic

      Study Outcomes:

      The primary outcome is feasibility. Secondary outcomes are injury-related complications,
      return to function, incidence of IPV, quality of life, abuse type and severity, and stage of
      change.

      Duration of Patient Follow-Up:

      Study participants will be followed for 12 months
