      To determine the impact of OrCam on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in subjects with
      advanced glaucoma over 1 month and to assess health-related quality of life using the
      National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire 25 (NEI-VFQ-25).

      To determine the tasks for which the subjects are using the OrCam device and patient
      satisfaction and to analyze qualitative data from weekly patient logs, in order to determine
      efficacy of OrCam.

    <textblock>
      Participants will be expected to attend 2 appointments at Wills Eye (baseline and final
      visit) and document their daily impression about the use of OrCam, over a 1-month period.
      During the participant's baseline visit, the patient will be trained on how to use the OrCam
      device by the research assistants. The Wills Eye trainer will be trained directly by OrCam
      before training participants. The subject will complete a best-corrected visual acuity
      assessment (ETDRS) and complete the NEI-VFQ-25. They will also read a short printout of an
      online newspaper article.

      The NEI-VFQ-25 includes a series of 25 questions pertaining to vision or feelings about a
      vision condition. Answers are selected among a numbered list of possible responses, the
      values of which are ultimately recoded and converted to a 0 to 100 scale so that the lowest
      and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100 points, respectively. Items within each
      subscale are averaged together to create 12 subscale scores.10 An overall composite score
      will be calculated by averaging the vision-targeted subscale scores, excluding the general
      health rating question.

      Participants will read a short article. They will be asked to grade their difficulty reading
      between 1 (unable to read) to 10 (able to read without difficulty). The time that will be
      required to complete the reading of the article will be recorded. This task will be performed
      with best correction - with and without the assistance of the OrCam device.

      After training and baseline visit, the subjects will utilize OrCam daily for one month. Each
      week, subjects will record their thoughts about the device in the log book. The log book will
      be filled by writing or using an audio tape recorder, according to the patient's personal
      preference. The following topics will be addressed: average number of hours using OrCam
      daily, fields in which vision-related quality of life has improved, fields in which OrCam did
      not improve vision-related quality of life, problems using OrCam, and general feelings on the
      device. Additionally, a research assistant will call the participants weekly to discuss the
      topics and address any other concerns.

      After this month-long period, the subjects will return to Wills Eye Hospital to undergo their
      final assessment. Best-corrected visual acuity (ETDRS), NEI-VFQ-25, and the newspaper-reading
      task will be completed again with and without the assistance of OrCam. A satisfaction
      questionnaire will also be completed in order to assess the subjects' overall feelings on
      OrCam. The audio log books will be analyzed for the listed specific factors and recorded by a
      research assistant.
