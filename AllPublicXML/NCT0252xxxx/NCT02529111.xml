  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The interventional catheterization allows the percutaneous treatment of congenital heart
      diseases as the atrial septal defect (ASD). The examination is guided by the X-rays with
      stochastic side effects worrying at the child's. The software &quot;Echonavigator&quot; allows to merge
      the ultrasound image and fluoroscopic. This innovative software facilitates the procedures
      and reduce the irradiation time in some adult procedures.

      The aim of this study was to validate the image fusion in children.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The software &quot;Echonavigator&quot; will be used after the introduction of the percutaneous closure
      of ASD prosthesis. The image fusion on fluoroscopy will then be applied and the bias between
      the generated ultrasound image and the X-ray view of the prosthesis will be measured. The
      center marker visible prosthesis ultrasound and fluoroscopy used as a reference marker.

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Through the fusion image will be measured by a fixed mark in 4 mm implications. This bias will be averaged in absolute terms and compared to zero through reference.
The bias will be measured by two methods: one using the tool positioning an echo point of interest later merged fluoroscopy, the other using a fusion of 3D image possible with the second version.
The method will be considered valid if the bias is not significantly different from 0 with a tolerance of 2 mm by 2 methods.</description>
