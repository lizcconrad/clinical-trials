    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, beginning
      most often in subjects aged 20-40 years. In France, thanks to recent studies reported during
      general states of MS in 2006, the prevalence is estimated at 65.5 / 100,000 population (96.3
      / 100,000 women and 41.9 / 100,000 men) and incidence at 7.91 per 100,000. In Lower Normandy,
      the incidence of MS is estimated to 4.45 / 100,000 inhabitants or 60 new cases per year.

      The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess the levels of glutamate and aspartate
      (excitotoxicity markers) and their repercussions on the clinical and radiological outcome in
      40 patients experiencing an event demyelinating central nervous system.
