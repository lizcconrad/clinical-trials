  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical
      trial, parturients with primary PPH are eligible for treatment with fibrinogen concentrate
      following both vaginal delivery and cesarean section complicated by an estimated blood loss
      (EBL) &gt;1000 mL and an ongoing bleeding notwithstanding standard treatment measures (volume
      replacement, uterine massage, and uterotonic agents).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed trial targets early detection and treatment of fibrinogen depletion in PPH. A
      widespread belief in the benefits of early fibrinogen substitution in cases of PPH has led to
      an increased use for this indication. The PERFECT PPH aims to provide an evidence-based
      knowledge for the recommendation of the early use of fibrinogen concentrate in PPH.

    <description>fib-tem® is a ready-to-use ROTEM® system reagent for use with citrated whole blood. It assesses the clot firmness of the fibrin clot. This is influenced mainly by the fibrinogen- and F XIII levels of the blood sample and by fibrin polymerisation disorders. The reagent contains a powerful platelet inhibitor; therefore only a fibrin clot is formed and measured. MCF is measured as the maximal amplitude of the curve.</description>

    <description>At the same time of randomization code generation, blood samples for a baseline ROTEM® analysis will be drawn, and blood products will be ordered. Patients will be eligible to receive study drug (fibrinogen concentrate or 0.9% saline solution), according to the randomization code previously generated, only if FIBTEM® - A10 value is &lt;18 mm (corresponding to a MCF value of &lt;20 mm, that is a plasma fibrinogen level &lt;3 g/L).</description>

    <description>The dose of fibrinogen concentrate needed to achieve this target will be calculated using a formula that accounts for the baseline FIBTEM® - A10 value and the patient's body weight assessed at hospital admission . In general, a 70-kg patient requires a fibrinogen dose of approximately 0.5 g to increase the MCF by approximately 1 mm.</description>
