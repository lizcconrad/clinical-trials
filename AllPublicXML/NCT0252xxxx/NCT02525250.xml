  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a framework for developing new therapeutic strategies for acute myeloid
      leukemia(AML)based immunotherapy.

      the role of NK cells was demonstrated in AML and especially GVL effect (graft versus
      leukemia) during allogeneic transplantation in these patients. However, it has been shown
      that the phenotype of NK cells and their cytotoxic functions were altered during this
      malignancy. In addition, in these patients, impaired NK function is associated with relapse.

      lenalidomide it would have a beneficial effect on NK cells of AML patients? Does it have a
      role in leukemic cells in this malignancy? what is its effect on the production of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines? In vitro data show an effect of lenalidomide on the phenotype of
      NK cells from healthy donors and patients with LAM, and despite these phenotypic changes, the
      cytotoxic capacity of NK is not altered.Lenalidomide also induces a significant increase in
      the production of TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor) by NK.

      It also seems to have an effect on leukemic blasts of AML. So, the investigators hope this
      study confirm these results in vivo in peripheral blood cells in patients treated with
      lenalidomide.
