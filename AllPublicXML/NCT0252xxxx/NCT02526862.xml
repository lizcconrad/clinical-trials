      This study aims to test direct application of the Non-Invasive Mechanical Ventilation -NIVM-
      mask or interface as the most efficient intervention to prevent Pressure Ulcers (PU),
      compared with other three usual preventive measures which consist in the use of three
      different medical devices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (NIVM) has turned into a standard in the care of patients
      with acute respiratory failure. Defined as a support modality to the patient`s spontaneous
      ventilation, it does not use invasive techniques to ventilate, working as an external device
      named interface or mask, avoiding so the complications associated to the invasive
      ventilation.

      NIVM had been restricted to ICU and Pneumology services, but in the last years it has been
      extended to ER with good results and it is being also used in the pre-hospital attention and
      in the home care of chronic patient.

      Often, the preferred interface is the oronasal, worst tolerated but associated to best
      treatment of the acute pathology. In most cases to avoid air leaks, its proper placement
      generates high pressure on the skin, being able to harm patient`s tissues, so that this
      therapy as intervention for the acute patient has pressure ulcers -PU- as main iatrogenic
      effect - although 95% of the PU are considered as preventable-.

      To diminish the pressure of the mask on the points of the face, nurses protect the most
      exposed zones with dressings of hydrogel-foam, polyurethane and/or hyperoxygenated fatty
      acids, trying to prevent PU.

      Reviewed studies present a big variability in these practices as well as high dispersion of
      the results achieved.

      Preventive measures are different and even none, as applying the mask or the interface
      directly could be the most effective treatment in the prevention of PU, avoiding not
      justified increase of fungible and other resources consumption.

      The aim of this study is to test direct application of the mask or interface, as the most
      efficient intervention, compared with other three usual preventive measures which consist in
      the use of three different medical devices: autoadhesive polyurethane dressing (Allevyn
      Thin®), semi-permeable hydrogel-foams adhesive dressing (Askina Transorbent Border®) or
      hyperoxygenated fatty acids (Linovera®)
