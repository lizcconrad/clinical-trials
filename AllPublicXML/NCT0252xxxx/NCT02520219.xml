      The aim of this study is to evaluate anti-tumor safety and efficacy of endostar®（Human
      recombinant endostatin injection）combined with traditional GDP
      （gemcitabine+dexamethasone+cis-platinum）chemotherapy for newly diagnosed or relapsed
      PTCL(aggressive peripheral T-cell lymphomas) patients in phase II clinical study.

    <textblock>
      Endostar is a conventional drug for treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer,
      nowadays,Endostar has been used in a variety of extra-pulmonary tumor treatment in
      clinical.Some basic experiments and clinical researchs confirm that Endostar can restitute
      the tumor stability after cyclophosphamide or rituximab treatment.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate anti-tumor safety and efficacy of endostar for newly
      diagnosed or relapsed PTCL patients based on chemotherapy combined with conventional GDP.This
      is a multi-center, open, randomized-controlled, phase II clinical study.

      Following a run-in period, approximately 60 subjects will be randomly assigned to
      conventional chemotherapy treatment group, endostar and conventional chemotherapy treatment
      group for 1 year. After the 1 year treatment period, subjects in two treatments arms will be
      followed for 1 year.
