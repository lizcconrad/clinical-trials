      Background:

      Cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) is common in people with cancer. Bone cancer can also lead to
      anxiety, depression, and reduced mobility and quality of life. Researchers believe a research
      drug called resiniferatoxin (RTX) may be able to help.

      Objective:

      To learn whether RTX is safe and can reduce cancer induced bone pain.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with CIBP that is not relieved by standard treatments

      Design:

      Participants will have up to 6 outpatient visits over about 7 months. These will include:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood and urine tests.

      Thermal testing: a disk placed on the skin to test ability to sense temperature in and around
      the area of pain

      Chest x-ray

      EKG: stickers are placed on the chest to measure heart signals

      ECG: measures electrical activity of the heart

      Participants will have 1 inpatient visit lasting 2-4 days. This will include:

      Catheter inserted into a vein in the arm. They are given anesthesia, sedation, and x-ray
      contrast.

      A needle is passed through the skin of the back to inject the RTX.

      Participants will keep a log of the pain medications they take after surgery.

      Participants will be called 1 week and 2, 3, and 4 months after the injection.

      Participants will be mailed surveys and questionnaires to complete 2, 3, and 4 months after
      the injection.

    <textblock>
      Cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) is a common clinical problem.1 While primary osteosarcoma is
      relatively uncommon, bone metastases frequently cause cancer-related pain with metastatic
      spread to bone in 60-84% of cases. 2 Resiniferatoxin (RTX) is an ultrapotent agonist analog
      of capsaicin that targets a receptor expressed on specific dorsal root sensory ganglia (DRG)
      neurons and is expected to reduce pain within the targeted zone. The overall program goal is
      to develop a new treatment for intractable chronic pain below the mid-thoracic level
      resulting from CIBP that has not been controlled with conservative treatments.

      Primary Objectives

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RTX when injected near one or more DRGs, and
      to characterize its safety/toxicity profile and identify any dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

      Study Population

      Up to 30 adult subjects total across all sites are estimated to be necessary for enrollment
      in order to have up to 16 subjects who will receive RTX and provide study-related assessment
      results through the 30-day time point.

      Design

      The study is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1b dose escalation safety and efficacy trial for
      adult subjects with intractable pain due to CIBP below the mid-thoracic level who meet all
      other eligibility criteria.

      Subjects who have undergone the informed consent (IC) process and signed the approved IC form
      for the study will be assigned a Screen # (S1, S2, etc.). Those subjects who meet all
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will undergo various study procedures and then be scheduled
      for the unilateral periganglionic (PG) DRG injection(s) (a maximum of 3 contiguous levels)
      under fluoroscopic guidance to treat the targeted DRGs demonstrated to be responsible for the
      chronic CIBP.

      Subjects who are screen failures and those who prematurely terminate participation will be
      replaced until 16 subjects have received the injection(s) and completed study-related
      assessments through the day 30 (D30) time point.

      Outcome Measures

      The primary outcome is to achieve a dose-response relationship for safety, although data for
      pain reduction will be obtained as a secondary outcome measure. All subjects will receive
      RTX. There is no placebo group because of the invasive nature of the injection and the dose
      escalation performed in the study.

      This dose escalation safety study is based upon 4 progressive dose levels (0.8
      microg/ganglion; 1.6 microg/ganglion; 3.2 microg/ganglion, and 6.4 microg/ganglion.

      The adaptive dose selection design is employed to establish the primary outcome, the MTD for
      RTX. MTD will be defined as 1 dose level below that at which DLT is observed in more than
      one-third of the subjects.

      The efficacy outcome variable will be evaluated by establishing dose-response curves, with
      dose plotted on the x-axis and changes in efficacy endpoints (between before and D30, D60,
      D90 and D180 after treatment) plotted on the y-axis. If, at the end of the study, all dose
      levels of RTX have equal pain-relieving efficacy, the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)
      may determine it is appropriate to include a dose lower than 0.8 mcg and/or a control group.
      On the other hand, if the dose-response curves show that higher doses could result in greater
      pain-relieving efficacy, the protocol may be amended to include higher doses of RTX.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Male or female subjects must be at least 18 years of age or older.

               2. Must be diagnosed with histologically-confirmed cancer-induced bone pain
                  producing intractable chronic pain in the target area (mid thoracic or chest
                  level down to lower extremities) which was poorly responsive to conservative
                  therapies based on patient report, such as analgesic medication management with
                  potent opioids with or without prior radiotherapy, bisphosphonates, or
                  radioisotope therapy. Additionally, pain that is non-responsive to non-opioid
                  drugs in situations where opioids were not tolerated. Conservative therapies do
                  not include invasive treatments, such as neurolytic procedure, including surgical
                  neurolysis, percutaneous regional or neuraxial continuous infusions (whether
                  opioid or local anesthetic), and peripheral neuromodulation or spinal cord
                  stimulation, but may include temporary diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.

               3. Must have moderate to severe pain that is not relieved by standard treatments.

               4. The chronic pain must result in an average score of at least 5 on the Brief Pain
                  Inventory (BPI) Pain Interference (BPI-PI) Items. The score across the 7 BPI-PI
                  items is averaged: the number (0 to 10) that describes how, during the past week,
                  the subject s pain has interfered with the following: general activity, mood,
                  walking ability, normal work (whether work outside the home or housework),
                  relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life.

               5. The subject must have undergone a diagnostic periganglionic injection(s) with a
                  long-acting local anesthetic (e.g., bupivacaine) under fluoroscopic guidance
                  which resulted in at least a 30% temporary pain reduction in the targeted pain
                  region lasting for the expected duration of the local anesthetic used, prior to
                  study drug treatment. Evidence of pain relief by bipuvicaine validates that a
                  ganglia is involved in transmitting the pain signal from the site of cancer to
                  the central nervous system.

               6. Must be healthy enough to tolerate study procedures in the judgment of the
                  investigator.

               7. Subjects taking aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, or vitamin
                  supplements that include vitamin E or any prophylactic anticoagulant (including
                  but not limited to Coumadin, heparin, or Xarelto) will be counseled either to
                  stop taking these at least 7 days before surgery or be given instructions on
                  dosing changes if applicable. In addition, if patients are currently taking a
                  Factor Xa inhibitor (such as Xarelto) a hematology consult will be obtained.
                  Subjects must be willing to comply with this requirement, which is standard
                  clinical practice when undergoing elective surgical procedures to avoid surgical
                  and post-surgical bleeding complications.

               8. If able to become pregnant or to father a child, agree to use a reliable/accepted
                  method of birth control (i.e. hormonal contraception (birth control pills,
                  injected hormones, vaginal ring), intrauterine device, barrier methods with
                  spermicide (diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide) or surgical
                  sterilization (hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or vasectomy) for the duration of
                  the study. Subjects must be willing and capable of understanding and cooperating
                  with the birth control requirements of the study.

               9. Medical clearance from referring physician.

              10. Must be willing and able to participate in all study procedures.

              11. Must be capable of understanding and cooperating with the requirements of the
                  study.

              12. Subjects must be able to understand and complete study-related forms and
                  adequately communicate in English.

              13. Subjects must have provided written informed consent which includes signing the
                  institutional review board (IRB)-approved consent form prior to participating in
                  any study-related activity.

              14. Must have the capacity to provide informed consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Subjects must not be undergoing or have plans to undergo any active treatment for
             their cancer during the study until after the day 30 assessment timepoint, after the
             RTX injection.

          2. Subjects must not have had prior surgical procedures, such as posterior spinal fusions
             in the area of the injection site that could impair the ability to perform the
             periganglionic injection.

          3. Subjects must not have evidence of a coagulopathy or hemostasis problem as evidenced
             by the following blood laboratory values within the week prior to the planned
             injection:

             PT/INR &gt; 1.5 times upper limit normal range (ULNR)

             PTT &gt; 35 seconds

          4. Platelet count &lt; 100,000 Subjects must not have a total neutrophil count (TNC) &lt; 1500.

          5. Subjects must not be febrile or have other evidence of an infection within 7 days of
             the planned periganglionic injection.

          6. Subjects must not have an allergy or hypersensitivity to chili peppers, capsaicin or
             radiographic contrast agents.

          7. Female subjects must not be pregnant or breastfeeding

          8. Subjects with any medical condition that, in the Investigator s opinion, could
             adversely impact the subject s participation or safety, conduct of the study, or
             interfere with the pain assessment, such as poorly controlled diabetes or
             hypertension. Patients can be re-assessed for eligibility if these conditions can be
             controlled medically.

          9. Subjects who participated in a clinical trial of an investigational drug or device
             within 30 days of screening visit or are scheduled to receive an investigational
             product while participating in this study.

         10. Subjects must not have received invasive treatments, such as a neurolytic procedure,
             including surgical neurolysis, percutaneous regional or neuraxial continuous infusions
             (whether opioid or local anesthetic), peripheral neuromodulation or spinal cord
             stimulation.
