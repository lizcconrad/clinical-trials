    <textblock>
      IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most prevalent primary glomerular disease worldwide and an
      important cause of end stage renal disease. IgAN has an incidence of 8-25 new cases/year/per
      million age-related population in adults and 3-5/new cases/year/per million age-related
      population in children and progresses to need of renal replacement treatment in 5-15% at 10
      years and in about 20% at 20 years. The variability of the clinical course anticipates
      different treatment options. There is an absolute need of validated biomarkers to predict
      risk of progression and indication for treatment at early stages, when lesions can be
      reversible. This study aimed to evaluate IgAN progression and its histological and clinical
      correlates.

      IgA nephropathy is the most prevalent primary glomerular disease worldwide and an important
      cause of end stage renal disease. Clinical course varies from long term stable renal
      functions with minimal proteinuria and microscopic hematuria to rapidly progressive
      glomerulonephritis with crescents on renal biopsy which progresses to end stage renal disease
      in a very short time.

      In current practice the diagnosis is made with renal biopsy. A less invasive procedure for
      diagnosis is not present and no serum biomarkers for clinical follow-up, treatment response
      and prognosis are available. For that reason follow-up of the disease is enabled with
      indirect markers of renal function like proteinuria, serum creatinine and glomerular
      filtration rate. These markers are not specific for IgA nephropathy. The lack of disease
      specific markers hinders the standardization of patient follow-up and treatment. Development
      of specific and sensitive, repeatable, histopathological and clinical markers for diagnosis,
      follow up and treatment response in IgA nephropathy the most prevalent primary glomerular
      disease affecting many patients worldwide will offer prospects of diagnosis and improved
      prognostication.

          -  Patients at all ages will be included regardless of treatment given

          -  A renal biopsy available for reviewing must include 8 or more glomeruli.

          -  At least 3 measurements of blood pressure, serum creatinine and proteinuria have to be

             last at the end of the follow-up.

          -  Patients must comply with the following criteria

               1. have a follow-up longer than 1 year

               2. or having progressed to end-stage renal disease regardless of the duration of
                  follow-up.

          -  Patients who have received antihypertensive or immunosuppressive medication will be
             included as well.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Solid organ (other than kidney) or bone marrow transplant at the time of biopsy.

          -  Other pre-existing parenchymal kidney disease on first kidney biopsy, determined by
             the pathology examination.

          -  Diagnosis of any of the following diseases from the time of biopsy to the time of
             enrollment: Systemic lupus erythematosus, HIV infection, active malignancy, except for
             non-melanoma skin cancer, active hepatitis B or C infection, defined as positive viral
