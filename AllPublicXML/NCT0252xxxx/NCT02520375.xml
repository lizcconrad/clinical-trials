      The aim of this study is to determine the impact of a prebiotic toothpaste and mouthrinse in
      periodontitis patients as an adjunct to scaling and rootplaning. Study design: this study
      will be a single centre (Department of Oral Health Sciences, University Hospitals Leuven),
      double blind, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial. The randomization (by means of a
      computer program) and double blind design are thought to minimize the bias of the
      investigator and patients. Study population: adults, who consult at the department of
      Periodontology at the University Hospital Leuven and who fit the inclusion criteria will be
      asked to participate in this study.
