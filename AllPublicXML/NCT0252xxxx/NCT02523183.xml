  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many families of children with medically refractory epilepsy are choosing to use medicinal
      cannabinoids (MCBD) as an adjunctive alternative treatment option. The safety, tolerability
      and efficacy of these products are not known. The primary objective of this study is to
      determine how the use of MCBD affects children with medically refractory epilepsy in an
      observational study. Measures of evaluation to be used will include: laboratory values,
      developmental measures, seizure diaries and serial electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study of a family's choice to use MCBD and the effect of this
      substance on medically refractory epilepsy in children. The risks associated with this use
      are not well known. There have recently been reports of stroke, liver dysfunction and altered
      anticonvulsant levels. In addition, there have been long term risks reported of decreased
      memory function, cognitive problems and executive function abnormalities. This study does not
      condone or advocate the use of the substance but merely seeks to document the short term
      effects of the use in this population. It should be noted that providers at Children's
      Hospital Colorado are not registered providers for medicinal cannabis; therefore, this will
      be an observational study of effects of this substance as prescribed by other physicians
      outside of our institution.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline in background and architecture of seizures confirmed by non-investigational EEG</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Prolonged EEG recordings lasting 24-48 hours (whichever is clinically indicated) will be performed in either the home setting as an ambulatory EEG or in the hospital in the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit. This decision will be made on a clinical basis. This will allow for objective quantification of seizures in children with frequent seizures that occur on a daily basis and background EEG changes for other children. Two EEGs will be done: one at baseline, and one at the end of the study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Seizure Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Biweekly for four months</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject will maintain a seizure diary. Rescue drug use and VNS (Vagus Nerve Stimulation) activations will be tracked as an adjunct to all current anti-seizure medications. Frequency of status epilepticus will be tracked as well as hospital visits for seizures or adverse events from MCBD. Clinical evaluations will be taken every 2 months throughout the duration of the study. Subjects will be monitored every 2 weeks by telephone and/or email.</description>

    <description>Side effects will be evaluated using PESQ (Pediatric epilepsy Side Effects Questionnaire). This questionnaire will be administered 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks after baseline.</description>

        Pediatric epilepsy patients who are followed at Children's Hospital Colorado with medically
        refractory epilepsy, and whom the family has decided to treat with medicinal cannabis.
        Children who have not been treated with medically accepted standard treatment for their
        epilepsy condition will not be accepted into this study as the researchers do not want to
        be misperceived as condoning the use of medical marijuana in lieu of standard treatment.
