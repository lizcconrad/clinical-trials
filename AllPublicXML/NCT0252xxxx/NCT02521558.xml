  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will examine the use of a mobile electronic application used to deliver
      cognitive rehabilitation to patients with mild cognitive impairment due (MCI) due to
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), and patients with mild AD. Patients will be given a specific
      cognitive rehabilitation program on their mobile device (iPad) with specific tasks for them
      to complete. The goal of this study is to determine if a) patients are able to use and adhere
      to a cognitive rehabilitation program delivered to their mobile device and b) to determine if
      patients can improve their language, attention, and memory by completing cognitive
      rehabilitation tasks assigned to them.

      In the current study, the investigators are examining the use of a mobile electronic
      application used to deliver cognitive rehabilitation tasks to patients with mild cognitive
      impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, and patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. An
      estimated 100 patients will be enrolled into the study (~50 patients with mild cognitive
      impairment, ~50 patients with Alzheimer's disease).

      Participants will either receive memory tasks designed to help stabilize or improve memory
      (Intervention Group) or a set of word or math puzzles (Control Group). Participants will
      complete memory tasks or puzzles for a six month period. The investigators will conduct pre-
      and post- neuropsychological testing to assess changes in cognitive status (e.g., memory,
      language, executive functioning) in the intervention group. Neuropsychological tests
      assessing changes to cognition will be completed prior to participant assignment to the
      Intervention or Control Group. Both groups will then be assessed again using
      neuropsychological tests. The investigators will also assess changes in performance on
      cognitive rehabilitation tests over the six month period to determine the efficacy of these
      tasks.

    <measure>Changes in performance on cognitive rehabilitation tasks (composite measure of memory tasks)</measure>
    <time_frame>During intervention (6 month time frame, composite measure)</time_frame>
    <description>In the intervention group, the investigators will examine speed and accuracy data on all cognitive rehabilitation memory tasks. Tasks will be converted into a single memory composite measure (for both speed and accuracy data).
The investigators will cull performance on the tasks on a weekly basis. Weekly data will be treated as a single data points. Participants will be followed for approximately 24 weeks (or 6 months).
The investigators will use a regression analysis to analyze to determine changes in the slope on speed and accuracy for each of these data points. Additionally, the investigators will use inferential statistics, such as ANOVA, to determine if participants improve on a week by week basis. These analyses will be conducted on the composite of memory data collected from all the memory tasks.</description>

    <description>In the Intervention Group, patients will receive an iPad with the Constant Therapy cognitive rehabilitation application. Patients in the Intervention Group will practice the memory tasks developed for the Constant Therapy application for a total of six months. On a weekly basis, a clinician and/or research assistant will check in with the patient to answer any questions or address any concerns the patient has with using the Constant Therapy application, or how to perform any of the memory tasks. At the end of six months, each individual in the Intervention Group is assessed with standard cognitive testing to determine if there was any change on overall cognition.</description>

    <description>The investigators are interested in how practicing memory tasks can improve memory in patients with MCI and with AD. Specifically, patients will perform a set of cognitive rehabilitation tasks designed to train memory in order to determine if these tasks are effective in improving memory or slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Patients will practice memory tasks for about an hour daily, for a total duration of 6 months. A research assistant or clinician will conduct weekly check-ins with each participant assess whether or not participants in the Intervention Group exhibit weekly improvements and to determine if patients are regularly adhering to the tasks.</description>

    <description>The Control Group will not receive any cognitive rehabilitation tasks for a six month period. Instead, they will simply be given booklets of puzzles (e.g., word search, number puzzles, etc.) to work on for the duration of 6 months.
A research assistant or clinician will conduct weekly check-ins with each participant assess whether or not participants in the control group feel like they are benefiting from the puzzles.
Participants in the Control Group will be given a standard battery of neuropsychological tests prior to the the puzzles and after the puzzles to assess any changes in memory, language, attention, and executive functioning.</description>
