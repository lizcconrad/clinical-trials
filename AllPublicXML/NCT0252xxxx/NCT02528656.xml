  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The physiological assessment in non-operative treatment on chest wall deformities, are still
      unclear today. These functional benefits outweigh the aesthetic benefits associated with
      anatomical improvement. The functional benefits, ventilation, hemodynamic and neurologic,
      have never been evaluated.

      Assessment of Effects on parasympathetic activity of the autonomic nervous system, global
      health criterion measured by noninvasive methods.

      Anatomic evaluation, between the initial and final assessment by objective measures 1) of the
      chest wall by MRI, and 2) of the heart by echocardiography.

      Noninvasive physiological assessment at rest and during exercise in respiratory function
      exploration flows and volumes, cardiac function by flow measurement, and overall metabolic
      function test effort (VO2max). Subjective assessment of functional gain between the initial
      and final balance sheet, based on EVA scales, valued by patients, parents and doctors.
