  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to define the safety and tolerability of this drug combination.
      The study will also define the response rate of patients with advanced and unresectable
      NSCLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has a dose escalation (Ib) and dose expansion phase (II). The ALT-803 treatment in
      the Phase Ib portion of the study will escalate until a recommended dose level is decided.
      This dose level will be used in the phase II portion of the study. The Phase II potion of the
      study will include two groups: Nivolumab naive and Nivolumab progressing. Patients will be
      enrolled to one of the arms based on their previous treatment with Nivolumab.

    <description>The phase II portion of the study looks to define the response rate (using immune-related RECIST) of ALT-803 added to nivolumab in patients with advanced and unresectable non-small cell lung cancer.
Response rate will be defined by the test overall response, which is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease, the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The subject's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.</description>
