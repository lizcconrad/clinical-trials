      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of mirabegron oral
      suspension after single dose administration in children with neurogenic detrusor overactivity
      (NDO) or overactive bladder (OAB).

      This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability as well as the acceptability and
      palatability of mirabegron oral suspension after single dose administration in children with
      NDO or OAB.
