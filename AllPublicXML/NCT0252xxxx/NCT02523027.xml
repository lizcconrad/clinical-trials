      Study Objective:

      To investigate the effect of two oral nutritional supplements (ONS) along with dietary
      counseling vs dietary counseling alone on growth among picky eating children from India, aged
      &gt; 24 months to ≤ 48 months over a period of 90 days.

      Number of Subjects / Length of Participation:

      Approximately 321 subjects (107 subjects per group) will be enrolled from estimated 8-10
      study centers to obtain at least 255 evaluable subjects (85 subjects per group), assuming 20%
      attrition rate. Expected total duration for the study is approximately 12 months.

      Study Design :

        -  Prospective, randomized, double blinded study, with two parallel treatment groups and an
           open-labeled control group multicenter clinical study Eligible subjects will be
           randomized into three groups

        -  Experimental Group 1: Oral nutritional supplement and dietary counseling. (List No
           S691/Z0)

        -  Experimental Group 2: Oral nutritional supplement and dietary counseling. (List No-
           P968/Z0)
