      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation study. MSI-1436 will be administered as a
      single intravenous infusion twice a week for 3 weeks on a 4-week cycle. Subjects will be
      enrolled according to a standard Phase I Fibonacci design to receive MSI-1436. Drug infusions
      will last approximately 2 hours. If a subject has a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at any time
      during the study, MSI-1436 will be held and either re-started or discontinued in that subject
      as per the Dose Adjustments and Toxicities Guidelines.

    <description>Subjects will be enrolled according to a standard Phase I Fibonacci design to receive MSI-1436C. If a subject has a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at any time during the study, MSI-1436C will be held and either re-started or discontinued in that subject as per the Dose Adjustments and Toxicities Guidelines.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC)</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>

    <measure>Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>All adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities will be recorded and tabulated. A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as any grade 3 or higher NCI Common Toxicity Criteria adverse event (CTCAE) that is deemed related to the study drug MSI-1436C, any infusion reaction necessitating drug discontinuation, or any other drug related adverse event leading to the study drug discontinuation.
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities. The proportion of AEs and DLTs will be calculated along with their corresponding exact 95% confidence intervals.</description>

    <measure>response rates</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the response rates of MSI-1436C in metastatic breast cancer patients the outcome variable of interest is time-to-progression. Patients who have not progressed (or who have not died) as of their last known follow-up, will be considered 'censored' for the time-to-progression analysis.
Time-to-progression will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier Product-Limit Method. Any post- hoc group comparisons will be carried out using the log-rank test. Patients who have not progressed (or who have not died) as of their last known follow-up, will be considered 'censored' for the time-to-progression analysis.</description>
