  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Herbs and spices offer one potential solution to the recent decline in children taking school
      lunch because they can increase the palatability of foods without adding salt and fat.
      However, there is currently limited evidence on how to successfully integrate herbs and
      spices into the school lunch menu. Developing evidence-based methods to teach school
      cafeteria workers to prepare healthy and tasty vegetable dishes with the addition of herbs
      and spices is a research priority. The investigators hypothesize that herbs and spices can be
      used to increase acceptance, intake, and participation in the school lunch program among 6th
      - 12th grade students from Central Pennsylvania.

      What this study will add to the literature: Herbs and spices offer one potential solution to
      the recent decline in children taking school lunch because they can increase the palatability
      of foods without adding salt and fat. However, there is currently limited evidence on how to
      successfully integrate herbs and spices into the school lunch menu. Developing evidence-based
      methods to teach school cafeteria workers to prepare healthy and tasty vegetable dishes with
      the addition of herbs and spices is a research priority. This research will provide evidence
      that herbs and spices can be used to increase acceptance, intake, and participation in the
      school lunch program among 6th - 12th grade students from Central Pennsylvania.
