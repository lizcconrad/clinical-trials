  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational prospective study. Patients diagnosed with advanced epithelial
      ovarian cancer (stage IC or higher) since 2008 will be asked to participate in this study by
      signing an informed consent. Tumour samples will be reviewed to confirm the diagnosis and to
      select the best regions for tissue sampling to perform the following molecular studies:
      array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization and Next Generation Sequencing. Detected
      mutations will be analysed by Sanger sequencing. FISH probes will be designed and tested on
      the samples.

    <description>Clinical data from the enrolled patients will be recorded and related to the results obtained from sequencing the DNA isolated from tumor samples. Whole exome sequencing (WES) will be used for sequencing DNA isolated from paraffin embedded samples and Whole genome association study (GWAS) for the DNA from frozen samples. The bioinformatics analysis of the sequencing results will allow us to identify altered regions and affected genes and the minimal common regions of imbalance. All detected mutations will be confirmed by Sanger sequencing to ensure the reliability of the findings.</description>
