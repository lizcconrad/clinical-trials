      Investigators propose to conduct a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter assessing
      the interests of an antibiotic protocol guided by serum procalcitonin (PCT) on morbidity and
      mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) hospitalized in
      intensive care unit (ICU) for acute exacerbation with or without associated pneumonia. The
      main objective is to show in patients hospitalized in intensive care for acute exacerbation
      of COPD with or without pneumonia, safety, defined as a lack of difference in mortality at 3
      months, an antibiotic strategy guided by the PCT in the ICU.
