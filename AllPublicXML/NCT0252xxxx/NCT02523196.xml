  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about a new test to look at liver function, the HepQuant-Shunt
      (HQ-Shunt). The HQ-Shunt is being evaluated for safety and effectiveness as an alternative to
      Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient testing in patients with liver disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to demonstrate the HQ-SHUNT is safe, simple to administer,
      noninvasive, cost-effective, and well tolerated by patients. This study will compare the
      HQ-SHUNT to Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient (HVPG) testing. In this study, 100 consecutive
      patients with various etiologies of liver disease who have undergone technically successful
      HVPG testing as standard of care will also undergo HQ-SHUNT testing.
