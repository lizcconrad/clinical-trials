      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of clinical injection of allogeneic human
      dental pulp stem cell(DPSC) in local infected periodontal tissue and determine whether
      injection of allogeneic DPSC is a effective way in the treatment of chronic periodontal
      disease.

      This study will involve 40 patients who were diagnosed as chronic periodontitis will receive
      periodontal scaling and root planing. Patients will randomly be divided at the base line into
      two groups.In test group, 20 chronic periodontitis patients will be treated using local DPSC
      injection. Whereas, a control group will contain 20 patients who will be treated using
      placebo. Clinical examination including Quigley-Hein plaque index (QHI), bleeding on probing
      (BoP), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and gingival recession (GR) will
      be perform in different time points during the study. Radiographic and clinical examination
      will be carried out during the late healing phase up to 12 months post operation.
