      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of donor regulatory T cells in
      treating patients with graft-versus-host disease affecting the liver or gastrointestinal
      organs (visceral) within 100 days (acute) after undergoing a stem cell transplant.
      Graft-versus-host disease occurs when donor immune cells infused in a stem cell transplant
      attack the gut, skin, liver, or other organ systems of the patient. Regulatory T cells are a
      type of immune cell that may be able to reduce the attack of the donor's immune cells on the
      patient's normal cells and help treat graft-vs-host disease.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and feasibility of donor T regulatory (Treg) cell infusions in
      subjects with visceral acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and incidence of dose limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE version 4 [v.4]) with a focus on infusion reactions within 24 hours, respiratory
      distress within 72 hours of infusion and all-cause mortality within 28 days of infusion.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the quantitative blood Treg cell changes following the cell infusions.

      II. Assess dosing requirements and treatment response rates to primary steroid, secondary and
      tertiary immunosuppressive therapy.

      III. Post-transplant day +100 and day +180 survival. IV. Post-transplant incidence of chronic
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at day +180.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive donor regulatory T lymphocytes intravenously (IV) over 5 minutes or less on
      day 0. Some patients receive a second infusion of frozen donor regulatory T lymphocytes 5-7
      days after the initial infusion or 2 additional infusions separated by 5-7 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly until day 28 and then on
      days 100 and 180.
