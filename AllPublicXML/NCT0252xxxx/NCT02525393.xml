  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomized in 3 groups: two intervent groups and a control group. The first
      group received two weeks of daily session of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
      (rTMS, 10 sessions) and, at least 6 months after, two weeks of daily transcranial Direct
      Current Stimulation (tDCS, 10 sessions); the second group received 10 daily session of tDCS
      and, after at least 6 months, 10 sessions of rTMS; the control group received 10 daily
      session of sham tDCS.

      Physiatric evaluations (ARAT scale), neuropsychological assessment and ERP (P300) were
      performed before (1 week) and after (1 week) the end of each treatment. Furthermore, all
      patients underwent follow-up neuropsychological assessment 6 months after the end of each
      stimulation period and follow-up physiatric evaluation at 3 and 6 months after the end of
      each stimulation period.

    <description>Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) measures Grasp, Grip, Pinch, Gross Movement. Baseline is 1 week before first treatment; other time frame: 1 week after first treatment; 3 months after first treatment; 6 months follow-up after first treatment; 1 week before second treatment; 1 week after second treatment; 3 months follow-up after second treatment; 6 months follow-up after second treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; 1 month; 6 months and 1 week; 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The P300 (P3) wave is an event related potential (ERP) component elicited in the process of decision making.
Investigators measured the latency of the component 1 week before first treatment; 1 week after first treatment; 1 week before second treatment; 1 week after second treatment.</description>

    <measure>Cognition (standardized neuropsychological assessment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 1 month; 6 months; 6 months and 1 week; 7 months; 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patients were evaluated by means of a standardized neuropsychological assessment consisting of a battery of cognitive tests involving the following domains: verbal short-term memory, visuospatial learning, working memory, verbal learning, attention and frontal executive functions, and general cognitive impairment.
The assessment was repeated 1 week before first treatment; 1 week after first treatment; 6 months follow-up after first treatment; 1 week before second treatment; 1 week after second treatment; 6 months follow-up after second treatment.</description>
