  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to prove the utility and safety of the negative pressure wound therapy
      (NPWT) in the postoperative management of free flaps.

      The quantitative assessment of the entirety of clinical main relevant parameters like edema
      formation, microcirculation, macrocirculation and wound healing should create a better and
      comprehensive understanding of the NPWT effects in this field.

      This study evaluates the impact of negative pressure wound therapy on free muscle flaps.
      Flaps were treated with NPWT or with a conventional dressing (control) for five days
      following tissue transfer. Edema formation is measured by a 3D scan (Artec SpiderTM) during
      the operation, five and fourteen days after surgery. The macrocirculation- and
      microcirculation parameters of the flaps are assessed using an implanted Doppler probe
      (Cook-Swartz®) as well as combined flowmetry and remission spectroscopy (O2C®). These
      measurements are conducted daily at the day of the operation as well as the first five days
      following the operation. Following dressing removal at the fifth postoperative day, skin
      graft take is assessed.
