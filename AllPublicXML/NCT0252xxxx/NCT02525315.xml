  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Auditory hallucinations are common (present in 60-70% of cases) and extremely debilitating.
      Behavioral disorders associated with them can have serious social repercussions. However, in
      25% of cases the usual antipsychotic drug treatments are incompletely or totally ineffective.

      Fifteen subjects will be included after collection and signed their informed consent.

      The rTMS treatment is made of 4 sessions of 13 minutes spread over two days, at a frequency
      of 20 Hz and an intensity of 80% of motor threshold at rest. These constants are used to stay
      below the risk of occurrence of seizures, the only serious side effects identified.
      Furthermore the rTMS treatment is almost painless: tension headaches are the main side
      effects and make amends with simple analgesics. rTMS is devoid of neurocognitive effects. The
      LEFT stimulation site will be established through a anatomofunctional imaging before
      treatment (between D-7 and D0).

      Treatment efficacy will be evaluated daily during treatment (days 1 and 2) and during the
      first 2 weeks of starting treatment.
