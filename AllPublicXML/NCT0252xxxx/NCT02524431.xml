  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to try to identify the cause of damage to the drainage system of
      the eye (the trabecular meshwork). Damage to this system may cause elevation in the pressure
      within the eye and thereby damage to the optic nerve and the vision.

      During a routine trabeculectomy surgery, a corneo-scleral block that includes TM tissue will
      be collected at the operating room. This tissue is routinely removed during every
      trabeculectomy surgery. The tissue will be stored immediately in normal saline at 4 degrees
      Celsius, and walked directly to the Jefferson Center for Translational Medicine at Thomas
      Jefferson University by the Wills eye glaucoma research fellow. TM tissue will be identified
      using light microscope base on TM cell pigmentation. The ocular tissue will be fixed and
      placed in pre-cooled fixative on ice for 1 hour. The lengths of mitochondrial cross sections
      at the longest extent will be measured under electron microscopy (EM) in order to identify
      the mitochondrial dynamics. Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) will be done to
      identify proteins responsible for mitochondrial fusion.
