  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an evidence-based post-traumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD) intervention adapted to focus on parenting-related impairment for
      mothers receiving preventive services. The study intervention is adapted from Skills Training
      in Affective and Interpersonal Regulation (STAIR). The investigators expect that the adaption
      (Parenting STAIR) has the potential to prevent child maltreatment as well as improve maternal
      and child well-being by reducing the effects of maternal PTSD and depression on parenting.

      The investigators plan to recruit mothers with high levels of trauma-related symptoms from
      preventive service agencies, and invite them to participate in the study. This study is a
      single group design, and data will be collected pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 12-week
      follow-up.

    <description>Parenting-STAIR is an adaptation of a 16 session study therapy entitled Skills Training in Affective and Interpersonal Regulation/Modified Prolonged Exposure (STAIR/MPE). It generally is comprised of approximately 23 sessions and includes seven didactic interaction parenting sessions. There are threskill building in areas such as e modules within Parenting STAIR: 1) Module 1 focuses on skill building (awareness of emotional states, management of negative feelings, regulation of emotional intensity, etc.); 2) Module 2 involves the processing of memories of trauma and creating a coherent and meaningful life narrative; 3) Module 3 includes both the mother and child, and focuses on increasing maternal attunement and improving parenting skills.</description>
