  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is the most common endocrine disorder, causes many complications such as
      micro- and macro-vascular diseases. Various kinds of antidiabetic drugs have been developed,
      but most of them have side effects. Recently, the use of natural plant products has gained
      more attention among scientists in order to prevent diabetic vascular complications. Curcumin
      is a natural yellow product derived from the turmeric rhizome which has shown to be non-toxic
      and exhibits various bioÂ¬logical activities such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory,
      anti-carcinogenic, and anti-diabetic effects. Curcumin is effective in reducing glycemic
      index and hyperlipidemia in rodent models and is relatively inexpensive and safe. Most of the
      studies conducted on animal model, and just a few of them are on human model. The present
      study was planned to evaluate the effects of curcumin supplementation on serum levels of
      lipid profile and inflammatory markers in patients with type 2 diabetes
