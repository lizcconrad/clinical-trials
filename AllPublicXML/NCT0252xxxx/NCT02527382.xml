      The purpose of this study is to check if there is a difference in peritoneal contamination in
      patients undergoing rectal resection with closed and open rectal stump prior to anastomosing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is not much information regarding the peritoneal bacterial contamination during
      colorectal surgery. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in peritoneal
      contamination following resection with closed or open rectal stump for left-sided cancer.
      Patients scheduled for elective resection are allocated for open resection with the distal
      stump closed or open. Anastomosis is performed while a clamp is placed on the rectal stump in
      one arm of the study while in the other arm, the stump remains open until the anastomosis is
      completed. A second bacterial sample will be obtained at the completion of the anastomosis
      from the same place (pelvic pouch) as the first one. After sampling an air leak test will be
      performed. A quantitative assessment of the number of Colony Forming Units (CFU/ml) of
      aerobic and anaerobic bacteria will be done for each patient. Operative time and time
      interval between samples will be measured. Postoperatively, possible complications (surgical
      site infections, leakage) will be monitored. The primary objective will be to determine the
      differences in peritoneal contamination between closed and open rectal stump during
      colorectal surgery.

    <measure>The number of Colony-Forming Units (CFU)/ml from the peritoneal samples</measure>
    <time_frame>within the first 30 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The formula we will use is: number of CFU (colony forming units)/ml = n x 10 x d, where n = number of colonies on the media and d = dilution reverse. The final number of CFU/ml will be given as the arithmetic mean of the three dilutions done for each sample. When no bacterial growth is found the results are given as 0 CFU/ml. The maximum limit is considered 100,000 CFU/ml.</description>
