  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Red raspberries are a rich source of (poly)phenolic compounds, the main components being
      anthocyanins and ellagitannins. There is growing evidence linking consumption of these
      compounds with beneficial effects on human health. However, the mechanisms involved remain
      poorly understood principally because of a limited understanding of the bioavailability of
      ellagitannins and anthocyanins. This study aims to explore the identity and amounts of the
      phenolic metabolites of anthocyanins and ellagitannins in human plasma and urine following
      acute ingestion of raspberries. For this purpose ten healthy volunteers were feed 300 g of
      blended raspberries containing in total 293 μmol anthocyanins and 250 μmol ellagitannins. All
      urine excreted over 48 h after the ingestion of raspberries was collected and blood samples
      were collected before (0 h) and after raspberry consumption up to 24 h. Metabolites were
      identified and quantified by ultra high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
      (UHPLC-MS).

    <measure>Changes in urinary anthocyanin and ellagitannin metabolite excretion after ingestion of 300g blended raspberries measured by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline excretion (12 h before intervention), and 0-4 h, 4-8 h, 8-24 h, 24-32 h, 32-48 h post ingestion</time_frame>
    <description>All urine excreted for 12 h prior to supplementation was collected as well as that excreted over 48 h after ingestion of raspberries. Urine samples were vortexed, centrifuged at 16110 g for 10 min at 5°C, and passed through 0.45 μm filter discs prior to the analysis of 5 μL aliquots by UHPLC-MS.</description>

    <measure>Changes in plasma concentration of anthocyanin and ellagitannin metabolites after ingestion of 300g blended raspberries measured by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry</measure>
    <time_frame>0 h, 0.5 h, 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 8 h, 24 h post ingestion</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected in heparin tubes before and after raspberry consumption up to 24 h. Plasma samples were vortexed and 400 µL aliquots were mixed with 1 mL of 2% formic acid in acetonitrile. The samples were then vortexed and ultrasonicated for 10 min. After centrifugation at 16110 g for 10 min, supernatants were reduced to dryness in vacuo using a Speedvac concentrator and resuspended in 100 µL of methanol:water:formic acid (50:50:0.1, v/v/v) which was centrifuged at 16100 g for 10 min and 5 μL aliquots of the supernatant analysed by UHPLC-MS.</description>
