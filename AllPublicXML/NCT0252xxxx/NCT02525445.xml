      The purpose of this study is to investigate if it is possible to influence the participants'
      expectations to improve outcome, in this particular setting the relaxing effects of one
      single acupuncture treatment with genuine or sham needles combined with positive or neutral
      communication regarding expected relaxing effects.

      Background It is commonly reported that individuals experience a sense of relaxation during
      acupuncture treatment. However it is not known if the effects are related to the specific
      effects of needling or non-specific effects associated with the treatment procedure e.g. the
      communication with the therapist. It is well known that the way in which patients and
      clinicians communicate with each other affect treatment outcome, and one of the possible
      mechanisms to mediate the communication-related treatment outcomes is patient expectations.

      Aims The aim of the study is therefore to investigate if it is possible to influence the
      individuals' expectations to improve outcome; in this particular setting the relaxing effects
      of one single acupuncture treatment with genuine or sham needles combined with positive or
      neutral communication regarding expected relaxing effects. The investigators also aim to
      investigate if different therapists influence how individuals perceive treatment effects,
      blinding and the communication during treatment with genuine and sham acupuncture.

      Procedure Nine therapists performed treatments on voluntary healthy individuals who were
      randomized to a 30 minute treatment session with a) genuine penetrating acupuncture in
      traditional acupuncture points or b) non-penetrating sham needles in sham points. Within
      groups, individuals were further randomized to two communication styles 1) neutral
      communication or 2) strengthened positive communication regarding expectations concerning
      relaxing effects.

      Outcome measures Perceived degree of expectancy and relaxation was measured directly before
      and after the treatment. The individuals also rated how they experienced the therapist´s
      communication style regarding grade of positivity and if they believed that the therapist had
      given them genuine or sham acupuncture directly after treatment.

    <intervention_name>acupuncture</intervention_name>
    <description>acupuncture was administered (sharp needles diameter 0.25 x length 40 mm) bilaterally to the acupuncture point pericardium six (PC6) between the tendons of palmaris longus and flexor carpii radialis at two body-inches (one body-inch approximately 1.5 cm) proximal to the wrist at 0.5 body-inch depth. The therapists manually manipulated the needles three times per treatment by rotating, thrusting or lifting the needles. When the participant reported a sense of numbness or soreness and the therapist noted a minimal muscular contraction around the needle.</description>

    <description>sham acupuncture was administrated (blunt needles diameter 0.25 x length 40 mm) bilaterally to a non-acupuncture point four body-inch proximal and one body-inch radial from the PC6 point, with the telescopic non-penetrating Park´s sham needle [20]. Park's credible needle looks identical to a real needle but glides upward into its handle, giving an illusion of penetration. A marking tube, identical for both acupuncture types, held the sham needle in place. The therapists manipulated the needles a few seconds three times per session until the needles touched the skin, but no &quot;needle sensation&quot; occurred, and then lifted the needles up from the skin.</description>
