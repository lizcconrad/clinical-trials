  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gastrointestinal dysfunction occurs frequently during the intensive care unit (ICU) stay
      and is associated with a worse prognosis.

      The gastrointestinal failure (GIF) is diagnosed based on symptoms such as bowel distension,
      ileus, diarrhea, digestive bleeding, or intestinal ischemia. A GIF score based on has been
      demonstrated to be correlated with outcome, with higher scores indicating higher risk of
      death. However, GIF may be occult or clinical signs can go undetected in critically ill
      patients due to the frequent use of analgesic, sedative or neuromuscular blocking agents,
      acute neurologic diseases, or delirium.

      Citrulline is a potential biomarker for small bowel function in critically ill patients with
      maintained renal function. Normal plasma citrulline levels (12-55 µmol/L) are determined by
      the balance between gut synthesis and kidney degradation.

      GIF is involved in the pathogenesis of multiple organ dysfunctions and failures (MOF) through
      various mechanisms, and it is often associated with high intra-abdominal pressure (IAP). IAP
      greater than 12 mmHg, may lead to abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) and MOF, including
      cardiac, respiratory and kidney failure. Studies have suggested that GIF can be the
      consequence rather than the cause of MOF.

      The aim of this study is to investigate if plasma citrulline levels is associated with a
      clinical diagnosis of GIF, and may predict the development of MOF.

    <description>to investigate if plasma citrulline levels are associated with a clinical diagnosis of Gastro Intestinal Failure, and may predict the development of Multiple Organ Failure. Gastrointestinal Failure is defined as the presence of three or more coincident GI symptoms (igh gastric residual volumes (GRV) = maximum GRV above 500 ml at least once. Absent bowel sounds (BS) = BS not heard on careful auscultation. Vomiting/Regurgitation= visible vomiting or regurgitation in any amount. Diarrhoea = loose of liquid stool three or more times per day. Bowel distension= suspected or radiologically confirmed bowel dilatation in any bowel segment. GI bleeding= visible appearance of blood in vomit, nasogastric aspirate or stool.). MOF was defined as the failure of two or more organs or system according to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)</description>

    <description>to investigate if increasing of intra abdominal pressure is associated with a clinical diagnosis of Gastro Intestinal Failure, and may predict the development of Multiple Organ Failure. Intra-abdominal Hypertension (IAH) is defined as an average IAP of the day ≥ 12 mmHg; abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is defined as a sustained (minimally two standardized measurements, performed 1-6 h apart) increase in IAP above 20 mmHg with new onset organ failure.</description>
