      This study evaluates a new formulation of LY900014, a drug that lowers blood sugar. It is
      administered by injection under the skin of the abdomen. The study will be conducted in
      healthy people to investigate how quickly and how much LY900014 is absorbed and the effect of
      different doses of LY900014 on blood sugar levels. Side effects and tolerability will be
      documented. The study will last for about 8 to 9 weeks for each participant, including
      screening and follow up. Screening is required within 28 days prior to entering the study.
