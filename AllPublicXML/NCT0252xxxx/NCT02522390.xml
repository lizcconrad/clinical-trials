    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the planned Nutrition Research Cohort (NRC) n250 study is to develop
      and evaluate the open access Nutrition Researcher Cohort for gathering personal health data
      from nutrition researchers, including analytical methods, standards and operation procedures,
      data infrastructure, ethical and privacy aspects, and governance.

      Besides, the study aims to exploit and analyse data on food, nutrient and bioactive compound
      intake and exposure, biomarkers for food, health and/or disease and health and/or disease
      related measurements to study the relation between nutrition, health and development of
      disease (on individual level).

      In addition, data will be used to develop applications that visualise personal health risks
      based for example on (validated) recommendations and applications that predict individual
      health risks.

      The study is designed as an open, one-group, exploratory cohort study. The total NRC cohort
      will be composed of about 250 life sciences employees and students from different,
      predominantly European, countries. This allows optimal involvement of participants in shaping
      all aspects of the cohort and the ownership of data. We aim to recruit about in total 20 male
      and female scientists per participating country.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NRC n250 study is an open, one-group, open-ended cohort study, which will include
      participants from 10 different countries. The study will be coordinated by national contact
      points from each of the participating countries.

      The NRC cohort study will start early 2015 and continue developing from that moment on.
      Recruitment will start immediately after approval of the study protocol in the country where
      it has been submitted. The Participant Information Form, which contains the complete research
      protocol as developed by the consortium partners, is available online via the NRC website.
      This way, potential participants can make an informed decision on whether or not they want to
      participate.

      The NRC n250 study will provide a dataset from 250 individuals, including food intake,
      microbiome composition, oral glucose tolerance tests, a series of plasma (bio)chemistry
      outcomes, plasma and urine metabolome and DNA damage, together with anthropometrics and life
      style questionnaires.

      Since the aim is to build up a powerful open access cohort, there is no end-date defined for
      this study. The collected data will be used for various analyses on food intake, biomarkers
      for food intake and/or health and/or disease, and health/disease related measurements.

      The research questions that will be answered with this cohort are largely not known yet,
      since it is not known which data will become available. A NRC Scientific committee is
      established to judge whether or not the data in the cohort may be used for answering the
      proposed research questions. This Scientific committee consists of the principal
      investigators of the individual participating countries.

      The Scientific committee is the entity that views all proposals (new studies, research
      questions) and decides whether or not it is in line with aim of NRC as well as ethics as well
      as scientifically robust. Approval for proposals can be obtained by positive response from a
      majority of the members (quality and ethics of proposals).

      Institutions/companies that obtain data for a specific proposal, are only allowed to use the
      data for that specific purpose.

      The NRC cohort also aims to serve as a platform to validate specific questionnaires
      (including food intake) or additional measurements (that are within scope of the NRC
      objectives). For offering an additional measurement or questionnaire to participants for
      health parameters that are already included in the protocols, also a request for approval
      should be filed to the scientific committee. The scientific committee will then decide (based
      on a positive response of the majority of the committee) if this measurement or questionnaire
      may be added. A request for data analysis with these new measures or questionnaires, other
      than validation purposes, has to be filed separately. If a request for approval is granted,
      participants still have the opportunity to opt out their data for use for this purpose.

      For research questions that require additional measurements for health parameters that are
      not yet included in the protocol, amendments will be submitted to the Dutch Medical Research
      and Ethics Committee (MREC).

    <description>This cohort study is an observational, one-group study. The intervention consists of research activities that participants are asked to perform throughout the cohort, including the use of do-it-yourself devices, filling out online-questionnaires and sample collection with supplied kits for the analysis of various health parameters. The frequency with which participants are asked to measure these health parameters varies, ranging from once to weekly.</description>

    <description>Measurements are primarily based on &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; non-invasive or minimally invasive methods. Participants upload collected data to the Personal Health Portal.
The measurements are divided into required and optional measurements. The required measurements mainly include routine methodology (e.g. weight, blood pressure, blood glucose); the latter also include methods under development that will be fine-tuned along the project. Which additional measures will be offered to participants is dependent on if funding or in-kind sponsoring is available. Participants will receive measurement kits for these analyses at-home and will be responsible for collection, labeling and shipment of samples themselves. After analysis the resulting data are uploaded to the user accounts.</description>

      In addition, the plasma metabolome and selected biomarkers (from dried blood spot), urinary
      metabolome (from collected urine), DNA damage (from dried blood spots, telomere length and
      mitochondrial DNA deletions, DNA base damage/oxidation, gamma H2AX DNA strand break assay),
      micronutrient analysis (from dried blood spot or capillary blood collection) and microbiome
      (sequencing metagenomics/Fecal Swabs) will be offered to participants as additional
      measurements, if funding or in-kind sponsoring is available.

      Funding is already available for:

        -  Dried blood spot collection for analysis of biomarkers (including fatty acids, vitamins,
           amino acids) and metabolomics;

        -  Faecal collection (swab) for metagenome analysis

        The NRC cohort will be composed of employees and students in the area of life sciences.
        This allows optimal involvement of participants in shaping all aspects of the cohort and
        the ownership of data. We aim to recruit about 250 male and female scientists for the
        entire cohort. For each participating country it is aimed to recruit about 25 participants,
        taking drop-out and varying submission and/or starting dates between the 15 participating
        countries into account. Besides, a higher number of participants will increase the chance
        of being able to compare the data with other countries.
