      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Subject is male or female, aged ≥ 18 years to ≤ 70 years at Screening. Female subjects
             must either be postmenopausal (at least 1 year), permanently sterilized or, if of
             childbearing potential, must be willing to use at least 2 effective methods of
             contraception, including a barrier method during the study period. Effective methods
             of contraception are methods of birth control, which result in a low failure rate when
             used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, oral contraceptives,
             progesterone-releasing intrauterine systems or the TCu 380A intrauterine device,
             complete sexual abstinence, or vasectomized partner. Male subjects with partners of
             childbearing potential must be willing to use a condom when sexually active. Both male
             and female subjects must use the above mentioned contraception for 20 weeks after
             administration of study drug (anticipated 5 half-lives)

          -  Subject has had a confirmed diagnosis of mild to moderate plaque-type psoriasis for at
             least 6 months involving ≤ 5 % of body surface area (BSA) (excluding the scalp)

          -  Subject has a body mass index of ≤ 35 kg/m^2 at Screening

          -  Subject has a minimum of 2 psoriatic lesions with at least 1 plaque in a site suitable
             for biopsy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subject who is pregnant, or plans to become pregnant during the study, or
             lactating, or sexually active with childbearing potential who is not using a medically
             accepted birth control method

          -  Subject has received systemic nonbiologic psoriasis therapy (methotrexate [MTX],
             steroids, cyclophosphamide) or psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA)/ultraviolet A (UVA)
             phototherapy within 4 weeks prior to Screening

          -  Subject has received treatment with biologic agents within 12 months prior to the
             study

          -  Subject has received live attenuated vaccination within 6 weeks prior to Screening or
             intends to have such a vaccination during the course of the study

          -  Subject has received any investigational drug or experimental procedure within 90 days
             or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to IMP administration

          -  Subject requires treatment with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug during the study
             period. Paracetamol will be permitted for use as an antipyretic and/or analgesic

          -  Subject has an active infection (eg, sepsis, pneumonia, abscess) or has had a serious
             infection (resulting in hospitalization or requiring parenteral antibiotic treatment)
             within 6 weeks prior to IMP administration. When in doubt, the Investigator should
             confer with the UCB Study Physician

          -  Subject has a history of a positive tuberculosis (TB) test or evidence of possible TB
             or latent TB infection at Screening that cannot be attributed to a prior Bacillus
             Calmette-Guérin inoculation

          -  Subject has renal or liver impairment, defined as:

               -  For women, serum creatinine level ≥ 125 μmol/L; for men, ≥ 135 μmol/L, or

               -  ALT and aspartate aminotransferase ≥ 2x ULN, or

               -  Alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &gt; 1.5x ULN (an isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5x ULN
                  is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin is &lt; 35 %)

          -  Subject has active neoplastic disease or history of neoplastic disease within 5 years
             of Screening (except for basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in
             situ that has been definitively treated with standard of care)
