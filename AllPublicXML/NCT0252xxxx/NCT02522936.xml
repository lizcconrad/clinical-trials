  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized placebo controlled trial of the use of Biotene versus no treatment in
      women receiving oral oxybutynin for overactive bladder. The primary outcome will be rate of
      discontinuation of oxybutynin at 6 month.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition affecting roughly 20% of women.
      Anticholinergic medications are the main treatment modality for women with OAB; however,
      treatment is hampered by high rates of dry mouth which limit tolerability. Discontinuation
      rates for anticholinergic medications for dry mouth have been reported to be as high as 71%
      at 6 months. Biotène(TM) Moisturizing Mouth Spray is used for xerostomia due to various
      etiologies in adults.

      The purpose of our study is to determine the rate of discontinuation of oral oxybutynin
      therapy for overactive bladder in women using Biotène(TM) Moisturizing Mouth Spray versus no
      additional treatment. This is a randomized open label trial. Participants will be randomized
      to moisturizing mouth spray versus no additional treatment. Urinary symptoms, xerostomia
      symptoms, and compliance with oral oxybutynin will be compared between groups. Our primary
      outcome is rate of discontinuation of oral oxybutynin at 6 months.

      Assuming a baseline discontinuation rate of 70% at 6 months, and assuming 80% power and α =
      0.05 for a two-sided test, we will require 42 subjects in each group to detect a difference
      of 30% in cure rate between the two groups. Assuming followup of 75%, 60 subjects in each
      group will be recruited.

      Participants within groups will be compared with respect to differences in baseline
      demographics, questionnaire scores and compliance with oxybutynin using a Chi Square test for
      categorical variable, a T test for normally distributed continuous variables or a Mann
      Whitney U test for non-normally distributed or ordinal variables.
