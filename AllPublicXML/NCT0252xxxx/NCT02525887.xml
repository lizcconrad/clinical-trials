  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observation will look at patient care decisions of the primary healthcare provider
      utilizing the results of the DNA testing of patients' metabolic pathways using 2C19, 2C9,
      2D6, 3A4, Factor II, Factor V and MTHFR and VKORC1. Findings of the data collection will be
      published to optimize the benefits of pharmacogenomics testing and publish health outcomes.

      This study will analyze de-identified data from patients identified by the primary healthcare
      provider where a DNA sample has been collected; the medical history and medications at the
      time the DNA sample was collected; the date of the DNA pathway testing and the results. The
      study will collect and assess the patient data where the healthcare provider has explained
      the results of the DNA testing to the patient and made applicable changes in the healthcare
      plan based on the DNA pathway results. Patients will have returned to the healthcare provider
      after a minimum of ninety (90) days for follow-up to assess the outcome of the care plan
      changes started after the DNA results provided. This study will collect the healthcare
      provider will provide the outcomes of the healthcare plan changes.
