      This pilot study will test the hypothesis that a low sodium diet will decrease sodium (23Na)
      magnetic resonance imaging-determined skin sodium concentrations in patients with systemic
      lupus erythematosus (SLE) and improve blood pressure and inflammation

      This pilot study will test the hypothesis that a low sodium diet will decrease 23Na magnetic
      resonance imaging-determined skin sodium concentrations in patients with SLE and improve
      blood pressure and inflammation. Investigators plan to enroll 21 participants who will be
      randomized to low salt or high salt diet. Participants will eat the first diet for 28 days,
      and after a 2 week washout, Participants will eat the second diet (whichever the participant
      was not randomized to for the first phase). Participant will know what diet participant is
      on, study coordinator who does the assessment will be blinded to diet.
