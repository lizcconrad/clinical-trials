  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to fully test a culturally/religiously-tailored,
      church-based HIV screening intervention (TIPS) against a standard HIV information
      intervention on HIV screening rates at 6 and 12 months with adult African American church
      members and community members who use church outreach services. Our secondary outcome is to
      reduce sexual risk behaviors with this same population.

      The primary aim of this study is to fully test a culturally/religiously-tailored,
      church-based HIV screening intervention against a standard HIV information intervention on
      HIV screening rates at 6 and 12 months with adult AA church members and community members who
      use church outreach services. In this two-arm clustered, randomized community trial, churches
      will be matched on SES, membership size, and denomination, then randomized to treatment
      condition. It is projected that 14 churches (7 churches per arm; 110 church and community
      members per church; 1,540 participants total) will be required to detect significant
      increases in HIV screening in the intervention arm. Intervention content is guided by the
      Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Intervention delivery will be guided by a Community
      Engagement and Social-Ecological approach. This approach includes church leaders delivering
      culturally/religiously-appropriate HIV education and screening materials (e.g., sermon
      guides, HIV screening testimonials, church bulletins) and activities (e.g., pastors modeling
      receipt of HIV screening, HIV screening events) from a church-based HIV Tool Kit through
      multilevel church outlets (community-wide, church-wide services, ministry and outreach
      groups, individual) to increase intervention reach and dosage. It was hypothesized that this
      church-based HIV screening intervention will significantly increase HIV screening rates vs a
      standard HIV information intervention in AA church-populations at 6 and 12 months. The role
      of potential mediators and moderators related to receipt of HIV screening will be evaluated
      and a process evaluation to determine modifiable implementation fidelity, facilitators,
      barriers, and costs related to increasing church-based HIV testing rates will be conducted.
      This intervention study could provide an effective, scalable model for HIV screening
      interventions in AA churches.

    <description>Pastors and Health Action Team members will be trained in treatment implementation procedures using the scripted, study implementation manual. Intervention churches will receive the TIPS HIV Tool Kit, including a study manual. These churches will hold a Kick-off event, where tools will be distributed, and motivational strategies implemented. After the Kick-off, liaisons will deliver 1-2 Tool Kit materials/activities per month through targeted multilevel church activities minimum of 24 tools over the 12 month study period. Two additional HIV screening events will be planned (one for community members) and will be open to all persons seeking screening, including study nonparticipants. Both groups will receive manualized pastor/church liaison trainings on study procedures, HIV basics and local resources and coordination of HIV screening events.</description>
