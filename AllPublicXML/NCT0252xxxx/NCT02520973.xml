  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women who develop active Tuberculosis (TB) are at increased risk of poor maternal
      and infant outcomes. Our data from South Africa show that up to 3% of HIV-infected pregnant
      women have active TB , many with advanced disease, contributing to the 40% of maternal
      mortality associated with TB or HIV in South Africa . Screening for TB in pregnant women in
      this setting is therefore essential to reduce maternal mortality. Symptom-directed screening
      for TB has been recommended by the World Health Organization and by the South African
      National Department of Health; however, no implementation framework is in place to
      operationalize the guidelines. Symptom-based testing is an efficient process that limits use
      of diagnostic tests, but may miss many cases. In Soweto, we found that 0.7% (700/100,000) of
      HIV-infected women had active TB when a symptom-based strategy was employed once, but in
      Klerksdorp we found that 3.3% (3,300/100,000) had active TB when universal testing,
      regardless of symptoms, was performed; most TB cases were newly diagnosed among women who
      reported no symptoms .
