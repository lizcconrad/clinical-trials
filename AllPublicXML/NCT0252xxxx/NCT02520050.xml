  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The American Diabetes Association (ADA), among other medical societies, is strongly
      recommending medical nutrition therapy (MNT) for prevention and management of type 2
      diabetes. However, the ADA recognized that there is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; diet and thus
      recommends that MNT should be conducted through a consultation with registered dietitians
      (RD). Previous studies have shown that using diabetes-specific nutritional formulas, as an
      integral part of the MNT, lowers postprandial blood glucose levels. Through our experience
      from the Joslin's Weight Achievement and Intensive Treatment (Why WAIT™) program, applying
      MNT within a structured dietary intervention protocol has the best impact on blood glucose
      values and body weight. Meanwhile, the frequent use of health coaching during dietary
      intervention proved to be effective in managing diabetes and inducing weight loss. However,
      no study compared those three intervention methods in a randomized clinical study.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of different models of conducting medical
      nutrition therapy on the glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.
