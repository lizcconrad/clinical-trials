  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of TRV130 for moderate to severe
      acute pain in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a suspected/known,
      unilateral, closed long bone fracture.

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of TRV130 for the treatment of
      moderate to severe acute pain associated with a long bone fracture in patients presenting to
      the ED. The safety and tolerability of TRV130 will also be evaluated in this open-label pilot
      study.

          -  Age 18-65 years, inclusive

          -  Has a suspected/known, unilateral, closed fracture of either: radius, ulna (or both)
             OR tibia, fibula (or both) BUT not fractures in more than 1 extremity

          -  Able to understand and comply with study procedures and requirements, and provide
             written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Multiple extremity trauma

          -  Open fracture

          -  Clinically significant medical condition or history of such condition that may place
             the patient at an unacceptable risk in the trial, may interfere with the
             interpretation of efficacy, safety, or tolerability data obtained in the trial, or may
             interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs
