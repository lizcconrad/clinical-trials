  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand if there is a relationship between the way that
      emotions are regulated by the brain and the way that heart rate is regulated by the brain.
      The study also seeks to understand whether having depression changes the way that emotions
      and heart rate are regulated.

    <description>Subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) who are scheduled to receive ketamine infusions will complete the video task and imaginal task twice. The first visit will be before any ketamine treatment. The second visit will be within 1 week after first ketamine infusion. This is NOT at treatment study. Study inclusion is open to participants with MDD who are already planning to receive ketamine treatment at Emory. No treatment is offered through this study.</description>

    <intervention_name>Video Task</intervention_name>
    <description>Subjects are asked to watch a series of six two-minute video clips. The video clips are designed to induce sad or happy emotions or no emotion (neutral) and are taken from movies, documentaries, or instructional videos. There are two videos for each emotion condition. Videos and fixation cross screens are viewed on a laptop computer. In between video clips, patients are asked to quietly look at a fixation cross for one minute, describe their emotional reaction to the video for up to one minute, then again attend to a fixation cross for one minute. A video recording of the frontal view of the participant's face will be made during task performance.</description>

    <description>Subjects are asked to think about happy or sad memories for 2 minutes. Subjects are asked to imagine performing neutral tasks, such as buying groceries. Subjects are then asked to think about a memory that makes them feel angry. A video recording of the frontal view of the participant's face will be made during task performance.</description>
