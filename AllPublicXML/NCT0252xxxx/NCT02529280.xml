    <textblock>
      &quot;Increasing Access of Latinas into Breast Cancer Clinical Trials&quot; aims to develop and pilot
      test a multi-communications approach - using a culturally relevant computer video, a tailored
      booklet and a patient navigator (PN) - to empower Latinas to make informed decisions about
      breast cancer clinical trials (BCCTs). Latinos represent 15% of the U.S. population but only
      5.6% of participants in National Cancer Institute (NCI) treatment clinical trials, resulting
      in disparities in cancer outcomes and jeopardizing the generalizability of trial findings. In
      response, this study will develop and evaluate communication and health-system-change
      strategies to facilitate Latinas' access to BCCTs at the Cancer Therapy and Research Center
      at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (CTRC-UTHSCSA). The
      CTRC-UTHSCSA, an NCI-designated Cancer Center located in South Texas, serves a culturally and
      ethnically diverse population that historically has low participation in clinical trials,
      especially among those with breast cancer, the No. 1 cancer killer of Latinas.

    <textblock>
      This study features a cohort design with random assignment of 112 Latina breast cancer
      patients from the CTRC to an intervention (56) or usual care control group (56). The
      intervention group will receive three components: 1) a culturally sensitive and individually
      tailored, 30-minute computer-based BCCT educational video; 2) a bilingual, low literacy
      booklet that encourages patients to communicate with family and friends; and 3) support from
      a patient navigator. The usual care control group will receive usual care breast cancer
      clinical trial information materials offered by the CTRC to its eligible patients. The
      intervention is based in two proven theories - Stages of Change and Social Cognitive Theory -
      and will feature basic components of individual empowerment, including knowledge, attitudes,
      skills and self-efficacy beliefs and expectations.

      The study has three main phases: Phase 1: Formative Research; Phase 2: Intervention; and
      Phase 3: Evaluation.

      Purpose:

      To empower Latinas to make informed decisions about breast cancer clinical trials (BCCTs) by
      enhancing their knowledge, attitudes, skills and self-efficacy required to support discussion
      of CT as a treatment option with doctors and family members.

      Specific Objectives:

        1. Increase patient education and awareness, positive attitudes and self-efficacy to
           enhance their decision-making skills to participate in BCCTs.

        2. Provide decisional support to make an informed decision regarding participation in BCCTs
           by encouraging discussion of BCCTs as a treatment option with medical team, family and
           friends.

        3. Test the efficacy of a multi-communication intervention to assist Latina breast cancer
           patients in their decision making process regarding participation in BCCTs.

    <description>Intervention includes 1) a 30-minute computer-based video (in English/Spanish), featuring instructional screens, graphics and animation to help participants understand the concepts presented. It will feature breast cancer patients who have participated in CTs, patients talking to their doctor or nurse and a bilingual narrator to guide participants. Video content will address common barriers and concerns regarding clinical trials, as well as the informed consent process, and how clinical trials are monitored and reviewed; 2) a bilingual easy to understand booklet with tailored information on clinical trials. The booklet will include many of the elements and messages featured in the video program; and 3) assistance from a trained, bilingual, bicultural, nurse navigator.</description>
