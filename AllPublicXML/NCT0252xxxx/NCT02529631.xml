    <textblock>
      This trial compares two treatment methods:

        1. Orlistat 60 mg to be taken three times daily one capsule; indicated for weight loss in
           overweight adults. Important is also that it is taken along with a reduced-calorie and
           low-fat diet.

        2. Polyglucosamine tablets to be taken two times daily two tablets, taken with the two main
           meals with the highest fat content, indicated for weight maintenance and weight loss.

    <description>In order to have comparable calorie intakes, all participants followed the recommendations of the German clinical practice guidelines on the management and prevention of obesity.
Due to the different appearance of tablets and capsules, a double dummy design was chosen, a blister strip for each day and each participant had to take the same amount of capsules and tablets per day. The content of the blister strips: three orlistat 60 g capsules plus six placebo tablets.</description>
