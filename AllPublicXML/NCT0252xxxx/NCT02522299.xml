  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate specific alterations in immune cell mechanisms
      related to neutrophil function as detected by PI3Kdelta-dependent changes in messenger
      ribonucleic acid (mRNA) extracted from induced sputum in patients experiencing an
      exacerbation of COPD, with or without treatment with GSK2269557. The efficacy of treatment
      with GSK2269557 will also be measured using functional respiratory imaging (FRI) and
      spirometry. This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. The
      study consisted of Screening Phase (up to 3 days prior to Day 1), Treatment Phase (Days 1 to
      84) and Follow phase (7 to 14 days after last dose). The total duration of the study is 13-14
      weeks including the screening visit.
