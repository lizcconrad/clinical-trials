      The purpose of this retrospective observational study is to describe the sequence of
      ICU-therapies that are limited and to compare characteristics and the decision making process
      in surgical ICU-patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decisions to limit life-support therapy are common on the intensive care unit (ICU).
      End-of-life decisions (EOLD) underlie a dynamic process and limitation of ICU-therapies is
      done sequentially. Questionnaire-based and observational studies on medical ICUs and in
      palliative care reveal blood transfusions as the first therapy physicians withhold in EOLDs.
      Whether this practice also applies to surgical ICU-patients is unknown.

    <description>The primary objective of this study performed according to an observational post-ad-hoc design is to identify the sequence of withdrawing life-sustaining treatment in surgical ICU-patients with an end-of-life decision on an intensive care unit of a German academic medical center.
Approximately 200 patients will be enrolled in the study. They are followed up until their death on the ICU. In clinical routine end-of-life decisions are documented for decision-makers and procedures in the patients´ records. Patients´ characteristics and therapeutic approaches are documented in the electronic patient data management system.</description>
