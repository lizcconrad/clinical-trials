      1. Investigate the application of ulinastatin(UTI) in real practice clinic.(eg:population
           character, usage and dosage, course of treatment,etc )

        2. Analysis the incidence of adverse drug reactions /adverse events of ulinastatin, collect
           the main clinical manifestations, treatment, outcome, influence factors; provide
           evidence for improving the recommended medication plan of ulinastatin.

        3. Evaluate the safety of ulinastatin , obtain scientific conclusion , and provide evidence
           for appropriate medication to administration department of health authority.

      In order to find out the application of ulinastatin in real practice clinic , identify the
      high risk group for adverse event/adverse drug reaction and calculate the adverse
      event/adverse drug reaction incidence rate, a large sample size clinical trial has been
      designed. This trial is an observational study. The investigators would screen several
      hospitals from different provinces and prospectively collect the main clinical
      manifestations,treatment, outcome, influence factors about patients using ulinastatin either
      in general clinical departments or in ICU. This study would be expected to provide evidence
      for appropriate medication to administration department of health authority.
