      This is a prospective international multicentre surveillance register. The aim of this
      register is to determine the Accolade/Accolade II stem and Trident/Tritanium cup survivorship
      over years. All institutions willing to participate to the register, able to recruit at least
      20 patients (up to 100 patients)

          1. Male and non-pregnant female patients between 18-75 years of age.

          2. Patients requiring uncemented primary THA (Total Hip Arthroplasty), suitable for the
             use of the Accolade stem and Trident/Tritanium cup.

          3. Patients with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA).

          4. Patients who understand the conditions of the study and are willing and able to comply
             with the post-operative scheduled clinical and radiographic evaluations and the
             prescribed rehabilitation.

          5. Patients who signed the Ethics Committee approved Informed Consent Form prior to

          1. Patients who require revision of a previously implanted hip prosthesis.

          2. Patients who had a THA on contralateral side within the last 6 months.

          3. Patients who had a THA on contralateral side more than 6 months ago and the
             rehabilitation period outcome was considered unsatisfactory or not good (Harris Hip
             Score &lt; 85).

          4. Patients who will need lower limb joint replacement for another joint within one year.

          6. Patients who have had a prior procedure of acetabular osteotomy.

          7. Patients with acute femoral fractures

          8. Obese patients where obesity is severe enough to affect subject's ability to perform

          9. Patients with active or suspected infection.

         10. Patients with malignancy - active malignancy.

             dose requirements.

         13. The patient has a neuromuscular or neurosensory deficit which would limit the ability
             to assess the performance of the device or the patient has a neurological deficit
             which interferes with the patient's ability to limit weight bearing or places an
             extreme load on the implant during the healing period.

         14. Female patients planning a pregnancy during the course of the study.

         15. Patients with systemic or metabolic disorders leading to progressive bone
             deterioration.

         16. Patients, who as judged by the surgeon, are mentally incompetent or are unlikely to be
             compliant with the prescribed post-operative routine and follow-up evaluation
             schedule.

         17. Patients with other severe concurrent joint involvements, which can affect their
             outcome.

         18. Patients with other concurrent illnesses, which are likely to affect their outcome
             such as sickle cell anaemia, systemic lupus erythematosus or renal disease requiring

         19. Patient with a known sensitivity to device materials.

         20. Patients under the protection of law (e.g. guardianship).
