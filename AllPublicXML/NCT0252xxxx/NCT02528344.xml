  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to determine whether High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) has
      potential to improve disease activity scores for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients. By
      reducing inflammation and modifying immune function HIIT may offer a substantial paradigm
      shift in RA care, especially in older persons with RA who experience aging
      related-immunesenescence, increased systemic inflammation and greater physical inactivity
      than young persons. Prior to embarking on a large scale trial of HIIT-induced disease
      modification, this pilot study aims to demonstrate that HIIT can produce measurable responses
      in disease activity scores and peak VO2in persons undergoing routine pharmacologic treatment
      for RA.
