  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous lidocaine is efficient for management of post operative pain in abdominal
      surgery. As previously published in literature the investigators use it during bariatric
      surgery.

      Nevertheless plasmatic concentration of lidocaine is unknown in this population, despite a
      widespread use.

      Investigators propose in this work to bring an objective proof that administration of
      lidocaine based on a modified body weight is safe.

      Intravenous administration concerned the peri operative period. A total of six samples are
      taken for each patient.

      Investigators get approbation of local ethic committee for this work.

    <description>Blood samples will be removed by the peripheral catheter or direct venous puncture with other blood sample usually performed during post-operative period.
First sample will be taken after initial bolus (ie 10 min after initiation of perfusion), second at 20 min, third at 30 min. The fourth and fifth samples will be taken after change of posology (from 2 to 1 mg/kg/h at the end of surgery) and at the end of administration. The sixth sample will be performed the day after the end of administration.</description>
