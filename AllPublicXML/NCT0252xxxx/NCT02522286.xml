  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study implements a simple evidence-based patient activation intervention - &quot;Ask 3
      Questions&quot;- augmented by a novel theory-based intervention - &quot;Open Communication&quot; - aimed at
      activating patients and healthcare providers. The goal of this project is to increase patient
      and physician's preparedness for more having more questions, expressing differing opinions,
      and working collaboratively in making medical decisions that are both informed and responsive
      to patients' needs and preferences.

    <textblock>
      Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) using a 2x2 factorial design to compare two
      interventions, &quot;Ask 3 Questions&quot; and &quot;Open Communication&quot; alone and in combination to a usual
      care control condition. These data will inform a potential future large scale evaluation of
      the interventions in clinical practice. Consistent with a patient-centered approach, outcome
      measures are selected in collaboration with a group of patient stakeholders and will include
      measures of patient satisfaction. The study aims to collect 75 post-visit surveys and 10
      appointment audio-recordings from patients at each of 4 participating sites (a total of 300
      post-visit surveys and 40 audio-recordings).

    <description>This arm has three components: (1) Patients, physicians, and medical assistants watching a video aimed at encouraging open communication; (2) Patients fill out a Visit Companion Booklet about what are the most important issues they want to discuss with their physicians, record their next steps, and teach back on their next steps; (3) physicians receiving communication coaching from a Standardized Patient Instructor on patient-centered communication.</description>

    <description>Participants were asked to bring an &quot;Ask 3&quot; questions flyer into their appointment to use if they needed to make a choice about their health care during their appointment. These 3 questions have been shown to help patients make more informed decisions about their healthcare.</description>

    <intervention_name>Open Communication</intervention_name>
    <description>Open Communication includes a combination of interventions. 1) Participants used a Visit Companion Booklet to write out issues they would like to discuss with their physician during their appointment before showing up. They were also asked to write out any next steps decided on during their appointment and to repeat back to their doctor what they wrote before leaving.
2) Patients watched a short, informational cartoon video to better understand the Visit Companion Booklet.
3) Participating physicians received a training through the use of a Standardized Patient Instructor as a means of providing convenient, individualized training on communication techniques. Dyads (physicians and their medical assistants) were trained on how to incorporate the Visit Companion Booklet into workflow.</description>
