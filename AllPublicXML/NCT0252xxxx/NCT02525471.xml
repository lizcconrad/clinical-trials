    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of RNS60 in patients
      with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Investigators will also measure the impact of RNS60
      on several markers of neuro-inflammation, measured by blood biomarkers and positron emission
      tomography (PET) imaging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease for which there is
      no cure. A substantial body of evidence implicates the neuroimmune system in ALS
      pathophysiology. Of relevance to this study, microglia activation in the brain has been found
      to correlate positively with faster rate of disease progression. In addition, studies of
      blood cells in people with ALS have shown an increased activation of two of the major
      inflammatory cell types in the body, monocytes and T cells. Among T cells, regulatory T cells
      (Tregs) have been recently proposed to play a role in ALS progression.

      RNS60 is an electrokinetically altered aqueous fluid. Chemically, RNS60 is composed of saline
      and oxygen. The electrokinetic processing of RNS60 in Revalesio's patented Revalesio Pump
      (RP) produces charge-stabilized nanostructures (CSNs) that exhibit electrical fields. RNS60
      is available for intravenous administration and inhalation. RNS60 has been extensively tested
      in preclinical toxicological studies and has shown very little to no side effects. In
      addition, RNS60 was well tolerated in three phase I human safety studies, one after
      intravenous administration and two after inhalation.

      Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies in multiple disease models have demonstrated that
      RNS60 has broad anti-inflammatory effects. These effects include reduction of microglia
      activation, increase of the Tregs subpopulation of lymphocytes, and neuroprotection in
      several disease models.

    <description>Following screening visit to determine eligibility, enrolled subjects will undergo the baseline visit within 6 weeks where the first intravenous (IV) infusion of study medication, RNS60, will be administered. Study medication for inhalation use will be dispensed at this time, and again at weeks 7 and 15. Subjects will continue once a week follow ups to receive RNS60 by IV infusion, continuing inhalation use the remaining 6 days per week, for 24 weeks total. Additionally, eligible subjects will undergo PET imaging at baseline and again between weeks 18 and 23.
In addition, upon nearing completion of the core study, subjects will be given the option to continue to receive drug for approximately an additional 24 weeks, for a total of approximately 48 weeks on study drug, following the optional extension phase schedule of activities.</description>
