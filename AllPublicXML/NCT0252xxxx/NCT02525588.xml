      The goal of this study is to compare conventional UHMWPE with X3 highly cross-linked
      polyethylene in a CS fixed bearing total knee prosthesis (Triathlon Knee System: Stryker,
      Warsaw, USA) by means of RSA and clinical evaluation.

    <measure>Investigation of clinical performance and patient outcome with the Knee Society Score (KSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative, 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, 1, 2 and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee Society Clinical Rating System is comprised of two distinct sub-scores: one for pain, range of motion (ROM) and joint stability, and one for functional parameters. Sub-scores range from a potential minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 100 points. Although the specific scores are not distinguished as &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;fair,&quot; or &quot;poor,&quot; a higher value represents a better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-operative, 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, 1, 2 and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 Health Survey is a 36-item patient completed questionnaire to measure general health and well-being. It includes a physical and mental status component score; each ranging from 0-100. Low values represent a poor health state and high values represent a good health state.</description>

    <measure>Investigation of clinical performance and patient outcome with the EuroQuol - 5 dimension (EQ-5D) patient questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative, 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, 1, 2 and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D health questionnaire provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status.</description>

    <measure>Investigation of clinical performance and patient outcome with the Lower Extremity Activity Scale (LEAS) patient questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative, 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, 1, 2 and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The LEAS is completed by the participant to assess activity level. Activity levels were ordered in terms of intensity from 1 to 18, with 18 indicating the highest activity level.</description>
