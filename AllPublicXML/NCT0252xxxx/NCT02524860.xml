      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Focal-Fusion Bx at detecting
      clinically significant prostate cancer in a standard clinical environment.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the Focal-Fusion Bx device
      at finding clinically relevant prostate cancer.

      A multiparametric MRI examination will be carried out prior to study enrollment. Probable
      cancerous regions (regions of interest, ROI) will be identified, and these ROIs will be used
      as targets during the biopsy.

      Three prostate sampling methods will be conducted in the same session on all patients. These
      include:

      i) Focal-Fusion Bx targeted biopsy ii) Cognitive fusion targeted biopsy and iii) Systematic
      (untargeted) biopsy. Trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging will be conducted with BK Flex
      Focus Ultrasound system (Analogic Corporation, Peabody, MA).

      Primary hypothesis: The technique used to acquire the biopsy samples will impact the
      proportion of clinically relevant cancers by improving the specificity of detecting
      clinically significant cancers. It is hypothesized that Focal-Fusion Bx biopsies will
      diagnose more high risk cancers and fewer low-risk cancers than non-targeted systematic
      biopsies.

    <description>The Focal-Fusion Bx device uses hardware and software to overlay targets onto the live ultrasound image in real-time. This allows the urologist to take biopsy samples from tissue that looked suspicious on the patient's MRI.</description>
