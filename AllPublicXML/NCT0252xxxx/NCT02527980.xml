      The proposed research will provide in-depth, longitudinal data, based on real-time reports,
      which will address key priorities for the FDA including, increased understanding of the
      relations between electronic cigarette (e-cig) use and 1) nicotine dependence, 2) reductions
      in combustible cigarette (CC) use, 3) attempts to quit CC use and the success of those
      attempts, and 4) health-related outcomes such as biomarkers of exposure and carcinogenicity.

      Primary Aim: Characterize e-cig use patterns both acutely and over 2 years and relate them to
      patterns of CC use (including reduced CC use), nicotine dependence and related variables
      (e.g., withdrawal suppression), and attempts and success in quitting CC use. Investigators
      will use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to obtain fine grained, real-time data on
      e-cig and CC use. These data will be used to test the hypotheses that increasing and higher
      levels of e-cig use, measured in real-time, will be negatively related to CC use, nicotine
      dependence, and CC withdrawal severity and positively related to CC quit attempts and CC
      cessation success.

      Secondary Aim 1: Determine how the use of e-cigs is related to biomarkers of tobacco exposure
      and cancer risk, and to acute and chronic pulmonary health outcomes. Investigators will
      examine the relation between e-cig use and cancer biomarkers, exposure biomarkers, and
      pulmonary function.

      Secondary Aim 2: Identify person factors, contextual variables, and patterns of behaviors and
      symp-toms that predict e-cig and CC use patterns and key outcomes (e.g., CC cessation,
      health-related outcomes), and identify variables that moderate relations between e-cig use
      and such outcomes. Investigators will attempt to identify contextual variables and person
      factors that predict increased e-cig use, decreased CC use (including cessation), reduced
      nicotine dependence, and significant changes in biomarkers and health outcomes. Further,
      investigators will identify variables that moderate such relations, revealing factors and
      events that make changes in e-cig and CC use, and associated outcomes, especially likely.

    <description>To address the primary aim of understanding dynamic use patterns in an observational cohort, investigators will assess the use of CCs, e-cigs and other tobacco use-related behavior. E-cig attitudinal questions and questions about e-cig use in the environment will be asked. Investigators will assess person factors that may inform understanding of who is using e-cigs and in what manner these may also moderate the effects of e-cig use. Investigators will also use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to obtain data on e-cig and CC use. Investigators will assess exhaled carbon dioxide, cotinine and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Pulmonary function will be assessed via spirometry conducted in accordance with the American Thoracic Society guidelines. Investigators will also assess prior pulmonary diagnoses. Participants will also complete the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (SGRQ-C).</description>

    <description>For all participants: We will conduct a 2-year longitudinal cohort study comprising participants who smoke exclusively CCs (n=175) and dual users of e-cigs and CCs (n=275). We will use state-of-the-art ecological momentary assessments to determine: 1) dynamic patterns of e-cig and CC use and related outcomes (e.g., dependence, withdrawal symptoms, CC quit attempts and quitting success); 2) episodic (affective, contextual, social) and stable person-factor (lifestyle factors, demographics) variables that covary meaningfully with e-cig and CC use and related outcomes; and 3) biomarkers of tobacco and carcinogen exposure as well as other health-related outcomes (e.g., reduced pulmonary function.</description>
