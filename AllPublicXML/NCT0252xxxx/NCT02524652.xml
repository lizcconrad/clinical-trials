  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is of paramount
      importance and requires optimal pain control based on a multimodal concept, including
      injection of local anaesthetics. Regarding this latter, different options have emerged
      recently such as the adductor canal block, performed before the surgery by the
      anaesthesiologist or the infiltration of the articulation performed by the surgeon at the of
      the intervention. No trial has compared these two approaches. As practice of medicine should
      be based on evidence, we decided to undertake this randomised controlled trial where we
      compared the adductor canal block with the local infiltration analgesia technique in terms of
      pain and functional outcomes

    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled to undergo anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction under general
      anaesthesia will be randomly allocated to two groups: local infiltration analgesia or
      adductor canal block.

      The local infiltration analgesia will be performed by the surgeon at the end of surgery with
      20 mLs of ropivacaine 0.5%. The adductor canal block will be performed by the
      anaesthesiologist under ultrasound guidance after the surgery, before awaking the patient,
      using the same solution (20 mLs ropivacaine 0.5%)

      Postoperative analgesia will include intravenous patient-controlled analgesia of morphine
      (settings 1 mg/ml, 2 ml/10 minutes, 40 mg/4 hours), ibuprofen (3x400 mg) and acetaminophen
      (4x1000 mg).

      A research assistant and a physiotherapist, both blinded to the group allocation, will
      collect pain and rehabilitation data, respectively.
