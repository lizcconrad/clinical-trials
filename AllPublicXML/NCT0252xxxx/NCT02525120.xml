  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the early clinical outcomes following
      non-surgical treatment with Triojection® to surgical discectomy. Early is defined as less
      than or equal to 6 months.

      The objective of this study is to compare clinical, economic and safety outcomes between
      Triojection and surgical discectomy. The study will include two follow-up phases: 1) an
      initial follow-up period during the first 6 months after treatment and (2) a long-term
      follow-up lasting an additional 18 months (2 years total).

      The hypothesis is that over the first six months after treatment, Triojection® will be
      non-inferior to discectomy with respect to the improvement in leg pain. This will be
      demonstrated using a non-inferiority margin of 19.4 points on the difference between baseline
      leg pain score and the average leg pain score recorded at 1 week, 1, 3 and 6 months.

    <description>Triojection is a system including a single-use sterile syringe cartridge and an accessory console. The console is interfaced to a supply of medical oxygen and uses this supply to fill the syringe with oxygen. Ozone is produced by applying a high voltage to electrodes physically located within the syringe. When a concentration of 35µg/ml is reached, the cartridge is removed from the console. The sterile syringe, containing the gas, is extracted from the protective housing and the gas is administered directly to the center of the herniated disc through a spinal needle.</description>
