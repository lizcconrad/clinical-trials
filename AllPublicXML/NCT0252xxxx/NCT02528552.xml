      This is a prospective, randomized double-blind, multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy
      of low level laser therapy over-the-counter at home device Theradome LH80 PRO, compared to
      SHAM for promoting hair growth in males diagnosed with androgenetic alopecia, and a usability
      study to assess subject ability to self-assess hair loss and understanding use of the device.
