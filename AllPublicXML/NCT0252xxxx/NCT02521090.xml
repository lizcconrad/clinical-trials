    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of epidermal growth factor
      receptor bispecific antibody (EGFRBi)-armed autologous T cells and how well it works in
      treating patients with glioblastoma that have come back or does not respond to treatment.
      EGFRBi-armed autologous T cells coated with antibodies (proteins used by the immune system to
      target and kill foreign objects such as cancer cells) may have great ability to seek out,
      attach to, and destroy glioblastoma cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for 8 intrathecal (IT) injections (via
      lumbar puncture) of anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)3 × anti-EGFRBi armed activated T
      cells (aATC) (EGFRBi-armed autologous T cells) given twice per week for 4 weeks in a standard
      3+3 dose escalation schema with 0.10, 0.50 and 1.00 × 10^9 EGFRBi-aATC per IT injection for a
      total of 0.8, 4.0, and 8.0 × 10^9 cells, respectively. (Phase I) II. To explore efficacy and
      confirm the toxicity profile of EGFRBi-aATC. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measure immune responses in participants of the phase I/II trial by sequential monitoring
      of phenotype, interferon gamma (IFN-g) enzyme-linked immunoSpots (EliSpots),
      anti-glioblastoma (GBM) cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) (direct
      cytotoxicity against GBM cells) directed at GBM cell lines, T-helper 1 (Th1)/T-helper 2 (Th2)
      serum cytokine patterns, and anti-glioma antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum
      during the &quot;vaccinate and consolidate&quot; process.

      II. Assess survival and persistence of aATC in the CSF, and trafficking of IT-injected aATC
      out of the CSF into the bloodstream.

      III. Image patients' brain with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (performed clinically in
      2-month intervals; includes standard structural sequences and perfusion imaging) and
      alpha-[11C]methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT) positron emission tomography (PET) scan (under Wayne
      State University [WSU] Internal Review Board [IRB]/Karmanos Cancer Institute [KCI]-approved
      research protocol) before and after the aATC treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive EGFRBi-armed autologous T cells IT twice weekly for 4 weeks.

      PHASE II: Patients receive EGFRBi-armed autologous T cells* IT twice weekly for 4 weeks and
      then intravenously (IV) over 15-30 minutes twice weekly for 2 weeks.

      *NOTE: Six selected patients receive EGFRBi-armed autologous T cells IV on day -3, -2, or -1
      prior to first IT infusion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months thereafter.
