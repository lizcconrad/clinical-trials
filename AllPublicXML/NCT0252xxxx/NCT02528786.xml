    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain blood samples from up to 14 participants who
      previously received namilumab in the previous study M1-1188-002-EM (PRIORA, [NCT01317797]) to
      correlate genetic markers with clinical outcomes.

    <textblock>
      Participants who received treatment with namilumab in the previous study M1-1188-002-EM
      (PRIORA [NCT01317797]) will have two whole blood samples (3 mL each) collected to correlate
      genetic markers with namilumab treatment responses as determined in the previous study.

      The study will enroll approximately 14 participants who received namilumab in the previous
      study.

      • No intervention is administered in this study.

      This trial will be conducted in Bulgaria, Spain and The Netherlands. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 1 day.

    <description>Clusters are described by an ellipse whose major and minor axes are the standard deviations in the x and y directions of the component points, which are rotated so that their covariance is equal to zero. The clusters were based upon the algorithms in which each data-point is assigned to one of four clusters: 1, 2, 3, or 4, representing no-target (negative controls [NTCs]), homozygotes one (XX), homozygotes two (YY), and heterozygotes (XY), respectively. Based on the calculated genetic composite scores from 8-single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based algorithm, participants were segregated into clusters.</description>
