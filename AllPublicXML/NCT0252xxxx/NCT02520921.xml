      To compare treatment with enteric coated aspirin twice a day (100 mg in the morning and 100
      mg in the evening) versus enteric coated aspirin 100 mg once per day on a composite end-point
      of ischemic events in diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome.

      It is expected that aspirin taken twice a day will reduce the occurrence of new ischemic
      event after acute coronary syndrome in diabetic patients.

      Patients who show high persistent platelet reactivity under aspirin are increasingly becoming
      an issue of clinical concern. Several studies have suggested that giving aspirin more
      frequently is very effective for reducing aspirin high persistent platelet reactivity,
      especially in diabetic patients. The aim of the study is to evaluate low dose of aspirin
      twice a day (compared to once a day) for the reduction of ischemic events in diabetic
      patients with acute coronary syndrome.

      Experimental Design:

      A multicenter, randomized, parallel group comparing aspirin given twice a day compared to
      once per day in diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome.

      Primary objective:

      To compare treatment with enteric coated aspirin twice a day (100 mg in the morning and 100
      mg in the evening) versus enteric coated aspirin 100 mg once per day on a composite end-point
      of ischemic events in diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To compare treatment with enteric coated aspirin twice a day (100 mg in the morning and
           100 mg in the evening) versus enteric coated aspirin 100 mg once per day on net clinical
           benefit combining the ischemic and bleeding events in diabetic patients with acute
           coronary syndrome.

        -  To compare treatment with enteric coated aspirin twice a day (100 mg in the morning and
           100 mg in the evening) versus enteric coated aspirin 100 mg once per day on cardiac
           events in diabetic patients with acute coronary syndrome.

        -  To compare treatment with enteric coated aspirin twice a day (100 mg in the morning and
           100 mg in the evening) versus enteric coated aspirin 100 mg once per day in each of
           individual component of the main criterion.

        -  To confirm the safety of the innovative strategy (aspirin twice a day) concerning major
           bleeding events.

      Study enrollment:

      Multicentric national study involving 42 centers in France The duration is expected to be 24
      months of recruitment. Diabetic patients will be randomized during the index hospitalization
      for acute coronary syndrome and before discharge between a conventional strategy of enteric
      coated aspirin 100mg per day with the standard of care or a innovative strategy of enteric
      coated aspirin 100mg morning and evening. Patients will be followed at one month, six months,
      one year and 18 months

      Statistical analysis:

      The study will include 2574 diabetic patients. We hypothesized that at 18 months, there will
      be an event rate of 22% for &quot;death, MI, stroke, urgent revascularization, or acute arterial
      thrombotic event in the group treated with aspirin and we expect a decrease of the primary
      event of 20% (relative variation) using aspirin twice a day corresponding to an event rate of
      17.6%.

      A sample size of 1287 patients /group will allow an 80% power to detect this difference using
      a log-rank test at a two-sided 5% significance level. The study will include 2574 diabetic
      patients.

      The primary analysis is based on the Intention To Treat population and the primary endpoint.
      The primary analysis on the primary endpoint will be carried out using a log-rank test for
      survival analysis. The 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio will be presented. In
      addition the survival status during 18 months follow-up will be described by showing
      Kaplan-Meier curves.

        -  Age: patients &lt; 75 years or patient ≥75 years
