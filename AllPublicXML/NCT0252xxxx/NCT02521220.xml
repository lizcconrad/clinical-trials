  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some studies have reported improved vascular function with the supplementation of L-arginine
      in participants with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Several clinical studies have also begun
      the investigation of L-arginine supplementation in participants with peripheral artery
      disease (PAD). This is particularly important as currently there are limited options
      available to medically manage intermittent leg pain resulted from PAD. Although some of these
      short-term clinical trials suggested that oral L-arginine improved walking distance or
      improved walking speed in participants with PAD, these results were not consistent. Further,
      only 1% of the oral supplemented L-arginine is available for the NO production as the rest is
      metabolised by the body. A better way to provide the body with substrate to produce NO is
      therefore needed. The natural amino acid and food component, L-citrulline has been suggested
      to be a good candidate for this purpose.

      L-citrulline, named after watermelon citrullus vulgaris from which it was first isolated, is
      a natural precursor of L-arginine. Studies have shown that L-citrulline is metabolised by the
      body to a lesser degree compared to L-arginine and hence is an effective precursor of
      arginine in peripheral tissues, including endothelial cells. Oral L-citrulline
      supplementation also eliminates some of the unwanted effects associated with oral arginine
      supplementation and it is well tolerated without known side effects. In addition,
      L-citrulline is a supplement that is available over-the-counter. Thus, oral supplementation
      of L-citrulline may be a new intervention strategy in participants with PAD.

      The investigators hypothesize that the oral food supplement L-citrulline, unlike L-arginine,
      reverses endothelial dysfunction. In a multinational, multicenter, double blinded,
      randomised, placebo-controlled cross-over trial the effects of L-citrulline in peripheral
      artery disease will be investigated.

      The primary aim of this trial is to examine whether the oral food supplement L-citrulline has
      any effect on clinical status, walking distance, arterial and endothelial function in
      participants with PAD.

      The investigators will use a double-blinded crossover design in which patients serve as their
      own controls. Patients who are enrolled will have two 'treatment' periods of twelve weeks
      with a wash-out period of 4 weeks in between. Patients will be randomly assigned to get
      L-citrulline in the first and placebo in the second period and vice versa.

      After a screening phase of 3 weeks, there will be a 'zero-point' measurement en then the
      first 'treatment' period of 12 weeks starts (placebo or food-supplement). Then there is a
      wash-out phase of 4 weeks after which the second 'treatment' period starts (food-supplement
      or placebo) In both periods, after 2 weeks and at the end of the period, a measurement of
      primary and secondary outcomes will be done: a questionnaire has to be filled out, treadmill
      test and flow-mediated dilation (for vessel function). The follow-up will take another 4
      weeks and will end with a phone call to check for the condition of the patient and possible
      side effects.

      Since every patient gets both placebo and the food-supplement, every patient is his/her own
      control.
