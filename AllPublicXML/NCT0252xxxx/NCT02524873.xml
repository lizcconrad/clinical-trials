      Whether patients with a functional genotype of a protein important in blood pressure
      regulation respond better to a drug therapy class/combination of therapy classes that target
      that specific pathway using the Geneticure panel for high blood pressure

      2.1 Study Design and Protocol Overview This is a post-hoc association study of patients who
      have been diagnosed with high blood pressure and have been stable on medication treatment for
      at least 6 months. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between optimal
      medication therapy (or the therapy that has resulted in the most stable blood pressure for
      that particular patient) and the predicted optimal medication therapy based on a patient's
      genetic profile.

      Chart reviews for the patient's history of antihypertensive therapy will be coupled with
      buccal swabs and blood pressure readings collected from eligible patients who have provided
      informed consent. The swab will be analyzed for fourteen genetic variants that are associated
      with antihypertensive therapy response (efficacy, side-effects).

      2.2 Study Objective To assess the relationship between the drug therapy class/combination of
      therapy classes that resulted in the best blood pressure control for a patient vs. what the
      Geneticure high blood pressure panel would have predicted.

      2.3 Secondary Objectives

        -  To assess the clinical time to achieve optimal blood pressure treatment.

        -  To assess the number of office visits required to achieve optimal blood pressure
           treatment.

             of 6 months. Note: A change in dosage, frequency, or specific medication is acceptable
             as long as there have been no changes to the class/classes of medications prescribed.

          5. Subject with a Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 19 and ≤ 35

          6. Subject is currently prescribed and taking one of the following classes of medications
             alone or in combination with each other or a Ca+ channel blocker.

               -  Diuretics

               -  ACE Inhibitors

               -  Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB)

               -  Beta-blockers

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has clinically significant kidney disease as determined by the investigator.

          2. Subject has clinically significant cardiac disease as determined by the investigator.

          3. Subject has clinically significant vascular disease as determined by the investigator.

          4. Subject has a diagnosis of secondary hypertension or is experiencing a complication of
             pregnancy.

          5. Subject is currently prescribed and taking any additional class of medication(s) for
             high blood pressure not included in the list above, with the exception of a Ca+
             channel blocker.

          6. Subject has Systolic BP &gt; 190 or Diastolic BP &gt; 120 documented within the six months
             prior to visit.

          7. Subject has a regular alcohol intake of greater than 21 units per week in the past 6
             months

          8. Subject has smoked greater than two packs of cigarettes (total) or equivalent nicotine
             intake in the past 6 months.

          9. Subject has an anticipated survival less than 12 months.

         10. Any other reason that the subject is inappropriate for study enrollment in the opinion
