          -  Inflammatory lesion (papules and pustules) count of 20 to 50 (inclusive)

          -  Non-inflammatory (open and closed comedones) lesion count of 25 to 100 (inclusive)

          -  No more than two nodulocystic lesions (i.e., nodules and cysts) on the face including
             those present on the nose, were enrolled.

          -  Subjects must also have had a Baseline IGA score of 3 or 4 on a severity scale of 0 to

          -  Presence of any other facial skin condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, might
             interfere with acne vulgaris diagnosis and/or evaluations (e .g., on the face:
             rosacea, dermatitis, psoriasis, squamous cell carcinoma, eczema, acneform eruptions
             caused by medications, steroid acne, steroid folliculitis, or bacterial folliculiti
             s).

          -  Excessive facial hair (e.g. beards, sideburns, moustaches, etc.) that would interfere
             with diagnosis or assessment of acne vulgaris.

             etc.)

          -  Use within 1 month prior to baseline or during the study of therapeutic vitamin D
             supplement (multivitamins are allowed).

             systemic antibiotics, 3) systemic treatment for acne vulgaris (other than oral
             retinoids which require a 6-month washout), or 4) systemic anti-inflammatory agents&quot;.
             (' Intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids do not require a washout and may be used
             throughout the study if at a stable and standard dose. &quot;Subjects may use Acetaminophen
             for pain relief, as needed, throughout the study)
