  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) require platelet inhibition after treatment.
      P2Y12 receptor blockage is a well-known, proved method of urgent and effective blockade of
      the platelet activation, and is applied to the current practice protocol. Ticagrelor is a
      well-performing P2Y12 receptor blocking agent which is used in these patients. In the same
      matter, it is essential to prescribe the exact dosage to optimize efficacy within the safety
      limits. However current studies are based on Western countries, whereas there has been no
      Ticagrelor patient registry in East-Asia. Thus it is reasonable to study the use of
      Ticagrelor in a large registry of Korean ACS patients.

      The BK registry is a Prospective, Open-label, Multi-center, Real world, Registry, with
      prospective registration of patients receiving the medication, Ticagrelor. All subjects are
      to be followed up for 18 months after diagnosis and treatment for ACS.

      The purpose of this study is to observe and register clinical data including Major Adverse
      Cardiovascular Endpoints and any total bleeding occurrence in Korean ACS patients treated
      with Ticagrelor during 18 month follow-up. Also, the purpose includes to determine compliance
      of Ticagrelor during post-approval commercial use and to determine prescription pattern of
      Ticagrelor during post-approval commercial use.
