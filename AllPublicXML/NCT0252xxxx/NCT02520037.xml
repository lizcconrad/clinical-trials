  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluids are generally administered to patients in order to improve circulation. However,
      fluids do not always improve circulation and fluids have side effects. Unfortunately, it is
      difficult to predict whether fluid administration improves the circulation, i.e. it is
      difficult to predict fluid responsiveness The overall aim of this observational study is to
      investigate if analysis of spontaneously occuring extra systoles can give the answer: The
      second beat in the extra systole - the post ectopic beat - is a normal sinus beat but it has
      experienced the compensatory pause, i.e. this beat is associated with increased filling time
      and in turn associated with increased filling. As such, the post ectopic beat shows how the
      heart responds to increased filling. Therefore, the hypothesis of this study is that the
      hemodynamic response to the increased filling at the post ectopic beat (compared with sinus
      beats) can predict fluid responsiveness

    <description>A positive fluid response is defined as a 15% or more increase in SV. From the arterial pressure curve, post ectopic changes (comparing with 10 preceding sinus beats) in systolic blood pressure and pre-ejection period will be derived and used to predict the fluid response. Time frame used is the 30 minutes prior to the volume expansion (from t = -30 min to t = 0 min)</description>
