    <textblock>
      The Konan RAPDx (Konan Medical USA, Irvine, CA) is a newly patented pupillography device.The
      aims of this study are to assess the ability of the RAPDx to distinguish between healthy
      subjects and patients with confirmed glaucoma using standard testing sequences, assess the
      ability of the RAPDx to distinguish between healthy subjects and patients with confirmed
      glaucoma using a customized testing sequence developed for use at the Wills Eye Hospital
      Glaucoma Research Center and to determine the combination of demographic, clinical, and RAPDx
      testing parameters which allow for maximum sensitivity and specificity in discriminating
      healthy subjects from those with glaucoma.

      The RAPDx utilizes digital, high-definition, infrared machine-vision with eye-tracking and
      automated blink detection technology to analyze and quantify the pupillary response to light.
      During the scheduled appointment, all patients will receive an undilated fundus examination
      by the attending ophthalmologist. The data of the following tests will be recorded,
      Demographic information, Visual acuity, Intraocular pressure (IOP) measured by Goldmann
      applanation tonometry,DDLS score,Vertical cup/disc ratio, gonioscopy (if not documented in
      the chart within the past 2 years) and Humphrey visual field examination.

      Each patient will undergo RAPDx testing with two different testing sequences. They are
      separated by a 10-second resting period during which the patient is instructed to close his
      or her eyes. The exam may be paused at any time and re-alignment may be performed during any
      pause. The two testing sequences are:

        1. Standard Factory Setting: 0.1-second stimuli with 2-second inter-stimuli pauses

        2. Custom Setting: 3-second stimuli with 1-second inter-stimuli pauses

    <description>the log of the difference between amplitudes of constriction when light is shone into the right versus the left eye. Amplitudes of constriction are calculated as the maximum contraction of the pupil as a percentage of the prestimulation size, that is, the prestimulus pupil diameter minus the minimum pupil diameter, divided by the prestimulus pupil diameter.</description>

    <description>the log of the difference between response latencies when light is shone into the right versus the left eye. Response latencies are calculated as the time in milliseconds between stimulus onset and time when pupil velocity has reached 50% of the peak velocity of constriction.</description>

    <description>the log of the difference between the duration of maximum constriction when light is shone into the right versus the left eye. The duration of maximum constriction is calculated as the time in milliseconds between the point of maximum constriction and the time when pupil amplitude has reached 50% of the peak amplitude of dilation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Glaucoma patients: characteristic optic nerve damage on slit lamp examination (defined
             as a definite notch in the neuroretinal rim, asymmetric inter-eye c/d ratio &gt;0.2 or
             DDLS&gt;2, or absence of neuroretinal rim not due to another known cause) with
             corresponding glaucomatous VF deficits (defined as a cluster of 3 or more points on
             pattern deviation plot depressed below the 5% level, at least 1 of which is depressed
             below the 1% level; OR corrected pattern standard deviation/pattern standard deviation

             reliability indices (fixation losses, false-positive rate, and false-negative rate
             each &lt; 33%).

          -  Healthy subjects: normal optic nerve exam with normal and reliable visual fields
