    <textblock>
      Single sided deafness (SSD) refers to asymmetrical hearing loss, where there is a significant
      worsening of hearing in one ear compared to the other.

      In Cambridge, the investigators see large numbers of patients with SSD caused by vestibular
      schwannomas, due to their affiliation with the Neuro-Otology Department, with over 100 new
      SSD patients being referred every year.

      Only a small number of studies have explored hearing handicap for those with SSD, and music
      appreciation has not been investigated, to the best of the investigators knowledge, in this
      patient group.

      In the limited number of studies conducted on those with single sided deafness, often only
      one or two outcome measures have been used, or the patient group has been small. The
      investigators have a large group of patients with a wide range of aetiologies who have
      completed several questionnaires as part of their treatment in the single sided deafness
      clinic and the investigators would like to analyse these data.

      At present there are different devices available on the NHS for the management of SSD and
      many studies have explored benefits of Bone Anchored Hearing Aids (BAHA). There is an
      under-representation of studies looking specifically at CROS aid devices which is relevant
      given the cost differences involved between devices.

      Study goals and objectives

        -  To find out what factors drive hearing handicap in SSD patients by analysing the results
           of several different well validated hearing handicap questionnaires

        -  To find out whether or not it is possible to change hearing handicap in this patient
           group by looking to see if there is an improvement in questionnaire scores post
           treatment.

        -  The investigators will also look at a sub-group who will be fitted with both traditional
           wired CROS aids and more up-to-date wireless aids which have been funded through a
           research grant, in order to assess whether these are more beneficial.

        -  The investigators will use a new questionnaire developed in-house to further explore the
           impact of single sided deafness on music appreciation.

      SSD can lead to:

        -  Reduction in spatial hearing

        -  Significant difficulty in background noise and social situations

        -  Exhaustion from the extra effort required to hear

        -  Reduced confidence

        -  Reduced ability to enjoy music

        -  Isolation

        -  An emotional burden linked to the onset of the hearing loss and associated symptoms

      The investigators have established a specialised clinic to address the consequences of SSD,
      and assess treatment options including the provision of counselling and wired CROS
      (Contralateral Routing of Signal) hearing aids.

      The investigators use a range of questionnaires, completed pre and post treatment, to assess
      outcomes and would like to analyse this data to see what drives handicap and whether there is
      any observable improvement post treatment. The investigators would like to find out more
      about the impact of SSD on patients' ability to enjoy music and propose to do this using a
      questionnaire developed in-house.

      The investigators have been awarded a grant to fit some of their patients with wireless CROS
      aids, which are not routinely available under the NHS in Cambridge, but are widely available
      in other areas and in the commercial sector.

      The investigators will utilise retrospective data in the form of questionnaires completed by
      SSD patients attending the Audiology clinic between 2009 and 2012. Prospective data will also
      be collected and from existing SSD patients, to whom the investigators intend to post the
      music appreciation questionnaire, or ask them to complete in clinic.

      A prospective cross over design study will compare wired and wireless CROS hearing aids in 13
      new patients a cross-over design trial to investigate whether residual handicap and
      satisfaction are any better with these devices than with standard wired versions.
