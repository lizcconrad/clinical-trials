      Primary Objective:

      Measure the proportion of patients who develop binding and neutralizing antibodies in the
      blood after treatment with sargramostim following induction/reinduction chemotherapy.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Assess the time after treatment at which the antibodies develop and the level of
           antibodies is measured after the first dose.

        -  Measure the levels of immunoglobulin protein.

        -  Assess the impact of any immune response on safety and the duration of low white blood
           cell count.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The total study duration for a participant is up to 6 months from 1st dose of sargramostim or
      until the antibodies level return to baseline or up to 24 months if antibodies test is
      positive at month 6.
