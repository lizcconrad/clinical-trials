      One of the main success factors in acne therapy is user compliance with treatment, product
      cost, availability and ease of use. Poor compliance may translate into decreased efficacy
      (either not improving symptoms well enough or not improving symptoms fast enough),
      tolerability issues or adverse effects (eg, erythema, dryness, or peeling of the skin), a
      lack of understanding of the instructions for use, or product cost/availability. Whatever the
      reason, poor compliance translates to decreased efficacy and increased frustration on the
      part of the user.

      The current study will evaluate and compare the efficacy and tolerability of 2 over the
      counter, topical product lines for the treatment of acne: MAXCLARITY II Foam Cleanser (2.5%
      benzoyl peroxide [BPO]) plus Foam Treatment (2.5% BPO) and (0.5% Salicylic Acid) Toner Foam
      compared with MURAD Clarifying Cleanser (1.5% salicylic acid [SA]) plus Exfoliating Acne
      Treatment Gel (1% SA) and Skin Perfecting Lotion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acne vulgaris (acne) is an extremely common dermatological disease that is found typically in
      adolescence and young adulthood. Acne manifests with open and closed comedones (blackheads
      and whiteheads), papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts on the face, neck, and trunk. Acne can
      be treated with a variety of agents that are selected to address the pathogenic factors
      assumed to be responsible for the type and degree of manifested acne lesions. Monotherapy and
      combination therapy regimens are both useful. Topical agents are generally used as first-line
      therapy and include retinoids, antibiotic preparations (eg, erythromycin and clindamycin),
      benzoyl peroxide (BPO), alpha and beta hydroxy acids (eg, glycolic and salicylic acid [SA]
      preparations), and azelaic acid. Systemic therapies are initiated in patients with moderate
      to severe inflammatory acne that does not respond to topical therapy.

      Benzoyl peroxide has antimicrobial and anti inflammatory properties and is often considered
      an important component of acne treatment. Salicylic acid has comedolytic properties and is
      often used when other topical therapies are not tolerated. Benzoyl peroxide and SA are
      frequently the first products that adolescents will use for acne because both can be
      purchased without a prescription in several different concentrations and formulations.

      One of the main success factors in acne therapy is user compliance with treatment, product
      cost, availability and ease of use. Poor compliance may translate into decreased efficacy
      (either not improving symptoms well enough or not improving symptoms fast enough),
      tolerability issues or adverse effects (eg, erythema, dryness, or peeling of the skin), a
      lack of understanding of the instructions for use, or product cost/availability. Whatever the
      reason, poor compliance translates to decreased efficacy and increased frustration on the
      part of the user.

      The current study will evaluate and compare the efficacy and tolerability of 2 over the
      counter, topical product lines for the treatment of acne: MAXCLARITY II Foam Cleanser (2.5%
      benzoyl peroxide [BPO]) plus Foam Treatment (2.5% BPO) and (0.5% Salicylic Acid) Toner Foam
      compared with MURADClarifying Cleanser (1.5% salicylic acid [SA]) plus Exfoliating Acne
      Treatment Gel (1% SA) and Skin Perfecting Lotion.

      This is a randomized, single center, evaluator blinded, split face efficacy and tolerability
      study of MaxClarity II and Murad, 2 over the-counter, topical product lines for the treatment
      of acne. Approximately 20 subjects, aged from 16 to 29 years, inclusive, with mild facial
      acne are expected to participate in the study. No more than 50% of the subjects at each site
      can be enrolled under the age of 20.

      An expert grader (blinded evaluator) will complete counts of inflamed lesions
      (papules/pustules) and noninflamed lesions (open/closed comedones), the ISGA, and an
      assessment of tolerability of each side of the face at each study visit. Subjects will assess
      tolerability on each side of the face at each study visit and will complete a product
      acceptability and preference questionnaire at the end of the study.

      The study duration will be 8 weeks (56 days) with visits at baseline (day 1), week 1, week 2,
      week 4 and week 8. Only the expert grader (evaluator) will be blinded to the study product
      assignments; subjects and study nurses/coordinators will not be blinded.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>During each study visit, expert grader (blinded evaluator) assessed the left side and right side of the face as inflammatory (papules [solid elevation of skin with no visible fluid] and pustules [small inflamed elevation of the skin that is filled with pus]) and non-inflammatory (open [blackheads] and closed [whiteheads] comedones) and total lesions for each participant. Each type of lesion was counted separately; the lesion counts were taken from the face from hairline to the mandible (including forehead, cheeks, and chin). Total lesion counts were calculated as the sum of the inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. Percent change from Baseline to Week 8 was calculated as the value at Week 8 minus the value at Baseline divided by the Baseline value multiplied by 100. Baseline is defined as value at Day 1.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Capable of understanding and willing to provide signed and dated written voluntary
             informed consent (and any local or national authorization requirements) before any
             protocol specific procedures are performed.

          2. Male or female aged from 16 to 29 years, inclusive, at time of consent. No more than
             50% of the subjects at each site can be enrolled under the age of 20.

          3. Mild facial acne, characterized by at least 12 facial inflammatory lesions (papules
             and pustules) and/or noninflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) on each half
             of the face (excluding nose and front hairline areas).

          4. Able to complete the study and to comply with study instructions.

          5. Sexually active females of childbearing potential participating in the study must
             agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception while receiving
             protocol-assigned product. A woman of childbearing potential is defined as one who is
             biologically capable of becoming pregnant; including perimenopausal women who are less
             than 2 years from their last menses. Acceptable contraceptive methods include the
             following:

               -  Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectable, or implantable methods
                  started at least 2 months prior to screening. If hormonal contraception was
                  started less than 2 months prior to screening, then a form of nonhormonal
                  contraception should be added until the third continuous month of hormonal
                  contraception has been completed.

               -  Two forms of reliable nonhormonal contraception, to include the use of either an
                  intrauterine device plus a reliable barrier method or 2 reliable barrier methods.
                  Reliable barrier methods include condoms or diaphragms. A cervical cap is also a
                  reliable barrier method, provided that the female subject has never given birth
                  naturally. The combined use of a condom and spermicide constitute 2 forms of
                  acceptable nonhormonal contraception, provided that they are both used properly.
                  The use of spermicide alone and the improper use of condoms are inferior methods
                  of contraception. Subjects with surgical sterilization, including tubal
                  sterilization or partner's vasectomy, must use a form of nonhormonal
                  contraception. A barrier method or sterilization plus spermatocide is acceptable.

               -  Women who are not currently sexually active must agree to use a medically
                  accepted method of contraception should she become sexually active while
                  participating in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female who is pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or breast feeding.

          2. Has an active or chronic skin allergy.

          3. Has a history of acute or chronic disease that might interfere with or increase the
             risk of study participation.

          4. Had skin cancer treatment in preceding 12 months.

          5. Has damaged skin on facial areas (eg, sunburn, tattoo, or scar)

          6. Had any medical procedure (eg, laser resurfacing, chemical peel, or plastic surgery)
             on facial areas in preceding 12 months.

          7. Had any cosmetic procedure (eg, microdermabrasion) on facial areas within 8 weeks of
             the baseline visit.

          8. Has any dermatological disorder that in the opinion of the investigator may interfere
             with the accurate evaluation of the subject's facial appearance.

          9. Received any investigational drug or procedure within 28 days of the baseline visit.

         10. Currently using any medication that in the opinion of the investigator may affect the
             evaluation of the study products or place the subject at undue risk.

         11. Has a history of known or suspected intolerance to any of the ingredients of the study
             products (ie, benzoyl peroxide).

         12. Considered unable or unlikely to attend the necessary visits.

         13. Live in the same household as currently enrolled subjects.

         14. Employee of the investigator, a contract research organization, or Stiefel
             Laboratories who is involved in the study, or an immediate family member (partner,
             offspring, parents, siblings or sibling's offspring) of an employee involved in the
             study.

          <description>MaxClarity II was a 2.5 percent (%) benzoyl peroxide (BPO) foam cleanser and foam treatment, 0.5% salicylic acid (SA) toner foam. Murad clarifying cleanser was a 1.5% SA plus exfoliating acne treatment gel (1% SA) and skin perfecting lotion. Both treatments were applied topically to 1 side of face twice daily (BD) for 8 weeks. MaxClarity II application: Participants washed the assigned side of face with the foam cleanser, patted dry twice and then applied foam treatment in ante meridiem (AM) and toner foam in post meridiem (PM). Murad application: In first week of treatment, participants washed the assigned side of face with the clarifying cleanser, patted dry twice and applied acne treatment gel, then applied skin perfecting lotion in AM and skin perfecting lotion only in PM. During weeks 2-8, in AM and PM, participants washed assigned side of the face with clarifying cleanser, patted dry, applied acne treatment gel, then applied skin perfecting lotion.</description>

        <title>Mean Percent Change in Inflammatory, Non-inflammatory and Total Lesion Counts From Baseline to Week 8.</title>
        <description>During each study visit, expert grader (blinded evaluator) assessed the left side and right side of the face as inflammatory (papules [solid elevation of skin with no visible fluid] and pustules [small inflamed elevation of the skin that is filled with pus]) and non-inflammatory (open [blackheads] and closed [whiteheads] comedones) and total lesions for each participant. Each type of lesion was counted separately; the lesion counts were taken from the face from hairline to the mandible (including forehead, cheeks, and chin). Total lesion counts were calculated as the sum of the inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. Percent change from Baseline to Week 8 was calculated as the value at Week 8 minus the value at Baseline divided by the Baseline value multiplied by 100. Baseline is defined as value at Day 1.</description>
