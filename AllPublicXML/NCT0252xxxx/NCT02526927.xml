  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The occurrence of anorexia nervosa (AN) during childhood or adolescence rapidly induces
      starvation, stop of growth and impaired mineralization of bone tissue together with an
      interruption of pubertal development. These consequences are initially reversible following
      food intake return but can lead to a more irreversible status with low height, osteoporosis
      and high fracture risk. The onset of the disease more and more early in life, with the first
      stages of puberty suggest that these consequences will be even more severe as bone resistance
      will be damaged by more profound effects on bone growth as well. It is therefore critical to
      evaluate these bone metabolism alterations in order to better manage these patients.

      At every age and in every clinical circumstance either physiologic or pathologic, high
      resolution peripheral quantitative computerized tomography (HRpQCT) provides an evaluation of
      bone microarchitecture that is more informative than the global quantitative assessment given
      by conventional Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) DEXA, with a better estimate of clinical
      fracture risk.

      Here, we propose to measure cortical parameters, such as cortical thickness which plays a key
      role in bone biomechanical strength in young adults aged between 20 and 30 years-old, who had
      developed AN as early as the during the first stages of puberty but no longer present,
      compared to age-and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Other micro-architectural parameters will
      also be studied. In an exploratory phase, we will evaluate these bone microarchitectural
      parameters together with bone biological turnover markers and markers of sexual maturation in
      adolescents or young adults 20 years-old or less, undernourished and currently managed for
      AN.
