      1. Explore the efficacy of Ulinastatin use in improving post-operative pulmonary
           insufficiency and safety in pediatric patients undergoing scheduled CPB open heart
           surgery to treat Complex Congenital Heart Disease

        2. Explore the efficacy of Ulinastatin use in improving intraoperative hemodynamic
           instability as well as other post-operative organ recuperation and its impact on
           hospital stay &amp; cost

    <textblock>
      Pediatric patients diagnosed with Complex Congenital Heart Disease ready to accept scheduled
      open-heart surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

      This study uses randomized (centralized randomization) &amp; controlled design with open label.
      Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either study drug (Ulinastatin) or
      conventional treatment.
