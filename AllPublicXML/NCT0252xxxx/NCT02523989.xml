    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between arsenic methylation and
      blood metals in children with developmental delays and its correlation with health related
      quality of life.

      The investigators recruited children with developmental delays and children with normal
      development from Shin-Kong Ho-Su Memorial Hospital as controls. Information obtained from the
      interview included socioeconomic and basic demographic characteristics as well as children
      function, health condition, and quality of life. On the other hand, blood and urine samples
      of the participants were collected for the analysis of arsenic methylation related enzymes
      using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. 2 ml blood were
      digested for the determination of mercury, lead and arsenic. The relationship between arsenic
      methylation and blood metals in children with developmental delays and its correlation with
      health related quality of were analyzed.

      Blood and urine samples of participants were collected and urine used for the analysis of the
      arsenic species using high performance liquid chromatography linked hydride generator and
      atomic absorption spectrometry. Buffy coat were separated from plasma and extract DNA to
      analyze the genetic polymorphism of arsenic methylation related enzymes using polymerase
      chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. 2 ml blood were digested for the
      determination of mercury, lead and arsenic.
