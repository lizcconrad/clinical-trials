      The Born in Guangzhou Cohort Study (BIGCS) was established to investigate the short- and
      long-term effects of exposure in early life on health consequences in Guangzhou, China. Data
      are collected regarding environmental, occupational and lifestyle exposures as well as health
      outcomes in later life. Biological samples including blood and tissue samples are also
      collected from the participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past three decades, China is undergoing rapidly economic development. At the same
      time, the Western diet and urban lifestyle has been more common than before, which may lead
      to an increase of incidence of non-communicable chronic diseases, such as diabetes and
      malignancies. Notably, the current generation of Chinese adults, particularly those in their
      middle age or older, were born in an era where hardship and rationing was the norm and
      witnessed a social and epidemiological transition that might have a profound effect on their
      present health. In contrast, the younger generation is raised in relative material abundance,
      under the influence of traditional Chinese values such as a strong family orientation and an
      emphasis on academic success. A birth cohort with would provide an opportunity to examine the
      short- and long-term effects of exposure in early life on health consequences in this younger
      generation, in the context of rapid development in China.
