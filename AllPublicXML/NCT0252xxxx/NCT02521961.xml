    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies a support group program in improving quality of life
      in underserved urban Latina breast cancer survivors. A psychosocial support group program may
      help reduce distress and improve health-related quality of life in underserved urban Latina
      breast cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effect of the support program for Latina breast cancer survivors using
      validated measures of health-related quality of life.

      II. Evaluate the effect of the support program for Latina breast cancer survivors using
      validated measures of general distress.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. A brief qualitative assessment will evaluate the perception of the program among
      intervention participants using a brief survey.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants attend support group sessions over 1-1.5 hours once weekly for 10 weeks.
      The sessions include facilitated discussions among participants about the following topics:
      stress management and emotional coping strategies, nutrition and physical activity, sexuality
      and body image, medical advocacy, self-care and social support. Participants receive a binder
      in which the rationale for each topic, techniques learned, and activities completed during
      each session will be summarized and are shown a Chair-robics digital video disc (DVD).

      ARM II: Participants receive one phone call to arrange a follow-up with the promotora, a note
      acknowledging their participation in the study, and a community resource booklet.
      Participants are then yoked into one of the 3 intervention groups and asked to attend a 30
      minute session similar to Arm I.

    <description>Skewed data will be log transformed or other appropriate transformations performed as necessary. Simple associations between demographic variables and outcome variables will be conducted to determine the need for control variables. Significant pre- to post-intervention change in psychosocial outcomes will be analyzed using the repeated measures linear mixed model. All analyses will be two-tailed and held to a significance level of alpha = 0.05. Post-hoc analyses will otherwise be conducted as appropriate pending the outcome of the initial primary analyses.</description>
