    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a prospective, non-interventional, observational single arm study.
      Hundred-fifty patients over 18 with stable disease or at least partial response while on
      treatment with lenalidomide will be recruited from approximately 20 haematology/oncology
      sites in the Netherlands. Recruitment will continue until 150 patients have started the
      study. When this target is reached, all patients on lenalidomide will continue to be followed
      until the last patient has been followed for 36 months.

        Patients already successfully, i.e. with currently stable disease or meeting the criteria
        for complete response, very good partial response or partial response, on-treatment for
        maximally up to 6 cycles with lenalidomide at each site will be enrolled into the study. In
        all cases, the decision to treat the patient with lenalidomide was already made prior to
        the decision to enter the subject into the study.
