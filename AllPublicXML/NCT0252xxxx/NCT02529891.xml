  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exacerbations of the disease are a hallmark of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),
      affecting the decline of pulmonary function, quality of life and increasing morbidity. The
      use of validated biomarkers could help to identify the etiology of exacerbation and to
      prescribe antibiotherapy when indicated.

      The analysis of exhaled air allows measuring different volatile organic compounds (VOC) which
      reflect local or systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. The relationship between the
      presence of some of these compounds and the exacerbation of COPD has never been studied.

      The aim of this study is to identify a cluster of VOC in COPD patients during an acute
      exacerbation of the disease, compared to a stable condition (3 months after discharge).
      Investigators also will seek for a relationship between VOC and the etiology of exacerbation
      (bacterial, viral, inflammatory).
