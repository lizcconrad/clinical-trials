  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate how the liver is affected with regard to
      inflammation and fibrosis during Sofosbuvir based treatment regimes of chronic hepatitis C.

      In order to examine how the liver heals, we want to use blood samples to check for the
      occurrence of special liver inflammation cells (CD163 and CD206). To assess to which extent
      fibrosis disappear during treatment, we want to examine the liver with FibroScan (a type of
      ultrasound examination) and also preferably with extraction of a small tissue sample. We want
      to examine how the liver function as inflammation and scar tissue decrease, especially
      concerning the liver's ability to produce proteins. Furthermore, we want to examine with a
      gastroscopy, if the circulation of blood in the liver is improved after successful treatment
      with the expected result that potential varicose veins in the esophagus vanish.

    <description>All patients receiving Sofosbuvir based treatment regimes during the study period will be included in the study.
All patients will receive all interventions (galactose elimination capacity test, gastroscopy, fibroscan), except liver biopsy which the patients may decline to participate in without affecting the participation in the rest of the study. If varices are found during the gastroscopy a liver vein catheterization will be performed.</description>
