  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most effective medical procedures. Except for the
      few early complications (acute infections and dislocations), the patient made a PTH can be
      assured of a significant improvement in its function and its short-term quality of life.
      However, clinical studies and records have shown that the lifetime of these implants was
      limited. The main cause of failure is the &quot;aseptic loosening&quot; influenced by many factors,
      foremost of which is due to periprosthetic osteolysis debris. This is a major concern for
      orthopedic surgeons loosening leads, in most cases, the recovery, the importance of
      osteolysis is a major cause of difficulties and poorer results.

      The main objective of the study is to compare, 2 years after the intervention, the
      penetration of the femoral head in the polyethylene and X3 in the acetabulum in N2VAC®
      conventional polyethylene.
