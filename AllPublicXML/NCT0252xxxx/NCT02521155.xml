    <textblock>
      The purpose of the investigators' study is to assess effectiveness of community based oral
      health literacy intervention promoting positive oral hygiene self-care behavior among
      Montreal's Punjabi immigrants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 140 participants in this study who will be randomly allocated into either
      intervention group (70) or control group (70).The intervention group will receive one hour
      long &quot;Safeguard Your Smile&quot; intervention and control group will receive no intervention and
      only a conventional pamphlet. Data will be collected at baseline and after 3 months using
      three research instruments. i) Oral hygiene self-care knowledge and oral hygiene self-care
      behavior will be assessed using self administered questionnaire. ii) Using Loe and Sillness
      indices, plaque and gingival index scores will be measured. iii) And oral health literacy of
      participants will be measured with the TS-REALD tool.The data analysis will include
      descriptive statistics and frequency tables will be provided for both baseline and endpoint
      data of the both groups. Continuous variables will be summarized with mean, standard
      deviation and range and for the categorical variables; frequency counts and percentage of
      subjects within each category will be provided. An array of data analysis including t-test,
      correlations and logistic regression will be performed assessing effectiveness of the
      Safeguard Your Smile intervention.

    <description>Loe and Sillness plaque index on the six Ramfjord teeth (16, 12, 24, 36, 32, 44 on proximal, buccal and lingual sides). Score 0= no dental plaque seen in the gingival area; score 1= dental plaque present on the free gingival margin; score 2= moderate accumulation of dental plaque at the gingival margin seen by naked eye and score 3= abundant dental plaque in the gingival margin.</description>

    <measure>Oral health literacy measured using TS-REALD (Two Stage Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Dentistry)</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's oral health literacy levels will be measured using validated oral health literacy measurement instrument i.e. TS-REALD (Two Stage Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Dentistry). TS-REALD is a word recognition routing test in which participants are asked to read a list of 5 dental words aloud and one point is given for the correct answer. This first stage of the test categorizes the participants depending on their scores into three groups of stage 2 for further testing: i) low literacy stage-2 (4 words test); ii) average literacy stage-2 (6 words test); and high literacy stage-2 ( 3 words test).The score from routing test is added to stage-2 score and this is called raw score. This raw score is translated into a scaled score by using the scaled score translational table that had been derived using psychometric testing. Specific cut offs for high and low oral health literacy are determined using the mean and the standard deviation of the scaled scores.</description>

    <description>Safeguard Your Smile intervention will consist of following five components:
i) Reviewing photonovel (educational booklet) with participants to help them understand adequate oral hygiene self-care behavior. ii) Demonstrating adequate tooth brushing, flossing and tongue cleaning (frequency, duration and technique) on dentoform iii) Helping participants to make a concrete plan (specifying when where and how will they perform oral hygiene self-care behavior and a coping plan). Also, to identify a prompt/cue that would act as a reminder. iv) Assigning a task to participants to daily check-mark their behavioral progress on a calendar provided in the photonovel for the next three months. v) Follow up by making three phone calls to each participant of the intervention group once a month.</description>
