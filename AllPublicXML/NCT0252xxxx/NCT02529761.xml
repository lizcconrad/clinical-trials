  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter prospective nonrandomized study is to evaluate the efficacy of TACE combined
      with sorafenib compared with TACE monotherapy in term of overall survival in
      intermediate-stage HCC.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, has been successfully applied for solid tumors such as
      renal cancer and HCC.

      According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging classification, transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) has been recommended as a first line-therapy for patients at
      intermediate stage - BCLC B class (multinodular asymptomatic tumors without an invasive
      pattern).

      Because sorafenib may improve the efficacy of locoregional therapy by decreasing post-TACE
      angiogenesis, sorafenib in combination with TACE has attracted considerable attention as a
      promising therapy

    <description>The first treatment of TACE should be completed within 3-7 days after the administration of sorafenib started. In all cases, TACE consists of an injection containing a mixture of chemotherapeutic agents and lipiodol followed by embolization with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles until complete stasis was achieved in the tumor-feeding vessels.Tumor-feeding vessels should be selected/superselected whenever possible. TACE will be repeated &quot;on demand&quot; depending on the radiological response.</description>
