  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-natal depression (PND) is anticipated to affect 12.9% of new mothers with at least
      75,000 cases per year in the UK alone. However, despite this, there is currently a worrying
      lack of support for new mothers, with data suggesting that 64% of healthcare trusts in the UK
      do not have a strategy for treating postnatal depression, and flaws in the current
      pharmacological and psychological treatment models. Consequently, research into promising
      psychosocial interventions such as music is critical to developing new paradigms for treating
      postnatal depression.

      This project is an ambitious programme of research that investigates the effects of music on
      postnatal depression through two phases: a questionnaire study and an intervention study.
      This record is for the intervention study. The questionnaire study has a separate record. We
      are accepting host hospital sites for both.

      The study tests the effectiveness of singing interventions led by the Royal College of Music
      at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital as a psychosocial tool to reduce the occurrence and
      effects of postnatal depression. It triangulates psychological, physiological, and biological
      data in a randomised control design to provide a comprehensive insight into the
      intervention's effects in comparison to a more common psychosocial intervention for new
      mothers (play groups) and a control group of no psychosocial interventions. The study aims to
      recruit 50-80 women into each of the three interventions (150-240 total).

      The study will used a mixed-method methodology comprising validated psychological scales,
      in-depth qualitative interviews and observations and biomarker analysis. If results are
      promising, there are plans in place to scale the singing intervention to more hospitals and
      community settings.

      Phase B will be open to NHS sites within the region of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital
      London from which women could travel to the sessions to take part.
