      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the MANTA Vascular
      Closure Device (VCD) to close the arteriotomy following percutaneous cardiovascular
      procedures utilizing large bore sheaths for purposes of supporting a CE Mark (Conformite
      Europeenne--&quot;European Conformity&quot;) and other regulatory submissions. The study will assess
      whether the MANTA VCD is safe and performs as intended for large-bore vascular closure after
      interventional procedures.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of MANTA in achieving
      hemostasis in femoral arterial access sites in patients undergoing percutaneous transcatheter
      interventional procedures using a 10-18F procedure sheath (such as Transcather Aortic Valve
      Replacement (TAVR), Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty (BAV) and Endovascular Aneurysm Repair
      (EVAR)) for purposes of obtaining a CE Mark in the European Union.

      The study will evaluate hemostasis success, time to hemostasis and ambulation, treatment
      success, and the rate of access-site-related complications in comparison to published
      literature on other hemostasis techniques for closing these large bore punctures (primarily,
      surgical closure and suture-mediated percutaneous closure.
