      A phase 2, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamic activity of titrating-dose lonafarnib in combination with ritonavir in
      patients chronically infected with hepatitis delta virus
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study of 24 weeks of treatment with a dose-titration regimen of
      lonafarnib/ritonavir in up to 15 patients chronically infected with HDV: lonafarnib starting
      at 50 mg bid in combination with ritonavir (100 mg bid) and escalating lonafarnib as
      tolerated.

      The duration of the study for each patient is approximately 13 months (up to 4 weeks for
      screening, 24 weeks of treatment, 4 weeks for the primary follow-up visit, and monthly safety
      follow-up visits for 5 months thereafter). The 6-month follow-up after the last dose of study
      drug is designed to allow evaluation of the clinical and virologic course after completion of
      the 24-week Treatment Period.
