  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Wellbeing in Pregnancy (WiP) project is an online pilot randomized controlled trial which
      aims to evaluate an intervention to improve women's emotional wellbeing in pregnancy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that mental health problems affect 10-20% of postnatal women. Many of these
      women do not seek help for their mental health for numerous reasons, including lack of
      awareness about symptoms, available treatments, and stigma. The Wellbeing Plan is a brief
      self-help leaflet developed by experts in perinatal mental health, and is designed to improve
      emotional wellbeing of women during and after pregnancy by providing information, raising
      awareness, helping a woman identify her own symptoms, provide coping strategies, and identify
      key people who can support the woman during this time. The Wellbeing in Pregnancy project is
      a online pilot randomized controlled trial which aims to evaluate the efficacy of the
      Wellbeing Plan in improving women's emotional wellbeing in pregnancy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in knowledge and beliefs about perinatal mental health from baseline at 1 month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge and beliefs about perinatal mental health will be measured using a 12-item self-report questionnaire scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 = Strongly agree to 5 = Strongly disagree. It has been developed in consultation with the research team and with a parental advisory group. It will explore women's knowledge and beliefs about perinatal mental health problems, including perceived stigma, incidence of psychological distress in the perinatal period, as well as knowledge and beliefs regarding sources of potential support for women.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in mood from baseline at 1 month</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Small changes in mood will be examined using the UWIST Mood Adjective Checklist (UMACL; Mathews, Jones &amp; Chamberlain, 1990). The UMACL includes 24 mood adjectives. Participants indicate whether each adjective relates to their current mood on a 4-point scale with higher scores indicating stronger mood. It has 3 subscales of tense arousal (8 items), energetic arousal (8 items) and hedonic tone (8 items), which have been confirmed by factor analysis. For this study, the items relating to energetic arousal will be omitted, as energy levels will be affected by the late pregnancy stage/early postpartum period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in mood from baseline at 6 weeks postpartum</measure>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived support will be measured using the Maternity Social Support Scale (MSSS) (Webster et al, 2000). The MSSS is a 6-item self-report questionnaire rated on a 5-point Likert scale which measures perceived social support in the prenatal period. It examines the woman's relationship with her partner, exploring the nature of the relationship, in addition to perceived support from family and friends.</description>
