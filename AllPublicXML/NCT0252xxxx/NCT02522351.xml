      The aim of the trial is to identify any systematic effect of cohesiveness on the efficacy of
      swallowing in patients having dysphagia problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will be a double blind, randomized, crossover, controlled, and interventional
      trial. Each subject will test 6 study samples in a randomized order at 5 mL of volume first
      then at 10 mL (12 samples maximum). The trial will last a maximum of one hour (a single study
      visit).

      The total sample size is 47 enrolled subjects, 33 subjects completed. Patients will be
      females and males aged between 18 and 85 years with mild proven dysphagia.
