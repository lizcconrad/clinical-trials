  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) is a rare, severely disabling disease
      characterized by painful, recurrent episodes of soft tissue swelling (flare-ups) that result
      in abnormal bone formation (heterotopic ossification or HO) in muscles, tendons, and
      ligaments. Flare-ups begin early in life and may occur spontaneously or after soft tissue
      trauma, vaccinations, or influenza infections. Recurrent flare-ups progressively restrict
      movement by locking joints leading to cumulative loss of function and disability. Mouse
      models of FOP have demonstrated the ability of retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ) agonists
      such as palovarotene to prevent HO following injury. This 36-month study will evaluate the
      long-term safety and efficacy of episodic treatment with palovarotene for flare-ups in FOP
      subjects who successfully complete two flare-up treatment periods (6 weeks duration) and two
      follow-up periods (6 weeks duration) in Study PVO-1A-202.

      The objectives of this Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, single-arm study are:

        -  To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of prior palovarotene treatment over 36
           months in FOP subjects who completed Study PVO-1A-202

        -  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of palovarotene in FOP subjects experiencing new,
           distinct flare-ups during the 36-month follow-up period.

      The follow-up portion of the study will consist of a Screening visit that will correspond to
      the last day (Study Day 84) of Study PVO-1A-202 and bi-annual assessments at Months 6, 12,
      18, 24, 30, and 36.

      Subjects experiencing a new, distinct flare-up during the 36-month follow-up will be
      evaluated and if eligible, receive palovarotene at the weight-adjusted equivalent of 10 mg
      for 14 days followed by 5 mg for at least 28 days. Any subject who received a lower dosing
      regimen due to tolerability issues during Study PVO-1A-202 will receive that tolerated dose.

      For each flare-up there will be two periods:

        1. A Screening period to occur within 7 days of the start of a new, distinct flare-up. The
           first dose of palovarotene will be taken within 10 days of the flare-up onset to allow
           for shipment of study medication to the subject's home.

        2. A treatment period of at least 6 weeks duration. Subjects experiencing a new, distinct
           flare-up will be evaluated

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        For study enrollment

          -  Completed Study PVO-1A-202 having been treated with palovarotene (ie, 6 weeks
             on-treatment and 6-weeks follow-up) for two flare-ups.

          -  Written, signed, and dated informed consent or age-appropriate subject/parent assent
             (this must be performed according to local regulations).

        For treatment with palovarotene for subsequent flare-ups

          -  Symptomatic onset of a new, distinct flare-up within 10 days of the first dose of
             study drug. Symptoms must be reported by the subject, be consistent with their
             previous flare-ups, and include a subject‑reported onset date. The flare-up must be
             confirmed by the physician at screening via telephone contact and/or
             video-conferencing.

          -  Females of child-bearing potential (FOCBP) must have a negative blood (or urine)
             pregnancy test (with sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL) prior to administration of
             palovarotene. Male and FOCBP subjects must agree to remain abstinent during treatment
             and for 1 month after treatment or, if sexually active, to use two highly effective
             methods of birth control during and for 1 month after treatment. Additionally,
             sexually active FOCBP subjects must already be using two highly effective methods of
             birth control 1 month before treatment is to start. Specific risk of the use of
             retinoids during pregnancy, and the agreement to remain abstinent or use two highly
             effective methods of birth control will be clearly defined in the informed consent,
             and the subject or legally authorized representatives (eg, parents, caregivers, or
             legal guardians) must specifically sign this section.

          -  Subjects must be accessible for treatment with palovarotene and follow-up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For study enrollment

          -  Any reason that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would lead to the inability of
             the subject and/or family to comply with the protocol.

        For treatment with palovarotene for subsequent flare-ups:

          -  Weight &lt;20 kg.

          -  The flare-up is at a completely ankylosed joint.

          -  Intercurrent non-healed fracture at any location.

          -  If currently using vitamin A or beta carotene, multivitamins containing vitamin A or
             beta carotene, or herbal preparations, fish oil, and unable or unwilling to
             discontinue use of these products during palovarotene treatment.

          -  Exposure to synthetic oral retinoids in the past 30 days prior to screening (signature
             of the informed consent or age-appropriate subject assent).

          -  Concurrent treatment with tetracycline or any tetracycline derivatives due to the
             potential increased risk of pseudotumor cerebri

          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity to retinoids or lactose.

          -  Female subjects who are breastfeeding.

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled cardiovascular, hepatic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal,
             endocrine, metabolic, ophthalmologic, immunologic, psychiatric, clinically significant
             abnormal laboratory findings, or other significant disease.

          -  Simultaneous participation in another interventional clinical research study within
             the past 4 weeks (except for Study PVO-1A-202).

          -  Subjects experiencing suicidal ideation (type 4 or 5) or any suicidal behavior within
             the past month prior to Screening as defined by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating
             Scale.

          -  Any reason that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would lead to the inability of
             the subject and/or family to comply with the protocol.
