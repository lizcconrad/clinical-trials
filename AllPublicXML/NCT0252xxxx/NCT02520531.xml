  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-centre, prospective, randomized comparative study to compare the maximum flexion and
      Chair Raise achievement ratios of the Scorpio PS and and the Scorpio NRG PS. Documentation of
      all complications.

      Surveillance design: Single-centre, prospective, randomized comparative study. Objectives: To
      compare the maximum flexion (active and passive) and Chair Raise achievement ratios. All
      complications will be documented.

      Number of subjects to be enrolled: All consecutive Scorpio patients are included until a
      group size of 88 is reached.

      Clinical evaluations: Chair raise test, Stair climb test, Western Ontario McMaster
      Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) patient self evaluation, EuroQuol - 5 dimension (EQ-5D) patient
      questionnaire. Standard clinical, functional and pain parameters (Knee Society Score),
      pre-operatively and post-operatively. All per- and post-op complications.

    <measure>Knee Society Score (KSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative, 6, 12, 26 weeks and 1, 2 and 5 years follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee Society Clinical Rating System is comprised of two distinct sub-scores: one for pain, range of motion (ROM) and joint stability, and one for functional parameters. Sub-scores range from a potential minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 100 points. Although the specific scores are not distinguished as &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;fair,&quot; or &quot;poor,&quot; a higher value represents a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Chair Raise Test</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative, 6, 12, 26 weeks and 1, 2 and 5 years follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>A measurement to assess functional lower extremity strength. The participant is seated on a chair. Arms are crossed at the wrists and held against the chest. The participant is instructed to complete as many full stands as possible within 30 seconds and to fully sit between each stand. The number of stands a person can complete in 30 seconds is recorded. The levels are 0 for those who can not complete 1 stand up to the number of full stands within 30 seconds.</description>

    <measure>WOMAC patient questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-operative, 12, 26 weeks and 1, 2 and 5 years follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC collects information specific to osteoarthritis outcomes. The questionnaire uses a visual analog scale for pain, measuring factors of general pain, stiffness, and physical findings. Pain is scored from 0 to 100 for each set of factors, with 0 indicating no pain and 100 indicating extreme pain. Total WOMAC scores range from 0 to 300. Lower values represent better outcomes.</description>
