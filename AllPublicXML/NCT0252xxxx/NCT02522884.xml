      This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, non-blinded study designed to investigate
      the safety and efficacy of the Tack Endovascular System in subjects with post-balloon
      angioplasty (post-PTA) dissection(s) type(s) A through F in the superficial femoral and
      proximal popliteal arteries ranging in diameter from 2.5mm to 6.0mm.
