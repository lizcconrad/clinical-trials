    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve IV-Patient Controlled Analgesia (IV-PCA) technique
      for postoperative analgesia. Investigators are comparing between patient re-education and the
      background morphine infusion among patients who fail to achieve satisfactory analgesia using
      IV-PCA Morphine after laparotomy.

      In this study, investigators have a second inclusion criteria for subject recruitment. For
      subjects who meet this criteria meaning their dynamic pain (when blowing incentive
      spirometer) is ≥ 4/10 after starting on IV-PCA Morphine will be randomized in to 2 groups.
      One group will receive patient re-‐education with an additional background morphine infusion
      and the other group will receive re-‐education only.

      The second highlight for this study is regarding the background morphine calculation. The
      background morphine is calculated according to this formula:

      Total morphine requirement in the first 24 hours post surgery (mg) = 100 - Age (year) So, the
      background morphine infusion will be calculated based on subject's age and half of their 24
      hours requirement will be infused over 24 hours.

      This formula was published by Pamela Macintyre in her paper titled &quot; Age is the Best
      Predictor of Postoperative Morphine Requirement&quot;.

    <description>Investigators use the formula that was published by Pamela Macintyre in her paper entitled &quot;Age is the Best Predictor of Postoperative Morphine Requirements.&quot; The estimation for the first 24-hour morphine requirement after surgery is calculated as: 100 - age (year).
So, half of the total 24-hour morphine requirement will be infused over 24 hours.
e.g. background morphine infusion= (100-Age)/ 2/ 24 (mg/hour)</description>
