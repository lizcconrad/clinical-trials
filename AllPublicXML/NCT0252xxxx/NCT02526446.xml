    <textblock>
      This proposed study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-administered acupressure
      intervention on caregiver stress and associated distress symptoms of fatigue, insomnia and
      depression in Chinese family caregivers of an elderly family member.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Taking care of an elderly family member can be stressful and family caregivers are at risk
      for emotional, mental and physical health problems arising from caregiver stress. Although a
      variety of psychosocial and pharmacological strategies have been developed to reduce
      caregiver stress, the efficacy in mitigating caregiver distress is modest. Acupressure, a
      non-invasive technique of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) by applying pressure on
      acupoints, has been successfully used for management of multiple symptoms without adverse
      effects. Thus, this study using a randomized, wait-list controlled trial is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of self-administered acupressure intervention on caregiver stress and
      associated distress symptoms of fatigue, insomnia or depression. A total of 200 Chinese
      family caregivers with caregiver stress and stress related symptoms of fatigue, insomnia or
      depression will be recruited from a community setting in Hong Kong and randomized to receive
      either a self-administered acupressure intervention or wait-list condition. The
      self-administered acupressure intervention will comprise (i) 5-hr individual learning and
      training session in the first 2 weeks, (ii) 2-hr home-visit reinforcement during 3rd and 4th
      week, and (iii) a total of 21-hr self-practice at home over 6 weeks. It is hypothesized that
      the family caregivers in the intervention group will have, upon completion of the program,
      lower levels of caregiver stress, lower scores of fatigue, insomnia, and depression with
      improved health-related quality of life as compared with that in the wait-list control group.
