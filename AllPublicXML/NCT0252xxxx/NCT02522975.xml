  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to comprehensively establish the biosimilarity/bioquivalence in EPIAO®
      and EPREX® in terms of 52-week comparisons in efficacy,safety and immunogenicity.The targeted
      population is anaemia patients with chronic renal disease who are naive to epoetin treatment
      and not yet on haemodialysis.

      This is a prospective, randomized, double blind, parallel group two arm study to establish
      the therapeutic equivalence, safety and tolerability of EPIAO® as compared to EPREX® in the
      treatment of CKD related anaemia in subjects who are not yet on dialysis (pre-dialysis). A
      total of 96 subjects will be randomized into two groups in a 1:1ratio. Treatment arm A will
      receive EPIAO® once a week, subcutaneously for period of 52 weeks and treatment arm B will
      receive EPREX, weight once a week, subcutaneously for period of 52 weeks.

    <description>Recombinant human erythropoietin falls under the pharmacological class of haematopoietic / anti anaemic agents. It has been developed for the treatment of anaemia in subjects with chronic kidney disease.
Erythropoietin, also known as EPO, is a glycoprotein hormone that controls erythropoiesis, or RBC production. It is a cytokine (protein signalling molecule) for erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow. Human EPO has a molecular weight of 34,000.</description>
