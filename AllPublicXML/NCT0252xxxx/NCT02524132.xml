  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research project, the investigators addressed if incorporating physical movements
      with preschoolers will help increase their ability to retain concepts learned in preschool
      such as letter, sound and number recognition. Movement plays an important role in the brain.
      Exercise shows many benefits for the brain to help maintain clearer thought, improve memory,
      and increase activity in the brain, especially the areas involved in memory, attention, and
      language. The following research includes an eight week study of the implementation of
      movement breaks with one preschool class, while using another class as a control group.
      During the two weeks of baseline data, data was collected from every student in both groups
      on their letter recognition with both upper and lower case, letter sound identification, and
      number recognition for numbers 0-10. The group that implemented movement breaks had
      three-five minute scheduled times to stop for movement. Data was collected and compared
      between the two groups to find differences in their academic performance.
