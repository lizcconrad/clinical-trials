      The purpose of this study is determine whether the combination therapy with LEE011 and
      chemoembolization in patients with locally advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma not amenable to
      curative therapies will provide greater efficacy than chemoembolization alone with a
      tolerable safety profile.

      Single-arm, single-institution, non-randomized, open-label phase II study to determine the
      efficacy and safety of treatment with LEE011 and chemoembolization in patients with advanced
      HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma) not amenable to curative therapies. A total of 40 patients
      will be enrolled and undergo chemoembolization. Patients will receive LEE011 (600 mg PO once
      daily, 3 weeks on/1 week off) on Day 1 with chemoembolization. Patients can receive a total
      of 4 chemoembolization treatments within 6 month following first treatment as needed to treat
      initial HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma) lesion.

      Progression free survival will be based on tumor assessment using RECIST 1.1 criteria
      (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) Patients will receive trial treatment until
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation from the study treatment
      for any other reason. Patients will be followed for survival regardless of treatment
      discontinuation for any reason.

      The study will include men and women with locally advanced HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma) not
      amenable to curative therapy who have received no prior therapy for advanced disease.

      Investigational Therapy:

      LEE011 oral (3 weeks on/1 week off) in combination with chemoembolization.

      Efficacy Assessments:

        1. Dynamic contrasted abdominal computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging will be
           done at baseline, every 8 weeks, and every 3 months thereafter following initial
           chemoembolization.

        2. Chest CT imaging as clinically indicated

        3. Survival status every 12 months (or earlier if required) regardless of treatment
           discontinuation reason

      Data Analysis:

      The primary endpoint of the trial will be progression free survival (PFS) of HCC patients.
      PFS is defined to be the time from initiation of treatment to progression or death without
      evidence of progression. For cases without documentation of progression, follow-up will be
      censored at the date of last disease assessment without progression, unless death occurs
      within 4 months following the date of last progression-free, in which case death will be
      counted as an event. The historical median PFS for TACE (Transcatheter arterial
      chemoembolization) alone is 8-10 months. This study will target a hazard ratio of 0.69 with
      an 80% power and a one-sided significance level of 10%. Assuming a 24-month accrual and an
      18-month follow-up period the study requires 38 patients initiating LEE011 treatment with the
      median PFS for TACE alone is 8 months, and 41 patients with the median PFS for
      TACE(Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization) alone is 10 months. PFS will be estimated
      using the Kaplan-Meier method, and Greenwood's formula will be used to calculate the standard
      error of the corresponding Kaplan-Meier estimate and 95% confidence interval. Survival curves
      will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology.

      Secondary endpoints of efficacy are to evaluate OS (Overall Survival). The statistical
      methods used for the analysis of PFS will be used for the analysis of OS.

      Other secondary objectives will include description of toxicity of the therapy regimen. These
      data will be analyzed separately. The safety analyses will be performed on all patients who
      receive any dose of therapy. Adverse events will be described using the NCI CTCAE v 4.03
      criteria (ctep.cancer.gov/forms.CTCAEv4.pdf). Frequency and severity of adverse events
      according to the NCI CTCAE ) v 4.03 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) body
      system and severity criteria will be described. In addition, frequency of Grade 3 or 4
      adverse events will be described separately. Causality will also be noted. Adverse events
      will be recorded for up to 1 year following discontinuation from study. Response rate and
      toxicity rate will be estimated using an exact binomial method along with the 95% confidence
      interval

         38. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             throughout the study and for 8 weeks after study drug discontinuation. Highly effected
             contraception methods include:

         39. Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception

         40. Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In
             case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
             confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

         41. Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on the
             study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.

         42. Combination of any of the two following (a+b or a+c or b+c) 43A-Use of oral, injected
             or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of hormonal
             contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone
             vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception; 45 B-Placement of an intrauterine
             device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); 45 C-Barrier methods of contraception:
             Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal
             foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository in case of use of oral contraception, women
             should have been stable on the same pill before taking study treatment.

        Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a barrier
        method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction. Women are
        considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of
        natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
        appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
        (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of
        oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by
        follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

        46-Sexually active males, unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the
        drug, and for 21 days after stopping treatment of LEE011 -- should not father a child in
        this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized male in order to prevent
        delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.
