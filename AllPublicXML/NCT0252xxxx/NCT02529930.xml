      This is an exploratory, open, prospective multi-centre study of VB10.16 immunotherapy in
      patients with high grade HPV16+ Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (HSIL; CIN2/3). This study
      will recruit approximately 27-40 female patients with high grade cervical intraepithelial
      neoplasia (HSIL, CIN 2/3) at multiple sites in Europe.

      The study will be divided into two phases, a dosing and expansion phase.

      During the dosing phase the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 2 different
      vaccination schedules of 3 mg VB10.16 immunotherapy will be established in a minimum of 12
      patients with histology confirmed CIN 2.

      During the expansion phase the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the selected
      vaccination schedule will be evaluated in approximately 15 to 20 patients with histology
      confirmed HPV16+ CIN 2/3.
