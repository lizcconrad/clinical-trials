          5. Patients must have previously received one platinum-based chemotherapy regimen for
             palliative therapy of locally advanced or metastatic disease. Patients are also
             eligible if they have received one platinum-based chemotherapy regimen as neoadjuvant
             or adjuvant chemotherapy and the disease recurred within six months since the
             finishing of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy.

          6. Without EGFR mutations.

          7. At least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST criteria.

          8. ECOG PS0 - 2.

          9. Adequate organ function including the following:

               -  bone marrow;

               -  hepatic;

               -  renal.

         10. Prior chemotherapy must be completed at least 3 weeks prior to the study enrollment,
             and the patient must have recovered from the toxic effects of the treatment (except
             for alopecia).

         11. Previous palliative radiation therapy is allowed, but limited in LESS 25% of the bone
             marrow and must not have included whole pelvis radiation. Patients must have recovered
             from the toxic effects of the treatment prior to study enrollment (except for
             alopecia). Prior radiotherapy must be completed one month before study entry.
             Radiotherapy should not be administered to target lesions selected for this study,
             unless progression of the selected target lesions within the radiation portal is
             documented.

         12. Estimated life expectancy of at least 8 weeks.

         13. For women:

               -  must be surgically sterile;

               -  postmenopausal; OR

               -  compliant with a medically approved contraceptive regimen during and for 3 months
                  after the treatment period; must have negative serum or urine pregnancy test and
                  must not be lactating.

         14. For men:

               -  must be surgically sterile; OR

               -  compliant with a contraceptive regimen during and for 3 months after the
                  treatment period.

         15. Patient compliance and geographic proximity that allow adequate follow-up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have received treatment within the last 30 days with a drug that has not received
             regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry or concurrent
             administration of any other anti-tumor therapy.

          2. Have previously participated in a study involving pemetrexed or EGFR-TKI

          3. Hypersensitivity to pemetrexed or gefitinib or any ingredients in the two drugs.

          4. Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases and asymptomatic CNS metastases
             requiring concurrent corticosteroid therapy. Treated stable CNS metastases are
             allowed; the patient must be stable after radiotherapy for more than 2 weeks and off
             of corticosteroids for more than 1 week. .

          5. History of another malignancy within the last 5 years except cured carcinoma in-situ
             of uterine cervix, cured basal cell carcinoma of skin and superficial bladder tumors

          6. Lack of physical integrity of the upper gastrointestinal tract, or malabsorption
             syndrome, or inability to take oral medication, or have active peptic ulcer disease.

          7. Patients with interstitial lung disease.

          8. Any unstable systemic disease (including active infection, hepatic, renal or metabolic
             disease) or serious concomitant disorders that would compromise the safety of the
             patient, or compromise the patient's ability to complete the study, at the discretion
             of the investigator.

          9. Significant cardiovascular event: congestive heart failure &gt;NYHA class 2; unstable
             angina, active CAD (myocardial infarction more than 1 year prior to study entry is

             or digoxin are permitted) or uncontrolled hypertension.

         10. History of significant neurological or mental disorder, including seizures or
             dementia.

             naproxen, piroxicam, diflunisal, nabumetone, rofecoxib, or celecoxib) it should not be
             taken 5 days before, the day of, and 2 days after the dose of pemetrexed.

         15. Presence of clinically detectable (by physical exam) third-space fluid collections,
             for example, ascites or pleural effusions that cannot be controlled by drainage or
             other procedures prior to study entry.

         16. Inability or unwillingness to take folic acid, vitamin B12 supplementation, or
