      RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of blood from patients with cancer to study in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about cancer and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at biomarkers of angiogenesis and disease in
      patients with unresectable malignant mesothelioma treated on clinical trial CALGB-30107.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine if elevated levels of thrombospondin I serum levels, vascular endothelial
           growth factor receptor I, fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor, and
           mesothelin portend a poor prognosis in patients with unresectable malignant mesothelioma
           treated with vatalanib on protocol CALGB-30107.

        -  Determine if elevated levels of thrombospondin I serum levels, vascular endothelial
           growth factor receptor I, fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor, and
           mesothelin correlate with response or stable disease in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Serum samples previously obtained from patients on protocol CALGB-30107 are tested
      for levels of thrombospondin I serum, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor I,
      fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor, and mesothelin using enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assays (ELISA).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 47 specimens will be accrued for this study.
