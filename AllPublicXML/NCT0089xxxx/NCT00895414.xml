      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Enalapril maleate may help protect heart cells from the side effects of
      chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether giving enalapril maleate before or after
      doxorubicin hydrochloride is more effective in treating women with breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying giving enalapril maleate together with
      doxorubicin hydrochloride to see how well it works in treating women with breast cancer.

      This study is a drug interaction study designed to study the effects of enalapril on
      doxorubicin metabolism. Women with breast cancer for whom at least two cycles every 14 day
      doxorubicin is planned will be considered for enrollment. Study participation will be for 2
      treatment cycles of doxorubicin or approximately 4 weeks. Patients will receive a 14 day
      course of daily enalapril in association with one cycle of doxorubicin and receive no study
      agent during the other cycle allowing patients to act as their own control. The sequence of
      enalapril dosing will be assigned by randomization at study enrollment. Blood samples for
      pharmacokinetics will be drawn before and at 7 time points after each of the two doses of
      doxorubicin. For each patient, serum doxorubicin and doxorubicinol concentrations both on and
      off of enalapril will be compared.

    <measure>Increase or decrease in doxorubicin hydrochloride exposure</measure>

    <description>Doxorubicin plasma concentration (DPC) will be the primary pharmacokinetic (PK) measure of the exposure. Each patient will have PK performed twice - once with enalapril and once without enalapril. An increase of more than 115 ng/ml in DPC will be considered important.</description>

    <time_frame>Before and After Treatment with Doxorubicin with and without Enalapril</time_frame>
    <description>Doxorubicin can induce changes in troponin, b-type natriuretic peptide and urine microalbumin. This analysis will determine whether enalapril prevents any of these changes.</description>

    <description>Doxorubicin is metabolized to doxorubicinol. The efeects of enalapril on doxorubicinol will be assessed.</description>
