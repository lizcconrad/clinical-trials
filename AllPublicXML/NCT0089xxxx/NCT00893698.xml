      The aim of the study is to realize a bilateral transplantation of upper limbs. The first
      objective is functional but there are aesthetic and psychologic imperatives too. This open
      and descriptive study needs compatible donor and recipient. The sample should be realized
      simultaneously and the transplantation should be made by two coordinated teams according to
      this sequence : osteosynthesis, vascular anastomosis, sutures of tendons and nervous sutures.
      An immunosuppressant treatment should be initialized from the beginning of the intervention
      and continued for life. Rejections should be screened by regular clinical and histological
      examinations.
