  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lipodystrophies represent a therapeutic challenge with regards to insulin resistance,
      hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver which often is coupled with significant adipose tissue
      loss. The purpose of the study is to examine the safety and efficacy of Leptin on subjects
      with lipodystrophy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mechanism by which leptin improves glucose and lipid control is not clear. We will
      examine the possible mechanisms of leptin action by studying the effects of leptin
      administration on food intake, insulin resistance, insulin secretory response, hepatic and
      intramuscular triglyceride stores in a large sample of patients with lipodystrophy.

      Hypothesis: Leptin replacement in patients with generalized and partial lipodystrophy and
      hypoleptinemia will be safe and efficacious in improving the metabolic abnormalities
      associated with insulin resistance.
