    <textblock>
      This study will assess the repeatability of Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) in both
      healthy volunteers and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-infected patients with fibrosis and lay the
      groundwork for the validation of MRE as an alternative to liver biopsy.

    <measure>Repeated Maximum Liver Elastic Stiffness (Kilopascal [kPa]) Measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Reader evaluated 4 sections of the liver at 4 different time points and the end result was a single region of interest (ROI) that could be measured in the registered elastograms at each of the time points. Stiffness measures obtained using the &quot;Individual ROI&quot; (average of the 4 individual ROI's selected by the reader, one for each slice of liver) and &quot;Common ROI&quot; (intersection (or area of common overlap) of the 4 individual ROI's) analysis methods were compared. The mean was the overall mean of the data and the standard deviation was the within participant standard deviation.</description>

        <description>Reader evaluated 4 sections of the liver at 4 different time points and the end result was a single ROI that could be measured in the registered elastograms at each of the time points. Stiffness measures obtained using the &quot;Individual ROI&quot; (average of the 4 individual ROI's selected by the reader, one for each slice of liver) and &quot;Common ROI&quot; (intersection (or area of common overlap) of the 4 individual ROI's) analysis methods were compared. The mean was the overall mean of the data and the standard deviation was the within participant standard deviation.</description>
