  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the Silent™ hip, when used as part of an
      artificial hip joint, is stable and effective in treatment of patients with joint disease
      requiring a total hip replacement. Patients who enter the study will be evaluated at regular
      intervals following hip surgery using patient, clinical, standard and special x-rays (RSA) to
      allow the position of the Silent Hip within the bone to be accurately monitored.

      The Primary Objective of this study was to evaluate the short-term stability of the Silent
      Hip, implanted using a manual or navigated technique, using radiostereometric analysis (RSA).
      The study was also intended to provide the clinical data necessary to demonstrate conformance
      with the essential requirements of the Medical Device Directive. Secondary objectives were to
      determine the efficacy of the Silent™ Hip femoral prosthesis from a clinical and radiological
      prospective, to assess the safety of the device and to evaluate the impact of the procedure
      on the Subjects' Quality of Life.

          1. Male or female subjects, aged between 25 and 65 years inclusive.

             this investigation and from whom consent has been obtained.

          3. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are able to understand this
             investigation, co-operate with the investigational procedures and are willing to
             return to the hospital for all the required post-operative follow-ups.

          3. Subjects who are known drug or alcohol abusers or with psychological disorders that

          6. Subjects who have osteonecrosis of the femoral neck

          7. Subjects who have an existing contralateral hip, ankle or knee replacement or an
             ipsilateral knee or ankle replacement or any metal implant in the lower lumber spine
             (navigated cases only).

          8. Subjects who are greater than 90kg in weight.

          9. Subject who have a CCD angle of the anatomical femur less than 125˚

         10. Subjects with significant bone loss or gross deformity in the region of the neck of
             the femur as identified on the pre-operative radiographs, where in the Investigator's
             opinion, there could be considerable migration of the prosthesis or a significant
             chance of fracture of the femoral shaft and/or the lack of adequate bone to support
             the prosthesis.

         11. Subjects with a Charnley C classification.

         12. Subjects with an active local or systemic infection.

         13. Subjects with loss of musculature, neuromuscular compromise or vascular deficiency in
             the affected limb rendering the arthroplasty procedure unjustified.

         14. Subjects with Paget's disease

         15. Subjects who still plan in the future to have children.
