      RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of blood and tissue from patients undergoing
      colonoscopy to study in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about colon cancer and
      identify biomarkers related to colon cancer in the future.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is collecting blood and tissue samples for future colon cancer
      biomarker studies in patients undergoing colonoscopy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Collect blood and tissue samples (including polyps, abnormal growths, cancer, and normal
           tissue) from patients undergoing colonoscopy.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo blood and tissue sample collection during colonoscopy. Samples are
      stored for future biomarker proteomic profiling.
