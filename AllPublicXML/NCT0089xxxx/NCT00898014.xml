      RATIONALE: Measuring blood levels of tumor cells in patients with breast cancer may help
      doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at blood levels of tumor cells in predicting
      response in patients receiving first-line chemotherapy for stage IV breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Predict the overall and progression-free survival of patients with stage IV breast
           cancer by measuring the rate of circulating tumor cells (CTC) before the second course
           of chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Predict overall and progression-free survival of these patients by measuring the rate of
           CTC before the start of chemotherapy, at the first tumor evaluation, and after 2-3
           courses of chemotherapy.

        -  Correlate the detection of CTC with tumor markers, clinical response, and radiological
           response.

        -  Study the changing status of HER-2 in CTC in patients receiving trastuzmab (Herceptin®).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline, before the second course of chemotherapy, before the
      third or fourth course of chemotherapy, and when progressive disease is diagnosed (before
      second-line treatment is initiated). Circulating tumor cells from the blood samples are
      examined by immunofluorescence.

      Patients are followed periodically for up to 3 months.
