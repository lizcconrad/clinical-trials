      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and bone marrow in the laboratory from patients at risk
      of developing myelodysplastic syndrome may help doctors learn more about changes that occur
      in DNA and identify biomarkers related to disorders of the blood and bone marrow.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at biomarkers in patients at risk of developing
      myelodysplastic syndrome or other disorders and in healthy participants.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To identify novel biomarkers of disease that would help in the initial diagnosis of
           myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

      Secondary

        -  To understand the genesis of anemia in cancers.

        -  To identify novel biomarkers of disease that predict progression of MDS to acute myeloid
           leukemia.

      OUTLINE: Blood and bone marrow samples are collected. Hemopoietic stem cells (HSC) and
      progenitor cells are isolated from samples for analysis. Some of these HSC and progenitor
      cells are used for functional assays. From the rest of the cells, DNA, RNA, and protein is
      extracted for molecular analyses, including gene mutation analysis, gene methylation assays,
      chromatin immunoprecipitation, microarray, and real-time polymerase chain reaction.
