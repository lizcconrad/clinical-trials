      Azacitidine will be given at a dose of 75 mg/sqm (s.c) daily for 5 consecutive days every 28
      days (every month) for a total of 8 courses to low risk MDSs according to IPSS scoring
      system. In fact, several studies produced high rates of trilineage responses, reduces the
      risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in high-risk MDS and improves the quality
      of life (QoL). The use of 5-Aza in the earlier phases of MDS could reduce the proliferative
      advantage of MDS clone and favour the regrowth of normal hematopoiesis.

    <textblock>
      5-Azacitidine(5-AZA) is the most promising drug for treatment MDSs. When administered at a
      dose of 75mg/m2/day subcutaneously for 7 days, every 28 days (every month), 5-Aza produces
      high rates of trilineage responses, reduces the risk of progression to AML in high-risk MDS
      and improves the QoL. The use of 5-Aza in the earlier phases of MDS could reduce the
      proliferative advantage of MDS clone and favour the regrowth of normal hematopoiesis. Other
      doses or schedules could improve its efficacy. Gene expression profile studies in MDS
      patients who are sensitive or resistant to 5-AZA are lacking and data coming from these
      studies could be useful to clarify the mechanisms of 5-azacitidine and optimize the therapy.

      Objectives of the study

      Primary:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy (hematologic response) and toxicity of 5-Aza five days monthly
           treatment schedule in patients with low-risk MDS (IPSS 0-INT1)

      Secondary:

        -  To evaluate QoL by the FACT-An questionnaire

        -  To evaluate time to progression of MDS;

        -  To evaluate the gene expression profile of MDS patients sensitive or resistant to 5-AZA;

        -  To evaluate oncostatin M, interleukin-6 and interleukin-11 levels in the responders and
           non responders.

      Azacitidine will be given at a dose of 75mg/sqm subcutaneous daily for 5 consecutive days
      every 28 days (every month) for a total of 8 courses. 5-Aza dosages will be adjusted as
      follows:

      Patients' care and other medications

        -  RBC are transfused to maintain a Hb level &gt; 90 g/L, or whenever indicated.

        -  Platelets are transfused if platelet count is &lt; 20 x 109/L, or whenever indicated.

        -  EPO is not allowed during the trial time (8 months= 8 courses of 5-AZA therapy)

        -  Granulocyte or granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF or GM-CSF) are
           allowed in case of severe neutropenia and/or systemic infection.

        -  Antibiotics and antifungals per os are given in prophylaxis if neutrophils &lt;0.5 x 109
           /L.

        -  Antibiotics are given i.v. in case of fever (&gt; 38°C for &gt; 24 h) or whenever indicated.

        -  Antifungals are given i.v. in case of fever persisting for more than 5 days of
           antibiotics i.v. or whenever indicated.

        -  Other experimental drugs or agents are not allowed.

        -  If another experimental drug or agent will be administered, the patient must discontinue
           the treatment with 5-AZA, and goes off-study.

      Definition of Response

      The response to treatment will be assessed according to IWG 2006 criteria, as reported by
      Cheson et al.(28) (Appendix F)

      Response criteria for altering natural history of MDS:

        -  Complete remission (CR) Bone marrow: ≤5% myeloblasts with normal maturation of all cell
           lines Persistent dysplasia will be notes Peripheral blood: Hgb ≥ 11g/dl, Platelets ≥ 100
           x 109/l, Neutrophils ≥ 1.0 x 109/l, Blasts 0%

        -  Partial remission (PR)

      All CR criteria if abnormal before treatment except:

      morphology not relevant

        -  Marrow CR Bone marrow ≤ 5% myeloblasts and decrease by ≥ 50% over pretreatment
           Peripheral blood: if HI response, they will be noted in addition to marrow CR

        -  Stable disease Failure to achieve at least PR, but no evidence of progression for &gt;8
           weeks

        -  Failure Death during treatment or disease progression characterized by worsening of
           cytopenias, increase in the percentage bone marrow blasts, or progression to a more
           advanced MDS FAB subtype than pretreatment.

        -  Relapse after CR or PR

      At least one of the following:
