  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to investigate the protective effects of topical
      sulforaphane-containing broccoli-sprout extracts (BSE) on radiation-induced dermatitis in
      women undergoing external-beam radiation therapy for breast cancer. Topical sulforaphane
      induces phase 2 enzymes that are protective against oxidants, electrophiles, and inflammation
      (Talalay and Fahey, 2001) - all of which are generated by both ultraviolet and ionizing
      radiation. Previous work from the investigators' group demonstrated that sulforaphane
      treatment protects against ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema of human skin (IRB protocol
      NA_00004897; Talalay et al. 2007). This investigation will extend the investigators' previous
      work by employing ionizing rather than ultraviolet radiation.

      The investigators propose a two part sequential protocol (Study A and Study B). Both studies
      will involve women with breast cancer who have undergone lumpectomy and are scheduled for
      adjuvant external beam radiation treatment. In study A, the investigators will validate their
      technique for measurement of skin erythema using a device called a chromometer; no active
      agent will be applied (up to 6 women). Study B will follow completion of Study A. Study B
      will involve the application of broccoli sprout extracts (BSE) or vehicle alone to determine
      if sulforaphane can reduce radiation-induced erythema (27 women). Four adjacent, 1.5-cm
      diameter areas-of-interest on the affected breast will be located by means of an adhesive
      vinyl template which can be accurately and repeatedly placed at the same position. Two of the
      four areas will be treated with BSE (active agent) and two with vehicle (inactive control).
      BSE will be applied on three days weekly throughout the 5-week period of whole breast
      radiation. Erythema will be noninvasively quantified by measuring the red-reflectance of the
      skin with a chromometer up to three times weekly throughout treatment. A total of 33 patients
      are to be enrolled.

      The investigators' objective is to determine and quantify the effect of topical BSE on
      radiation-induced skin erythema. This study will employ standard, clinically-accepted
      radiation doses and techniques that are safe and well tolerated. The safety and tolerability
      of both oral and topical broccoli sprout preparations is well established; no safety concerns
      have been noted. (Shapiro et al. 2006; Dinkova-Kostova et al. 2007).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have pathologically confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ
             of the breast.

          -  Patients must have undergone segmental mastectomy (i.e., lumpectomy).

          -  Patients must not have received prior radiation therapy to the breast.

          -  Patients must not have active local-regional disease prior to registration.

          -  Patients must not be pregnant because of the potential for fetal harm as a result of
             radiation treatment. Women of child-bearing age will be given a serum pregnancy test
             prior to study entry to ensure they are not pregnant. They will also be counseled on
             the importance of avoiding pregnancy and hormonal contraception while undergoing
             radiation therapy.

          -  Patients must not have a serious medical or psychiatric illness which prevents
             informed consent or compliance with treatment.

          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and give
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Visible skin pathology, excessive freckles, or skin blemishes in the test area.

          -  History of skin disease or hypersensitivity and repeated contact allergies.

          -  Sarcoma or squamous cell histology.

          -  Metastatic disease to the breast.

          -  Current tobacco use.
