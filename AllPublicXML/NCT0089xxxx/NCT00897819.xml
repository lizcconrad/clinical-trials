      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood, urine, and tissue from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients respond to
      treatment.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is analyzing the DNA in tissue samples from patients with
      advanced colorectal cancer treated with fluorouracil and oxaliplatin with or without
      bevacizumab on clinical trial E-3200.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the CpG island methylation pathway markers that are adverse for survival after
           treatment with fluorouracil in patients with advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma treated
           with fluorouracil and oxaliplatin with or without bevacizumab on clinical trial E-3200.

        -  Compare the methylation results to clinicopathologic and molecular findings and
           survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Tissue, blood, and urine samples and genomic DNA samples from tumor tissue blocks are
      examined by pyrosequencing assay for methylation. Genes examined include MINT1, MINT31, P14,
      and P16. Microsatellite instability and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 18 (18q
      LOH) are also assessed. Microsatellites examined include BAT loci, TGFÎ²RII, D2S123, D55346,
      and D17S250.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 350 specimens will be accrued for this study.
