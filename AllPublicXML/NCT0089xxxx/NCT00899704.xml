      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may
      help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tissue samples in predicting oral cancer in
      patients who have undergone neck dissection for oral cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To test preliminary data from node-positive oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)
           signatures for their ability to predict lymph-positive primaries using a cohort of OSCC
           tumors.

        -  To perform lymph node prediction using sentinel lymph node-biopsied primaries.

        -  To validate the preliminary data node-positive OSCC signature and test its ability to
           predict nodal status.

      OUTLINE: Patient tissue samples are screened using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for human
      papilloma virus-specific primers. Samples are analyzed to identify a nodal-metastasis
      signature for oral squamous cell carcinoma. Samples also undergo microarray analysis to
      quantify expression levels for targeted genes. Initial data analysis is performed using
      Affymetrix® Microarray Suite 5.0 to quantify expression levels for targeted genes.
