    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) causes motor and non-motor impairments that affect the quality of
      life of the subjects. The purpose was to assess the effects of treadmill walking training
      with additional body load on the quality of life and motor symptoms of the subjects with PD.

      Methods: Nine subjects with PD, Hoehn and Yahr stages 2 through 3, not demented and with
      capability to ambulate independently voluntarily participate in this study. The training
      program was divided into three phases (A1-B-A2): treadmill training with additional body load
      (A1), control condition (conventional physical therapy group) (B) and treadmill training with
      load again (A2). Each phase lasted six weeks. The quality of life and motor symptoms were
      assessed by PDQ-39 and UPDRS, respectively. Both evaluations and training were performed
      during on-phase of the medication cycle.
