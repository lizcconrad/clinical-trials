      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors
      predict how patients respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at biomarkers in patients with stage III or stage
      IV follicular lymphoma treated on clinical trial E-1496.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Correlate gene expression profiles with progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with
           stage III or IV follicular lymphoma treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and
           prednisone with or without rituximab on clinical trial E-1496.

        -  Determine if immunoglobulin Fc-gamma receptor polymorphisms are predictive of PFS in
           these patients.

        -  Assess the significance of the microenvironment by constructing tissue microarrays of
           follicular lymphoma and immunostaining with relevant biomarkers.

        -  Correlate relevant biomarkers with clinical features, response, and PFS.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Tissue samples are analyzed by gene expression profiling, microarrays to predict gene
      expression, immunohistochemistry, and immunoglobulin Fc-gamma receptor polymorphism analysis
      for biological markers.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 175 samples will be accrued for this study.
