  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether a medication reduces the number, severity and
      bothersomeness of menopausal hot flashes. Escitalopram (also called Lexapro®) is a selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). It is sold by prescription for depression and general
      anxiety disorder. An SSRI increases serotonin, a brain substance that is believed to
      influence mood. Serotonin may also affect brain levels of estradiol, a hormone related to hot
      flashes. This research study will test whether escitalopram reduces menopausal hot flashes.

      The MsFLASH-01 study, Efficacy of a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) for
      Menopausal Symptoms in Midlife Women is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel arm clinical trial. The design includes: 3 weeks of daily recording of hot flashes
      prior to drug treatment; 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with escitalopram or placebo with
      dose escalation at 4 weeks among non-responders; 1 week of drug taper for those on higher
      dose, followed by 2 weeks with no treatment; and a telephone follow-up post-treatment. This
      study is one of five clinical trials to be conducted as part of the Menopause Strategies -
      Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health (MsFLASH) study, a network of investigators
      and clinical trials designed to find new ways to alleviate the most common, bothersome
      symptoms of the menopausal transition.

At 4 weeks, if hot flash frequency was not reduced by at least 50% or there was no decrease in severity, the dose was increased to 2 pills daily(escitalopram 20 mg or placebo) unless precluded by unacceptable adverse events. At 8 weeks, participants taking 1 pill per day stopped treatment; participants taking 2 pills per day tapered the dose over a week.</description>

          <description>Escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). For the first four weeks, participants took 1 pill daily (escitalopram 10 mg or placebo). At 4 weeks, if hot flash frequency was not reduced by at least 50% or there was no decrease in severity, the dose was increased to 2 pills daily(escitalopram 20 mg or placebo) unless precluded by unacceptable adverse events. At 8 weeks, participants taking 1 pill per day stopped treatment; participants taking 2 pills per day tapered the dose over a week.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Although this was a community-based sample, the volunteers may be a select group motivated to seek treatment. An 8-week trial is brief, but data indicate that this interval is sufficient to determine long-term efficacy of a nonhormonal compound.</limitations_and_caveats>
