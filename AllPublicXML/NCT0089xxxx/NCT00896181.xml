  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying whether giving a combination of docetaxel, cisplatin, and
      fluorouracil chemotherapy followed by the combination of cisplatin with radiation therapy
      works in treating patients with advanced nasopharyngeal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy
      uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a
      high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage
      to normal tissue. Giving combination chemotherapy together with radiation therapy may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To establish the progression free survival rate at 2 years, using RECIST criteria, to
      induction treatment with docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (TPF) followed by
      chemoradiotherapy of locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate complete response rates, safety and feasibility of TPF followed by
      chemoradiation in patients with NPC

      OUTLINE: This is a single site study.

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1; cisplatin IV over
      1-3 hours (or carboplatin IV over 30 minutes) on day 1; and fluorouracil IV continuously over
      24 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONCURRENT CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Beginning within 3-6 weeks after initiating the last course of
      induction chemotherapy, patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy once daily for 6.5-7 weeks. Patients also receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour (or
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes) once weekly in weeks 1-6 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma meeting the
             following criteria:

               -  WHO type I, II, or III

               -  Stage II -IVB disease (minimally T2a, N0, M0 or any T any, N1, M0)

               -  Measurable disease, defined as &gt;= 1 lesion that can be accurately measured in &gt;=
                  1 dimension as &gt;= 20 mm by conventional techniques or as &gt;= 10 mm by spiral CT
                  scan

               -  Prior diagnostic surgery(s) at the primary site or neck allowed provided there is
                  still measurable disease present

               -  No known brain metastases

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months

          -  ANC &gt;= 1,500/mm^3

          -  Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/mm^3

          -  Total bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 times ULN

          -  AST and ALT &lt;= 2.5 times ULN

          -  Creatinine &lt;= 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance &gt;= 55 mL/min- NOTE: * Patients with
             creatinine &gt; grade 1 but &lt; grade 3, hearing loss &gt;= grade 2, and peripheral neuropathy
             &gt;= grade 2 are eligible provided they receive carboplatin in place of cisplatin
             throughout study treatment
