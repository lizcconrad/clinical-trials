      This study is being done to determine whether measures of brain activity (known as cortical
      excitability and inhibition) collected by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) are
      different in children and adolescents with depression and children and adolescents that do
      not have depression.

      The purpose of this study is determine whether single and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) can be used to detect brain changes in children and adolescents with major
      depressive disorder. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a noninvasive focal brain
      stimulation technology which makes certain parts of the brain work without putting any wires
      or chemicals into the body. Single and paired-pulse TMS involves giving one or two brief
      magnetic pulses to the brain no more often than every few seconds and measuring the subject's
      thumb movements. This is different from what is called repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) in which investigators rapidly give many pulses to the brain with the idea
      of altering brain function and treating illnesses. This study does not involve any treatment.
      It is a study to examine the brain changes associated with depression in children and
      adolescents. The techniques which will be used in this study (single and paired-pulse TMS)
      are much safer than rTMS and have been used safely and frequently (over 2,000 published
      cases) for research in children.

      Investigators in this study will use TMS to measure cortical excitability (how active the
      brain is) and cortical inhibition (how active the brain is and how well chemicals which slow
      brain functions are working) in children and adolescents with MDD and healthy controls. The
      aims of this study are to compare these measures of cortical excitability and inhibition in
      these two groups (depressed children and adolescents and normal controls), and to determine
      if there is a relationship between these measures of cortical inhibition and excitability and
      how severe symptoms of depression are in subjects and if these measures change differently
      with age in depressed children and adolescents and normal controls. The investigators
      hypothesize that subjects with depression will have decreased cortical inhibition compared to
      healthy controls and that depressed subjects will have greater differences in cortical
      inhibition on the left and right sides of their brains than healthy controls. The
      investigators also hypothesize that subjects with more severe symptoms of depression will
      have lower cortical inhibition. Also it is hypothesized that, in depressed subjects, cortical
      inhibition will not increase with age as significantly as it does in healthy controls.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children and adolescents from the ages of 8 to 17, male or female, any ethnicity.

          -  Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), single episode, or recurrent, moderate to severe,
             based on DSM-IV-TR criteria and the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and
             Schizophrenia for School Aged Children Past and Lifetime(K-SADS-PL) semi-structured
             psychiatric interview by a psychiatrist, a Ph.D. level psychologist, or equivalent
             professional with extensive clinical experience.

          -  Childhood Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) score of 40 or higher.

          -  Outpatient, inpatient, or partial hospitalization patients.

          -  Capable of providing informed assent (consent if age 18) in addition to consent by
             parent or guardian.

          -  Healthy controls: will be matched for age, sex, and handedness-based on the Edinburgh
             Inventory of Handedness (Oldfield 1971) to subjects with MDD. These subjects must be
             in good medical and psychiatric health (no active diagnosis based on evaluation with
             K-SADS-PL).

          -  English or Spanish Speaking

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary Axis I or II disorder other than MDD. Any axis I or II disorder in control
             subjects.

          -  Any psychotropic medications or any medication which could lower the subject's seizure
             threshold.

          -  Unprovoked seizure history, seizure disorder, history of febrile seizures, family
             history of epilepsy.

          -  Pregnancy or suspected pregnancy in females.

          -  Metal in the head (except the mouth), implanted medication pumps, cardiac pacemaker.

          -  Prior brain surgery.

          -  Risk for increased intracranial pressure such as a brain tumor.

          -  Any unstable medical condition.
