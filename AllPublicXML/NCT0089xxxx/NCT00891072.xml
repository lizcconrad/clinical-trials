    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of gossypol when given together
      with paclitaxel and carboplatin in treating patients with solid tumors that are metastatic or
      cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gossypol, paclitaxel, and
      carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving gossypol together with paclitaxel and
      carboplatin may kill more tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The primary end point will be to determine the maximum tolerated dose of AT-101 with
      paclitaxel and carboplatin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the toxicities associated with the combination of paclitaxel, carboplatin, and
      AT-101.

      II. To evaluate the human pharmacokinetic disposition of AT-101 in the context of escalating
      doses.

      III. To describe the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel when given concurrently with AT-101.

      IV. To evaluate for evidence of activity for the combination of paclitaxel, carboplatin and
      AT-101.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid.

      Patients receive oral R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid twice daily on days 1-3. Patients also
      receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies by
      liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 4 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed malignancy that is
             metastatic and unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do
             not exist or are no longer effective; patient may have previously treated or untreated
             disease

          -  Patients may have had no more than nine months of previous marrow damaging cytotoxic
             chemotherapy; examples include but are not limited to: platinum agents
             cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, BCNU, and mitomycin C; chemotherapy agents that are
             non-alkylators such as fluorouracil or taxanes will not be considered marrow damaging
             chemotherapy; patients must be at least 28 days from last prior chemotherapy or
             molecular therapy; at least six weeks from last chemotherapy if the regimen included
             BCNU or mitomycin C; it must be at least 2 weeks from last radiation therapy and less
             than a total of 30% of the bone marrow receiving radiation dose &gt; 3000 cGy; in
             addition, patients may not have received previous high-dose therapy requiring
             hematopoietic stem cell transplantation nor can they have received anti-cancer
             treatments involving radioactive pharmaceuticals

          -  Patients with non-Hodgkins lymphoma that is amenable to hematopoietic stem cell
             transplantation with curative intent may participate only if stem cell transplant is
             refused or is not indicated

          -  ECOG performance status =&lt; 2, Karnofsky ≥ 60%

          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR a measured creatinine clearance by 24
             hour urine collection greater than 60 mL/min; a calculated creatinine clearance by
             Cockcroft-Gault Formula is acceptable in lieu of a measured value

          -  All Patients must have Measurable or Evaluable Disease per RECIST Criteria

          -  The effects of AT-101 on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason and
             because other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal
             or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry, for the duration of study
             participation, and for at least one month following the last dose of AT-101; should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Patients with previously treated brain metastases who are clinically and
             radiographically stable or improved at least four weeks after completion of radiation
             therapy and are off steroids are eligible; an MRI of the brain or CT scan of the head
             with contrast must be performed at baseline for patients with history of and/or
             symptoms suspicious of brain metastases

          -  Patients must sign informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with chemotherapy, hormonal agents (except LHRH agonists/antagonists) used
             for their anti-cancer activity, or biologic response modifiers within 4 weeks (6 weeks
             for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study

          -  Failure to recover fully (as judged by the investigator) from prior surgical
             procedures, or failure to recover from adverse events due to agents administered more
             than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Concurrent treatment with an investigational agent other than the investigational
             agent(s) used in this study OR treatment within 4 weeks of study entry with any
             investigational agent(s) or device(s)

          -  Any prior use of racemic gossypol or AT-101

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to AT-101 or other agents used in study

          -  Requirement for routine use of hematopoietic growth factors (including granulocyte
             colony stimulating factor, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, or
             interleukin-11) or platelet transfusions to maintain absolute neutrophil counts or
             platelets counts above the required thresholds for study entry; use of erythropoietin
             stimulating agents and RBCs prior to study enrollment is allowed

          -  Neuropathy is a well described side effect of paclitaxel and carboplatin; patients may
             not have baseline peripheral neuropathy &gt;= Grade 2

          -  Any condition (e.g., gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take
             oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures
             affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease) that impairs their ability to
             swallow and retain AT-101 tablets

          -  Patients with malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal
             function, or resection of the stomach or small bowel within the last three months are
             excluded; subjects with ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or a partial
             or complete small bowel obstruction are also excluded

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would affect safety or limit
             compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of AT-101 on the
             developing human fetus are unknown, but could potentially include teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with AT-101,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with AT-101; these
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with AT-101 or other agents used in
             this study; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken
             in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Patients with &gt; grade 2 symptomatic hypercalcemia

          -  Patients with a myocardial infarction (MI) or cardiac (heart) surgery within the past
             3 months
