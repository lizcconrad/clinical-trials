    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to reconstruct a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) from
      intracardiac (IC) electrograms (EGM) obtained from defibrillator devices (ICD). The purpose
      of such a reconstruction is to allow the use of IC EGM for diagnosis of clinical conditions
      for which ECG have historically been used, and to test the feasibility of a reconstruction
      technique for the standard 12-lead or extended electrocardiogram from electrical potentials
      obtained from inside a patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reconstructing a 12-lead surface ECG from intracardiac EGM vectors of patients implanted with
      defibrillators can be of great value. It allows implantable devices that have thus far been
      used exclusively for arrhythmia detection and treatment, to be used for diagnostic purposes
      in similar ways as the ECG. The advantage of the reconstruction process is that it provides
      real-time continuous monitoring, which can be used for multiple purposes, including but not
      limited to:

        1. Ischemia detection

        2. Myocardial Infarction detection

        3. Electrolyte abnormalities detection

        4. Assessment of effect of medications

        5. Improved rhythm discrimination

    <description>The subject population will be obtained by approaching the Principal and Co- Investigators' patients who have been referred for ICD implantation or who already have an ICD. This population ranges in age from 18 years on, and includes both males and females. A maximum of 50 subjects will be enrolled in this study.</description>

    <intervention_name>CT scan of the chest without contrast</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients consenting to participate in the study may also undergo a baseline CT scan of the cest without contrast to allow for the geometrical characterization of their intracardiac electrodes from the ICD system in relation to the position of the 12-lead surface ECG electrodes which would be applied to the chest prior to the CT scan. This scan involves a small amount of radiation, a dose of approximately 1 rem. For comparison, radiation workers are permitted, by federal regulation, a maximum annual radiation exposure of 20 rems to the most sensitive organs of their body.</description>

        Subjects will be identified by their cardiologist who is also an investigator on this study
        at the time they are evaluated for an ICD implantation. Once it has been determined during
        the course of the patient's regular clinical care that he or she requires an ICD, they will
        be approached for enrollment into the study by the physician investigator and the clinical
        research coordinator.
