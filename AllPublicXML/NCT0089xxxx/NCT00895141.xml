  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test whether increased saturated fat intake results in
      increased levels of larger LDL and HDL particles in individuals with LDL Pattern B.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increased saturated fat intake is known to elevate plasma levels of both low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), however,
      less is know regarding the effect of saturated fat on lipoprotein subclasses. We previously
      showed that, in the context of a reduced carbohydrate diet, saturated fat induced increases
      in LDL cholesterol were apparently due to increases in large, more buoyant LDL without
      increases in small, dense LDL. This finding was supported by a previous dietary intervention
      study showing a correlation between saturated fat intake and large LDL. In both cases, this
      increase in large LDL was correlated with an increase in large HDL. In this study, we will
      test the following specific hypotheses regarding changes in plasma lipoproteins induced by a
      diet high in myristic acid and other saturated fats derived primarily from dairy sources in
      individuals with LDL subclass pattern B: 1) there will be a coordinate increase in levels of
      large HDL particles that are considered anti-atherogenic and large LDL particles that are
      less strongly associated with increased CVD risk than smaller LDL; 2) this change in
      lipoprotein profile will result in a higher proportion of pattern B individuals converting to
      LDL subclass pattern A (predominance of larger LDL); and 3) the coordinate increase in large
      HDL and LDL is due to a common underlying pathway. The latter hypothesis will be addressed by
      assaying cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), hepatic lipase (HL), and lipoprotein
      lipase (LPL).
