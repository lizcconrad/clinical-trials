  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ORION study is being conducted to determine whether the Epic™ Nitinol Stent for primary
      stenting of iliac atherosclerotic lesions shows acceptable performance at 9 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ORION is a prospective, single arm, non-randomized, multicenter study. A subject could
      receive a maximum of 2 study stents for up to 2 target lesions. A maximum of 1 non-target
      lesion in 1 non-target vessel could be treated with a commercially approved treatment during
      the index procedure.

    <description>Systolic velocity ratio (SVR) is the ratio of the measurement of systolic velocity in 2 arterial regions as determined by duplex ultrasound (DUS). Restenosis (defined per lesion)is defined as DUS SVR &gt;2.5 or the presence of a target lesion revascularization prior to the DUS examination, regardless of the SVR value. In 1 subject, SVR was invalid and proximal peak systolic velocity by DUS was analyzed to assess restenosis.</description>

             trial

          -  Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to contrast dye that, in the opinion of the

             femoral artery occlusion in the limb supplied by target vessel

          -  Heavily calcified and/or excessively tortuous lesions in the target vessel as
             determined by angiography

          -  Target lesion is within or near an aneurysm

          -  Persistent, intraluminal thrombus of the proposed target lesion post-thrombolytic
             therapy

          -  Perforated vessel as evidenced by extravasation of contrast media

            <groups_desc>MAE rate was compared to a predefined performance goal of 17.0%, based on literature-derived expected rate of 8.0% for iliac stenting plus a 9.0% margin. Study had 87% statistical power to show the MAE rate (accounting for 9-month attrition of &lt;=15%) is less than the performance goal, assuming a 9-month MAE rate of 8.0%. If the exact one-sided 95% upper confidence bound of the observed rate is lower than the performance goal, the Epic stent would be considered to have acceptable performance.</groups_desc>
