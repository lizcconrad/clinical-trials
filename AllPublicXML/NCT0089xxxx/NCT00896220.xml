  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in critical care medicine have dramatically improved the survival of critically ill
      patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. However, there are no systematic
      follow-up, rehabilitation, or psychoeducational interventions for these vulnerable patients
      or their family caregivers who contribute to survivor recovery and rehabilitation. Major
      barriers to developing these programs for survivors of prolonged mechanical ventilation and
      their caregivers include the following:

        1. There is inadequate information about the determinants of long-term functional outcomes
           for a diverse group of survivors of prolonged mechanical ventilation.

        2. There is inadequate information about the needs of survivors of prolonged mechanical
           ventilation and their family caregivers across the trajectory of illness (i.e., from the
           ICU to the community).

        3. There is a poor understanding of the development of ICU-acquired muscle injury.

      Towards RECOVER is the very first study to identify survivors of prolonged mechanical
      ventilation who are at-risk for poor functional outcomes, to identify elements of the
      care-giving situation that put caregivers at risk for poor quality of life and mental health,
      to catalogue the rehabilitative needs of patients and family caregivers across the illness
      trajectory, and to evaluate the mechanism of critical illness associated muscle injury.

      The RECOVER Program consists of Four Phases:

        -  Phase I: Towards RECOVER

        -  Phase II: RECOVER development and pilot testing

        -  Phase III: RECOVER randomized controlled trial

        -  Phase IV: Long-term implementation of RECOVER
