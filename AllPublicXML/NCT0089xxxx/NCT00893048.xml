  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of cellulitis in society is very high, as much as 3% of visits to Emergency
      Departments are for the treatment of this disease. The treatment of cellulitis varies
      depending on the severity. Low severity cases are treated with pain control and antibiotics
      by mouth and high severity are treated with antibiotics intravenously and pain control. The
      investigator's hypothesis is to see if the addition of steroids, which are known to decrease
      inflammation, will decrease the length of the disease process. If so, it will decrease the
      length of stay if IV antibiotics are needed, it will decrease duration of days out of work
      and decrease the overall pain control required and therefore patient satisfaction.

      The incidence of cellulitis is about 24.6 cases per 1000 person-years, which is an estimate,
      since cellulitis is not a reportable disease. In some Emergency Departments up to 3% of
      visits are for cellulitis. Depending on the severity of the disease, some are treated as
      outpatients, and others are admitted for IV antibiotics. In some Emergency Departments cases
      of cellulitis are treated in an observation area for 23 hours with doses of IV antibiotics.
      My proposed research is to see if the addition of one dose of prednisone the treatment will
      decrease the inflammatory reaction enough to decrease length of stay and treatment and
      increase patient satisfaction.
