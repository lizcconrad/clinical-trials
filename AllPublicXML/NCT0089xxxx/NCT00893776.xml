  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A small, pilot study consisting of twelve participants with subacute (6-12 months
      post-stroke)and chronic stroke (1year+ post-stroke)living in and around Columbia area. The
      twelve participants will randomly be selected to participate in either unilateral
      (one-handed) task training (6 participants) or bilateral (two-handed) task training (6
      participants) with the SaeboFlex orthosis. Each group will undergo six assessments to
      establish pre-testing baseline and qualification, followed by a training session, four-week
      combined home and clinic program, and post-testing to determine changes in affected arm use
      and function. The hypothesis is that two-handed training will before effective than
      one-handed training.

    <textblock>
      The SaeboFlex device is a mechanical orthosis that promotes grasp and release and functional
      movement of an upper limb that has impaired movement due to a stroke. Many researchers have
      found that incorporating both the affected and unaffected limb together during exercises
      (bilateral task training) results in increased functional use of the affected limb as
      compared to only performing exercises with the affected limb. Therefore, we want to determine
      if bilateral task training is more effective than unilateral task training with the use of
      the SaeboFlex device in subacute and chronic stroke rehabilitation. For the unilateral
      training group, exercises will be completed with only the affected hand using the Saebo
      device. For the bilateral group, the Saebo will be on the affected hand, no device on the
      unaffected hand, and both arms will do the exact same movements/exercises at the same time.
      The participants will be videotaped and photographed moving balls without the device, with
      the device at the start of the study, with the device midway through the study, and at the
      end of the study. This will be done for the purpose of providing participant feedback
      regarding their progress and for report of outcomes upon completion of the project. Faces
      will be omitted from all photographic media at the request of the participant, and the
      participant may decline photographic media at any time without having to withdraw from the
      study.

    <description>This group will wear the SaeboFlex orthosis on their affected extremity and do exercises with that extremity only. SaeboFlex exercises include moving the ball in high repetition of grasp and release while wearing the SaeboFlex orthosis to various positions individualized to each participant based on movement deficits, as well as Task Training (using the affected arm during specific functional activities to use newly acquired movement patterns)</description>
