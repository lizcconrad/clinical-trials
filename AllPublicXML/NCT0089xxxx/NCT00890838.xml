  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The perioperative administration of n-3 fatty acids has been shown to lead to favorable
      effects on outcome in patients with severe surgical interventions by lowering the magnitude
      of inflammatory response and by modulating the immune response. To the investigators'
      knowledge, no study with preoperative administration of intravenous (IV) omega 3 fatty acids
      as a part of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or monotherapy with it to demonstrate its
      effects on inflammatory and immune response has been conducted. So, this study has been
      planned to judge the inflammatory response of preoperative monotherapy with IV omega 3 fatty
      acids in elderly patients undergoing valvular surgery considering the hyperinflammation
      associated with this type of surgery in elderly patients.
