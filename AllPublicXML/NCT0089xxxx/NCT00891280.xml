    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study of oral CX-4945 is designed to test the safety, tolerability and highest
      safe dose level of this CK2 inhibitor in patients with advanced solid tumor cancers,
      Castleman's Disease or Multiple Myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elevated CK2 activity has been associated with malignant transformation and aggressive tumor
      growth and overexpression of CK2 has been documented in multiple types of cancer. CK2 has
      emerged as a potential anticancer target and inhibition of CK2 represents a potential
      therapeutic strategy to target a specific molecular defect perpetuating many cancers. CX-4945
      has demonstrated potent inhibition of CK2 enzymatic activity. This study will evaluate the
      safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of CX-4945 administered to
      patients with malignancies or lymphoproliferative disorders known to overexpress CK2
      including advanced solid tumors, Multiple Myeloma and Castleman's Disease.

             endocrine therapy, chemotherapy) or for which effective therapy is not available,
             including the following types: (examples)

               -  Lung cancer

               -  Renal cell cancer

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  One or more tumors measurable on radiograph or CT scan, or evaluable disease defined
             as non-measurable lesions per RECIST or detection of protein M in serum and/or urine
             of patients with Multiple Myeloma (serum ≥ 10 gm/L and urine ≥ 200 mg/24 hr).
