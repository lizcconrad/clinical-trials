    <textblock>
      This is the second phase of a two-phase, cross-sectional study of linkage to medical care of
      HIV positive youth. Social, psychological and behavioral factors associated with receipt of
      care will be evaluated. This study will also compare three methods for recruitment of
      out-of-care youth using a randomized permuted block list of possible sequences.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ATN 066b consists of a cross-sectional evaluation of three groups of recently diagnosed
      HIV-infected adolescents including: (1) care non-initiation; (2) care initiation, no
      maintenance; and (3) care initiation with maintenance. Social, psychological and behavioral
      factors associated with HIV-related care-seeking will be assessed using an ACASI. Three
      recruitment strategies using a randomized permuted block list of possible sequences for
      HIV-infected youth not in care will be also compared.

      The ACASI instrument will be adapted from previously used instruments intended to
      retrospectively reconstruct the care-seeking process and to assess quality of life, concerns
      and expectations for care, satisfaction with care, and social-problem solving.

      Ideally, the ACASI will be administered during a single session and may take up to 90 minutes
      to complete. Participants who are unable to complete the ACASI in one session will be allowed
      up to 7 days after initiation to complete it. Completion of all study data collection,
      including accrual period, is expected to take approximately 12 months. Outcome measures will
      be classified as (1) care non-initiation; (2) care initiation, no maintenance; or (3) care
      initiation and maintenance.

      The assessment of recruitment strategies most effective for not in care youth will include:
      use of usual case-management approaches; snowball sampling and venue-based advertisement.

    <description>Clinical personnel at each AMTU site may work with other personnel from organizations authorized to have access to personal health information to identify clients identified as HIV positive within the past 6 - 18 months.
Initial contact will be made by persons at source organizations who are authorized to have access to personal health information. Persons so authorized will explain the nature of the research study and request permission from the client for subsequent contact by research personnel from the AMTU site. If permission for contact is received, research personnel at each site will attempt calls as specified by the potential participant or at random times (before 12:00 pm; between 12:00 - 4:00 pm; and between 4:00 - 10:00 pm) for no more than 10 attempts.</description>

    <description>Snowball sampling assumes that social networks of HIV sero-positive persons in treatment may overlap with those of HIV sero-positive persons not in treatment.
When a site is assigned to identify HIV positive adolescents not in care by snowball sampling, all HIV positive persons in care at the site will be invited to refer other adolescents known to them as HIV positive, but not in care, for possible participation in the study.
Printed information containing a brief description of the research in English and in Spanish and contact information of site study personnel will be provided to in-care adolescents at the site for distribution to those known HIV positive adolescents who are not in care.</description>

    <description>AMTU staff will develop lists of potential participants at their sites who have had an initial HIV-related health care visit but not received additional visits within the 12 mos prior the list (or before protocol screening) or have completed initial and follow up visits but dropped out of care for 12 or more mos. Back-up lists will be made of potential participants who have gone 9-12 mos and 6-9 mos without a visit. Clinical staff at each AMTU may work with staff from other organizations authorized to access personal health information to find potential participants. 1st contact will be made by persons at source organizations who are authorized to access personal health information. Authorized staff will explain the study and ask permission for contact by research staff at the AMTU site. If so, research staff will attempt calls as specified by the potential participant or at random (before 12 pm; between 12-4 pm; and between 4-10 pm) for no more than 10 attempts.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection behaviorally-acquired at age 10 years or older, by the site staff's
             best determination;

          -  HIV-1 infection documented by a positive result on any of the following licensed tests
             at any time: any HIV-1 antibody test confirmed by Western blot, HIV-1 culture, HIV-1
             DNA PCR, or plasma HIV-1 RNA PCR &gt; 1,000 copies/ml; NOTE: Anonymous HIV-1 antibody
             test results, with confirmation by Western blot, will be considered an acceptable form
             of documentation for those individuals who do not wish to have their name linked to
             their HIV diagnosis. The original slip containing the result will need to be
             presented. If individuals request that their test results remain anonymous, AMTUs are
             encouraged to retest using an anonymous method.

          -  Documented or self-reported receipt of HIV positive diagnosis between 6 -18 months,
             inclusive, prior to the protocol screening date; NOTE: The protocol team will monitor
             enrollment during the first 3 months of study implementation and may expand this
             window to 24 months, if necessary.

          -  Ages 14 - 24 years, inclusive at the time of protocol screening;

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to provide written informed consent/assent in
             English or Spanish;

          -  Group 1: Never initiated HIV-related medical care and 6 or more months have elapsed
             since receipt of an HIV diagnosis. This cohort is not currently considered in care;

          -  Group 2: Initiated HIV-related medical care, but 12 or more months have elapsed since
             care was initiated, and has not had additional HIV-related medical care since the
             initial visit; or

          -  Group 2: Initiated and had follow up HIV-related medical care, but is no longer in
             care for 12 or more months since the last visit. This cohort is not currently
             considered in care; and

          -  Group 3: Initiated and maintained HIV-related medical care with at least one
             maintenance visit within the 12 months prior to the protocol screening date. This
             cohort is currently considered in care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Psychiatric disorder (untreated) associated with thought disorder, hallucinations,
             acute substance use withdrawal. Stabilized patients receiving appropriate psychiatric
             care will not be excluded if informed consent can be reasonably assumed;

          -  Visibly distraught and/or visibly emotionally unstable (e.g., depressive mood;
             exhibiting manic, suicidal, or violent behavior);

             requirements;

          -  Known pregnancy;

          -  Acute illness that, in the opinion of the treating clinician, would endanger the
             well-being of the individual if treatment was delayed due to study participation;

          -  HIV positive adolescents infected through either perinatal transmission or blood
             products, including those who became aware of their HIV diagnosis within the prior 6
             -18 months; and

          -  Explicit prior refusal of permission by the adolescent for any subsequent contact by
             site personnel. (Adolescents who wish to participate and provide signed informed
             consent, but who cannot or will not provide contact information, do not meet this
             exclusion criterion.)
