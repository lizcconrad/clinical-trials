      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about cancer and the development of drug resistance in
      patients.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at lapatinib resistance in patients with breast
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To identify secondary ErbB2 mutations in tumor tissue samples from patients with
           ErbB2-positive breast cancer treated with lapatinib ditosylate.

        -  To investigate ErbB2 copy number changes and expression levels.

        -  To determine abnormalities of other pathways (e.g., c-MET and PI3K) as potential
           mechanisms of resistance.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected tumor tissue samples* are obtained for genetic analysis
      studies. Samples are analyzed for secondary ErbB2 mutations by nested PCR; ErbB2 copy number
      changes by quantitative PCR and standard histological FISH; and ErbB2 expression levels by
      quantitative RT-PCR and IHC. Patients also undergo blood sample collection for extraction of
      DNA (as normal control DNA) and isolation of EpCAM-positive circulating tumor cells using
      immunomagnetic cell separation technology. Additional research studies may include mutational
      and amplification analysis of the c-MET and PI3K pathways.

      NOTE: *Patients may undergo biopsy if a post-treatment tumor tissue sample is unavailable.
