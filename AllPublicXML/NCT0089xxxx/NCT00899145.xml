      This research study is looking at breast cancer risk in women who are BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation
      carriers. Studying samples of DNA in the laboratory from women who are BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation
      carriers may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      OBJECTIVE:

      I. To identify potential genetic modifiers of breast cancer risk in women who are carriers of
      the breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1/2, by collecting data and genetic information
      from GOG-0199 and contributing it to the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of
      BRCA-Associated Breast Cancer (CIMBA), an international consortium of clinical cancer
      genetics investigators.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by study, country of residence,
      ethnicity, and birth cohort. Joint analyses of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers are further
      stratified by mutation.

      Previously collected DNA samples and associated clinical information obtained from BRCA
      mutation-positive participants enrolled on GOG-0199 are studied. DNA samples are analyzed by
      mutation testing for variants (i.e., single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) in candidate
      genes of interest. Once genetic testing for a given set of variants has been completed, the
      coded laboratory data file is merged with selected demographic, clinical, and epidemiological
      data obtained from the GOG-0199 baseline questionnaire and submitted to the Consortium of
      Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA-Associated Breast Cancer (CIMBA) Central Database to
      analyze and publish the data. The epidemiological and SNP data contributed to the central
      database are then distributed to the investigators responsible for analysis of a particular
      SNP or set of SNPs from a candidate gene or genetic pathway.
