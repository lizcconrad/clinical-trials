      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may
      help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer. It may also help doctors predict how well patients respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at biomarkers that may predict response to
      tamoxifen and letrozole in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer treated on
      clinical trial CAN-NCIC-MA17.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the prognostic utility of the MGH 2-gene and the GHI 21-gene expression
           signatures in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer treated with tamoxifen
           followed by either placebo or letrozole on clinical trial CAN-NCIC-MA17.

        -  Assess the ability of the MGH 2-gene and the GHI 21-gene expression signatures to
           predict responsiveness to letrozole.

        -  Compare the prognostic utility of quantitative immunofluorescence vs standard
           immunohistochemistry of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER-2, tumor
           aromatase, cyclooxygenase-2, GATA-3, and NAT-1 in these patients.

        -  Assess the ability of quantitative immunofluorescence and standard immunohistochemistry
           of these proteins to predict responsiveness to letrozole in these patients.

        -  Use gene discovery from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens to identify
           novel gene expression profiles that may predict outcome and responsiveness to letrozole
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a controlled study.

      Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast tumor tissue samples are analyzed for MGH 2-gene and
      GHI 21-gene expression signatures using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
      Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence are used for analysis of estrogen receptor,
      progesterone receptor, HER-1 and -2, aromatase, GATA-3, NAT-1, and cyclooxygenase-2.
      Microarray hybridization is used to identify novel gene expression signatures.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 957 specimens will be accrued for this study.
