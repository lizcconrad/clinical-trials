    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the confocal endomicroscopy imaging of the biliary
      strictures during ERCP will differentiate between benign and malignant strictures in vivo and
      has increased sensitivity compared to biliary brushing/biopsy, and that direct
      cholangioscopic guidance of pCLE is more accurate than fluoroscopic guidance.

    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances in biliary imaging and biliary tissue acquisition, the diagnosis and
      tissue-confirmation in suspected malignant biliary obstruction remains challenging. Patients
      often undergo repeat endoscopic and cross sectional imaging procedures, and even surgical
      exploration to establish a diagnosis. A major new advancement in cancer imaging is the
      development of a probe-based confocal endomicroscopy (pCLE) system capable of cellular and
      sub-cellular imaging of the biliary tree. Preliminary data suggests that pCLE can accurately
      detect or exclude malignancy within otherwise indeterminate strictures. In this study, we
      propose to validate these preliminary findings and compare two methods of pCLE image
      acquisition that are important for clinical translation of the technology.

      This is a Phase 1 Study: During this study, in vivo microscopic images of 10 benign
      (post-operative from know benign disease such as orthotopic liver transplant) and 10
      malignant (cytology-positive) strictures will be obtained at ERCP. Patients clinical course
      will be followed and a composite gold standard will be used for comparison to pCLE. These
      confocal images of biliary lesions will be reviewed side by side, unblinded to the reference
      standard by the endoscopists. The basic image characteristics allowing distinction between
      benign and malignant tissue will be established (details of features noted and examined are
      below). We will also assess whether good quality images can be feasibly obtained without the
      cholangioscopic guidance.
