        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis at The Vancouver General Hospital
        or the BCCA-Vancouver.

        Eligible patients will have one of the following underlying diseases:

          -  High risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first complete remission, with high
             risk being defined by the presence of t(4;11), t(9;22) or t(1;19) or patients
             presenting with extreme hyperleukocytosis (WBC &gt;100x109/L) or failure to achieve a
             complete remission after standard induction therapy.

          -  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission with high risk cytogenetics
             or failure to achieve complete remission after standard induction therapy. ALL or AML
             in second or subsequent remission

          -  Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia.

          -  Chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic (failed interferon and/or Gleevec) or accelerated
             phase.

          -  Myelodysplastic syndrome with IPSS risk category &gt;Int-1

          -  Acceptance of standard blood product support

          -  Adequate organ function as defined by current Leukemia/BMT Program of BC standards
             (Appendix 10.1)

          -  Karnofsky performance status â‰¥ 80 (Appendix 10.2)
