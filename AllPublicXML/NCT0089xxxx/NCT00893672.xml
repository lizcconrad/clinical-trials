    <textblock>
      Current guidelines recommend Routine daily chest radiographs (CXRs) for mechanically
      ventilated patients in intensive care units (ICUs). However, some ICUs have shifted to an
      On-demand strategy, in which this CXR is only prescribed if warranted by the patient's status
      at the morning physical examination. Here the investigators compared Routine and On-demand
      strategies in 21 French ICUs. The working hypothesis was that CXR prescriptions would fall by
      at least 20% with the On-demand strategy, with no reduction in quality of care.

      Based on a cluster-randomized two-period two-strategies cross-over design, respectively 11
      and 10 participating ICUs applied the Routine and On-demand strategies during the first
      period, each enrolling 20 consecutive patients requiring mechanical ventilation for at least
      two days. Each ICUs applied then applied the alternative strategy during the second period,
      again enrolling 20 consecutive patients.
