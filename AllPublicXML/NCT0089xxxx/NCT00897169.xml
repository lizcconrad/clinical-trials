    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe and Japan. The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate
      the possible difference in the development of type 2 diabetes in a Japanese and a Caucasian
      population. Healthy subjects, subjects with impaired glucose tolerance, as well as subjects
      with type 2 diabetes will be included in the trial. The development of type 2 diabetes across
      the cohort will be investigated with regard to insulin sensitivity and B-cell capacity.
