      Chronic headache is a common symptom in children. Pharmacologic treatment has only a limited
      productivity and several known adverse reactions. Despite the frequency and chronicity of
      pediatric headache, validated treatment paradigms are currently inadequate.

      Biofeedback is a medical treatment in which physiologic markers like heart rate, breathing
      rate, EMG, EEG, or electrodermal activity are measured and displayed back to the patient. The
      patient can then attempt to modulate physiology to achieve a certain feedback goal,such as
      slowing heart or breath rate, or relaxing certain muscles. Numerous psychophysiologic studies
      have been conducted that examine the effect of biofeedback alone on physiology as well as
      various clinical conditions. Clinical trials for chronic headaches have found that
      biofeedback was more effective in the treatment of headache when compared to pure drug
      therapy.

      A number of recent distraction interventions for acute pain in children and adolescents have
      employed virtual reality technology in conjunction with either a passive distraction
      stimulus, such as a movie, or an interactive distraction activity, such as a computer game.
      However, the actual benefit of VR technology over and above the benefits of the distracting
      stimulus that is experienced through the VR equipment has not been adequately tested in
      children.

      The objective of this study is to combine virtual reality with biofeedback in order to
      increase the effectivity of both techniques in decreasing chronic headache frequency and pain
      degree in the pediatric population.
