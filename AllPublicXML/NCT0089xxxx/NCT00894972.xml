  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be a randomized clinical trial designed to determine the most
      effective physical therapy program for individuals who have undergone lumbar discectomy
      surgery. The study will compare two different post-operative physical therapy programs
      (general strengthening or general + specific strengthening). Both groups will begin treatment
      2 weeks post-surgery. Subjects in both groups will receive weekly treatment sessions for 8
      weeks with a treatment program emphasizing exercises shown to activate the large trunk
      muscles without imposing potentially harmful compression or shear forces. The general +
      specific strengthening group will also receive exercises shown to isolate activation of the
      deep trunk muscles, in particular the multifidus, with training augmented by the use of
      diagnostic ultrasound biofeedback. Patient assessments will be conducted pre- and
      post-surgery, as well as 10 (post-treatment) and 26 weeks after surgery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18-60 years old

          -  Diagnosis of LDH based on imaging (MRI or CT scan) of the lumbar spine with concurring
             clinical examination findings (based on the judgment of the attending neurosurgeon)

          -  Appropriate surgical candidate based on the opinion of the attending spine surgeon,
             and scheduled for single-level lumbar discectomy (open or micro-discectomy).

          -  Able to attend weekly treatment sessions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior surgery to the lumbar spine

          -  Spondylolytic or degenerative spondylolisthesis present on pre-surgical imaging

          -  Unable to speak and understand English

          -  Peri- or post-operative complication (infection, nerve injury, dural tear, vascular
             injury, etc.) that would limit or delay the ability to participate in post-operative
             rehabilitation.

          -  Multi-level surgery or the use of instrumentation during surgery (i.e., lumbar fusion)
