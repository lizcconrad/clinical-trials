      RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of tissue from patients with cancer to study in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that may occur in DNA after radiation
      therapy and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at changes in DNA after radiation therapy in
      patients with prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring specimens, both frozen and paraffin-embedded,
           to yield RNA of adequate quality to perform DNA microarray studies on markers of
           radiotherapy outcome in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the gene expression results from frozen tissue and paraffin-embedded tissue to
           see the correlation between the 2 methods in patients treated on the brachytherapy alone
           arm of protocol RTOG-0232.

        -  Find genes that are expressed differentially before and after radiation therapy in
           patients treated on the brachytherapy plus external-beam radiation therapy arm of
           protocol RTOG-0232.

        -  Find gene expression patterns in patients treated on either arm of protocol RTOG-0232
           who have significant associations with biochemically as well as clinically apparent
           local and distant failure.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, pilot study.

      Frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue samples are studied for biomarker/laboratory analysis.
      DNA microarray analysis is performed on the samples to assess markers of radiotherapy
      outcome.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 156 patients will be accrued for this study.
