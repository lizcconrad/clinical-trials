      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors
      predict how patients respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is examining biological markers in patients with follicular
      lymphoma treated on clinical trial SWOG-8809, SWOG-9800, or SWOG-9911.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the prognostic significance of MUM-1, lymphoma-associated macrophages, and
           regulatory T cells in patients with follicular lymphoma treated on clinical trials
           SWOG-8809, SWOG-9800, or SWOG-9911 representing pre- and post-monoclonal antibody
           therapy protocols.

        -  Determine whether these factors have similar prognostic significance in patients treated
           with chemotherapy alone vs chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody therapy on these
           clinical trials.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Previously collected tissue samples from patients are analyzed by immunohistochemistry, gene
      expression profiling, and quantitative analysis for MUM1 expression, lymphoma-associated
      macrophages, FOXP3-positive regulatory T cells, CD68, and CD163.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 318 samples will be accrued for this study.
