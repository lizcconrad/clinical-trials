    <measure>Overall Response Rate (Complete Response + Partial Response) at the End of Cycles 3 and 6 Using the 2007 International Working Group Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3 (end of cycle 3), Month 6 (end of cycle 6)</time_frame>
    <description>The International Working Group (IWG) criteria (Cheson et al 2007) for a complete response is a complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. A partial response is at least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses, no increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver or spleen, and no new sites of disease should be observed.
95% CIs are calculated using binomial exact method.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Estimate for Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Month 43</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response is defined as the time between the date of the first response to date of progression or death. Response is determined on the basis of the 2007 IWG criteria. A complete response is a complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. A partial response is at least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses, no increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver or spleen, and no new sites of disease should be observed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Estimate for Progression-Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Month 45</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the time from first exposure to study medication to disease progression or relapse, or death due to any cause. Progression is defined using the 2007 International Working Group criteria, as any new lesion or increase by at least 50% of previously involved sites from nadir.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Estimate for Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Month 57</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from first exposure to study medication to death, or to last date from adverse events, concomitant medications, vital signs, lost to follow-up, or last known alive, for overall survival censoring date.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shifts in Baseline to Post-Treatment in Positron Emission Tomography (PET)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Days -30 to 0), post treatment (up to Month 9, 30 days following completion of therapy)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants had a whole-body PET at baseline and at the end of cycle 6 or the end-of-treatment visit. Negative PET refers to PET results showing no abnormal lymph nodes; conversely, positive PET refers to PET results showing abnormal lymph nodes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shifts in Baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (baseline) up to Month 8</time_frame>
    <description>The ECOG scale is:
Grade 0: Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease activities without restriction;
Grade 1: Restricted in physically strenuous activity, ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light nature;
Grade 2: Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to work. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours;
Grade 3: Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair &gt; 50% of waking hours;
Grade 4: Completely disabled. Cannot carry on any self-care. Confined to bed or Chair.
The shift table compares baseline ECOG scores to the ECOG scores as of the last treatment visit.</description>

    <description>Bendamustine at 90 mg/m^2 intravenously (iv) on days 1 and 2 of each 28-day cycle. Dosage calculations for bendamustine are based on the patient's body surface area (BSA) at baseline, using actual weight for calculations. If there is a 10% change in a patient's weight during treatment, the most recent weight is used to recalculate the BSA. The new BSA is used in determining the doses to be administered in any subsequent cycles.</description>

          <description>The presence of B symptoms is a marker for more advanced disease with systemic, rather than merely local, involvement.
B symptoms include:
Fever greater than 38 °C. Pel-Ebstein fever, the classic intermittent fever associated with Hodgkin disease, occurs at variable intervals of days to weeks and lasts for 1–2 weeks before resolving. However, fever associated with lymphoma can follow virtually any pattern.
Drenching sweats, especially at night.
Unintentional weight loss of &gt;10% of normal body weight over a period of 6 months or less.</description>

        <description>The International Working Group (IWG) criteria (Cheson et al 2007) for a complete response is a complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. A partial response is at least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses, no increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver or spleen, and no new sites of disease should be observed.
95% CIs are calculated using binomial exact method.</description>

        <description>Duration of response is defined as the time between the date of the first response to date of progression or death. Response is determined on the basis of the 2007 IWG criteria. A complete response is a complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. A partial response is at least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses, no increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver or spleen, and no new sites of disease should be observed.</description>

          <description>Duration of response is defined as the time between the date of the first response to date of progression or death. Response is determined on the basis of the 2007 IWG criteria. A complete response is a complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. A partial response is at least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses, no increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver or spleen, and no new sites of disease should be observed.</description>

        <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the time from first exposure to study medication to disease progression or relapse, or death due to any cause. Progression is defined using the 2007 International Working Group criteria, as any new lesion or increase by at least 50% of previously involved sites from nadir.</description>
