      The post traumatic stress disorder PTSD arises when the physiological response to stress does
      not come to its term. This study aims to explore the cognitive, psycho physiological and
      cerebral mechanisms involved in PTSD, in fear conditioning and face matching tasks, before
      and after treatment.PTSD patients will be recruited by Pr Jean-Claude Samuelian in his
      service at the Conception Hospital and by Pr Jean-Michel Azorin in his service at the Sainte
      Marguerite Hospital (Marseille) and will undergo either CBT or EMDR within those same
      services. The tasks they will be asked to perform will study the psycho physiological,
      cognitive and central mechanisms involved in PTSD and its treatment. All in all, 17 healthy
      controls will be recruited as well as 17 PTSD patients for each of the two treatment group.In
      terms of perspectives, this study would help isolate neural systems functionally involved in
      PTSD and its treatment. A better knowledge of those mechanisms would set room for the
      optimization of the current PTSD treatment.
