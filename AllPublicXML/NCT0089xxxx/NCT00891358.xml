  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will begin to develop a culturally appropriate secondary prevention intervention
      for young HIV+ women through focus groups.

      Using three intervention sites, focus groups will guide the development of the intervention's
      framework and content areas. An intervention will be developed/adapted through the data
      collected in the focus groups and review of relevant interventions. The intervention aims to
      address the following concerns: 1) reducing the risk of young women infected with HIV
      transmitting the virus to their sexual partners, and 2) preventing young women infected with
      HIV from re-infection with a new viral strain or co-infection with another sexually
      transmitted disease.

      This study will develop/adapt a culturally appropriate secondary prevention intervention for
      young HIV+ women through focus groups. Using three intervention sites, focus groups will
      guide the development of the intervention's framework and content areas. An initial list of
      content areas and potential activities for presentation to the focus groups will be developed
      by the protocol team by reviewing existing HIV prevention interventions that have been
      implemented with adolescents and young adults, as well as interventions that have targeted
      HIV+ populations.

      Three focus groups will be convened (1 per selected ATN site) with young women living with
      HIV to solicit information on their intervention needs. All focus groups will be digitally
      recorded and transcribed. Executive summaries of the groups will focus on the major themes
      elicited by probes that explore the proposed content and structure of the interventions. The
      summaries will be generated by members of the Protocol Team and based on a review and
      integration of data from a) focus group flip charts; b) digitally recorded comments from
      participants; c) digitally recorded oral summaries by moderators offered during the focus
      groups; and d) thematic notes taken by the assistant moderator during the focus groups. Based
      on the outcome of the focus groups, intervention modules will be developed and modified in
      collaboration with the Youth Advisory Team.
