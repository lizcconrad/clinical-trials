    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.
      It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research trial is studying matrix metalloproteinases after surgery or
      radiofrequency ablation in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Describe the kinetics of postoperative changes of serum matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)
           (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9) and their inhibitors (TIMP) (TIMP-1, TIMP-2) as a function
           of surgical technique.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the predictive value of postoperative risk of recurrence.

        -  Correlate the risk of recurrence with surgical technique.

        -  Determine whether elevated serum levels of MMP are a better marker than the
           carcinoembryonic antigen of hepatic or extrahepatic recurrence.

        -  Determine whether the postoperative serum of HGF/SF is correlated to changes in plasma
           levels of MMPs.

      OUTLINE: Blood samples are collected periodically before and after treatment to analyze for
      metalloproteinases and their inhibitors.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at day 45 and then every 3 months
      for 2 years.
