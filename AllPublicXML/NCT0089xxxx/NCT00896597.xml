  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, randomized study in patients with different severity stages of hepatic
      cirrhosis, in which rater pairs will be used for the assessment of the intra- and inter-rater
      reproducibility of NRL972 pharmacokinetics and CTP sum score. Rating will be performed by 32
      to 40 pairs of raters. The raters will perform the required assessments in the capacity of
      sub-investigators of the phase I (co-ordinating) unit.

      Up to 240 patients with clinically established hepatic cirrhosis without confounding
      end-stage co-morbidity (stable disease) will be studied. Within 30 days of confirmation of
      eligibility, Visit 1 will take place to determine the investigational parameters (NRL972
      pharmacokinetics, clinical laboratory tests, and determination of CTP sum score). At
      approximate intervals of one week, Visits 2, 3 and 4 will occur, and the investigational
      parameters will again be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to give written Informed Consent.

             adequate contraception).

          -  Ethnicity: Any.

          -  Age: 18 to 80 years of age.

          -  Patient volunteers with a diagnosis of clinically stable hepatic cirrhosis with a CTP
             class A, B and C but excluding patient volunteers with the diagnosis of primary
             biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and cystic fibrosis-associated liver
             disease.

          -  No previous liver transplantation or intended liver transplantation within the next 6
             months after enrollment.

          -  No previous transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) or portocaval
             anastomosis (PCA).

          -  Medically fit to undergo the protocol-defined procedures without undue risk and
             discomfort.

          -  No previous participation in a study with an investigational product within 90 days
             prior to enrolment except epidemiologic or observational studies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous participation in this trial (except for scheduled re-testing in relation to
             technical difficulties with initial test or rescreening).

          -  Donation of blood during the last 60 days or a history of excessive blood loss within
             the last 3 months, assessed using clinical judgement.

          -  Any donation of germ cells, blood, organs or bone marrow during the course of the
             study.
