      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of Radiofrequency ablation in
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients with primary tumor less than 5 cm before medical
      treatment. Ablation may allow for reduced morbidity and may increase the likelihood of
      patients receiving systemic therapy.

      Nephrectomy has become an integral part of the management of patients with metastatic kidney
      cancer. Performing nephrectomy in these patients is not without risk, however. The very real
      chance of significant metastatic disease progression during the postoperative period or
      complication before or during surgery that may prolong postoperative recovery could
      potentially delay or prevent the administration of systemic therapy in the postoperative
      period. Patient selection for surgery remains critical for success.

      Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a medical procedure where tumor is ablated using microwave
      energy to treat a medical disorder. The benefits of RFA in selected metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma patients with small primary tumor (&lt;5 cm) will be evaluated in this Phase I/II
      study.

    <description>Patients undergo ablation by radiofrequency energy under CT-guidance. RFA continues until the entire tumor is treated. Treatment ceases when the entire lesion has undergone necrosis or the zone of necrosis or significant heat deposition approaches vital neurovascular structures. 38 patients will receive following immunotherapy with Interferon-alpha 9 MIU subcutaneously three times per week, 3 weeks on, 3 weeks off till progression. 38 patients will receive sunitinib maleate 50 mg orally once day, 28 days on, 14 days off till progression. Evaluation for response will be after second cycle.</description>
