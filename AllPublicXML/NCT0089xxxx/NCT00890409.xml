      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and safety of selective head
      cooling (SHC) in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) remains a major cause of neonatal death and long term
      disabilities. Data from animal studies have shown protective effects of mild hypothermia to
      both the mature and immature brain. Recently research priorities have moved from bench to
      bedside. Several studies have shown a trend for brain protection of mild to moderate
      hypothermia and mild hypothermia has emerged as a promising treatment for HIE. Therefore,the
      investigators organized a multi-centered randomized controlled trial of selective head
      cooling (SHC) combined with mild systemic hypothermia in HIE newborn infants.

    <description>The group was fitted with a cooling cap around the head for 72 hours. The temperature of the cap could be adjusted between 5 to 20 degree C and was automatically regulated by a servo-controlled temperature probe placed in the nasopharynx to maintain the nasopharyngeal temperature at (34±0.2)degree C. All infants were nursed under a servo-controlled radiant warmer and the rectal temperature was maintained at 34.5 to 35 degree C. Head cooling was started within 6 hours after birth for 72 hours followed by spontaneous re-warming and the average time to reach the target temperature was 2 hours.</description>

    <description>A semiconductor water circulation cooling device (YJW608-04B, Henyang Radio Manufactory, Hunan, China) was used to conduct head cooling. The hypothermia group was fitted with a cooling cap around the head for 72 hours. The temperature of the cap could be adjusted between 5 to 20 degree C and was automatically regulated by a servo-controlled temperature probe placed in the nasopharynx to maintain the nasopharyngeal temperature at (34±0.2)degree C.

        <title>Major Adverse Events</title>
        <description>Major adverse events were defined as severe arrhythmia (II or III degree A-V block or atrial or ventricular arrhythmia), major venous thrombosis, refractory hypotension (mean blood pressure less than 40 mmHg), moderate or severe scleredema (greater or equal to 20% body surface area), and severe bleeding.</description>

            <description>The group was fitted with a cooling cap around the head for 72 hours. The temperature of the cap could be adjusted between 5 to 20 degree C and was automatically regulated by a servo-controlled temperature probe placed in the nasopharynx to maintain the nasopharyngeal temperature at (34±0.2)degree C.</description>
