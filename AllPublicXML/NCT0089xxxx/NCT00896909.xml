      RATIONALE: Collecting samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer to study in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that may occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at HER-2 mutations in tumor samples from patients
      with advanced non-small cell lung cancer being treated with trastuzumab on clinical trial
      ECOG-2598.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Correlate clinical response to trastuzumab (Herceptin®) with the presence of mutation in
           the HER-2 kinase domain in tumor samples from patients with advanced non-small cell lung
           cancer treated on protocol ECOG-2598.

        -  Correlate mutations with time to progression and survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Tissue specimens are analyzed by polymerase chain reaction to assess mutations in the HER-2
      gene. Laboratory/biomarker analysis data is correlated with clinical data from protocol
      ECOG-2598.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-44 patients will be accrued for this study.
