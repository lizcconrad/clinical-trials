      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and bone marrow in the laboratory from patients with
      cancer may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify genes related
      to cancer. It may also help doctors diagnose cancer and predict how patients will respond to
      treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is identifying cancer-related genes in blood and/or bone marrow
      samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To identify and validate individual genes for diagnosis of three major translocations in
           acute myeloid leukemia.

        -  To correlate transcript expression data in the various translocations with age, sex,
           race, response to treatment, and survival and with other known mutations.

      OUTLINE: Blood and/or bone marrow samples previously procured from patients on CALGB-9665 are
      obtained from the CALGB Leukemia Tissue Bank from patients enrolled on CALGB AML treatment
      studies. Mononuclear cells are isolated from samples and mRNA is extracted. Gene expression
      profiles are analyzed via custom mRNA microarray and confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR.

    <description>This is a CALGB Leukemia Tissue Bank project makes use of tissue from patients who have previously provided their consent. Diagnostic samples from patients enrolled on CALGB AML treatment studies (eg, CALGB 9621, 9710, and 19808) and who have been registered on the companion Leukemia Tissue Bank Protocol CALGB 9665 were used.</description>
