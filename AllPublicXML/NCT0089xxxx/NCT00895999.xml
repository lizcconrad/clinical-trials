  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with depression and pain have poorer outcomes in response to depression treatments
      than depressed patients without pain. While psychotherapy treatment studies have demonstrated
      improvement in pain and depression, no psychosocial interventions have been developed and
      tested prospectively specifically for patients with both conditions. Interpersonal
      psychotherapy (IPT), an effective treatment for depression, has been adapted successfully for
      physically ill patients and demonstrates good adherence, treatment satisfaction, and
      depression outcomes. The investigators propose to test a modified form of IPT-P for depressed
      patients with co-morbid pain.

    <description>IPT-P focuses on improving relationships as a way to improve depression and pain. The patient and therapist work together to improve communication and enhance relationships and social support. Patients choose a problem focus and goal related to both their pain and depression. Up to 8 IPT-P sessions are provided regardless of ability to pay.</description>

    <description>Research staff connect patients with the Strong Family Therapy Services, Women's Behavioral Health Service, or other appropriate mental health care and reduce potential barriers from making it to the initial appointment. This support includes navigating insurance issues, addressing issues of childcare and transportation, helping to schedule the initial appointment, reminder calls, and follow-up after the scheduled intake. Research staff will also check-in monthly to see if the patients require any additional support to remain in mental health treatment. Up to 8 therapy sessions are covered regardless of ability to pay.</description>
