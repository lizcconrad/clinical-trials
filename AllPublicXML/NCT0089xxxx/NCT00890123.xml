  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The perioperative administration of n-3 fatty acids has been shown to lead to favorable
      effects on outcome in patients with severe surgical interventions by lowering the magnitude
      of inflammatory response and by modulating the immune response. No study with preoperative
      administration of IV omega 3 fatty acids as a part of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or
      monotherapy with it to demonstrate its effects on inflammatory and immune response has been
      conducted. So, this study has been planned to judge the inflammatory response of preoperative
      monotherapy with IV omega 3 fatty acids in elderly patients undergoing hip surgery
      considering the hyper-inflammation associated with this type of surgery in elderly patients.
