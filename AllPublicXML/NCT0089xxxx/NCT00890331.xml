      Establish the efficacy of a brief, clinic-based prevention program of teamwork coping skills
      for youth and their parents during in a high risk period of early adolescence (11-14 yrs)
      when parental involvement and self-care deterioration occurs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Promotion of optimal disease care and metabolic control in youth with Type 1 diabetes is an
      important goal of disease management during early adolescence. Typically youth assume
      increasing responsibility for these goals along with parental involvement and guidance.
      However, as youth progress through adolescence, parents often become less involved in
      diabetes management and poorer self-care and metabolic control often results.

      The goal of the prevention program is to encourage parents to remain involved in their
      child's diabetes care throughout adolescence and to provide tools to help make that
      involvement a positive experience. To minimize parent/child conflict that may accompany
      sustained parental involvement, sessions of the active treatment review the following coping
      skills: communication, problem solving, conflict resolution, attitude and behavior change.
      Meetings occur in-clinic in conjunction with four consecutive medical appointments.

      The educational comparison group also meets with study researchers for in-clinic sessions
      that occur in conjunction with four consecutive medical appointments. Families discuss a
      variety of helpful educational diabetes topics and resources.

      The overarching project goal is to demonstrate the efficacy of a brief, prevention focused
      coping skills program for youth with type 1 diabetes and their parents with the ultimate goal
      of translation into routine pediatric care.
