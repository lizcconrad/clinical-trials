  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the suggested study is to identify changes in MEG correlates caused by the
      add-on treatment with the changes in negative symptoms of schizophrenia by comparing the
      change in the MEG correlates of the subjects before and during usage of new add on treatments
      for negative symptoms.

      The investigators hypothesize that the gravity of negative symptoms will correlate with a
      trend towards more aberrant electroencephalographic correlates mainly in continuous
      parameters, with an emphasis on alpha and delta bands

      There is a paucity of information regarding electrophysiological correlates of negative
      symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia. The proposed study is set out to compare
      the MEG correlates of negative symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia to those of
      healthy controls in terms of both relevant ERP components and quantified (continuous) MEG.

      The presented study will include two parts: Part A will explore the electrophisological
      correlates of negative symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia using MEG. The study
      will do so by comparing the electrophisological correlates of schizophrenia patients
      suffering from negative symptoms and stable on psychiatric treatment to those of healthy
      controls. In the second part of the study data from part A of patients that have started new
      add-on treatments for negative symptoms will be compared to parallel data acquired after
      stabilization on the new treatment.
