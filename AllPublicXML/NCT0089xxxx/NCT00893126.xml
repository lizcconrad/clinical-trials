      The purpose of this study is to compare the prevalence and severity of CAD (coronary artery
      disease) in patients with and without severe psoriasis, otherwise matched for cardiovascular
      risk factors.

      To establish the relationship between psoriasis and coronary disease by comparing the
      prevalence and severity of CAD (coronary artery disease) in patients with and without severe
      psoriasis, otherwise matched for cardiovascular risk factors, as determined by CT coronary
      calcium scoring and Coronary CT angiography.

      31 ml of blood will be drawn in conjunction with this study.Lipid, Glucose and Lipoprotein
      will be drawn in one SST tube = 7 ml. Insulin (INS) will be collected in one Green top tube =
      7 ml. HSCRP- will be collected in on SSS tube = 7 ml. IL-6 will be collected in Red or
      Lavender top tube = 7 ml. An additional 3 ml will be drawn for ICAM testing. (The blood for
      the ICAM testing and IL- 6 will be drawn and frozen until funding has been obtained to run
      these tests). Specimens will be be properly disposed of after testing is completed.

        Subjects with severe psoriasis will be selected prospectively from the clinics of the
        University of Michigan, Dept. of Dermatology.

        The comparison group (subjects without psoriasis) will be targeted in the Dermatology
        clinic by screening for matching variables before enrollment. This group will be matched by
        age and gender to the psoriasis population, and on Framingham risk score.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with severe psoriasis as determined by more than two episodes of systemic or
             inpatient treatment and 10% or more body surface area involvement.

          2. Male or female ages 18 to 55 (because CAD risk has been shown to be greatest in
             younger psoriasis patients in earlier studies, this pilot study will focus on young
             individuals).

          3. Able to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior diagnosis of CAD (coronary artery disease) or heart disease based upon one or
             more of the following:

               -  coronary arteriography

               -  percutaneous coronary intervention

               -  cardiac surgery including bypass graft surgery

               -  valve surgery

               -  congenital heart disease repair

               -  stress ECG or imaging

               -  myocardial infarction

               -  angina or unstable angina

               -  congestive heart failure

               -  cardiomyopathy

          2. History of anti-oxidants such as fish oil or biologic therapy Tumor Necrosis Factor
             alpha inhibitors (such as etanercept, adalimumab, or infliximab). A recent review by
             Sattar et al [22] has shown preliminary evidence that TNF (tumor necrosis factor)
             blockade can modulate nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors such as C-reactive
             protein(CRP), Interleukin-6(IL-6), Apolipoprotein AI(ApoAI), Lipoprotein(a)(Lp[a]),
             Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), and homocysteine to exert a possible vascular and
             metabolic protective effect.

          3. Pustular and erythrogenic psoriasis

          4. Unable to give informed consent

          5. Contraindications to coronary CT, including:

               -  Irregular heart rate, such as multiple PVCs (premature ventricular contractions),
                  atrial fibrillation

               -  Active heart failure

               -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5mg/dl

               -  Weight &gt; 320 lbs (due to degradation in CT (computerized tomography)image quality
                  by image noise)

               -  History of severe allergy to intravenous contrast media

               -  High irregular heart rate with contraindications to beta-blockers

               -  Pregnant
