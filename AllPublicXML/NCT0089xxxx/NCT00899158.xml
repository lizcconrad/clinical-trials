      RATIONALE: Learning about biological markers in patients with pancreatic cancer and cachexia
      may help doctors predict patient outcome and may help the study of cancer in the future.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is examining biological markers in patients with pancreatic
      cancer experiencing weight loss.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare levels of caspase-3 and phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) in the rectus abdominous
           muscle of patients with pancreatic cancer who are experiencing cachexia and are
           undergoing surgery for diagnosis or primary therapy with patients who have not lost
           weight and are undergoing abdominal surgery for nonmalignant conditions.

        -  Compare levels of urinary 3-methylhistidine (3-MH) in these patients.

        -  Evaluate possible correlations of caspase-3 activity, pAkt, and urinary 3-MH with early
           time to progression and subsequent lean body weight loss in patients with pancreatic
           cancer.

        -  Associate excretion of urinary 3-MH with higher levels of caspase-3 activity and pAkt to
           analyze the utility of 3-MH as a marker of skeletal muscle proteolysis.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      During surgery, a muscle biopsy is performed and approximately 1 cm of rectus abdominous
      muscle is obtained for analysis. Caspase-3 activity and total/phosphorylated
      phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and Akt are measured in muscle biopsies by western blot
      analysis. 3-methylhistidine activity is measured in urine samples.

      After completion of study, patients with pancreatic cancer are followed postoperatively at 3
      and 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
