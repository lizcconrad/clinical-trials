      Background:

        -  Diabetes is a disease defined by abnormally high blood sugar (glucose) levels. Glucose
           is an essential source of energy for the body s cells, but insulin is required to move
           the glucose into the cells. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that allows
           glucose to enter cells.

        -  In diabetes, the body is unable to supply enough insulin to meet its demands. The
           problem may be a low supply of insulin or a high demand for insulin. Someone who has
           been diagnosed with diabetes has lost much of their insulin-producing capacity. Clinical
           studies have shown that good control of blood sugar is essential to prevent diabetes
           complications like damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and blood vessels.

      Objectives:

        -  To establish a relationship with several individuals with diabetes caused by the immune
           system attacking the body s insulin-producing cells in order to:

        -  Explore why the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells.

        -  Understand why some individuals develop diabetes-related complications and others do
           not.

        -  Develop therapies to improve how patients can control their blood sugar levels.

        -  Continue to follow subjects who have completed or are considering other NIH
           diabetes-related studies.

        -  To develop improved tests for determining an individual s risk for developing diabetes
           and/or to accurately diagnose the exact type of diabetes.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals who have been diagnosed with or are at risk for developing diabetes.

      Design:

        -  Standard physical examination and clinical tests to determine if the patient has
           diabetes or to confirm a particular type of diabetes:

        -  None of the treatment in this study is experimental.

        -  Patients will receive a separate consent form for any special tests needed to learn more
           about their particular type of diabetes.

        -  Patients may be asked to provide additional urine and blood samples for use in
           laboratory research about diabetes.

        -  Researchers may offer medical treatment advice for diabetes, or explain how to improve
           patients diabetes management skills.

      Individuals with known or suspected autoimmune mediated diabetes, or healthy individuals at
      risk for developing the disease, will be evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center. Studies will
      include characterizing the disease s clinical and laboratory features, observing the natural
      history of the disease and its complications, evaluating responses to standard treatments.
      Protocol enrollees may be asked to contribute blood and/or urine samples for immunological
      research studies, and/or for studies designed to find parameters that increase a subject s
      risk for diabetes and/or its associated complications.

        -INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        i. Clinical diagnosis of diabetes, either type 1 (T1D) or insulin-requiring type 2 (T2D),

        ii. Healthy individuals who may be at risk for developing diabetes,

        iii. Individuals with suspected immune mediated diabetes,

        iv. Willingness of the patient or guardian to give informed consent and assent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        i. Concomitant medical problems which would confound the interpretation studies of the
        autoimmune beta cell destructive process

        ii. Concomitant medical, surgical, or other conditions for which adequate facilities or
        funds are not available to support their care at the NIH.

        iii. Any other co-existing condition/circumstances that would make a subject unsuitable to
        participate in the study, as deemed by the investigators.
