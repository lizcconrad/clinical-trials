      RATIONALE: Studying Pap smears in the laboratory from women with atypical glandular cells of
      unspecified significance may help doctors learn more about changes that may occur in DNA and
      identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at Pap smears from women enrolled on clinical trial
      GOG-171.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the diagnostic accuracy of using previously reported morphometric criteria
           for chromatin distribution, shortest distance between nuclei, and/or the ratio of
           nucleoli area to nucleus area in a conventional Pap smear from patients with a cytologic
           diagnosis of atypical glandular cells of unspecified significance (AGUS) to predict the
           presence of significant glandular lesions (i.e., adenocarcinoma in situ [AIS] or
           invasive cancer) and/or squamous lesions (i.e., cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN2
           or CIN3]) of the cervix.

      Secondary

        -  To optimize the diagnostic accuracy of using chromatin distribution, shortest distance
           between nuclei, and/or the ratio of nucleoli area to nucleus area in a conventional Pap
           smear from patients with a cytologic diagnosis of AGUS to predict the presence of
           significant glandular lesions (i.e., AIS or invasive cancer) and/or squamous lesions
           (i.e., CIN2 or CIN3) of the cervix.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected slides from Pap smears of patients enrolled on clinical trial
      GOG-171 are assessed for nuclear chromatin distribution, the shortest distances between the
      central points of neighboring cell nuclei, and nucleoli area/nucleus area (N/N) ratio via
      morphometric analysis.

               -  Original Pap smear used to define the diagnosis must be available for review

          -  Previously enrolled by GOG-JAPAN onto clinical trialGOG-171

               -  Must have been eligible and evaluable for the primary objective of GOG-171

               -  Gave permission to use specimens for future cancer research in GOG-171

          -  Underwent a loop electrosurgical excision procedure/large loop excision of the
             transformation zone (LEEP/LLETZ) procedure on clinical trial GOG-171 to determine the
             presence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN-2 or CIN-3), significant glandular
             lesions (AIS), or invasive cancer
