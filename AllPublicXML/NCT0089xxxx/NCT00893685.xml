    <textblock>
      The DREAMING clinical trial is part of the DREAMING project, which has the objective to
      demonstrate that the DREAMING platform consisting of integrated health monitoring, alarm
      handling and videoconferencing services produces clinical benefits to its users and economic
      benefits to the health authorities. The study evaluates the long-term (30 months) effect of
      continuous use of the DREAMING subsystems and is testing the hypothesis that such use is
      superior to usual care alone in reducing the deterioration of health related quality of life
      that is associated to age and chronic disease. It also tests the hypothesis that the DREAMING
      environment is superior to usual care in delaying the transfer to nursing or elderly homes
      and in reducing the incidence and duration of hospitalisation episodes. The trial will also
      evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the DREAMING platform. Outcomes are assessed in six
      different health care systems (Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden) and will
      represent a basis for the adoption of DREAMING services by the respective health authorities.

      Homes of participants are equipped with environmental sensors, motion detection, and with
      wireless sensors for blood pressure, blood glucose, body weight, blood oxygen saturation,
      peak expiratory flow and electrocardiogram. Disease related parameters are monitored at least
      daily and the measured values are transmitted to a central monitoring unit. In case of
      abnormal values, health alarms are generated and transmitted to the local health authorities
      to trigger eventual intervention by the physicians and nurses who normally follow the
      participants. Participants and health professionals can stay in contact via an easy to use,
      home television based videoconferencing system. Participants are also equipped with a a
      personal alarm and GPS-enhanced localisation system.

    <description>Homes of participants will be equipped with wireless monitors for blood pressure, blood oxygen, blood glucose, peak expiratory flow, electrocardiogram, body weight. All vital parameters are monitored on a continuous, at least daily basis and obtained values are transmitted to a monitoring centre. Abnormal values are classified for their health risk and health alarms and/or intervention of health professionals is triggered.</description>
