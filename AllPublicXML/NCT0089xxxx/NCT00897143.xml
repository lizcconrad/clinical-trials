      RATIONALE: Studying samples of pleural fluid in the laboratory from patients with lung cancer
      may help doctors identify early lung cancer cells. It may also help the study of lung cancer
      in the future.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at malignant pleural effusion samples from patients
      with primary lung cancer to see if early lung cancer cells can be identified.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Isolate and identify lung cancer precursor cells in discarded pleural fluid specimens
           obtained during routine thoracentesis procedures for the diagnosis and treatment of
           malignant pleural effusions.

      OUTLINE: Malignant pleural effusion specimens obtained from the Pathology Department at the
      University Hospitals of Cleveland are analyzed using an immunomagnetic bead enrichment assay
      to isolate cells of epithelial origin. The isolated cells are then stained with fluorescent
      DNA binding dye, Hoechst 33342, and other markers (i.e., CD133, CD24/CD44) and sorted by flow
      cytometry into progenitor and nonprogenitor subpopulations. The sorted subpopulations are
      separated and examined functionally by in vitro and in vivo studies. Sphere culture studies
      are also performed on the sorted subpopulations. The specimens may also be utilized for
      transcriptional profiling studies, RNAi studies, and for the establishment of long-term
      cultures and cell lines. DNA is also isolated and stored from tumor and nonepithelial normal
      cell compartments for future genetic studies on known and unidentified genetic abnormalities
      contributing to the development of lung cancer, such as EGFR, ErbB2, K-ras, and p53
      mutational status.
