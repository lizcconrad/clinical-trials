      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer and predict how patients will respond to
      treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at biomarkers in patients with high-risk melanoma
      receiving high-dose interferon therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To screen serum specimens using a high throughput protein profiling platform that tests
           for the highest number of known biomarkers (detectable by antibodies) that could be
           predictors of response to interferon treatment, autoimmunity, and disease outcome in
           patients with high-risk melanoma undergoing high-dose interferon (IFNa2b) therapy .

        -  To compare soluble factors across all patients at each time point (baseline and during
           therapy).

        -  To compare pre-therapy vs post-therapy serum samples from these patients.

        -  To assess the kinetics of soluble factors' appearance, persistence, and disappearance
           during the 12 months of therapy.

        -  To assess whether the amount of specific soluble factors in the pre-therapy sample is
           predictive of response independent of therapy.

        -  To correlate statistically significant factors with S100 and autoimmunity in these
           patients.

        -  To confirm the data obtained with the Luminex technology.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to survival (&lt; 2 years vs &gt; 5 years).

      Blood samples collected from patients enrolled in E-1694 are analyzed using high throughput
      protein profiling by ELISA to compare changes in levels of putative biomarkers of interferon
      alfa-2b, including cytokines and paired receptors, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules,
      metalloproteinases, angiogenic markers, growth factors, soluble receptors, signal
      transduction molecules, hormones, and other biomarkers of disease and dysregulated immune
      processes, at baseline and during therapy.
