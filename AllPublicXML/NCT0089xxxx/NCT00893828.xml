    <textblock>
      The PAPIRUS III study will continue to follow patients initially enrolled in PAPIRUS II.
      Pressure readings from the investigational device will continue to be collected and will be
      correlated to physiological changes during activities of daily living and protocol defined
      tests.

      This is a small clinical trial to determine the feasibility of a device &amp; to test prototype
      device, where the primary outcome measure relates to feasibility and not to health outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has been enrolled in the PAPIRUS II Study and has a RemonCHF pressure sensor
             implanted

          -  Patient is willing and able to provide informed consent, participate in the Safety
             Follow-up Program and/or in the required tests associated with the clinical
             investigation (Core Study Program) at an approved clinical investigational center and
             at the intervals defined by the Clinical Investigational Plan.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient enrolled in PAPIRUS II but not implanted with a RemonCHF Pressure Sensor

          -  Patients who are currently enrolled in another investigational study or registry that
             would directly interfere with the current study (with the exception of the PAPIRUS II
             Study). Each instance would be brought to the sponsor to determine eligibility.

          -  Age &lt; 18 years

          -  Women of childbearing potential who are, or might be, pregnant at the time of the
