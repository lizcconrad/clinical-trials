      RATIONALE: Studying proteins in head and neck cancer cells in the laboratory may help doctors
      learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at proteins in head and neck cancer cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Define the function and mechanism of LZAP in regulating ARF.

        -  Determine the mechanism and biological consequences of LZAP inhibition of NF-κB.

        -  Determine if LZAP has tumor suppressor activity by conditional targeting of LZAP in
           mice.

      OUTLINE: Using molecular laboratory techniques, this study examines the biochemical
      mechanisms by which LZAP activates transcriptional, tumor suppressive activity (both
      p53-dependent and p53-independent) of ARF and inhibits transcriptional, tumorigenic activity
      of NF-kB. LZAP regulation of newly identified ARF activities, such as S-phase delay and
      ARF-mediated B23 degradation are also evaluated. LZAP's tumor suppressive activity is
      assessed in vivo using a conditional knockout vector to target LZAP in mice and to observe
      for spontaneous and induced tumor formation. Laboratory analyses used to determine study
      endpoints include standard recombinant DNA, recombinant protein expression and purification,
      cell culture and transfection, cell labeling, reporter assays, flow cytometry, yeast-two
      hybrid, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, TUNEL assay, ELISA assay,
      Southern blotting, and protein and gene expression.
