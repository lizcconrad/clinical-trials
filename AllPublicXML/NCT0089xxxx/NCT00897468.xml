      RATIONALE: Changing the genes in laboratory mice to create a living model of human breast
      cancer may help doctors learn more about breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is developing mouse models of breast cancer using tissue samples
      that were previously collected from women with breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To develop new in vivo models of human breast cancer.

        -  To correlate response in this model to actual treatment outcome in patients, if the in
           vivo model is proven feasible.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected breast tumor fragments are implanted into the renal capsule
      site of SCID mouse hosts (mouse with severe combined immune deficiency) to establish
      metastatic spread patterns, and both histologic and molecular tumor characteristics.

      Patients' medical charts are reviewed to obtain relevant information, including general
      demographics, smoking and alcohol use, as well as outcome data such as survival and response
      to treatment.

    <description>Tissue samples will either be collected at the time of medically indicated surgical procedures or through research core biopsies. A sample of urine will also be obtained. Blood will be collected via venipuncture and lymphocytes (mononuclear cells) separated and processed as a source of normal DNA and normal cells.</description>
