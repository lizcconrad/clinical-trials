  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Aromatase inhibitors, such
      as letrozole, anastrozole, and exemestane, may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of
      estrogen the body makes. Hormone therapy, using tamoxifen citrate, may fight breast cancer by
      blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. It is not yet known whether aromatase
      inhibitors or tamoxifen citrate have less effect on memory in patients receiving treatment
      for breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane to
      see how they effect memory compared with tamoxifen citrate in treating postmenopausal women
      with breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate verbal episodic memory in patients with breast cancer after 6 months of
           treatment with aromatase inhibitors (AI) vs tamoxifen citrate.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate cognitive functions of these patients at month 6 and 12 of treatment.

        -  To evaluate the psychological and social impact on these patients at month 6 and 12 of
           treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral tamoxifen citrate once daily for 1 year in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive an oral aromatase inhibitor (letrozole, anastrozole, or
           exemestane) once daily for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      Patients undergo cognitive, psychological, social, and quality of life assessments every 6
      months using the CDS scale, the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, the Mini Mental Test, the
      French version of the National Adult Reading Test, the Benton Visual Retention test, the
      direct and indirect capacities of the WAIS-R, the WMS sequential visual-spatial capacity, the
      dual task test, categorical and formal verbal fluency, the Trail making test, the Stroop
      test, the Wisconsin Card Sorting test, the choice reaction time test, the sequential visual
      spatial capacity, the HADS scale, IADL, and QLQ-C30 questionnaires.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 1 year.
