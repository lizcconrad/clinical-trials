    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of the potential prebiotic beta-glucan on
      the intestinal microflora, the bacterial enzyme activity (beta-glucuronidase and
      beta-glucosidase) in the feces, the fecal pH and the concentration of fecal short-chain fatty
      acid in polypectomized patients. Also the in vitro anti-cyto- and anti-genotoxicity of fecal
      water will be examined on human cell culture (HT29). During the trial, patient's clinical
      symptoms (intestinal habits), physical activity, well-being and food intake will be recorded.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prebiotics, such as short- and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides are fermented by the
      microflora colonizing the gastrointestinal tract, and they selectively stimulate the growth
      or the activity of one or limited number of bacteria within the intestine. Beta-glucans are
      polysaccharides occurring in the bran of cereal grains, the cell wall of Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae and bacteria, certain types of fungi, seaweed and many kinds of mushrooms. The aim
      of this study is to determine the effect of the potential prebiotic beta-glucan on the
      intestinal microflora, the bacterial enzyme activity (beta-glucuronidase and
      beta-glucosidase) in the faeces, the faecal pH, and the concentration of faecal short-chain
      fatty acid in polypectomized patients.
