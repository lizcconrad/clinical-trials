      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may
      help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer. It may also help the study of cancer in the future.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at tumor tissue samples from patients with melanoma
      who have undergone sentinel lymph node biopsy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Develop a predictive model for sentinel lymph node biopsy positivity in patients with
           melanoma who have undergone sentinel lymph node biopsy.

        -  Develop a survival model for relapse based on sentinel lymph node biopsy positivity.

        -  Assess the genetic determinants in primary melanomas that predict a metastatic phenotype
           and thereby improve understanding of the biology of the metastases in melanoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a retrospective, case-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to Breslow thickness of the tumor (0.75-1.50 mm vs 1.51- 4 mm vs &gt; 4 mm) and
      gender.

      Archived tumor tissue is analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for AP2, vascular endothelial
      growth factor, MMP 2, MCM4, and others, if feasible. Sentinel node biopsies are analyzed by
      IHC for CD31, LYVE-1, and D2-40 expression. RNA and DNA are also extracted for genetic
      expression studies and mutation analysis (e.g., BRAF, NRAS, PTEN, CDKN2A).

      Patient data related to relapse and recurrence is collected, if available.

      Peer reviewed and funded or endorsed by Cancer Research UK

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,000 patients will be accrued for this study.
