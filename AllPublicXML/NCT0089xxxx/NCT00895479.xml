  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in renal failure on hemodialysis depend on adequate and sustained vascular access.
      This can be achieved by surgical placement of a synthetic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
      graft. These patients frequently experience graft complications arising from the development
      of smooth muscle cell (SMC) neointimal hyperplasia in the proximity of the graft-vein
      anastomosis. Such complications eventually lead to stenosis, access thrombosis and graft
      failure. Trinam® is being developed to prolong graft survival. It is a combination product
      consisting of a replication deficient Adenovirus containing the human Vascular Endothelial
      Growth Factor D (Ad-VEGF-D) gene and a biodegradable local delivery device (collar) made of
      collagen. At the end of the surgical procedure to insert the PTFE graft the collagen collar
      is applied around the anastomosis and sealed with a collagen surgical sealant. This procedure
      creates a reservoir between the site of anastomosis and the collagen collar. The adenoviral
      vector is then injected into this reservoir, localizing the expression of the transgene to
      the site of the anastomosis. Expression of VEGF-D has been shown to have a vascular
      protective role and inhibit SMC neointimal proliferation, therefore expression of VEGF-D
      should prolong graft survival.

             replacement (after failure of previous vascular access) of an end-to-side or
             end-to-end 6.0 mm synthetic PTFE arteriovenous hemodialysis access arm graft.

          -  Male or female aged 18 years or over.
