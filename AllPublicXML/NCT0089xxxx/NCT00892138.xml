      This study will assess the short and long term effects of a group-based mindfulness programme
      (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, MBSR) on first year medical and psychology students at
      the Universities of Oslo and Tromso.

      The primary outcome variables are mental distress, student stress and subsequent work stress,
      subjective wellbeing, empathy, mindfulness and spirituality. The investigators will also
      study explanatory moderator and mediator variables.

      The study will be a two-centre randomized controlled study involving 288 medical and
      psychology students from the University of Oslo and from the University of Tromso. The sample
      size calculation is based on a reduction in mental distress and perceived medical/psychology
      school stress of 20% in the intervention group. The control group will not receive an
      intervention. After the initial seven week course (taking place in 2009 and 2010) the
      intervention group will receive a follow-up session of 1.5 hours twice a year throughout
      their study course of 5-6 years. The follow-up period will last until 1 year after graduation
      in the Oslo cohort and until 3 years after graduation in the Tromso cohort.
