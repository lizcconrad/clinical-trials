  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is not only unpleasant for patients but also can
      delay hospital discharge and increase cost of stay. In some cases, when severe vomiting
      occurs, pain scores seem to be increased. The overall incidence of PONV is 30% and increases
      to 79% in patients at high risk for this post-operative outcome. The NUSS procedure is
      considered to be a procedure with a high risk for the outcome of nausea and vomiting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale is to do a prospective study in patients who have been diagnosed with Pectus
      Excavatum and who are undergoing a NUSS procedure (pectus excavatum correction) and to
      evaluate the effect of Acupressure on the post-operative outcome of PONV in these patients.
      Also, to determine whether there are any secondary outcomes related to pain scores and length
      of hospital stay.

    <description>A band with bead attachment will be used to produce Acupressure and applied to the P6 (three fingers breath from the wrist crease on th ventral surface of the upper limb). The application will be done 20 minutes prior to anesthesia and explanation as to usage after surgery will be given. The patient of caregiver will apply pressure on the bead for three minutes and repeat this four times a day for the next five days. None of the protocol for prevention of PONV in this group of patients will be changed. The postoperative therapy for nausea and vomiting will be on a PRN (as required) basis. Nausea and vomiting scores and VAS scores for pain estimation will be carried out according to hospital protocol in the PACU amd twice a day thereafter for their period of stay in the hospital. The amount of analgesics and antiemetics used and the number of days spent in the hospital will be registered.</description>
