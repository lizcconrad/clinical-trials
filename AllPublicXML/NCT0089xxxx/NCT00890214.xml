  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers investigated the influence of a prostacyclin analogue (PGIA) versus
      unfractionated heparin (UFH) on ex vivo platelet function, during continuous venovenous
      hemodiafiltration.

      Context and purpose of the study: Prospective, randomized comparison of a PGIA versus UFH as
      circuit anticoagulant. Platelet responsiveness was assessed from peripheral blood by
      light-transmittance aggregometry (LTA) induced by collagen and ADP, at baseline, 4 and 24 hrs
      after treatment onset. Platelet function was also assessed in blood samples collected in the
      circuit before and after the filter. The Setting was a University Hospital Intensive Care
      Unit. 23 ICU patients with Acute Renal Failure needing CVVHDF were studied during standard
      CVVHDF therapy, at random infusion in the extracorporeal circuit of PGIA or UFH.
