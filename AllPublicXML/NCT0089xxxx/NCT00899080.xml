      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.
      It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at blood samples from patients with multiple myeloma
      who were treated with thalidomide or lenalidomide.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To analyze the mechanism of development of thalidomide/lenalidomide-induced venous
           thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with multiple myeloma treated on clinical trial
           ECOG-E4A03 or E-E1A00.

        -  To determine the intensity, dynamics, and specificity of cathepsin G (CG) upregulation
           in response to thalidomide and lenalidomide treatment.

        -  To determine the specificity and threshold levels of CG for induction of platelet
           aggregation in response to thalidomide and lenalidomide and the resulting risk for VTE
           development.

      OUTLINE: Blood samples obtained before, during, and after treatment with thalidomide or
      lenalidomide from patients previously enrolled on clinical trial ECOG-E4A03 or E-E1A00 are
      analyzed to determine the total content of cathepsin G (CG) via ELISA; to determine mRNA
      levels of CG via RT-PCR; and for platelet aggregation studies. Blood samples are collected
      from healthy volunteers for platelet preparation.
