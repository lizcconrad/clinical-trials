      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to bone
      tissue death.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at risk factors for bone tissue death in young
      patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated on clinical trial CCG-1882.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Identify possible pharmacogenetic risk factors for avascular necrosis (AVN) in pediatric
           patients who received intensive therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia on clinical
           trial CCG-1882.

        -  Compare whether thymidylate synthase 2/2 enhancer repeat genotype and vitamin D receptor
           C/C start site genotype are more common among patients who developed AVN than among
           patients who did not.

      OUTLINE: This is a retrospective, cohort, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to gender and treatment regimen on clinical trial CCG-1882 (augmented vs regular
      Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster).

      DNA is extracted from slides of blast samples that were previously obtained from patients
      treated on clinical trial CCG-1882. DNA genotyping is performed, and genotypes (proportion of
      population with variant alleles or frequency of variant alleles) are compared between
      patients who did and did not develop avascular necrosis.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 671 tissue samples from patients (294 females and 377 males)
      will be accrued for this study.
