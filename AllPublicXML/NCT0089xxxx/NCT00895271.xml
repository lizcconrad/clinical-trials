  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  National Institutes of Health (NIH) researchers have been studying immune cells (white
           blood cells) to better understand how the human body s defense system works and adjusts
           or regulates itself, and how changes in this system can make a person sick.

        -  To study the cells of patients who have problems with their immune systems, researchers
           would like to collect samples of skin cells from patients with immune system disorders
           and compare them with skin cells taken from healthy volunteers. By studying these cells,
           researchers hope to determine whether these cells can be modified to create a new kind
           of personalized gene therapy that would attempt to cure immune diseases in the future.

      Objectives:

        -  To obtain skin cells from patients with immune system disorders and from healthy
           volunteers for research and comparison purposes.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients between the ages of 2 and 85 who have immune system disorders.

        -  Healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 85.

        -  Both groups will be selected from the eligible participants of existing NIH studies into
           immune system disorders.

      Design:

        -  Researchers may take up to two biopsies from participants arms, legs, abdomen, or back.

        -  The biopsy site will be numbed with local anesthetic and cleaned before the sample is
           taken.

        -  The punch skin biopsy needle will be inserted into the skin and rotated to remove a
           small circle of skin (approximately 1/4 to 3/8 of an inch across). The area will be
           closed with bandages or stitches, and then covered with a dressing. Any stitches will be
           removed in 7 to 10 days.

        -  Tissue samples collected in the study will be stored for future research.

      This protocol is designed as an adjunct to other NIAID IRB approved protocols that allow for
      genetic testing, which may include those that are screening protocols for patients with rare
      primary immunodeficiency or immunodysregulation disorders. Patients deemed of sufficient
      research interest after review of outside medical records, clinical evaluation, and testing
      may be invited to participate in this study. Healthy volunteers will also be invited to
      participate as a source of control samples for research testing. After consent and enrollment
      into this study, skin punch biopsies will be obtained to establish dermal fibroblast cell
      lines for research studies directed at understanding the genetic and biochemical bases of
      these diseases. Cell lines will also be used to investigate the utility of induced
      pluripotent stem cells (iPS) for lymphocyte derivation and targeted gene correction. The
      nasal epithelial scrapings will be used for research purposes to grow out primary nasal
      respiratory epithelial cell lines. These cell lines will be used for functional studies by
      testing virus replication in them. These functional studies will allow us to identify new
      primary immunodeficiencies that may present primarily as recurrent or persistent lower
      respiratory tract virus infections.Results with the potential to impact medical care will be
      relayed to the referring physicians and where applicable, patients will be referred to other
      appropriate NIH protocols for additional clinical evaluation and treatment. The study will
      enroll up to 200 patients and healthy volunteers over the next 5 years.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients:

        To be enrolled in this study, a patient must be greater than or equal to 2 years of age but
        not greater than 85 years of age, have a known diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency or
        immunodysregulation (or be a blood relative of such as patient), and be concurrently
        enrolled on an NIAID IRB approved protocol that includes genetic testing for disease of the
        immune system, such as but not limited to 05-I-0213 or 06-I-0015.

        Healthy Volunteers:

        To be enrolled in this study, a normal volunteer must fulfill all of the following
        criteria:

          -  1. Be enrolled on protocol 05-I-0213.
