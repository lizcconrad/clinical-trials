  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two hundred and sixty patients with breast cancer will be accrued into the study. After
      inclusion in the study, all the patients will be randomized into two arms. Arm 1 will receive
      Tamoxifen given concurrently with radiotherapy while in Arm 2 radiotherapy will be given
      followed by tamoxifen sequentially. The patients will be stratified for the following
      factors: a) BCS (Breast conservative surgery) versus MRM (modified radical mastectomy) and b)
      central lung distance (CLD) &gt; 2 cm.

      Patients in both arms will continue tamoxifen for a period of 5 years. The patients will be
      evaluated by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) (baseline and at 2 years), serum
      transforming growth factor (TGF) beta levels (baseline and at 6 months) and
      diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) aerosol clearance half life (baseline and at 6
      months).
