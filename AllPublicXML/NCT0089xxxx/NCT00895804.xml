  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, &quot;Ecstasy&quot;) produces tachycardia, hypertension,
      hyperthermia, and other acute adverse effects. Ecstasy use has also been associated with rare
      cardio- and cerebrovascular complications. The role of beta-blockers in the treatment of
      cardiovascular and adverse effects of MDMA is unknown.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We investigated the interactive effects of the beta-blocker pindolol (20 mg) with MDMA (1.6
      mg/kg) on heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and adverse effects in a double-blind
      placebo-controlled study in 16 healthy subjects.
