      The purpose of this study is to investigate the lesions, clinical features and outcome in
      young children with melamine-related-calculus.

      1. To investigate the outcome of melamine-related-calculus.

             -  The change of calculus.

             -  The change of obstruction features,including hydronephrosis and ureterectasia.

             -  The change of the urinalysis.

        2. To investigate the change of renal function in children with melamine-related-calculus
           during the follow up.

             -  Creatinine, urea and uric acid.

             -  α and β2 microglobulin.

        3. To analysis the factors might be associated with the outcome.

             -  The characteristics of patients: age, gender, and so on.

             -  The characteristics of calculus: location, size, and so on.
