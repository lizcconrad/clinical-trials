      RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of blood from patients and their brothers with
      cancer to study in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that may occur in
      DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at changes in DNA in patients and their brothers
      with prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes in patients
           with prostate cancer, their affected siblings, and an unaffected healthy population
           (control).

        -  Determine the age of onset of prostate cancer in affected probands and affected
           siblings.

        -  Determine the penetrance or likelihood that given SNPs will result in disease in
           affected siblings based upon Mendelian genetics.

        -  Determine the odds ratio of developing prostate cancer in the presence of SNPs.

        -  Determine SNP genotypes in patients enrolled on ECOG-E3805, a prostate phase III study
           enrolling men with D2 prostate cancer treated with androgen-ablation therapy alone or
           androgen-ablation therapy with chemotherapy, and correlate them with disease progression
           (i.e., androgen independence).

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      ethnicity, age at diagnosis, and Gleason score.

      Patients, their affected siblings, and healthy participants (controls) undergo collection of
      blood samples. Genomic DNA is extracted from whole blood and sequenced for single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in Akt and mdm-2 genes. SNP data is correlated with clinical and
      biographical data.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients (250 probands and 250 siblings) and 146 healthy
      participants (controls) will be accrued for this study.
