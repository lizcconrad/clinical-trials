  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was an evaluation of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Blum Family Resource Center
      Van's existing skin cancer screening and education program. This program occurred over 2
      summers. This study will fill a critical gap in the investigators' knowledge about how best
      to address the high-risk behaviors that regularly occur during the summertime at beaches. The
      investigators randomized beaches to receive different combinations of the van program
      components in order to determine how services should optimally be configured to maximize
      impact. The investigators hypothesized that providing all three components (1-Skin cancer
      prevention education; 2-Biometric feedback using a Dermascan Analyzer that illustrates skin
      damage due to sun exposure and Ultra Violet (UV) Reflectance Photography; and 3-Dermatologist
      skin exam) will maximize knowledge and behavior change, relative to education alone.

    <description>In addition to the education program, participants received free skin exams by board certified dermatologists from Brigham and Women's Hospital. The van was equipped with a private clinical setting conducive to carry out such examinations. Based on the recommendations of the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), a visual full body exam was provided to participants. At the end of each skin exam the dermatologist provided a presumptive diagnosis to the participant, and made appropriate recommendations and referrals for follow up with the participants' physician/dermatologist (if and when necessary). All participants undergoing the skin exam were required to complete an &quot;AAD Skin Cancer Screening Registration and Report form&quot;.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In addition to the educational program, participants received biometric feedback using a Dermascan Analyzer and Ultra Violet (UV) Reflectance Photography. The Dermascan Analyzer is an educational tool that enhances visibility of skin texture, markings or lesions and is commonly used in health fairs and at schools all over the country. The analyzer highlights the sun damage on the participants skin as dark purple blotches, which the participants are able to see in the mirror placed inside the analyzer. Ultra Violet (UV) Reflectance Photography provides participants with a visual image of their skin damage that can be taken with them.</description>
