      This study will follow 1000 refugee infants from birth for two years. The aim of the study is
      to better understand why some children develop infections caused by the bacterium
      Streptococcus pneumoniae whilst others merely carry this organism asymptomatically at the
      back of the nose (in the nasopharynx). The investigators will also define which
      micro-organisms cause lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., pneumonia) in this population
      in order to implement appropriate interventions (e.g., vaccines). Infants will be reviewed
      monthly and a nasopharyngeal swab will be taken. A group of 250 mother-infant pairs will be
      studied in greater detail, to improve our understanding of the frequency and outcomes of
      nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Monthly nasopharyngeal swabs will be
      collected from mothers and infants. The investigators will measure the infant immune response
      to Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage or disease by taking monthly blood samples. The
      investigators will make an assessment of the protective effect of antibodies acquired from
      the mother during pregnancy by taking blood from the mother and placenta at birth. An
      assessment of pneumococcal carriage in mothers will also be made to determine how frequently
      the bacterium is transmitted between family members. All lower respiratory tract infections
      will be documented, and the causative micro-organisms identified.

      This project's central hypothesis is that acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) are a
      common and significant cause of morbidity and mortality in young children living in Maela
      refugee camp on the Thai-Burmese border, and that this is reflective of the general situation
      in the developing world. Therefore, we aim to define the incidence, aetiology, and outcome of
      acute lower respiratory infections in this population. This will focus on Streptococcus
      pneumoniae and the factors associated with colonisation and invasive disease.

      Additional objectives are to:

        1. Characterise the interaction between bacterial and viral pathogens and disease.

        2. Examine the dynamics of pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage, including transmission of
           strains between infants and their mothers.

        3. Determine the effect of the non-pathogenic members of the nasopharyngeal flora on
           colonisation with potential pathogens.

        4. Examine the role of passively transferred maternal pneumococcal antibodies in subsequent
           pneumococcal colonisation and disease in the infant.

        5. Document the development of pneumococcal antibodies in the infants over time and
           correlate these with pneumococcal carriage and infection episodes.

        6. Determine the risk factors associated with respiratory infection.

        7. Characterise the bacteria causing invasive non-respiratory infections.

        8. Conduct surveillance for influenza and in particular avian influenza A (H5N1) infection.

        Maela is a densely populated camp predominantly inhabited by refugees of the Karen ethnic
        group. It is located in hills adjoining the Burmese border 50 km north of Mae Sot. It is
        the largest of the camps on the Thai-Burmese border, housing around one-third of the total
        refugee population. Maela has a population of approximately 43,000 people, of which 20% are
        females of child bearing age. Women presenting for antenatal care at SMRU's clinic will be
        asked to take part in the study.
