        et al 2001; see Appendix 16.1.1 [(Protocol Appendix 5]):

          -  Two relapses and objective clinical evidence (history or present) of at least 2
             lesions

          -  Two relapses and objective clinical evidence (history or present) of 1 lesion; and
             dissemination in space, demonstrated by MRI (Barkhof/Tintoré criteria) or 2 MRI T2

             clinical event.

          -  One relapse and objective clinical evidence (history or present) of 1 lesion, and
