      Immediate post-operative abdominal compartment syndrome is a feared complication after hernia
      repair in patients with a &quot;loss of abdominal domain.&quot; Replacement of the viscera within an
      unyielding stiff abdominal wall may compromise the perfusion of the intestines, elevate the
      diaphragm, and interfere with ventilation. The components separation technique, used to
      repair these massive hernias, employs bilateral relaxing incisions in the external oblique
      muscle and fascia in order to approximate the rectus abdominis muscles in the midline.
      Reducing a large volume hernia into the abdominal cavity and primary closure of the abdominal
      wall should cause problems both with abdominal compartment pressure and with postoperative
      ventilation, but in the investigators' 13-year experience with over 250 cases, this has not
      been seen clinically, and the investigators sought to understand why. The investigators'
      hypothesis is that releasing the rectus muscles from the external obliques expands the
      intra-abdominal compartment, reclaims lost domain, and thus reduces abdominal pressure and
      respiratory problems. The investigators have previously reported increased abdominal volumes
      using the components separation technique in a retrospective series, but patients were not
      standardized for the collection of data, and no pulmonary function tests were obtained in
      that series (Hadad, in press). The purpose of this study was to prospectively analyze the
      effect of this surgical technique on abdominal volume and pulmonary function.

      With approval from the Institutional Review Board of Northwestern University, twenty-one
      patients with large ventral hernias were selected due to their large hernia size from a pool
      of 130 patients undergoing abdominal wall reconstruction from January 2007 to December 2008.
      No patients were excluded based on co-morbid conditions. One patient of the 21 selected was
      excluded because his preoperative CT scan that was performed at an outside institution was
      stored in an incompatible format for analysis. Another patient was excluded because it was
      decided intra-operatively that she could be repaired in a tension-free manner without
      components separation and was closed with mesh alone. Standard abdominal and pelvic CT scans
      and pulmonary function tests were performed immediately before hernia repair, and 3 months
      after repair. Pulmonary function tests were interpreted by blinded members of the Department
      of Pulmonology. Intra-operative peak airway pressure, bladder pressure, postoperative oxygen
      requirement, diagnosis of pneumonia, and any other cardio-respiratory complications were
      recorded on the remaining 19 patients. Routine patient demographics, clinical
      characteristics, postoperative course and incidence of recurrence were prospectively
      collected on all patients. Statistical analysis was performed in an intention-to-treat
      manner, using paired student's t-test where applicable.
