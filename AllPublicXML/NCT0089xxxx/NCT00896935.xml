      RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of tissue and blood from patients with cancer to
      test in the laboratory may help the study of cancer in the future.

      PURPOSE: This research study is collecting and storing tumor, tissue, and blood samples from
      patients with pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Provide cancer investigators access to a wide variety of tissues and biospecimens for
           translational studies in cancer.

        -  Collect and preserve tissue from the primary organ site (uninvolved and involved with
           cancer), from the metastases, from patient blood (serum and lymphocytes), and from
           patient urine.

        -  Provide quality-controlled storage and management of the specimen bank.

        -  Collect relevant clinical and pathologic information with appropriate privacy
           protection.

        -  Contribute to the development of a comprehensive database annotated with relevant
           clinical data, pathology, and research findings.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Tumor samples, lymph node samples, and normal pancreas tissue samples are collected. Blood
      samples are also collected prior to surgery, six months after the initial blood draw and
      tissue sample collection, and every six months thereafter for two years.

      Tissue will be collected and preserved from the primary organ site, from the metastases, from
      patient blood (serum and lymphocytes), from patient urine, and from related samples of other
      tissues/fluids removed by the surgeon left over after diagnostic testing.

        The goal of this protocol is to provide cancer investigators access to a wide variety of
        tissues and biospecimens for translational studies in cancer by collecting and preserving
        tissue from the primary organ site, from the metastases, from patient blood (serum and
        lymphocytes), from patient urine, and from related samples of other tissues/fluids removed
        by the surgeon left over after diagnostic testing. No additional tissue will be taken at
        the time of surgery other than that required for patient care, but additional blood and
        urine samples will be obtained at that time. This protocol is not limited to certain types
        of cancer.
