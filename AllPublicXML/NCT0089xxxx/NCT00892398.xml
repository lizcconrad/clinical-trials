  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trabeculectomy with mitomycin C remains the standard surgery for glaucoma. This surgery
      involves creating a door in the eye wall in order to improve fluid outflow and decrease
      intraocular pressure. However, success rates range from 70% to 90% depending on the criteria
      used and tend to decrease with time. The failure of the surgery is associated with
      inflammation, new blood vessel formation and scarring which can cause closure of the door.
      Molecules which inhibit new blood vessel formation such as inhibitors of vascular endothelial
      growth factor have been used successfully to decrease scarring in animal eyes where little
      doors were created and significantly improve survival. Furthermore, they have shown promise
      when used during trabeculectomy. Ranibizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor, has also
      been used safely in intraocular surgery to treat other diseases which involve new blood
      vessel formation such as macular degeneration and diabetes.

      The investigators hypothesize that ranibizumab may decrease the failure rate of
      trabeculectomy with mitomycin C by decreasing scarring.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the difference in failure rates and bleb morphology at
      one year post-operatively in eyes having undergone sub-conjunctival injections of ranibizumab
      in addition to primary trabeculectomy with mitomycin C compared to eyes having undergone
      trabeculectomy with mitomycin C alone.

      Prospective, randomized, unblinded clinical trial. Two groups of patients with glaucoma
      undergoing primary trabeculectomy or phaco-trabeculectomy with MMC between March 2009 and
      September 2012. The ranibizumab group (RAN) received 2 subconjunctival injections of 0.5 mg
      of ranibizumab (intraoperatively and on day 14) and he control group did not receive
      ranibizumab.
