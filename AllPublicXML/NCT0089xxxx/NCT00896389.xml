  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although hypertension can be easily diagnosed and there are many medications available to
      treat hypertension, this condition is poorly managed in many patients and is a leading cause
      of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Because a newly identified hypertension susceptibility
      gene, STK39 (Serine Threonine Kinase 39), plays a central role in kidney sodium transport,
      the investigators propose a pharmacogenetics study to examine the relationships between STK39
      genotypes and responses to salt loading and to thiazide diuretics, hydrochlorothiazide. The
      investigators hypothesize that STK39 genotypes will be associated with the outcome of both
      interventions and can contribute to personalized care for hypertension by predicting patients
      most likely to effectively control their blood pressure by adopting salt-reducing diet and
      taking thiazide diuretics.

    <intervention_name>Salt loading</intervention_name>
    <description>We will perform salt loading intervention, a routinely prescribed diagnostic test to determine if patients have hypoaldosteronism, on 120 subjects. After overnight fasting, subjects will arrive at the Amish Research clinics. After taking height, weight, BP, and body temperature (intervention will not proceed if fever is detected), the patient will be in supine position, have IV line inserted and fitted for an automatic BP monitor. BP will be taken every 5 minutes until the last 3 SBP (systolic blood pressure) readings are within 3 mmHg. Once the BP has &quot;equilibrated&quot; 2 L of 0.9% NaCl (sodium chloride) saline will be intravenously infused over 4 hours. BP will be taken every 15 minutes during this procedure and for 2 hours after the intervention. Blood and urine samples will be collected from all subjects pre- and post-infusion.</description>

    <intervention_name>Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)</intervention_name>
    <description>We will perform short-term HCTZ intervention on the same 120 subjects.The subjects will arrive to the ARC after overnight fasting (day 1), have their height, weight, and BP measured. Subjects are given seven 12.5 mg HCTZ tablets and instructed to take 1 tablet daily for one week. The subjects will return to ARC on day 8 and have height, weight, and BP measured again. Blood and urine will be collected on both day 1 and day 8. After a minimum 6-week wash-out period, the subjects will come back to the ARC and repeat the 7-day diuretics intervention, taking 25 mg of HCTZ instead. Subjects with plasma potassium levels below 3.6 mmol/L on day 8 of 12.5 mg HCTZ will be given a daily supplement of 16 milliequivalents of potassium to prevent harmful loss of potassium while taking HCTZ.</description>
