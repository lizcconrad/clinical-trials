  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. The incidence is
      highest in Asia and it is increasing in North America, with a two to three fold increase in
      mortality in North America expected over the next two decades. Previous research has shown
      that tumours often have abnormal blood vessels that may reduce the effect of radiation
      therapy. New drugs, known as &quot;anti-angiogenic&quot; drugs have been shown in animal and human
      studies to damage or change tumour blood vessels in ways that may make tumors more sensitive
      to radiation treatment. 38-44 patients diagnosed with HCC will be invited to take part in
      this study. Upon completion, this study will establish the safety of the combination of
      radiation and sorafenib in patients with HCC. This will also establish preliminary data
      regarding efficacy of the combination and investigate potential imaging and serum/tissue
      markers surrogates for tumor response and/or drug activity.

      The study design will include 2 radiation strata of patients, with a constant radiation dose
      for strata 1 requiring a low volume of liver to be irradiated, and a variable dose defined
      based on the effective liver volume irradiated in the second strata, which will require more
      liver volume to be irradiated, based on our prior experience. Both stratas one and two will
      be accrued concurrently. Biologic response will be assessed using standard contrast CT scans.
      Correlative studies of biological markers, perfusion CT, and microbubble contrast enhanced
      ultrasound will also be performed.

    <description>Patients will receive sorafenib alone (following the dose escalation scheme) for one week, followed by 2 weeks of concurrent administration of sorafenib with conformal radiation therapy (6 fractions over two weeks). Sorafenib administration will continue for four weeks following completion of radiation. At three months following radiation, when liver toxicity is assessed, full dose sorafenib (400mg PO BID) will then be initiated and continued until disease progression or serious toxicity occurs, to a maximum time of 12 months.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have HCC either

               -  confirmed pathologically

               -  diagnosed by showing vascular enhancement of the lesion on at least two imaging
                  techniques

               -  diagnosed by showing vascular enhancement on a single technique if the AFP is
                  over 200, in the setting of cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B without cirrhosis.
                  Biopsies are mandatory (unless an absolute contraindication exists).

          -  The tumour must be unresectable or medically inoperable

          -  At least 800 cc of non-tumor liver

             systemic therapy to start of radiation therapy. Prior sorafenib or any other targeted
             therapy with anti-VEGF activity is not permitted.
