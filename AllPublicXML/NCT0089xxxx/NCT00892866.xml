    <textblock>
      This research trial studies carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA-IX), p16, proliferative markers, and
      human papilloma virus (HPV) in diagnosing cervical lesions in patients with abnormal cervical
      cells. Studying biomarkers in abnormal cervical cells may improve the ability to find
      cervical lesions and plan effective treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine CA-IX, p16, Ki-67, and mini-chromosome maintenance complex component 2 (MCM2)
      expression in liquid-based cytology (LBC) specimens to see which subset of markers can
      provide the optimal diagnosis of significant cervical lesions in women in North America with
      a cytologic diagnosis of atypical glandular cells (AGC) and a positive test for high risk
      human papillomavirus (HPV).

      II. To examine high risk HPV, CA-IX, p16, Ki-67, and MCM2 expression in LBC specimens to see
      which subset of markers can provide the optimal diagnosis of significant cervical lesions in
      women in Japan and Korea (with each country?s cohort analyzed separately) with a cytologic
      diagnosis of AGC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the accuracy of diagnosis based on high risk HPV and expression of
      CA-IX, p16, Ki-67, and/or MCM2 varies with patient age at enrollment and country of
      enrollment.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess biomarker expression, loss of heterozygosity, and chromosome gains/losses in
      formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from the highest grade or most abnormal lesion in
      women from North America, Japan, or Korea presenting with a cytologic diagnosis of AGC or
      with a cytologic/histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS).

      II. To determine CA-IX, p16, Ki67, and MCM2 expression in LBC specimens to see which subset
      (or combination) of markers will provide higher sensitivity in the diagnosis of cervical
      adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo liquid-based cytology specimen sample collection for analysis of CA-IX, p16,
      Ki-67, and MCM2 expression via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and for the presence of high risk
      HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and HPV genotyping.
