      RATIONALE: Studying samples of cells in the laboratory from patients with cancer may help
      identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors learn how patients respond to
      treatment.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is analyzing samples of cells from patients with chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia who were treated on clinical trial ECOG-2997.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To analyze the expression of a variety of informative molecules using a unique
           high-resolution flow cytometric immunophenotyping technology in samples from patients
           with chronic lymphocytic leukemia enrolled in clinical trial ECOG-2997.

      OUTLINE: Cell samples are analyzed for the following prognostic biomarkers: ZAP-70,
      phospho-Syk, phospho-GSK-3β, phospho-Akt, phospho-ZAP-70, cyclin D1, cyclin D2, p21cip1,
      phospho-ReIA, IkappaBα, Bax, Mcl-1, PTEN, phospho-Erk1/2, and phospho-MEK1/2. Biomarker
      signals are amplified using enzymatic amplification staining to obtain high resolution
      detection of cell-surface markers on leukemic cells. Biomarker expression levels are measured
      using fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis. Relationships between clinical outcomes,
      standard flow cytometric analysis, cytogenetic studies, and high resolution immunophenotyping
      will also be assessed.
