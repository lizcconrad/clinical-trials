  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand using incentives to encourage employees to
      increase participation in an aspect of a corporate wellness program - filling out health risk
      assessments. This study will test whether lottery-linked incentives are more effective than
      guaranteed incentives in encouraging people to fill out health risk assessments.

      This study will be run in an employer setting in which rates of health risk assessment
      completion are suboptimal. This study would be conducted within a workplace setting in which
      the firm is divided into a number of geographically situated and functionally related
      subunits. The investigators will run a &quot;complete your health risk assessment now!&quot; program
      for 4 weeks. Each work unit will obtain a symbol. Every week, one symbol will be randomly
      drawn, publicly announced, and anyone in that work unit at the firm who has received their
      preventive screening would receive a $100 prize. In addition, if all of employees in that
      unit have completed their forms, then the prize will be increased to $125.

      The investigators expect this condition to result in greater compliance compared to a control
      condition in which employees would receive weekly reminders and a direct payment of a $25
      gift card for completing the form at anytime during the 4 weeks of the study. This is
      analogous to direct payments that have been used by insurers to encourage completion of such
      forms in other contexts.

      The purpose of this study is to apply concepts from behavioral economics to increase the
      effectiveness of incentives for preventative health care.

      Health risk assessments are an important part of preventative healthcare. Employees fill out
      these forms and are given feedback about their health risks and steps they can take to
      improve their health. This study will be run in an employer setting in which rates of health
      risk assessment completion are suboptimal. This study would be conducted within a workplace
      setting in which the firm is divided into a number of geographically situated and
      functionally related subunits. We will run a &quot;complete your health risk assessment now!&quot;
      program for 4 weeks. Each work unit will obtain a symbol. Every week, one symbol will be
      randomly drawn, publicly announced, and anyone in that work unit at the firm who has received
      their preventive screening would receive a $100 prize. In addition, if all of employees in
      that unit have completed their forms, then the prize will be increased to $125.

      This program plays on a number of psychological factors: 1) avoidance of regret, which one
      will experience if the number/symbol of the unit one is a member of is drawn and one does not
      win a prize because one is not participating in the wellness program 2) amplification of such
      regret by social means - because other people around you who are participating will receive
      cash prizes 3) mild social pressure, because high enrollments will yield benefits for all
      participants.

    <description>Regret Lottery: Employees are divided into work units of about 5 employees. Employees in the lottery-linked incentive condition will be eligible for a weekly lottery drawing only if they have already completed their health risk assessment. The lotteries will work as follows. Participants will be assigned to work units of about 10 people. Each week, one work group is drawn at random. If a participants group was drawn and that participant already completed the health risk assessment, then that person will win a $100 cash prize. If all of the members of his or her work group also filled out the health risk assessment, then the prize will be boosted.</description>
