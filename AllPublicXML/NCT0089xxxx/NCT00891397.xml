      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of pregabalin in patients with complex
      regional pain syndrome Type I and to determine whether it provides clinically significant
      pain relief and whether it improves functioning of the upper limb.

    <description>Pregabalin group is made up of 20 patients. Patients will receive 150mg/day in two divided does. The patients will be assessed weekly and the dose can be increased to 300mg/day, if the patient does not report any decrease in pain. The following week the dose may be increased to 600mg/day if once again the patient reports no decrease in pain. This is also the maximum permissible does that will be given to the patient. If patient reports any side effects then the dose can be decreased once. The time period of 2 to 5 weeks will be the dose adjustment period. After which the drug maintenance period extends from week 5 to 12. All doses will be given in two divided doses/day.</description>
