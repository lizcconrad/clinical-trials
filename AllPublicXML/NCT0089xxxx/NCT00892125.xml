  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to evaluate the effects of a potent metabolic enzyme inducer,
      carbamazepine, on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of orally administered paliperidone ER
      and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the treatments in clinically stable patients
      with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder.

      The current study is designed as an open-label, multiple-center, multiple-dose, 2 treatment,
      2 period sequential drug interaction study. It consists of 3 phases: a screening phase
      beginning within 21 days before the first study drug administration; an open label treatment
      phase consisting of 2 treatment periods (Period 1 and Period 2), during which patients will
      receive multiple oral doses of 6-mg paliperidone ER alone or in combination with multiple
      oral doses of carbamazepine, and end of study evaluations upon completion of all the study
      procedures in Period 2 or at early withdrawal. There is no washout period between treatment
      periods. Given the potential concomitant use of carbamazepine with antipsychotics, such as
      paliperidone ER, in the treatment of schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder, this study is
      designed to investigate the effect of carbamazepine on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of
      paliperidone ER. Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study.. Period 1: 6
      mg paliperidone ER once daily from Day 1 through Day 7, route oral; Period 2: 6 mg
      paliperidone ER once daily and carbamazepine 200 mg twice daily from Day 8 through Day 28,
      route oral.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of schizophrenia of any subtype (295.10

          -  295.20

          -  295.30

          -  295.60

          -  295.90) or bipolar I disorder (296.0x, 296.4x, 296.5x, 296.6x or 296.7), according to
             the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)

          -  Clinically stable with no psychiatric hospitalization or change in existing mood
             stabilizers, antipsychotic, or anti-manic drugs for 3 months before screening. A
             reduction in the dose of existing medication is acceptable if the subject remained
             clinically stable throughout the 3 month period. In addition, an increase or decrease
             in the dose of a mood stabilizer on the basis of therapeutic drug monitoring or the
             substitution of a specific mood stabilizer, antipsychotic, or anti-manic drug for
             another because of poor tolerability will be allowed within 3 months before screening

          -  Have a CGI-S score of 3 or less at baseline and at screening

          -  Body mass index (BMI, weight [kg]/height [m2]) of 18 to 35 kg/m2, inclusive

          -  Have a supine (after 5 minutes rest) blood pressure between 100 and 140 mmHg systolic,
             inclusive, and 50 and 90 mmHg diastolic, inclusive

          -  Apart from the above-mentioned diagnosis, otherwise healthy on the basis of a prestudy
             physical examination, medical history, 12-lead ECG, and the laboratory results of
             serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis performed within 21 days before the first
             dose. For renal function tests, the values must be within the normal laboratory
             reference ranges

          -  Women must be postmenopausal for at least 2 years, surgically sterile, abstinent, or
             practicing or agree to practice an effective method of birth control if they are
             sexually active before entry and throughout the study (effective methods of birth
             control include intrauterine devices, double-barrier method, and male partner
             sterilization). Prescription hormonal contraceptives must be used in combination with
             another method of birth control (e.g., double-barrier method) throughout the study.
             Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at
             screening, and a negative urine test at baseline (Day 1).

             judgment of the investigator, with the exception of barbiturates

          -  Acute substance abuse, as evidenced by a positive urine drug screen at screening or
             baseline (Day 1)

          -  Positive alcohol test at screening or baseline (Day 1)

          -  History of neuroleptic malignant syndrome

          -  History of bone marrow depression or acute intermittent porphyria

          -  History of or a positive result at screening for any of the serology tests (hepatitis
             B, C, and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV])

          -  History or presence of any relevant cardiovascular (including myocardial infarct or
