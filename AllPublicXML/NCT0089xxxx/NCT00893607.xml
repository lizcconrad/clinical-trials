    <textblock>
      Study to assess the effects of 10mg NRL001 on mean anal resting pressure (MARP) when
      administered as a slow release suppository applied to the anal canal or rectum. In addition,
      the pharmacokinetics of NRL001 in plasma, adverse events, and any changes in heart rate or
      blood pressure were to be assessed.
