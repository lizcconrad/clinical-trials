      This laboratory study is looking at response or resistance to chemotherapy in young patients
      with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with methotrexate. Studying samples of tumor tissue
      in the laboratory from patients with cancer may help doctors learn more about changes that
      occur in DNA and drug resistance in patients.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the molecular basis for human reduced folate carrier (hRFC) transcripts in
      B-precursor and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) blasts obtained from children with
      newly diagnosed ALL subsequently treated with methotrexate.

      II. Correlate hRFC expression in these specimens with methotrexate transport and
      sensitivities.

      III. Determine the roles of high frequency gene/transcript variants for hRFC as determinants
      of response and resistance to methotrexate in these patients.

      IV. Determine the roles of multidrug resistance-associated proteins as determinants of
      response and resistance to methotrexate and mercaptopurine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Tumor diagnostic specimens from patients who subsequently failed therapy within 4 years of
      diagnosis or who did not fail therapy within 4 years of diagnosis (control patients) are
      obtained from the Children's Oncology Group cellbank. Specimens are studied for molecular
      determinants of human reduced folate carrier (hRFC) gene expression and gene sequence
      alterations using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), thymidylate
      synthase inhibition assay, Rnase protection assay, or 5'RACE. Multidrug resistance proteins
      are also studied by RT-PCR.

      A certificate of confidentiality protecting the identity of research participants in this
      project has been issued by the National Cancer Institute.
