      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients with cancer may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.
      It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at blood sample analysis in predicting overall
      survival in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To validate the mass spectrometry profile that is predictive of survival benefit in
           patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with
           EGFR inhibitors.

      OUTLINE: Plasma and serum samples are analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry and classified according to prognosis (&quot;good&quot; vs &quot;poor&quot;)
      using a previously developed predictive algorithm.
