  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our proposal will enable us to study cocaine patients to determine whether varenicline can
      weaken brain arousal to drug cues in an fMRI imaging setting, which is what we theorize. This
      supplement supports a pilot imaging study in cocaine dependence. It will evaluate the impact
      of varenicline on the brain response to ultra-brief drug and comparison cues in an
      event-related fMRI paradigm. This is a pilot study.

      We will additionally examine the impact of varenicline on addiction-relevant behavioral
      probes of impulsivity, inhibition, attentional and affective bias. The proposed study will
      provide the first brain-behavioral probes of varenicline's cocaine-relevant actions in
      humans, and will provide the critical scientific rationale to move the agent into future
      collaborative clinical trials.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Physically healthy male substance abuse subjects age 18-55.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1) Participation in clinical trial and receipt of investigational drug(s) during
             previous 60 days 2) Clinically significant cardiovascular, hematologic, hepatic,
             renal, neurological or endocrinological abnormalities 3) History of serious head

             Presence of magnetically active prosthetics, plates, pins, broken needles, permanent
             retainer, bullets, etc. in subject's body (unless a radiologist confirms that its
             presence is unproblematic). A x-ray may be obtained to determine eligibility. 5)
