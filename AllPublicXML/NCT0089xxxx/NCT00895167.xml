  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) serves as a protective gene. Induction of HO-1 has therapeutic
      potential for several indications. The inducibility of HO-1 by curcumin will be evaluated in
      this pilot study. Furthermore, the influence of a modulating factor of HO-1 gene activity on
      the dinucleotide guanosine thymine repeat (GT) length polymorphism in the promotor region
      will be investigated.
