      RATIONALE: DNA analysis of tumor tissue from patients with cancer may help doctors predict
      how patients respond to treatment and plan the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is identifying genetic markers that predict response to
      paclitaxel in patients with newly diagnosed stage III or stage IV ovarian epithelial cancer
      or primary peritoneal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Identify genetic markers of paclitaxel chemosensitivity and/or chemoresistance, using
           gene expression arrays, in patients with newly diagnosed stage III or IV ovarian
           epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer treated with single-agent weekly
           paclitaxel followed by paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin.

        -  Correlate RNA expression levels with clinical response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Compare transcriptional profiles of primary tumors vs tissue obtained at second-look
           surgery in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Identify differential expression between pre- and post-treatment tissue in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Pre- and post-chemotherapy tumor samples undergo transcriptional profiling using cDNA
      microarrays to identify gene overexpression. The gene expression profiles of
      paclitaxel-sensitive tumors are compared with those that are paclitaxel resistant to identify
      gene markers that are associated with response to paclitaxel.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with newly diagnosed histologically confirmed advanced stage (III &amp; IV)
             epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer. --OR-- Patients with a
             suspected malignancy who are unsuitable candidates for surgery (i.e., those with
             medical co-morbidities, massive effusions, or tumor burden such that an optimal
             resection is unlikely) who undergo a core biopsy that is positive for malignancy.

          2. Patients who have undergone tumor reduction must have either stage III suboptimal (&gt; 2
             cm residual) disease or stage IV disease.

          3. Patients may have had no prior chemotherapeutic regimen.

          4. Zubrod performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

          5. Patients must have recovered from effects of recent surgery. They should be free of
             significant infection.

          6. Patients with a history of another malignancy within 5 years. Patients who have had a
             prior malignancy but remain continuously free of recurrent or persistent disease for
             more than 5 years may be entered in the study after consultation with the study chair.
