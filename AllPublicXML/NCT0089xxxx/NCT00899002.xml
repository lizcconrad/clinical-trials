      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may
      help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at biomarkers in stored tumor samples from younger
      patients with liver cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To characterize, at a molecular level, archived samples of tissue from young patients
           with fibrolamellar carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma in non-cirrhotic livers
           matched for age and sex.

        -  To perform genomic analysis on these tissue samples using array comparative genomic
           hybridization.

        -  To perform targeted gene mutation analysis on these samples by PCR.

        -  To perform proteomic profiling on fixed tissues in these samples by various proteomic
           methods, including IHC and mass spectrometry.

        -  To look for association between molecular aberrations and clinicopathologic features in
           these samples.

      OUTLINE: Archived tissue samples are collected from the pathology department at Vanderbilt
      University Medical Center and from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Tissue samples
      are analyzed by genomic analysis using array comparative genomic hybridization, target gene
      mutation analysis by PCR, and proteomic profiling on fixed tissues using various proteomic
      methods, including IHC and mass spectrometry. Samples are also examined for association
      between molecular aberrations and clinicopathologic features found in each disease.

      Clinical patient data (i.e., age, sex, race, date of diagnosis, risk factors, histology,
      surgical staging, follow-ups, date of death, and adjuvant therapy) are also collected.
