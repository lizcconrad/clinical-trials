  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether bone mineral density has increased in a
      subgroup of postmenopausal osteoporotic women from study CR9108963, between 6 and 12 months
      following cessation of ronacaleret therapy.

      CR9112792 is a follow-up study of CR9108963, the 12 month dose ranging study of ronacaleret
      (SB-751689), a calcium sensing receptor antagonist, in postmenopausal women with
      osteoporosis. CR9108963 evaluated the effects of ronacaleret (100mg, 200mg, 300mg, 400mg) on
      bone mineral density (BMD), safety and tolerability in comparison with placebo and 2 active
      comparators, alendronate and teriparatide. CR9108963 was terminated earlier than planned due
      to an observed lack of efficacy in lumbar spine and hip BMD. In this study we will follow-up
      subjects between 6 and 12 months after they discontinued treatment with ronacaleret to
      evaluate the potential for mineralization of bone following cessation of ronacaleret therapy.
      Subjects at pre-specified sites from the CR9108963 placebo, 200mg, 300mg and 400mg dose
      groups will be included in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent: Subject is willing and able to provide written informed consent.
