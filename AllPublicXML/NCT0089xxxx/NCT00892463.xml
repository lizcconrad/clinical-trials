  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is for a 6 week open-label clinical trial in which Seroquel XR is added to
      a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication for the treatment of depressive
      and/or anxiety symptoms. Each subject will self-report changes in symptoms, functional
      impairment, etc. on a twice daily basis using a handheld computer (HHC) that transmits
      real-time symptoms reports to a central database. Each subject will be assessed in-person on
      a weekly or biweekly basis during the course of the study.

      This study is a 6-week open-label clinical trial in which Seroquel XR is added to an
      antidepressant medication for the treatment of MDD with or without comorbid generalized
      anxiety disorder. Patients who are currently experiencing a depressive episode that has not
      responded to an adequate trial of an antidepressant will be eligible to participate. During
      the course of augmentation treatment with Seroquel XR, each subject will regularly enter
      information on symptom severity and functional impairment into their handheld computer, and
      this information will be wirelessly transmitted to a central database.
