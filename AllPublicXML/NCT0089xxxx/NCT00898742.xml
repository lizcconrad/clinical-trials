      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may
      help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer. It may also help doctors predict how will patients respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at gene and protein expression patterns in predicting
      response to cetuximab in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To identify 100 patients from the Head and Neck Tumor Tissue Repository and Clinical
           Database treated with cetuximab monotherapy or cetuximab-containing combination therapy
           as a standard of care for recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell
           carcinoma at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

        -  To assay the diversity of gene and protein expression patterns seen in these patients.

        -  To identify predictive patterns associated with treatment response and survival of these
           patients by correlating the laboratory data with clinical data.

      OUTLINE: Tumor tissue specimens and clinical data are obtained from the Head and Neck Tumor
      Tissue Repository and Clinical Database protocol VU-VICC-HN-0356. Specimens are analyzed for
      patterns of gene and protein expression predictive of cetuximab treatment response and
      survival by DNA microarray, tissue microarray, reverse transcriptase-PCR, and mass
      spectroscopy.
