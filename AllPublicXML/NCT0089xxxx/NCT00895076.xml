  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are to evaluate the extent of systemic exposure and dexamethasone
      bioavailability following a single application of a dexamethasone iontophoretic transdermal
      patch in healthy volunteers.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the systemic and topical safety of the dexamethasone
      iontophoretic transdermal patch and of the dexamethasone intramuscular (IM) injection.

          -  Must, in the investigator's opinion, have no clinically significant disease as
             determined by medical and psychiatric history, physical examination, vital signs,
             and/or laboratory evaluations conducted at the screening visit or on clinic admission
             that would interfere with the evaluation of safety or pharmacokinetics.

          -  Must have negative screens for Hbs-Ag, HCV-Ab, and HIV-Ab, and no history of a
             positive result.

          -  Female subjects may be included if they are surgically sterile or 2 years post
             menopausal, and they have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening. Female
             subjects of child bearing potential and peri-menopausal subjects may be included if
             they have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and on admission to the clinic
             on Day -1, and agree to use a medically accepted method of birth control (e.g.,
             barrier method with spermicide, oral contraceptive, or abstinence) and agree to
             continue use of this method for the duration of the trial.

          -  Must be non-smokers, defined as not having smoked tobacco, used chewing tobacco, or
             used nicotine-containing products for smoking cessation in the 6 months prior to
             screening.

          -  Must be able to communicate effectively with the study personnel.

          -  Must agree to remain in the study facility overnight for approximately five
             consecutive days and nights.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is a female subject who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning a pregnancy during the
             study.

          -  Has a clinically significant unstable medical abnormality, chronic disease,
             significant neurological (including seizure and cognitive disorders), hepatic, renal,
             endocrine, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, or metabolic disease, or any
             other abnormality that could interfere with the PK evaluation of the study drug.
             Particular attention will be paid to exclude subjects with a risk for the consequences
             of systemic corticosteroid exposure, such as diabetes or poorly controlled
             hypertension.

          -  Has had a clinically significant illness within 30 days of Screening.

          -  Use of any prescription medication (other than hormonal contraceptives) within 14 days
             or over-the-counter (OTC) medication (with the exception of ibuprofen and
             acetaminophen) within 7 days of randomization or intends to use any prescription or
             OTC medication during the study that may interfere with the evaluation of the study
             drug.

          -  Use of any topical creams, lotions or oils on the patch application site within 2
             weeks of treatment administration in the first period and throughout the study.

          -  Use of any steroid, including topical steroid, within 4 weeks of treatment
             administration in the first period and throughout the study.

          -  Intake of grapefruit products, and foods, herbal products and over-the-counter or
             prescription medications that may interact with the CYP450 enzyme system from 7 days
             prior to treatment administration in the first period until completion of the
             end-of-study procedures.

          -  Has ingested alcohol within 24 hours before admission (Day -1) and throughout the
             study.

          -  Has a history of significant allergy or hypersensitivity to the study drugs or to any
             component of iontophoretic transdermal patch used in this study, including allergy or
             sensitivity to bandage adhesives or to sodium bisulfate.

          -  Has any of the following exclusionary clinical laboratory results:

               1. Hemoglobin less than 12.0 g/dL

               2. Serum creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL

               3. Abnormal liver function tests (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT],
                  also called aspartate transaminase [AST]; or serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase
                  [SGPT], also called alanine transaminase [ALT] more than twice the upper limit of
                  normal)

               4. Elevated serum bilirubin more than 2 times the upper limit of normal

          -  Any blood donation or significant blood loss within 90 days of treatment
             administration in the first period.

          -  Any plasma donation within 7 days of randomization.

          -  Has any sensory dysfunction, any skin irritation, sensitivity or disease, or a tattoo
             that may in the opinion of the investigator interfere with assessment of topical
             effects at the site of patch application.

          -  Has history of alcohol abuse, illicit drug use, significant mental illness, physical
             dependence to any opioid, or any history of drug abuse or addiction within 12 months
             of study enrollment.

          -  Has or develops a positive urine drug screen, including ethanol, cocaine,
             tetrahydrocannabinol, barbiturates, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, and opiates.

          -  Use of any other investigational drug within 30 days or five half-lives (whichever is
             longer) before treatment administration in the first period, or plans to use an
