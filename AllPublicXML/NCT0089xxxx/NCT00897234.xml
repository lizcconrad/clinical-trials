      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at blood samples from patients with non-small cell
      lung cancer and from healthy volunteers.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Measure plasma cathepsin D levels in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and in
           healthy volunteers using mass spectometry.

        -  Measure fatty acid synthase levels in these patients and healthy volunteers using mass
           spectometry.

      OUTLINE: Blood samples are collected from patients and healthy volunteers to measure the
      levels of cathepsin D and fatty acid synthase by proteomic profiling and mass spectrometry.

        Subjects who have non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) will be recruited from the Masonic
        Cancer Center at the University of Minnesota. Controls will be non-smoking individuals, age
        matched to the NSCLC subjects recruited through advertising. Normal controls should not be
        regularly exposed to second hand smoke.
