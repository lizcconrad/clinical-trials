    <textblock>
      The investigators designed this study to determine the predictive value for predicting fluid
      responsiveness of noninvasive evaluation of respiratory variation of peak velocity in
      brachial artery, in mechanically ventilated patients with acute circulatory failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Predicting the hemodynamic response to fluid administration (or fluid responsiveness) in
      critical ill patients is still a matter of concern, since fluid overload could worse the
      clinical situation of these patients. Parameters of fluid responsiveness usually require an
      invasive monitoring (like arterial pulse pressure variation).

      We hypothesize that noninvasive evaluation of respiratory variation of peak velocity in
      brachial artery using Doppler ultrasound could provide a feasible estimation on fluid
      responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients with acute circulatory failure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with controlled mechanical ventilation, equipped with an indwelling radial
             artery catheter and for whom the decision to give fluids will be taken because the
             presence of one or more clinical signs of acute circulatory failure:

               -  systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg (or a decrease &gt;50 mmHg in previously
                  hypertensive patients)

               -  the need of vasopressor drugs

               -  oliguria (urine output &lt;0.5 ml/kg/min for at least 2 h)

               -  tachycardia

               -  delayed capillary refilling

               -  the presence of skin mottling

        Exclusion Criteria:
