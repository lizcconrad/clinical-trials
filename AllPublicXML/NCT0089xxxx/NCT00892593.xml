      The study will determine if adding fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) at yearly intervals to
      a colonoscopy screening program will improve colon cancer detection rates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the benefit of augmenting a compliant College of Gastroenterology
      colorectal cancer screening program with the addition of yearly FIT testing at two critical
      points in the current recommended follow up: 1. In patients found to have adenomatous polyps
      for the first time after colonoscopy, the addition of FIT in yearly intervals following index
      colonoscopy and 2. For subjects with &quot;clean&quot; colonoscopies (no polyps found), the addition of
      FIT at yearly intervals starting in year 6 and continuing to year 10 or subsequent
      colonoscopy. Current screening guidelines do not recommend the combination of colonoscopy and
      FOBT.

      Two factors plague an effective colon cancer screening program: 1) a less than 100%
      sensitivity (95% ) for optical colonoscopy to detect colon cancer, and 2) Limitations of
      guaiac based stool testing: low sensitivity ( 5% in single use) for detection of colon cancer
      and the traditional gFOBT is cumbersome for patients to perform, impeding patient acceptance
      and adherence.

      FIT offers a FOBT with improved sensitivity (65% for invasive colon cancer) and improved
      specificity and better patient compliance. The addition of FIT after initial colonoscopy
      could be applied to a screening program and thereby salvage &quot;missed&quot; lesions by increased
      detection rates
