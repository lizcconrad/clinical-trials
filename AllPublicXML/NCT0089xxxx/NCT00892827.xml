  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an indolent disease of mature-looking B lymphocytes, is
      the most common leukemia in Israel and the Western world. The disease is associated with
      considerable morbidity and mortality, and is currently incurable. Rituximab (Mabthera) is a
      chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against CD20 antigen, present exclusively on B
      lymphocytes. Treatment with Rituximab is widely used in indolent B cell malignancies.
      However, the administration of Rituximab in CLL patients yields less successful results than
      in other indolent B cell malignancies, and even responding patients may become refractory. We
      hypothesized that the abnormalities in the complement system identified in CLL underlie the
      suboptimal response to Rituximab, since complement-dependent cell cytotoxicity is a major
      mechanism of Rituximab action. Following patient consent and Institutional Review Board
      approval, standard-dose Rituximab (375 mg/m2) will be administered, preceded by 2 units of
      FFP. This treatment will be repeated every 1-2 weeks for 4-6 cycles. The clinical and
      laboratory parameters, as well as adverse drug events, will be monitored.

    <textblock>
      Indolent B cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients show good responses to Rituximab,
      administered either alone or preferably with standard chemotherapy. The response to Rituximab
      of patients with CLL is inferior in comparison to other indolent B cell malignancies. The
      therapeutic approach of combining treatments with Rituximab and fresh frozen plasma (FFP)
      used by us first in one case and following the impressive response - in additional 2
      patients, was undertaken on the basis of two observations.

      We assumed, that the addition of FFP to Rituximab treatment would increase and/or restore the
      efficacy of Rituximab in advanced CLL patients that are resistant to therapy by correcting
      their abnormal complement system thus allowing improved complement activation and increase
      anti-leukemic activity.

      The major aims of the study are: (1) To establish the efficacy of the combination of FFP and
      RTX as determined by response rate. (2) To elucidate the effector mechanism responsible for
      the efficacy of the FFP-Rituximab combination. The secondary aims of the study are (1) To
      establish the response duration of the combination of FFP and RTX as determined by time to
      progression. and time to re treatment (2) To determine the safety of the combined treatment.

      The study is designed as a single-arm, phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of
      combined treatment with FFP and RTX in advanced refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
      along with an analysis of the complement system associated parameters.
