    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to begin the multi-step process of establishing the reliability and
      validity of hepatic triglyceride content (HTGC) and carotid artery intima-media thickness
      (IMT) as biomarkers of cardiometablic risk in children treated for mental illness. The
      distribution of HTGC and carotid IMT—proximate indicators of cardiometabolic risk—across a
      range of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)-measured adiposity in children treated with
      antipsychotic agents will be characterized in comparison to healthy, untreated,
      non-psychiatric controls, in order to estimate effect sizes for future studies incorporating
      these markers. The ability of HTGC and IMT to predict cardiometabolic risk as measured by
      commonly-used laboratory tests, such as fasting lipids, liver function tests, C-reactive
      protein and serum fibrinogen, will be assessed.

    <textblock>
      Carotid artery intima media wall thickness (IMT) is one of the most developed biomarkers of
      cardiometabolic risk, with established reliability and predictive validity, and has been
      utilized as a surrogate endpoint for cardiovascular disease progression in FDA-reviewed
      registration studies. This technique has also been used in children and adolescents without
      psychiatric disorders, indicating that changes in IMT are positively correlated with
      metabolic syndrome criteria. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H MRS) to quantify hepatic
      triglyceride content (HTGC) is a promising new marker of cardiometabolic risk, especially
      given the importance of nocturnal circulating free fatty acids in the development of insulin
      resistance leading to type 2 diabetes. Fatty liver, related in part to obesity, is the most
      common liver abnormality found in children ages 2-19, with one in ten children manifesting
      signs of macrovascular steatohepatitis. 1H MRS is a well-established methodology used to
      measure HTGC that correlates well with liver biopsy results. This technique has been studied
      in obese children without psychiatric disorders, and is widely considered to be the optimal
      noninvasive means by which to measure HTGC. Unfortunately, neither of these promising methods
      have been applied to the study of cardiometabolic risk in children with psychiatric
      disorders.

      It is important to now study these biomarkers in psychiatric populations, where individuals
      are subject to treatments that can increase risk. Our group is experienced in the application
      of sophisticated, gold standard techniques for measuring cardiometabolic risk in psychiatric
      populations, and is—to our knowledge—the only group in the US using sensitive methodologies
      like stable isotopomer euglycemic clamps to study the pathophysiology leading to diabetes and
      cardiovascular disease in the mentally ill. An important goal of studying these biomarkers is
      to ultimately determine which of the more commonly available conventional risk measures
      (e.g., lipid profiles, adiposity measures) can be used alone or in combination to accurately
      identify children at highest risk, to aid in the development and targeting of effective
      interventions.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        The inclusion criteria for the treatment group participants are: i) aged approximately 6-18
        years; ii) BMI percentile between approximately 25 and 99; iii) otherwise healthy and meets
        DSM-IV criteria for one or more childhood onset psychiatric disorder, any type (determined
        by semi-structured Missouri Assessment of Genetics Interview for Children or
        MAGIC—described below and at the discretion of the PI), treated with an antipsychotic &gt;
        approximately 12 weeks; iv) able to give assent and have a guardian that can provide
        informed consent; and v) no antipsychotic medication dose changes for approximately 1
        month, and no other medication changes for 1 month prior to study enrollment.

        The inclusion criteria for healthy controls are: i) aged 6-18 years; ii) BMI percentile
        between approximately 25 and 99 iii) otherwise healthy and at the PI's discretion do not
        meet DSM-IV criteria for any Axis I psychiatric illness; iv) not currently taking any
        medications; and v) able to give assent, and have a guardian that can provide informed
        consent.

        The exclusion criteria are: i) active suicidality or a primary diagnosis of major
        depressive disorder; ii) any lifetime use of antipsychotics; individual subjects with a
        remote, brief prior antipsychotic exposure may be considered for enrollment on a case by
        case basis by the PI; iii) the presence of any serious medical disorder that may confound
        the assessment of relevant biologic measures or diagnoses, including: significant organ
        system dysfunction; endocrine disease, including type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus;
        coagulopathy; anemia; or acute infection; all based on PI discretion; iv) subjects
        regularly taking within the last 3 months any glucose lowering agent, lipid lowering agent,
        exogenous testosterone, recombinant human growth hormone, or any other endocrine agent that
        might confound substrate metabolism, oral glucocorticoids (glucocorticoid nasal spray and
        inhalers are permitted), sedating antihistamines (non-sedating antihistamines such as but
        not limited to Claritin (loratadine) and Zyrtec (cetirizine) are permitted), and certain
        mood stabilizing agents, as some medications may themselves worsen or otherwise alter
        weight gain, glucose and lipid regulation or otherwise make it difficult to assess the
        effects of the antipsychotic alone; (note that exposure to many psychotropic agents
        including stimulants and SSRI's is permitted in order to maintain the generalizability of
        the sample); v) IQ &lt; 70 (based on school records and/or evaluation by clinician); vi)
        current substance abuse; vii) past history of, or current dyskinesia; viii) stimulant
        dosage significantly higher (per PI judgment) than the equivalent of approximately 2
        mg/kg/day methylphenidate equivalent dose.
