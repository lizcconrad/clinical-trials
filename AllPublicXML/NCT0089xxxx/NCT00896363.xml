  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test if GSK163090 can reduce the symptoms of depression. The
      safety and how well the body can handle the drug will also be investigated. The study will be
      conducted in Russia in hospitalised patients with severe depression. GSK163090 will be
      compared with placebo, which looks like the study drug but does not contain any active
      substance. Subjects will be given either the study drug or the matching placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, repeat dose, parallel
      group study in male and female patients with severe depression requiring hospitalization.
      Efficacy, safety and tolerability will be assessed in three treatment arms. The study will
      consist of a screening period, a treatment phase (up to 6 weeks) and a post-treatment
      follow-up visit. The study duration from screening to follow up will be approximately 9
      weeks. Subjects who pass screening will be randomized on Day 1 to one of three treatment arms
      (low dose arm, high dose arm or placebo). Each treatment arm will contain approximately 50
      subjects. The subject's depressive symptoms will be assessed using the HAMD17- CR.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17), on Day 14 and 42</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, pre-dose), Day 14 and Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>HAMD-17 is a 17-item scale that evaluates depressed mood, vegetative and cognitive symptoms of depression, and co-morbid anxiety symptoms. The 17 items were rated on either a 5-point (0-4) or a 3-point (0-2) scale. In general, the 5 point scale items use a rating of 0=absent; 1=doubtful to mild; 2=mild to moderate; 3=moderate to severe; 4=very severe. The 3-point scale items use a rating of 0=absent; 1=probable or mild; 2=definite. The total HAMD-17score ranges from 0 (not ill) to 52 (severely ill). The highest possible score was 52, which represented the most severe measure of depression; the lowest possible score was 0, which represents an absence of depression. Baseline was defined as the assessment done on Day 1 (pre-dose). Change from baseline in total Score was the difference between HAMD total score at the time point being analyzed to Day 1.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, pre-dose), Day 14 and Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS-SR is a 16-item, participant-rated short form of the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology that assesses 9 domains: sad mood, concentration, self-criticism, suicidal ideation, interest, energy/fatigue, sleep disturbance (initial, middle, and late insomnia or hypersomnia), appetite/weight increase/decrease and psychomotor agitation/retardation. A total score was obtained by summing scores on each domain. the scores ranges from 0 (none) to 27 (very severe), where the highest possible score was 27, which represented the most severe measure of depression; the lowest possible score was 0, which represents an absence of depression. Baseline was defined as the assessment done on Day 1. Change from Randomization in total score was the difference between QIDS total score at the time point being analyzed to randomization.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Suicidal Behavior and Suicidal Ideation Subscales of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 52</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS was a clinician-rated scale that evaluated severity and change of suicidality by integrating both behaviour and ideation. The 2 of 3 sections of the scale were suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation. For suicidal behaviour participants were scored as non-suicidal-0, preparatory acts or behavior communicating ideation-01, aborted attempt-2, interrupted attempt-3 or actual attempt-4. The score ranges from 0-4, where 0 was absence of suicidal behavior and 4 being the most severe form of suicidal behavior. On the Suicidal Ideation scale, participants were scored as non-suicidal-0, wish to be dead-1, non-specific active suicidal thoughts-2, active suicidal ideation with associated thoughts of methods without intent-3, active suicidal ideation with some intent to act on suicidal thoughts without clear plan-4, active suicidal ideation with plan and intent-5. The score ranges from 0-5, where 0 was absence of suicidal ideation and 5 being the most severe form of suicidal ideation.</description>

        <description>HAMD-17 is a 17-item scale that evaluates depressed mood, vegetative and cognitive symptoms of depression, and co-morbid anxiety symptoms. The 17 items were rated on either a 5-point (0-4) or a 3-point (0-2) scale. In general, the 5 point scale items use a rating of 0=absent; 1=doubtful to mild; 2=mild to moderate; 3=moderate to severe; 4=very severe. The 3-point scale items use a rating of 0=absent; 1=probable or mild; 2=definite. The total HAMD-17score ranges from 0 (not ill) to 52 (severely ill). The highest possible score was 52, which represented the most severe measure of depression; the lowest possible score was 0, which represents an absence of depression. Baseline was defined as the assessment done on Day 1 (pre-dose). Change from baseline in total Score was the difference between HAMD total score at the time point being analyzed to Day 1.</description>

        <description>The bech melancholia is sum of scores on 6 items- depressed mood, feelings of guilt, work and activities, retardation, anxiety psychic, somatic symptoms general (items 1, 2, 7, 8, 10 and 13 respectively). Each item having 5 responses. The items are rated on a scale of 0-4, where 0=absent; 1=doubtful to mild; 2=mild to moderate; 3=moderate to severe; 4=very severe. Total possible score is 0-24. where the lowest possible score was 0, which represented an absence of depression and higher scores reflecting greater severity of diseases. Baseline was defined as the assessment done on Day 1. Change from baseline was the difference between BECH 6 scale at the time point being analyzed to randomization.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symtomatology – Self Rated (QIDS-SR) Scale, on Day 14 and 42</title>
        <description>The QIDS-SR is a 16-item, participant-rated short form of the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology that assesses 9 domains: sad mood, concentration, self-criticism, suicidal ideation, interest, energy/fatigue, sleep disturbance (initial, middle, and late insomnia or hypersomnia), appetite/weight increase/decrease and psychomotor agitation/retardation. A total score was obtained by summing scores on each domain. the scores ranges from 0 (none) to 27 (very severe), where the highest possible score was 27, which represented the most severe measure of depression; the lowest possible score was 0, which represents an absence of depression. Baseline was defined as the assessment done on Day 1. Change from Randomization in total score was the difference between QIDS total score at the time point being analyzed to randomization.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Suicidal Behavior and Suicidal Ideation Subscales of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS was a clinician-rated scale that evaluated severity and change of suicidality by integrating both behaviour and ideation. The 2 of 3 sections of the scale were suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation. For suicidal behaviour participants were scored as non-suicidal-0, preparatory acts or behavior communicating ideation-01, aborted attempt-2, interrupted attempt-3 or actual attempt-4. The score ranges from 0-4, where 0 was absence of suicidal behavior and 4 being the most severe form of suicidal behavior. On the Suicidal Ideation scale, participants were scored as non-suicidal-0, wish to be dead-1, non-specific active suicidal thoughts-2, active suicidal ideation with associated thoughts of methods without intent-3, active suicidal ideation with some intent to act on suicidal thoughts without clear plan-4, active suicidal ideation with plan and intent-5. The score ranges from 0-5, where 0 was absence of suicidal ideation and 5 being the most severe form of suicidal ideation.</description>

        <description>Urinalysis parameters included: Urine Occult Blood, Urine Ketones, Urine Ketones. data for number of participants with abnormal urinanalysis parameters was reported by dipstick method. dipstick was a strip used to detect the presence or absence of these parameters in the urine sample. dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results can be read as negative, Trace, 1+, 2+, and 3+, indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. Urine occult blood dipstick and urine general dipstick were semi quantitative results. Urine glucose and urine ketones dipstick results were in milimole per liter, urine protein dipstick results were in gram per liter.</description>

        <description>Data for change from Baseline was reported for PR Interval, QRS Duration, QT Interval, QTcB, QTcF, and RR Interval. 12-lead ECGs was obtained at each time point during the study using an ECG machine that automatically calculated the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTcB ,QTcF, and RR intervals. Day -1 evening (PM) was the Baseline for participants with only Day -1 records. Day 1 PM Dose was the Baseline for participants with Day 1 records. Baseline was the mean of replicate assessments. Change from Baseline was the difference between the value at the time point analyzed and baseline value.</description>

        <description>Heart rate is the speed of the heartbeat measured by the number of contractions of the heart per minute, (beats per minute). Heart rate was assessed at the specified time points. Measurements were taken after the participant has been semi-supine for at least 5 minutes. Day 1 was Baseline and change from Baseline was difference between the value at the time point analyzed and baseline value.</description>

        <description>Data for number of participants who presented one or more adverse events (serious or non serious) was reported. An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence (MO) in a participant temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product (MP), whether or not considered related to the MP and can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with its use. The SAE was any untoward MO that, at any dose, results in death, life threatening, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, congenital abnormality or birth defect, that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.</description>
