  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Football-related knee injuries are common and especially the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
      injury constitute a serious problem in football regardless of the playing level. The purpose
      of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of a training
      program designed to prevent acute knee injury in female adolescent football players.

      The investigators' hypotheses are:

        1. a preventive training program reduces the incidence of ACL injury, and

        2. a high match frequency and match play at senior level increase the risk of ACL injury.

    <description>The preventive program (Knäkontroll, SISU Idrottsböcker©, Sweden, 2005) consists of six exercises focusing on knee control and core stability and is performed during the warm-up at two training sessions per week throughout the 2009 competitive season.</description>
