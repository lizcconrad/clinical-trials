      The aim of this study was to assess the clinical effect of Lactobacillus sakei
      supplementation in children with atopic dermatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics were also shown to reduce severity of AEDS when administered to infants with early
      onset AEDS. In contrast, only a few studies have evaluated the therapeutic effectiveness of
      probiotics on the groups of older children with established AEDS. In these studies,
      administration of Lactobacillus strains to unselected children aged 1 year and over was
      associated with improvement in the clinical severity of eczema. The purpose of this study was
      to evaluate the clinical efficacy in AEDS of a newly identified probiotic strain,
      Lactobacillus sakei KCTC 10755BP, which showed the most potent inhibitory activity against S
      aureus growth among Lactobacillus species in our preliminary experiment. We administered L
      sakei to an unselected group of children aged 2 to 10 years with moderate and severe AEDS and
      evaluated the clinical outcome at the end of the intervention. In addition, we also measured
      levels of serum chemokines as activity markers for AEDS to provide a more objective evidence
      for the beneficial role of this probiotic.
