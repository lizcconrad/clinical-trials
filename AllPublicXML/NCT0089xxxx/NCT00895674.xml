  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell carcinoma accounts for roughly 3 % of all cancer. It is a rather aggressive cancer
      type, which means that patients who present with an advanced disease have a rather poor
      prognosis. When this study has been started the standard therapy for patients has been
      cytokines, which might be accompanied by significant toxicities or might fail the therapeutic
      goal. In these cases sorafenib can be a feasible therapeutic option. This non-interventional
      study has been created and is being conducted to collect clinical data on the patients'
      therapy with sorafenib in an everyday treatment schedule. The main goal of this study focuses
      on patient characteristics and tumor status in RCC treated with sorafenib as well as the
      treatment duration and safety of sorafenib under everyday treatment conditions.
