      The purpose of this trial is to improve the clinical management and outcome of patients with
      locally advanced cervical cancer by using positron emission tomography-computed tomography
      (PET-CT) imaging.

      There is considerable debate worldwide regarding the utility of PET for staging cervical
      cancer. Although there are studies on the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of PET in
      cervical cancer, there are currently no prospective randomized studies on how PET information
      affects treatment decisions and outcomes.

    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. In Canada, it is
      estimated that in 2009 there will be 1,300 new cases of cervical cancer and that 380 women
      will die of this disease. The corresponding 2009 data for Ontario is 500 new cases and 140
      deaths. In Canada, cervical cancer screening with the Pap test allows for the diagnosis and
      curative treatment of precancerous lesions of the cervix or early cervical cancers. Symptoms
      of cervical cancer include vaginal bleeding and discharge. Unfortunately these are often
      associated with more advanced disease.

      The costs associated with health care are increasing. PET is an expensive imaging modality.
      Given that resources for health care are not unlimited, there needs to be high quality
      evidence of an intervention such as PET's efficacy.

             eligible.

          -  Age equal to or greater than 18 years

          -  Being considered for treatment with curative intent using concurrent chemotherapy and
             pelvic RT.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  ECOG performance status greater than 2.

          -  Other cervical cancer tumour types (e.g. neuroendocrine, serous).

          -  Carcinoma of the cervical stump.

          -  Prior hysterectomy.

          -  Patients who, at the time of the initial evaluation, have already undergone a whole
             body PET-CT within the last 6 months.

          -  Inadequate bone marrow function: ANC less than 1.5 X 10^9, platelets less than 100 X
             10^9.

          -  Inadequate renal function: Creatinine greater/equal to 150 micromol/L

          -  Inadequate hepatic function: Bilirubin greater than 1.5 X ULN and SGOT and Alkaline
