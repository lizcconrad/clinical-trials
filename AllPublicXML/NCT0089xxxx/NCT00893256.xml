  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Negative symptoms in schizophrenia present a challenge to the clinician owing to their poorer
      response to conventional treatment with antipsychotics. Negative symptoms in schizophrenia
      may be secondary to psychotic symptoms, depressive symptoms, drug-related side effects or
      lack of environmental stimulation. Alternately, they may represent core features of the
      illness, characterized as primary deficit symptoms. Previous studies have suggested that
      atypical antipsychotics may be beneficial in improving deficit symptoms of schizophrenia.
      This study aimed at characterizing the nature of improvement of negative symptoms in the
      early phase (12 weeks) of treatment with the atypical antipsychotic, risperidone. In order to
      account for factors contributing to improvement in secondary negative symptoms, ratings were
      carried out of change in positive symptoms, depressive symptoms and drug-related side
      effects. Further, add-on citalopram or placebo were administered in a double-blind design to
      study the effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) augmentation of risperidone
      on negative symptoms. The investigators hypothesized that the improvement in negative
      symptoms during the initial phase (12 weeks) of treatment with risperidone will be largely
      accounted for by improvement in secondary negative symptoms, rather than of the primary
      deficit symptoms.
