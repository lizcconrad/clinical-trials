      The study will be testing metformin in patients with breast cancer who are about to undergo
      surgery. Patients will take metformin 3 times daily for about 2-3 weeks prior to their
      surgery date. It is hypothesized that metformin will reduce cell proliferation rates in
      tumour tissue.

                  oral contraceptives are contra-indicated in breast cancer) and to have a negative
                  pregnancy test prior to starting metformin.
