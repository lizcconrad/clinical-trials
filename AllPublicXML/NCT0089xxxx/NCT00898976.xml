      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue in the laboratory from Native American women with
      breast cancer may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to breast
      cancer in these patients. It may also help doctors learn more about the prognosis of these
      patients.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at biomarkers in Native American women with breast
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate a selected panel of molecular markers in tissue specimens from Native American
           women with breast cancer.

        -  Determine which molecular markers provide independent prognostic information with
           respect to traditional prognostic factors in these patients.

        -  Compare and contrast the prevalence of positivity in Native American women with breast
           cancer with an age- and stage-matched cohort of Caucasian women with breast cancer
           enrolled on clinical trial NCCTG-77-30-51 or the Mayo Breast Cancer Registry.

      OUTLINE: Immunohistochemistry is performed on tumor samples to analyze the following
      molecular markers: estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, c-erbB2, p53, Ki-67, Bcl-2, Bax,
      cyclin D-1, and insulin-like growth factor-1R.
