  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III study designed to demonstrate the superiority of single-dose 90 mg
      intravenous (IV) casopitant over placebo, each in combination with ondansetron and
      dexamethasone, for the prevention of emesis over the first 0-120 hours (overall phase)
      following initiation of the cisplatin infusion in the first cycle of highly emetogenic
      chemotherapy (HEC). Eligibility is limited to subjects who are scheduled to receive their
      first cycle of chemotherapy which includes at least 60 mg/m2 of cisplatin administered on Day
      1 only of a 21 day or 28 day cycle. All subjects will receive IV ondansetron and oral
      dexamethasone on Day 1 prior to initiation of the cisplatin infusion, followed by oral
      dexamethasone on Days 2-4. Additionally, subjects will be randomized to receive single-dose
      90 mg IV casopitant or matching placebo prior to initiation of a cisplatin-based HEC regimen.

             agents that may be added to oxaliplatin.

          -  An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Hematologic and metabolic status adequate for receiving an oxaliplatin-based
             moderately emetogenic regimen and meeting the following criteria:

          -  Total Neutrophils ≥1500/mm3 (Standard units : ≥1.5 x 109/L)

          -  Platelets ≥100,000/mm3 (Standard units: ≥100.0 x 109/L)

        males

          -  Liver enzymes must be below the following limits:

          -  Without known liver metastases: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 x ULN.

             urine dipstick pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the first dose of
             investigational product on Cycle 1 Day 1. Women of childbearing potential must also
             commit to consistent and correct use of an acceptable method of birth control. GSK
             acceptable contraceptive methods, when used consistently and in accordance with both
             the product label and the instructions of the physician, are as follows:

          -  male partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry into the study and is
             the sole sexual partner for that female subject;

             investigational product throughout the clinical trial, and for a period after the
             trial to account for elimination of the drug (minimum of 3 days);

          -  if subject indicates they will remain abstinent during the period described above,
             they must agree to follow GSK guidelines for the consistent and correct use of an
             acceptable method of birth control should they become sexually active.
