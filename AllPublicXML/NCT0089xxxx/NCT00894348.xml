      To determine factors associated with a positive yield of malignancy on biliary brush cytology
      obtained by ERCP.

      There are only 3 studies available that have tried to evaluate factors influencing the yield
      of brush cytology. Two of the 3 studied one parameter. The third study, which is also the
      largest, reported on 199 samples which the authors evaluated in a retrospect fashion. We plan
      to conduct a larger study assessing several other factors that have not been studied before.
      The study findings would help develop strategies to improve sensitivity of brush cytology
      specimens. This would ultimately result in more effective use of health care resources and
      improve patient outcomes.
