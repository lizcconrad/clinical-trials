    <textblock>
      Escalating doses of Omega 3 Fatty Acids are being used in patients who have early stage
      Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (ES-CLL), Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance
      (MGUS), or Smoldering Multiple Myeloma (SMM), whose disease does not currently require
      treatment. The primary aim of the study is to determine if the Omega 3 supplementation will
      help prevent or delay progression of the disease to a stage that requires treatment.

    <measure>Activated Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NFkB) in Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes From Patients With Early Stage Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Before, During and After Consumption of an Omega 3 Supplement.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, and post supplement month 1(3 capsules/day), month 2 (6capsules/day), month 3 (9 capusules/day), month 6 (9 capusules/day), month 9 (9 capusules/day), month 12 (post supplement)</time_frame>
    <description>Peripheral lymphocytes were isolated from the blood using Ficoll-Paque gradient. Nuclear Factor Kappa B activation was analyzed using Thermo Scientific Transcription Factor kit for NFkB p50, according to manufacturer's protocol. Protein extracts containing 1-15µg of protein/well were added in triplicates. Luminescence resulting from a reaction with bound NFkB was detected using a Berthold Centro LB960 Luminometer and analyzed with MikroWin 2000 ver. 1.08. NFkB activity was normalized by luminescence units/µg of protein per well.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Degree of Change in Tumor Mass Measurements During and After Omega-3 Supplementation as Evaluated by Standard Clinical Tests of Disease Activity.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, month 1, month 2, month 3, month 6, month 9, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients diagnosed with early stage (asymptomatic) CLL were supplemented with escalating doses of omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids (2.4 g of n-3/day up to 7.2 g of n-3/day). Given that these patients are asymptomatic and did not require treatment, measures of tumor mass during and after omega-3 supplementation, as evaluated by standard clinical tests of disease activity, were not performed. Instead, absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC), as a measure of tumor burden, was evaluated before and after omega-3 supplementation. Data represents the fold change in ALC post omega-3 consumption as compared to baseline ALC.
Patients with MGUS or SMM were not enrolled into this study.</description>

          <description>Peripheral lymphocytes were isolated from the blood using Ficoll-Paque gradient. Nuclear Factor Kappa B activation was analyzed using Thermo Scientific Transcription Factor kit for NFkB p50, according to manufacturer’s protocol. Protein extracts containing 1-15µg of protein/well were added in triplicates. Luminescence resulting from a reaction with bound NFkB was detected using a Berthold Centro LB960 Luminometer and analyzed with MikroWin 2000 ver. 1.08. NFkB activity was normalized by luminescence units/µg of protein per well.</description>
          <population>NFkB activation of all patients diagnosed with early stage CLL at baseline and following omega 3 consumption. Patients are further separated into high (&gt; median, n=7) and low initial baseline (&lt; median, n=6) NFkB. Patients included must have had one baseline and at least one period of omega 3 consumption. Not all patients completed all periods</population>

        <title>The Degree of Change in Tumor Mass Measurements During and After Omega-3 Supplementation as Evaluated by Standard Clinical Tests of Disease Activity.</title>
        <description>Patients diagnosed with early stage (asymptomatic) CLL were supplemented with escalating doses of omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids (2.4 g of n-3/day up to 7.2 g of n-3/day). Given that these patients are asymptomatic and did not require treatment, measures of tumor mass during and after omega-3 supplementation, as evaluated by standard clinical tests of disease activity, were not performed. Instead, absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC), as a measure of tumor burden, was evaluated before and after omega-3 supplementation. Data represents the fold change in ALC post omega-3 consumption as compared to baseline ALC.
Patients with MGUS or SMM were not enrolled into this study.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, month 1, month 2, month 3, month 6, month 9, 12 months</time_frame>
        <population>Patients who's absolute lymphocyte counts were known prior to omega-3 initiation (baseline) and after omega-3 consumption were included in this analysis. Patients who's ALC was unknown prior to omega-3 initiation or after omega-3 consumption were excluded.</population>
