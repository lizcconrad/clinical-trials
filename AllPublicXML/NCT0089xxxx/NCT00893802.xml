    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of treatment of periodontal disease during
      the second trimester of gestation in adverse pregnancy outcomes.

      Pregnant patients during the 1st and 2nd trimesters at antenatal care in a Public Health
      Center will be divided into two groups: NIG- 'no intervention' or IG- 'intervention,'
      according to agreement in receive periodontal treatment during pregnancy. Treatment will be
      performed by a single periodontist consisting of scaling and root planning (SRP),
      professional prophylaxis (PROPH) and oral hygiene instruction (OHI). Patients at NIG will
      receive PROPH and OHI during pregnancy and will be referred for treatment after delivery.
      Periodontal evaluation will be performed by a single trained examiner, blinded to periodontal
      treatment, according to probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque index
      (PI) and sulcular bleeding index (SBI) at baseline and 35 gestational weeks-28 days
      post-partum. Primary adverse pregnancy outcomes to be addressed are: preterm birth (&lt; 37
      weeks), low birth weight (&lt; 2.500 Kg), late abortion (14-24 weeks) or abortion (&lt; 14 weeks).
      The results obtained will be statistically evaluated according to OR, unpaired t test and
      paired t test.

      It is expected that periodontal treatment during the second trimester of gestation will
      result in decreased rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

      All patients entering the study at the 1st and 2nd trimesters will be invited to participate
      in an oral health program, including oral hygiene instruction, caries diagnosis and
      treatment, and evaluation and treatment of periodontal conditions during the second
      trimester. Those who refuse to receive periodontal treatment during pregnancy will constitute
      the 'no intervention' control group (NIG), while those who agree in receiving dental and
      periodontal treatment during the second trimester of gestation will constitute the
      'intervention' group (IG).

      Patients are going to be evaluated by a single calibrated periodontist blinded in relation to
      periodontal treatment, which will be performed by another periodontist. Treatment consists of
      scaling and root planning, professional prophylaxis and oral hygiene instruction. Obstetrical
      data, birth weight and gestation duration will be recorded after examination and recording by
      the responsible obstetrician and nursery staff.
