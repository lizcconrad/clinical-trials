      RATIONALE: Gathering information about metabolic syndrome from young patients who have
      survived acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may help doctors learn more about the disease.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the metabolic syndrome in young patients who have
      survived acute lymphoblastic leukemia and in healthy sibling volunteers.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (MS) and its component traits (i.e.,
           obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance) in survivors of childhood
           acute lymphoblastic leukemia and in healthy sibling volunteers.

        -  Identify host- and treatment-related risk factors for MS.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients' medical charts are reviewed and patients undergo anthropometric measuring (height
      and weight for BMI calculation and waist and hip circumferences) and blood pressure testing.
      Patients also complete questionnaires on their physical activity, diet, and family history
      over 30-45 minutes. Blood is collected to measure cytokines (e.g., adiponectin, leptin,
      interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein), fasting glucose, and fasting insulin.

      Healthy volunteers undergo anthropometric measuring and blood pressure testing (if they are
      seen in the clinic). They also complete a baseline medical history and questionnaires on
      their physical activity and diet.

        A minimum target accrual at each institution is 25 subjects for each treatment modality and
        25 siblings, for a total of 75 study participants at VCH. An attempt will be made to
        approach equal numbers of male and female survivors.
