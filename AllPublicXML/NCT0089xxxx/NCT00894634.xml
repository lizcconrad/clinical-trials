      The objective of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of
      brompheniramine maleate (BROM) in children and adolescents, ages 2 to less than 18 years
      following dosing in accordance with current weight-age dosing guidelines. Once characterized,
      the PK data will be pooled with adult PK data from other studies and analyzed under a
      separate analysis plan to confirm or refine the existing OTC doses in children aged 2 to &lt;12
      yrs and adolescents aged 12 to &lt;18 yrs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or females between 2 to less than 18 yrs of age with a minimum weight of 24
             pounds and within the 5th and 95th percentiles in height and weight, and BMI based on
             age and gender

          2. Symptomatic or asymptomatic children/adolescents as follows:

               -  A prior diagnosis of allergic rhinitis and either symptomatic or asymptomatic at
                  the time of entry in the study; or * Symptoms of an acute URI; or

               -  No symptoms of an acute URI, but at risk for developing an acute URI as evidenced
                  by the following frequency, crowding, and exposure criteria:

                    -  Frequency: a history of frequent URIs defined as greater than 6
                       infections/yr for children aged 2 to less than 6 yrs and as greater than 4
                       infections per year for adolescents aged 6 to less than 18 yrs;

                    -  Crowding: living in a home with greater than 4 persons, or sleeping in the
                       same bedroom with greater than 3 persons;

                    -  Exposure: the presence of another family member in the household who is ill
                       with a URI, or a child in the family that is attending preschool, or
                       attending school with greater than 6 children in the class;

          3. Except for allergic rhinitis or a URI, children/adolescents are in normal physical
             health (i.e., no clinically significant systemic disease) as judged by the
             Investigator upon physical examination of the subject;

          4. Subjects do not require concomitant medication except for low-dose inhaled
             glucocorticoids for allergic rhinitis or mild concomitant asthma, if dose is
             stabilized before entry in the study (i.e., dose is not changed for one month prior to
             or during the study), and inhaled short-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonists for
             concomitant asthma, as needed;

          5. Post menarchal females must be using a reliable method of contraception (i.e., oral,
             transdermal, injectable or implanted contraceptives, IUD, cervical cap, diaphragm,
             condom, abstinence, or surgical sterility).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The child/adolescent weighs less than 24 pounds or is below the 5th or above the 95th
             percentiles in physical growth characteristics (i.e., height and weight), and BMI
             based on age and gender;

          2. Inability to swallow the medication;

          3. Eaten within 2 hours prior to dosing;

          4. A known hypersensitivity to BROM, any other antihistamine, or EMLA cream;

          5. Systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure at or above the 95th percentile based on
             gender, and age and height percentiles. (Note: If a subject with no history of
             hypertension has a blood pressure reading at or above the 95th percentile, the subject
             will be allowed to rest for 15 minutes and the blood pressure measurement repeated. Up
             to 3 consecutive measurements at approximately 5 min intervals will be allowed.
             Subjects who continue to have systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure readings at or
             above the 95th percentile will be excluded from the study);

          6. History of melena or any hepatic, renal, endocrine (e.g., diabetes, thyroid disorder),
             cardiac, neurological, psychiatric, gastrointestinal, hematological or metabolic
             disorder deemed to be clinically significant by the Investigator;

          8. The child is diagnosed with anemia or has a red blood cell count or hemoglobin level

             treatment before and during the study, i.e., no use within 7 days of entering the
             study or at any time during the study, and no use of astemizole within the preceding 3
             calendar months;

         11. Other than described in Exclusion Criterion i, use of any medication 72 hours prior to
             dosing;
