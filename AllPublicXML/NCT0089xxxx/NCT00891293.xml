  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a 24-month, open-label extension study that followed an 8-week double-blind study
      (Study LOV111859/OM5) and an 8-week, open-label extension study (LOV111860/OM5X). Study
      LOV111859/OM5 was conducted to evaluate whether combination therapy with Lovaza (omega-3-acid
      ethyl esters) and Antara (fenofibrate) would result in a greater reduction in serum
      triglyceride levels in hypertriglyceridemic subjects than treatment with fenofibrate alone.
      This second extension of 24 months was to assess the continued efficacy of adjunctive Lovaza
      (omega-3-acid ethyl esters) [formerly known as Omacor] therapy in hypertriglyceridemic
      subjects treated with Antara (fenofibrate) in lowering serum triglyceride (TG) levels.

      Three studies comprise this program. Study LOV111859/OM5 (double-blind study) was followed by
      two open label extensions - LOV111860/OM5X (1st open label extension - 8 weeks) and
      LOV111821/OM5XX (2nd open label extension - 24 months).

      Studies LOV111859/OM5 and LOV111860/OM5X are outlined in NCT00246636.

        Subjects were men and women who had successfully completed the previous open-label
        extension study (LOV111860/OM5X) and had met all inclusion and exclusion criteria for the
        original double-blind study (LOV111859/OM5) and throughout LOV111860/OM5X, or who had a
        renewed waiver of a previously approved protocol deviation.

        Eligibility for entry into this study was based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria
        described of the double-blind LOV111859/OM5 protocol.

        Subjects were men and women who had successfully completed the previous open-label
        extension study (LOV111860/OM5X) and had met all inclusion and exclusion criteria for the

        renewed waiver of a previously approved protocol deviation. The main eligibility criteria
        for LOV111859/OM5 were,

          -  18 to79 years of age (inclusive) at screening

          -  fasting serum TG levels ≥500 mg/dL and &lt;1300 mg/dL

          -  BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 and ≤43 kg/m2.

        Subjects enrolled directly from the end of LOV111860/OM5X into LOV111821/OM5XX.
