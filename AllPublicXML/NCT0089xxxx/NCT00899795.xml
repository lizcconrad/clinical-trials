      RATIONALE: Studying samples of bone marrow from patients with cancer and from healthy
      volunteers in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in bone
      marrow stromal (connective tissue) cells. It may also help doctors understand the effects of
      alkylating agents on bone marrow stromal cells.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is evaluating stromal cells in patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, or Fanconi anemia; in patients who were exposed to
      alkylating agents; and in healthy volunteers.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine abnormal stromal function in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
           myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), or Fanconi anemia; in patients who were exposed to
           alkylating agents; and in healthy volunteers.

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether clonal progenitors from patients with secondary AML or MDS are
           resistant to selected extracellular apoptotic cues.

        -  Determine whether stromal function in patients with secondary AML or MDS is more
           aberrant than stromal function in patients with primary AML or MDS.

        -  Determine whether cytotoxic agents known to induce secondary MDS or AML influence the
           supportive function of the bone marrow stroma.

        -  Determine whether cytoprotective agents reduce both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in
           hematopoietic progenitor cells and stromal cells.

      OUTLINE: Patients and healthy volunteers undergo bone marrow sample collection. Progenitor
      cells are grown in culture. Cell survival is quantified by flow cytometric and cytogenetic
      analysis, sister chromatid exchange, and FISH for chromosome 11 changes (for
      etoposide-exposed samples only).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients and healthy volunteers will be accrued for this
      study.
