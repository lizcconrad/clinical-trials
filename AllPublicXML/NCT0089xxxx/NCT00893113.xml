    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of Alfuzosin in treating Erectile
      Dysfunction in men with mild lower urinary tract symptoms based upon a change from baseline
      in erectile function (EF) domain of International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF).

    <textblock>
      This protocol is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial. Patients will be
      screened and then randomized to Group A or Group B at a 1:1 ratio to receive a placebo tablet
      once daily or Alfuzosin (10 mg) daily for 12 weeks. Patients will then crossover with the
      original placebo group receiving Alfuzosin for 12 weeks and the original Alfuzosin group
      receiving placebo. At every visit the patients will complete an IIEF and an AUA symptom
      index.

    <measure>Change From Baseline Erectile Function Domain of the International Index of Erectile Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) is used for the evaluation of male sexual function and diagnostic evaluation of Erectile Dysfunction (ED) severity. There are 5 domains of the IIEF: erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction. The Erectile Function (EF) domain of the IIEF is used to assess specific key components of ED including ability to achieve penetration and ability to maintain erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. A score of 0-5 is awarded to each question of the IIEF. The EF domain pertains to questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 15. Scores are totaled and ranges are assigned to results. In the EF domain, a score of 0-30 is possible. The EF scores can be interpreted as follows: 0-6 severe dysfunction, 7-12 moderate dysfunction, 13-18 mild to moderate dysfunction, 19-24 mild dysfunction, and 25-30 no dysfunction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in American Urological Association (AUA) Symptom Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The American Urological Association (AUA) Symptom Index is used to evaluate the severity of the patient's enlarged prostate symptoms. The AUA Symptom Index is completed by the patient. Questions are based on patient experiences in the past month and are answered on a scale of 0-5 (0 = not at all, 1 = less than one time in 5, 2 = less than half the time, 3 = about half the time, 4 = more than half the time, 5 = almost always). The scores are totaled and ranked as follows: mild (1-7), moderate (8-19), and severe (20-35).</description>

    <measure>Change in Total International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) is used for the evaluation of male sexual function and diagnostic evaluation of Erectile Dysfunction (ED) severity. There are 5 domains of the IIEF: erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction. A score of 0-5 is awarded to each question of the IIEF. Total IIEF scores range from 0-75. Lower scores indicate severe erectile dysfunction (0=severe erectile dysfunction), while higher scores indicate less erectile dysfunction (75=no erectile dysfunction).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Erectile Function Domain of the International Index of Erectile Function</title>
        <description>The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) is used for the evaluation of male sexual function and diagnostic evaluation of Erectile Dysfunction (ED) severity. There are 5 domains of the IIEF: erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction. The Erectile Function (EF) domain of the IIEF is used to assess specific key components of ED including ability to achieve penetration and ability to maintain erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. A score of 0-5 is awarded to each question of the IIEF. The EF domain pertains to questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 15. Scores are totaled and ranges are assigned to results. In the EF domain, a score of 0-30 is possible. The EF scores can be interpreted as follows: 0-6 severe dysfunction, 7-12 moderate dysfunction, 13-18 mild to moderate dysfunction, 19-24 mild dysfunction, and 25-30 no dysfunction.</description>

        <population>The evaluable set includes all subjects who have sufficient data to assess the primary efficacy endpoint, and who have no major protocol deviations. Subjects were analyzed according to randomized treatment. Data for 45 subjects was analyzed.</population>
