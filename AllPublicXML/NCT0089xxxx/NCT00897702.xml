  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn why certain drugs stop working in patients.In lab
      studies, tumors become resistant in several ways. Specific molecules seem to change and this
      may be why therapy stops working. However, we do not know if the same molecules change in
      patients. This study is being done to see if they do change. If we learn more about how
      patients become resistant, we may be able to offer better treatment in the future.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients:

          -  Diagnosed with progressive, recurrent or metastatic HER2+ or ER+ breast cancer.

        Cohort 1

          -  Patients who previously received treatment with anti-HER2 therapy (including
             trastuzumab, pertuzumab, TDM1, or lapatinib) as part of adjuvant chemotherapy and now
             have progressive or recurrent breast cancer or, patients who previously (or currently)
             received anti-HER2 therapy as part of a regimen for metastatic breast cancer and
             subsequently experienced.

          -  Evidence of disease progression or recurrence after prior therapy (e.g. radiologic
             progression by RECIST criteria or new metastasis).

          -  Prior tumor biopsy (may be original) defined as HER2+ by amplification by FISH (&gt;1.9
             gene copy number) or IHC 3+.

        Cohort 2

          -  Patients who previously received treatment with hormonal therapy (including tamoxifen,
             toremifene, raloxifene, anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane, fulvestrant, ARN-810) as a
             part of adjuvant therapy and now have progressive or recurrent breast cancer or
             patients who previously (or currently) receive hormonal therapy as part of a regimen
             for metastatic breast cancer and subsequently experienced evidence of disease
             progression.

        Cohort 3

          -  Patients not eligible for Cohorts 1 or 2, but previously received treatment of any
             other kind for breast cancer.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are unable to consent to a biopsy.

          -  Patients for whom a repeat biopsy would be medically unsafe
