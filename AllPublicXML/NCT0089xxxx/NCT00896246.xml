  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase 1, open-label, randomized study, designed to assess the impact of Moviprep®
      or Klean-Prep® on gastrointestinal transit. It was performed in two parallel groups with Part
      A in two groups of four subjects preceding Part B, which was performed in two groups of 12
      subjects. Subjects attended a pre-study medical within 28 days of dosing and a post-study
      medical 5-10 days after the final dose. Within both Part A and Part B, subjects were required
      to attend the clinical unit for 2 study periods. Part A consisted of a baseline period to
      determine individual reference times for gastrointestinal transit. Part B was the test period
      in which gastrointestinal transit following the administration of the test preparations was
      assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy males;

          3. Body Mass Index of 18-35 kg/m2;

          4. Must be willing and able to participate in the whole study and must provide written
             informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participation in a clinical research study involving investigational drugs or dosage
             forms within the previous 3 months;

          2. Subjects who have previously been enrolled in this study;

          3. Subjects who have ever sought advice from or been referred to a GP or counsellor for
             abuse or misuse of alcohol, non medical drugs, medicinal drugs or other substance
             abuse e.g. solvents;

          4. Subjects who admit to any current or previous use of Class A drugs such as opiates,
             cocaine, ecstasy, LSD (d lysergic acid diethylamide) and intravenous amphetamines.
             Subjects who admit to occasional past use of cannabis will not be excluded as long as
             they have a negative drugs of abuse test and have abstained from cannabis use for at
             least 3 months;

          5. Positive drugs of abuse test result;

          6. Regular alcohol consumption &gt; 21 units per week (1 Unit = ½ pint beer, a 25 mL shot of

          7. Current smokers and those who have smoked within the last 12 months. A breath carbon
             monoxide reading of greater than 10 ppm at screening;

          8. Radiation exposure from clinical trials, including that from the present study and
             from diagnostic x rays but excluding background radiation, exceeding 5 mSv in the last
             twelve months or 10 mSv in the last five years. No occupationally exposed worker, as
             defined in the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999, shall participate in the study;

          9. Clinically significant abnormal biochemistry, haematology or urinalysis as judged by
             the PMI;

             performed within the previous 12 months);

         11. History of clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, respiratory and

             AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome), other sexually transmitted disease or
             hepatitis. This will be assessed by the use of a question which requires that a
             potential subject decides whether he fulfills any category included on a reference
             card. If the answer is 'yes', the subject is excluded from the study;

         15. Positive HBV, HCV or HIV results;

             not stop taking a prescribed medication for the purpose of entering the study;
