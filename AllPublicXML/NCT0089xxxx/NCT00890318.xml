    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine multiple dose safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of ABT-072 under nonfasting conditions in healthy adult subjects, and to
      determine the effect of single dose administration of ketoconazole on steady state ABT-072
      pharmacokinetics.
