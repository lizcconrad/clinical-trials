    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the present study is to assess satisfaction in a large sample of next of
      kin in Swiss-German ICUs.

      Secondary aims are to test the hypothesis that family satisfaction is related to ICU
      structure and process and to factors related to patients and next of kin. Further, the
      hypothesis will be tested that proxy assessment is possible, i.e. next of kin rate
      satisfaction with care similar to patients.
