  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study sets out to test the hypothesis that parameters of heart rate variability, as a
      non-invasive measure of cardiovascular risk, can be improved by the addition of omega-3 fatty
      acids in euthymic bipolar patients with a low omega-3 index and reduced heart rate
      variability.

    <description>The study drug is a food supplement called EPAX 6015 TG. One capsule of EPAX 6015 TG contains 530 mg of EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and 150 mg of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), provided as triglycerides. For the entire study period (12 weeks) patients will receive 4 capsules of EPAX 6015 TG per day.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must meet the DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorders, in remission

          2. Age: 18 - 65 years

          3. Low omega-3 index (&lt;5%)

          4. SDNN &lt; 60 msec

          5. Subjects must have adequate fluency in German or English to complete baseline and
             follow-up interviews and fill out the Beck Depression Inventory

          6. Stable psychotropic medication for at least 2 weeks

          7. Subjects must be able to give written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects for whom the intake of omega-3 fatty acids is indicated according to recent
             treatment guidelines

          2. Patients on Warfarin

          3. Subjects with any acute and life-threatening condition, such as collapse and shock,
             acute myocardial infarction, stroke, embolism

          4. Subjects with significant medical comorbidity

          5. Pregnant subjects - due to any possible teratogenic effects of EPAX 6015 TG and corn
             oil, respectively, on the fetus - and breastfeeding subjects. In addition, women of
             childbearing potential who will not practice a medically accepted method of
             contraception will be excluded

          6. Subjects who, in the investigator's judgement, pose a current significant suicidal or
             homicidal risk or patients who will not likely be able to comply with the study
             protocol

          7. Subjects fulfilling the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for current substance abuse
