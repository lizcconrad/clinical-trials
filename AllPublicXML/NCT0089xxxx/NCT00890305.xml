    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will be performed in previously untreated patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer. The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the study
      drug, CT-011, in combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy (FOLFOX4 or mFOLFOX6) compared with
      treatment by FOLFOX alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial will be a multi-center, randomized, open label, active control
      study in previously untreated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer aimed to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the monoclonal antibody, CT-011, administered at
      3mg/kg in combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy (FOLFOX4 or mFOLFOX6) compared with treatment
      by FOLFOX alone. Approximately 168 patients are planned to be enrolled to this study.

    <description>CT-011 (3 mg/kg) administered intravenously every 4 weeks for 4 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression or maximum tolerance.
FOLFOX (FOLFOX4 or mFOLFOX6) administered 7 days after the first administration of CT-011 and repeated every 14 days for up to 24 cycles. At the end of FOLFOX therapy, patients who have not progressed will be eligible for maintenance chemotherapy with 5-FU/leucovorin at the same dose and schedule until disease progression or study drug discontinuation.</description>
