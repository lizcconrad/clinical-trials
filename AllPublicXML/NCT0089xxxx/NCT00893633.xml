      Since 1984, the problem of critical illness neuromuscular abnormalities (CINMAs) has
      attracted considerable interest. According to these studies, CINMAs include the muscular
      weakness that accompanies critical illness resulting from polyneuropathy and/or myopathy and
      can be seen in 25-85% of cases of critically ill patients. Clinically, CINMAs present as
      symmetric flaccid tetraparesis and difficulty weaning off mechanical lung ventilation.
      However, these data are derived from treating non-specialized intensive care unit (ICU)
      patients. In this research, we wished to investigate CINMAs in neurocritical care patients.
      From day one of the patients' participation in the research and until a discharge from the
      ICU (or death), daily neurological surveys and weekly nerve conduction studies were
      performed. Based on the results of each nerve conduction study, an index of neuromuscular
      damage was noted to evaluate the severity of the CINMAs. Needle electromyography and muscle
      biopsy were not used
