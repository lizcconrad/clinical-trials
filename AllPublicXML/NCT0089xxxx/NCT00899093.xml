      This research trial studies chitinase 3-like 1 (cartilage glycoprotein-39) (YKL-40) in serum
      samples from patients with newly diagnosed stage III-IV ovarian epithelial, primary
      peritoneal cavity, or fallopian tube cancer receiving chemotherapy. Studying samples of serum
      in the laboratory from patients receiving chemotherapy may help doctors learn more about the
      effects of chemotherapy on cells. It may also help doctors understand how well patients
      respond to treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the ability of the YKL-40 serum marker to detect response or lack of response to
      primary chemotherapy in International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage
      III or IV invasive epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

      II. To compare the predictive accuracy of YKL-40 with cancer antigen 125 (CA125).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the ability of the YKL-40 serum marker to detect recurrence of ovarian, primary
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer in patients who are in first remission following primary
      chemotherapy.

      II. To test the ability of the YKL-40 serum marker to predict poor risk patients with FIGO
      stage III or IV invasive epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore alternative cut-off values for YKL-40 elevation in this large patient
      population.

      II. To describe the variability of YKL-40 and CA125 measurements in patients receiving
      primary chemotherapy and in primary remission in a large patient population.

      III. To describe the accuracy of YKL-40 coupled with CA125 measurements in predicting
      chemotherapy response, progression-free survival and overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of serum samples for analysis of YKL-40 via enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and CA125 via chemiluminometric sandwich immunoassay at the
      following time-points: at baseline; prior to beginning each course of chemotherapy (courses
      1-6); at completion of chemotherapy; every 3 months during years 1-2 post-chemotherapy; every
      6 months during years 3-5 post-chemotherapy; every year during years 6-10 post-chemotherapy;
      and at time of disease recurrence or progression.

    <description>In order to make a valid comparison between CA125 and YKL-40, in this study computed tomography (CT) criteria will be treated as the &quot;gold standard&quot; and whether changes in YKL-40 levels correlate with CT evidence as well as or better than changes in CA125 levels will be evaluated.</description>

    <measure>Time to disease progression using RECIST criteria</measure>

    <measure>Time to tumor recurrence (relapse)</measure>
    <time_frame>From study entry until disease recurrence, death or date of last contact, assessed up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Parallel analyses of the markers as predictors of time-to-relapse will be performed using survival-type regression methods such as the Cox proportional hazards model or a parametric maximum likelihood model. The total number of patients available for analysis of time to relapse is the number of patients who respond to treatment.</description>

    <measure>YKL-40 measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>YKL-40 will be compared to CA125 in terms of its ability to detect response to chemotherapy (during chemotherapy) and recurrence of disease (in remission). Serum YKL-40 behavior will also be assessed as a reflection of tumor histology, tumor grade, and tumor stageâ€”all in comparison to CA125. The accuracy of each marker alone will be compared using area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and assess which adds more predictive information when both are included in logistic regression.</description>

    <description>Optimal cut-off values for YKL-40 that subsequently can be used in clinical practice will be determined. Any statistical significance calculated for an optimized cut-off will adjust for the selection process, and any comparison with CA-125 will treat both markers in the same way.</description>
