      The purpose of this protocol is to pathologically evaluate the destruction by microwave
      ablation of primary and metastatic liver tumors. The primary aim is to measure tissue
      destruction with the MedWaves Microwave Ablation/ Coagulation Ablation System.

    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive surgical alternatives are becoming more attractive for the treatment of
      malignancy.The goal is to reduce morbidity and mortality and increase the ability to treat
      patients in the outpatient setting. Image-guided ablation is becoming an attractive
      alternative because of its relative low cost, its ability to provide large regions of
      coagulative necrosis in a controlled fashion, and its relatively low toxicity. Although
      image-guided ablative techniques have been extensively investigated for the treatment of
      liver tumors, there has been limited experience with microwave ablation (MWA) in the liver.
      This study will evaluate the treatment effect of MWA in liver tumors. Patients undergoing
      planned surgical removal of liver tumors will have the tumors intra-operatively treated with
      MWA. The histological changes will be evaluated upon removal of the specimen.
