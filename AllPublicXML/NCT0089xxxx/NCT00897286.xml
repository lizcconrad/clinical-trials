    <textblock>
      This laboratory study is looking at stored tumor samples in young patients with brain tumors.
      Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors
      learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      The overall objective of this non-therapeutic protocol is to identify molecular abnormalities
      within prospectively treated pediatric CNS develop xenograft and in vitro models derived from
      Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumors (ATRT), Choroid Plexus Carcinomas (CPC), Ependymoma and
      high-grade gliomas. The investigators will characterize the genome-wide mutation, expression
      and epigenetic signatures of these models and compare them with the primary tumors from which
      they were derived, thus creating well-characterized and invaluable resource for research on
      these rare and deadly pediatric brain tumors. This will also provide important insights into
      intratumoral heterogeneity, and molecular abnormalities that may influence the selective
      pressures driving evolution, and tumor growth as xenografts or in vitro. and define the
      relationship between these abnormalities and tumor histologic and clinical characteristics.
      This objective will be achieved by applying state-of-the-art DNA, RNA and protein epigenome
      analysis tools to the study of fresh frozen, fixed and cultured tumor cells and xenografts.
      The establishment of cell cultures from each tumor sample will also allow for in vitro and in
      vivo analysis of tumor cell growth, signaling and therapeutic response.

        Participants will have ATRT, CPC, medulloblastoma/PNET, ependymoma or glioma of the CNS as
        documented by the local neuropathologist. All studies will be conducted using tumor
        material collected prospectively from a clinically well characterized patient cohort.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  ATRT, CPC, medulloblastoma/PNET, ependymoma or glioma of the CNS as documented by the
             local neuropathologist. Tumor may be primary, progressive or recurrent CNS tumor
             including brain and/or spine. For fresh tissue, in some cases we must process the
             tissue before a final diagnosis is available. If a xenograft is established from a
             brain tumor that is later diagnosed to be a different histological subtype, we will
             store frozen viable cells for potential future use. Although rare, patients with ATRT
             may present with a primary renal and CNS tumor. In these instances samples will be
             collected from both the kidney and CNS tumor for analysis if available.

          -  Tumor may be collected at surgery prior to histologic confirmation

          -  Age not more than 21 years at the time of initial diagnosis.

          -  Enrollment in the current version of the institution's banking protocol

          -  Biological parent(s) of participant (child) whose tumor is studied on this protocol.
             These parents will be assigned to cohort P. The exclusion criteria below do not apply
             to this cohort.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Diagnosis of tumor outside the central nervous system.

          -  Age greater than 21 years at the time of diagnosis
