  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The integration of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the treatment planning process for
      prostate cancer will reduce uncertainties in delineation of the prostate gland, and will
      enable delineation of the urethra, penile bulb, and internal pudendal artery. The integration
      of daily cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) will markedly reduce set-up uncertainties,
      thereby reducing the minimum planning target volume (PTV) margin. By combining MRI simulation
      and daily CBCT, and by adapting radiation delivery accordingly, the investigators will reduce
      dose delivered to the rectum, bladder, urethra, and erectile structures. In this study, the
      investigators seek to determine whether this dose reduction translates to improved patient
      outcomes. In a prospective, 2-stage design, up to 190 patients will be enrolled. In the first
      stage, advanced imaging will be integrated without altering dose planning techniques. Stage 2
      will reduce dose delivered to normal tissues, and will collect toxicity outcome measures.
      This clinical trial will be conducted over 3 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advances in medical imaging, and their integration in the treatment planning and daily
      guidance of radiotherapy, stand to improve the therapeutic ratio. Improved imaging can reduce
      uncertainties by 1) improving the accuracy and reproducibility of organ or tumor delineation,
      and 2) guiding and adapting delivery to account for organ motion. This paradigm has been
      widely accepted in the radiotherapy community, and much research has addressed the technical
      and dosimetric aspects for a sound clinical implementation. However, direct evidence of a
      clinical translation to improved patient outcomes is limited. In this study, we hypothesize
      that the integration of advanced imaging for treatment planning and guidance will safely
      enable a reduction of dose delivered to normal tissues, and will improve toxicity and quality
      of life (QOL) outcomes in patients receiving external beam radiotherapy for low or
      intermediate risk prostate cancer.
