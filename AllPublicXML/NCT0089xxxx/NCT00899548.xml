      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer and from healthy participants
      in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that may occur in DNA and
      identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how well patients
      will respond to systemic therapy.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at DNA in predicting response after systemic
      therapy in women with metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Identify a panel of methylated gene markers in serum from women with metastatic breast
           cancer that is significantly different from that observed in healthy participants.

        -  Assess changes in a panel of methylated gene markers from baseline, after 3-4 weeks, and
           after 9-12 weeks of systemic therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the potential effects of common exposures (i.e., alcohol, smoking,
           medications, and dietary factors) on patterns of serum methylation in patients with
           metastatic breast cancer and in healthy participants.

        -  Develop a predictive model using DNA methylation profiles in serum that predicts
           clinical outcome for an individual patient with metastatic disease.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with clinical outcome in patients with
           metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Correlate CTCs with serum methylation in these patients.

        -  Determine if the addition of CTCs to serum methylation results in an improved predictive
           model.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, multicenter study.

      Patients and healthy participants fill out health assessment questionnaires at baseline, week
      3-4, and week 9-12.

      Patients undergo blood collection for methylated marker analysis at baseline, weeks 3-4, and
      weeks 9-12 and circulating tumor cell levels at baseline and weeks 3-4. Healthy participants
      undergo blood collection for methylated marker analysis at baseline. An additional cohort of
      healthy participants undergo follow-up blood collection ≥ 1 week after baseline.

      DNA methylation is measured by quantitative multiplex methylation-specific polymerase chain
      reaction (QM-MSP) assay.

      After completion of study procedures, patients are followed every 3-4 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients and 150 healthy participants will be accrued for
      this study.
