      This research studies collecting and storing tissue and blood samples from patients with lung
      cancer who are undergoing surgery. Collecting and storing samples of tissue and blood from
      patients with lung cancer to study in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about
      changes that may occur in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        1. To collect, catalog and store frozen samples of lung carcinoma and when possible,
           portions of involved lymph nodes, as well as adjacent grossly uninvolved lung tissue
           obtained from surgical specimens of patients undergoing surgical resection for
           previously untreated lung cancer as a source of quality DNA, messenger ribonucleic acid
           (mRNA) and protein for molecular analysis.

        2. To collect, catalog and store frozen samples of blood pre- and post-resection from the
           same patients to provide a source of reference DNA to assess somatic mutations
           associated with tumor or preneoplastic &quot;normal&quot; lung, and to allow assessment of levels
           of circulating markers.

        3. To associate these specimens with historical, clinical, pathological, and outcome
           information.

      Grossly viable tumor and grossly normal lung tissue are identified and removed from patient
      surgical specimens and cryopreserved until shipment to the Cancer and Leukemia Group B
      (CALGB) Lung Cancer Tissue Bank for future use in research. Blood specimens are also
      collected prior to surgery and at 4-12 weeks post-surgery (before the start of adjuvant
      therapy) and shipped immediately to the Tissue Bank.

        1. Histologic Documentation: All patients with suspected or histologically documented
             previously untreated lung cancer undergoing surgical resection are eligible whether or
             not the patient participates in a CALGB-sponsored treatment trial; patients enrolled
             on a CALGB trial of preoperative chemotherapy for lung cancer will be eligible if a
             pre-treatment frozen sample of tumor (e.g., a positive lymph node from
             mediastinoscopy) can be submitted to the bank; patients enrolled on CALGB 140203,
             intraoperative sentinel node mapping in non-small cell lung cancer, are not eligible.

          2. No patients with known infectious disease, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
             tuberculosis (TB), or hepatitis B, C
