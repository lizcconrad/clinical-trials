      RATIONALE: Studying the genes expressed in samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer
      may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at gene expression in tissue from patients with
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled in clinical trial ECOG-2993.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Identify genes involved in specific biologic processes or molecular functions that
           contribute to the mechanisms by which the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase induces a leukemic
           phenotype using RNA banked from patients with BCR/ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic
           leukemia (ALL) enrolled on ECOG-2993.

        -  Compare patterns of mRNA expression of BCR/ABL fusion protein in patients with B-lineage
           ALL vs patients with ALL and no cytogenetic abnormalities enrolled on ECOG-2993.

        -  Determine both shared and differing expression patterns in patients with
           BCR/ABL-positive and cytogenetically negative ALL with respect to achievement of
           complete remission and duration of disease-free and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Total RNA is isolated from stored tissue samples and integrity is verified by reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). cDNA libraries are created from total RNA
      and gene expression is analyzed via microarray analysis.

      Genes of interest are further analyzed by flow cytometry and RT-PCR.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 137 patients will be accrued for this study.
