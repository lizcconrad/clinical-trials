      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients who are at high risk of
      developing prostate cancer may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at blood samples from patients at high risk of
      developing prostate cancer and from healthy male participants.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine whether there are any changes in pro-oxidant-antioxidant profiles in
           patients who are at high risk for developing prostate cancer.

        -  To compare the profiles of these patients with those of healthy controls.

      OUTLINE: Participants undergo blood sample collection. Samples are used to measure levels of
      antioxidant enzymes (i.e., glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase,
      superoxide dismutase, and reduced glutathione) and biomarkers of oxidative stress and DNA
      damage in leukocytes (i.e., thiobarbituric acid reactive substances [TBARS] and
      8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine). Samples are analyzed via antioxidant enzyme assay, TBARS assay, and
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 participants (20 at high risk for developing prostate cancer
      and 20 healthy controls) will be accrued for this study.
