  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate whether treatment with this new drug will result
      in lower testosterone levels in men with prostate cancer. At the same time it will be
      investigated whether the drug induces side effects, and if so, which ones.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer growth is influenced by the male hormone testosterone. Treatment with drugs
      that stop the production of testosterone often results in a decrease of the tumor or
      inhibition of its growth. This is particularly important prior to radiotherapy, since
      radiation can better be focused on the prostate with as a result less frequent or less severe
      side effects of the radiation.

      Most of the drugs used to date to stop the production of testosterone have the disadvantage
      that initially they may cause a rise of testosterone levels before the production is
      effectively blocked. The new drug that will be investigated in this trial is a vaccine. The
      vaccine offers a different treatment modality since it interferes at a different level of the
      hormonal axis that drives the testosterone production; it will not cause an initial surge.

      In this trial the vaccine will be administered three times, testosterone levels will be
      monitored for a total period of three months.
