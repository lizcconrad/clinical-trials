  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are looking at how PTSD affects things such as memory,
      attention, reaction to sounds, eye movements, and heart rate. The investigators are also
      studying whether a medication called prazosin has an effect on these things.

      Converging lines of evidence suggest that central nor adrenergic function is perturbed in
      PTSD. Placebo-controlled trials demonstrate that the centrally acting alpha-1 antagonist
      prazosin is clinically effective for several core symptoms of PTSD in combat veterans.
      However, no detailed assessment of the impact of prazosin on human neurophysiology and
      cognition have been conducted. Our hypotheses are based on studies that demonstrate (1) the
      importance of central adrenergic receptors in regulating fundamental neurophysiologic and
      cognitive functions, (2) the alteration of these functions in PTSD, and (3) the efficacy of
      prazosin in improving the clinical symptoms of PTSD. The primary objective of this study is
      to measure the subtle neurocognitive and neurophysiologic effects on prazosin in combat
      veterans with PTSD.
