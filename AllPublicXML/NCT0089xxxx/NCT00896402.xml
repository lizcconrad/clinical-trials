  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous femoral nerve block (CFNB) techniques continue to be increasingly used in the
      management of postoperative pain after total knee arthroplasty. Although the risk of full
      blown infection with CFNB has been poorly defined, the rate of catheter colonization after
      antisepsis with povidone-iodine has been demonstrated to be high (Cuivillion et al. showed
      the rate of colonization to be 57% after 48 hours). Recently, several anecdotal case reports
      have demonstrated severe infectious complications including psoas abscess and necrotizing
      fasciitis associated with continuous nerve block techniques. As the use of CFNB techniques
      increase in popularity, infectious complications will undoubtedly become more common.

      The American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine recommends the routine use of
      antiseptic solutions with an alcohol base for skin disinfection before peripheral regional
      techniques due to their penetration of the stratum corneum and their rapid and prolonged
      effect. Chlorhexidine(chloraprep) has been proven to be better than povidone iodine solution
      for skin preparation before epidural catheter and intravascular device insertion (Kinirons et
      al., Ostrander et al., Mimoz et al.,). The goal of this prospective trial therefore is to
      determine if an alcoholic solution of 0.5% chlorhexidine is more effective than an aqueous
      solution of 10% povidone-iodine in reducing catheter colonization and reducing skin flora
      associated with short term ( 48 hours) postoperative continuous femoral nerve catheter
      placement. The investigators will also compare the ability of chloraprep and betadine
      disinfection at the time of catheter placement to prevent bacterial contamination of the
      continuous femoral catheter.

      After antisepsis four different cultures will be analyzed:

        1. The femoral nerve catheter will be removed after 48 hours and a culture of the distal
           tip of the femoral nerve catheter will be performed between the 2 arms.

        2. immediately before skin antisepsis, a culture of the the skin will be performed to
           identify baseline skin flora.

        3. immediately after antisepsis with both betadine and chlorhexidine, a culture of the skin
           will be performed to assess antiseptic efficacy.

        4. just prior to removal of the femoral nerve catheter, a culture of the skin/catheter
           interface will be performed between the 2 arms.
