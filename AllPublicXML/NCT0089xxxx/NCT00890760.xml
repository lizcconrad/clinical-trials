  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria affects around 515 million people each year, about a million of whom die from the
      disease. It is a major problem for those who live in affected areas as well as for travellers
      to affected areas. There is a great need for a safe, effective malaria vaccine. The purpose
      of this study is to test 2 new vaccination regimes that include a new malaria vaccine
      candidate, for their ability to prevent malaria infection.

      The vaccines are different types of virus which contain genetic information (DNA) from the
      malaria parasite. This genetic material is named ME-TRAP. The aim is to use these viruses to
      help the body make an immune response against the malaria parasite. Both viruses are
      inactivated so that they are unable to multiply within the body.

      The first vaccine virus is a weakened version of a common cold virus. Such adenoviruses occur
      in many strain types and commonly infect chimpanzees as well as people and this vaccine uses
      a strain originally derived from a chimpanzee. The vaccine is called AdCh63 ME-TRAP.

      The other virus is Modified Vaccinia Ankara Virus, (MVA), which is a safer form of the
      vaccine virus previously widely used for smallpox vaccination. The vaccine is called MVA
      ME-TRAP.

      This study will enable the investigators to assess:

        1. The ability of different vaccine combinations to prevent malaria infection

        2. The safety of the vaccine combinations in healthy volunteers

        3. The response of the human immune system to the vaccines
