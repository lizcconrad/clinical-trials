  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, the investigators are testing a new type of breast camera, called
      Molecular Breast Imaging, to see if it can find tumors in the subject's breast.

      Patients who are suspected to have DCIS based on mammographic findings will be invited to
      participate in this study. The investigators plan to recruit 200 patients who are scheduled
      to undergo a breast biopsy for a breast lesion considered suggestive or highly suggestive of
      DCIS as determined by a radiologist specializing in breast imaging. Each patient will have a
      suspicious area of calcification on mammography of extent &lt; 3 cm, or a non-focal area of
      abnormality on ultrasound or MRI that is scheduled for evaluation by biopsy. Each patient
      will undergo an MBI study immediately prior to biopsy. The study coordinator will approach
      these patients and inform them of the research project. If they are interested in
      participating, informed consent will be obtained and the patient will be scheduled for the
      MBI study prior to the breast biopsy.

        mammographic, ultrasound or MRI studies. Patients who are suspected to have DCIS based on
        mammographic findings will be invited to participate in this study.
