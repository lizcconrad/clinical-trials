      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and
      help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Colony-stimulating factors, such as GM-CSF, may cause the body to make
      more blood cells and help it recover from the side effects of rituximab and combination
      chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving GM-CSF together with rituximab and
      combination chemotherapy works in treating patients with previously untreated advanced
      follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the overall objective tumor response rate (complete and partial response
           rates) in patients with previously untreated advanced follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma
           treated with sargramostim (GM-CSF) and R-CHOP.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the time to progression.

        -  To evaluate the overall survival.

        -  To evaluate the duration of response.

        -  To evaluate the time to next treatment.

        -  To evaluate the safety profile of GM-CSF in combination with R-CHOP.

        -  To evaluate the influence of FcγR polymorphisms on clinical response.

        -  To monitor FcγR expressing cells in peripheral blood during treatment.

        -  To monitor the molecular biological marker bcl-2 [t(14;18)] in peripheral blood and bone
           marrow by quantitative PCR assay.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive R-CHOP comprising rituximab IV, cyclophosphamide IV,
           doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, and vincristine sulfate IV on day 1 and oral prednisone on
           days 1-5. Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 2-6.
           Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses. Patients then receive rituximab IV
           on day 1 and GM-CSF SC on days 1-5. Treatment with rituximab and GM-CSF repeats every 21
           days for 2 courses. Patients achieving complete or partial response proceed to
           maintenance therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1 and GM-CSF SC on days 1-5.
           Treatment repeats every 2 months for 12 courses.

      Blood and bone marrow samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for
      analysis of FcγR expression by immunophenotyping and bcl-2 rearrangement by quantitative PCR.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for 4 years.
