    <textblock>
      This open-label extension study will permit patients with Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic
      Arthritis (SJIA) who previously were responsive to treatment with canakinumab and canakinumab
      treatment-naïve patients with active SJIA with and without fever to be retreated with 4 mg/kg
      s.c. every 4 weeks and assessed for continued efficacy and safety until discontinuation or
      when study CACZ885G2402 is in place at their study center or around March 2013, whichever
      occurs first. Patients who are steroid-free will be able to taper their canakinumab dose to 2
      mg/kg s.c. every 4 weeks.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disability, Overall Well-Being and Pain Intensity Scores Based on Child Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) to Last Assessment of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to last assessment (4 years) or date of discontinuation, which ever occurred earlier</time_frame>
    <description>The CHAQ was used to assess physical ability, overall well- being and pain intensity experienced by participants. The CHAQ (disability and well-being) dimension consisted of 20 multiple choice items concerning difficulty in performing eight common activities of daily living; dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, reaching, personal hygiene, gripping and other &quot;activities&quot;. Participants were graded for the response in four categories, ranging from 0 (without any difficulty), 1 (with some difficulty), 2 (with much difficulty) and 3 (unable to do). Participant's pain intensity was assessed by parents and adult participants (18-20 years old) on a VAS scale of 0-100 mm (0 mm: no pain to 100: very severe pain). Change from baseline was calculated by using the formula = (post baseline value - baseline value). For both scales, lower scores indicate increased functional ability.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to last assessment (4 years) or date of discontinuation, which ever occurred earlier</time_frame>
    <description>The Child Health Questionnaire - Parent Form (CHQ-PF50) instrument was used to measure HRQoL aged 5 to 18 years from a parent's perspective. This 14 concept questionnaire measured physical and psychosocial health of the participants on following points: physical functioning, role/social emotional, role/social behavior, role/social physical, bodily pain, general behavior, mental health, self-esteem, general health perception, change in health, parental impact - emotional, parental impact - time, family activities, and family cohesion. Total score ranged from 1-100. Increase in score represented improvement in overall well being of participants. Change from baseline was calculated by using the formula = (post baseline value - baseline value).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in EuroQual 5 -Dimension Health Status Questionnaire (EQ-5D) Utility Index and Health State Assessment Scores [EQ Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS)] to Last Assessment of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to last assessment (4 years) or date of discontinuation, which ever occurred earlier</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D HRQoL tool was employed for participants above 12 years and EQ-5D proxy for 8 - 11 years. Utility based EQ-5D questionnaire was in two parts and provides generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal based on 2 parts: EQ-5D descriptive system and EQ-VAS. EQ-5D descriptive system contains 5 dimensions each with 3 levels (Level 1: no problem, Level 2: moderate problem, Level 3: severe problem): mobility (1=0, 2=0.069, 3=0.314), self care (1=0, 2=0.104, 3=0.214), usual activities (1=0, 2=0.036, 3=0.094), pain/discomfort (1=0, 2=0, 3=0.386) and anxiety/depression (1=0, 2=0.071, 3=0.2). EQ-5D Total score= 1 - 0.081 - (score of level 2 in present) - 0.269 (if at least one of level 3 presents). EQ-5D total score: 1 = high quality of life; -0.59 worst quality of life. EQ-VAS recorded participant's self-rated health on vertical, visual analog scale- '100': Best and '0': Worst imaginable health state. A positive change from baseline score indicated improved health status.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS) Score to Last Assessment of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to last assessment (4 years) or date of discontinuation, which ever occurred earlier</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep patterns in children and adolescents aged between 11 and 15 years were determined using PDSS instrument to evaluate whether canakinumab helps in reducing sleepiness in children with SJIA. Participants were assessed on 8 items of PDSS, on a scale of 0 to 4 (0 - never, 1 - seldom, 2- sometimes, 3 - frequently and 4 - always). The sum of all the items was reported as total score with a range of 0-32. Change from baseline was calculated by using the formula = (post baseline value - baseline value). A positive change from baseline score indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Non-­Responders Who Achieved Minimum Response of American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Pediatric 30/50/70/90/100</title>
        <description>Adapted ACR Paediatric 30/50/70/90 or 100 was assessed based on following 7 variables: 1.Physician’s Global Assessment on a 0-100 mm VAS; 2. Participants Global Assessment on a 0-100 mm VAS; 3. Functional ability; 4. Joints count with active arthritis; 5. Joints count with limitation of motion; 6. Laboratory measure of ­CRP and 7. Absence of intermittent fever due to SJIA during the preceding week. Response was defined as ≥ 30%/50%/70%/90% or 100% improvement in at least 3 of the response variables 1 to 6, no intermittent fever (i.e. body temperature ≤ 38°C) in the preceding week (variable 7) and with no more than one variable 1 to 6, worsening by more than 30%.</description>

        <description>Steroid tapering with oral steroids was allowed if the participant achieved an adapted ACR Paediatric 50 response and had no fever. A participant was considered to have tapered steroids successfully, if the steroid dose was reduced from baseline and the participant did not flare and maintained a minimum adapted ACR Paediatric 30 at the last measurement. A participant was considered to have unsuccessfully tapered steroids if the steroid dose was reduced during the study but dose at last assessment was equal to or greater than dose at baseline or; if steroid dose was reduced but the participant did not maintain a minimum adapted ACR Paediatric 30 at the last measurement.</description>

          <description>Steroid tapering with oral steroids was allowed if the participant achieved an adapted ACR Paediatric 50 response and had no fever. A participant was considered to have tapered steroids successfully, if the steroid dose was reduced from baseline and the participant did not flare and maintained a minimum adapted ACR Paediatric 30 at the last measurement. A participant was considered to have unsuccessfully tapered steroids if the steroid dose was reduced during the study but dose at last assessment was equal to or greater than dose at baseline or; if steroid dose was reduced but the participant did not maintain a minimum adapted ACR Paediatric 30 at the last measurement.</description>

        <description>The CHAQ was used to assess physical ability, overall well- being and pain intensity experienced by participants. The CHAQ (disability and well-being) dimension consisted of 20 multiple choice items concerning difficulty in performing eight common activities of daily living; dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, reaching, personal hygiene, gripping and other “activities”. Participants were graded for the response in four categories, ranging from 0 (without any difficulty), 1 (with some difficulty), 2 (with much difficulty) and 3 (unable to do). Participant’s pain intensity was assessed by parents and adult participants (18­20 years old) on a VAS scale of 0-100 mm (0 mm: no pain to 100: very severe pain). Change from baseline was calculated by using the formula = (post baseline value – baseline value). For both scales, lower scores indicate increased functional ability.</description>

        <description>The Child Health Questionnaire – Parent Form (CHQ­PF50) instrument was used to measure HRQoL aged 5 to 18 years from a parent’s perspective. This 14 concept questionnaire measured physical and psychosocial health of the participants on following points: physical functioning, role/social emotional, role/social behavior, role/social physical, bodily pain, general behavior, mental health, self-esteem, general health perception, change in health, parental impact ­ emotional, parental impact – time, family activities, and family cohesion. Total score ranged from 1-100. Increase in score represented improvement in overall well being of participants. Change from baseline was calculated by using the formula = (post baseline value – baseline value).</description>

        <description>EQ­5D HRQoL tool was employed for participants above 12 years and EQ­5D proxy for 8 – 11 years. Utility based EQ­5D questionnaire was in two parts and provides generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal based on 2 parts: EQ-5D descriptive system and EQ-VAS. EQ-5D descriptive system contains 5 dimensions each with 3 levels (Level 1: no problem, Level 2: moderate problem, Level 3: severe problem): mobility (1=0, 2=0.069, 3=0.314), self care (1=0, 2=0.104, 3=0.214), usual activities (1=0, 2=0.036, 3=0.094), pain/discomfort (1=0, 2=0, 3=0.386) and anxiety/depression (1=0, 2=0.071, 3=0.2). EQ-5D Total score= 1 - 0.081 - (score of level 2 in present) - 0.269 (if at least one of level 3 presents). EQ-5D total score: 1 = high quality of life; -0.59 worst quality of life. EQ-VAS recorded participant's self-rated health on vertical, visual analog scale- '100': Best and ‘0': Worst imaginable health state. A positive change from baseline score indicated improved health status.</description>

        <description>Sleep patterns in children and adolescents aged between 11 and 15 years were determined using PDSS instrument to evaluate whether canakinumab helps in reducing sleepiness in children with SJIA. Participants were assessed on 8 items of PDSS, on a scale of 0 to 4 (0 - never, 1 - seldom, 2- sometimes, 3 - frequently and 4 - always). The sum of all the items was reported as total score with a range of 0-32. Change from baseline was calculated by using the formula = (post baseline value - baseline value). A positive change from baseline score indicated improvement.</description>

Participants were assessed on 8 items of PDSS, on a scale of 0 to 4 (0 - never, 1 - seldom, 2- sometimes, 3 - frequently and 4 - always). The sum of all the items was reported as total score with a range of 0-32. Change from baseline was calculated by using the formula = (post baseline value - baseline value). A positive change from baseline score indicated improvement.</description>
          <population>The analysis was performed in FAS population. Here, ‘Number of participants analysed’ signifies those participants with a value at both baseline and the respective post baseline time point and with an assessment of PDSS score in the given visit..</population>
