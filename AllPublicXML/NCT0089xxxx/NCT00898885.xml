      Introduction: Graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) is the major cause of morbidity and mortality
      in patients submitted to the Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT). The oral manifestations can
      be very debilitating and interfere in the results of medical therapy, leading to systemic
      complications, committing the prognosis and quality of life of the patient.

      The early diagnosis can be done through biopsies of oral mucosa with or without apparent
      injury clinic. The association between the clinical and histopathological tables of GVHD,
      especially through the use of recent consensus established in these areas, can bring new
      benefits to physicians.

      Objective: This study aims to apply and compare the two classifications histological to GVHD,
      Horn (1995) and Consensus (2006) in specimens obtained from clinical oral lesions suggestive
      of GVHD; correlate them with clinical classification according Akpek (2001) and with the
      survival of the patients.

      Methods: For this study we analyzed histological samples of oral mucosa of 10 patients with
      clinical diagnosis of GVHD, which have areas of epithelium, and salivary gland. The
      histopathological aspects were observed by the author of this work and his advisor, so
      blinded by applying the criteria for Horn and the Consensus. We consistency between the two
      classifications obtained and histological correlation with the clinical classification of
      GVHD (Akpek, 2001) and the curve of survival.
