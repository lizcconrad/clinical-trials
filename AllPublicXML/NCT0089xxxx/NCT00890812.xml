  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of measuring coagulation factor
      activities in the setting of acute ischemic stroke, as potential markers of inherited
      thrombotic risk. The investigators will determine if relationships exist between coagulation
      factors, including factor VIII, factor IX, and factor XI and clinical diagnosis,
      classification, and outcome. The investigators will determine if any significant elevations
      of these factor activities are independent thrombotic risk factors.

      Null Hypothesis: There is no statistical difference between coagulation factors, including
      factors VIII, IX, or XI activity levels in patients having acute ischemic stroke as compared
      to acute stroke mimics.

    <textblock>
      Increased factor XI levels have been associated with venous thromboembolic disease and acute
      myocardial infarction. However, checking factor XI levels is not currently indicated to
      assess individual thromboembolic risk. Factor XI is an important protease that links the
      extrinsic arm of the coagulation cascade with the intrinsic arm through dual activation by
      both factor XII and thrombin. Since thrombin is a downstream product of factor XI, a feedback
      loop is created that amplifies thrombin production and ultimately results formation of a
      stable fibrin clot. Sufficient thrombin generation via this pathway also contributes to
      activation of the Thrombin-Activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor (TAFI). Activated TAFI
      downregulates fibrinolysis and has been implicated as part of the association between
      elevated factor XI levels and venous thromboembolic disease. One study found that functional
      TAFI levels of &gt; 120% increased the risk of ischemic stroke approximately 6-fold, however,
      the association between Factor XI and ischemic stroke has yet to be firmly established. We
      recently performed a preliminary retrospective analysis of 78 patients with stroke or
      transient ischemic attack (TIA) and found that patients with factor XI activity levels above
      the 95th percentile of an age and sex matched reference population had a relative risk of 5.3
      for stroke or TIA. Factor XI measurements may be able to help identify thromboembolic
      disease, aiding in the determination of stroke etiology.
