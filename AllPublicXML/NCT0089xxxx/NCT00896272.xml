  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to understand the impact of living with Klinefelter syndrome (KS) and the
      factors that contribute to adaptation in adolescents and adults. Individuals with KS may have
      variable symptoms, including hypogonadism, gynecomastia, learning disabilities, and delay and
      underdevelopment of secondary sexual characteristics. Perhaps the most challenging symptom of
      KS is infertility, which seems to be a universal symptom. It is not fully understood how
      males with KS conceptualize their condition, cope with their diagnosis, and adapt to living
      with this condition. In this study, Lazarus and Folkman s Transactional Model of Stress and
      Coping provides a framework for examining coping and adaptation in males with KS. A
      cross-sectional research design using a quantitative survey will be utilized to examine the
      relationships among appraisals (illness perceptions and perceived stigma), time elapsed since
      learning of diagnosis, coping, and adaptation. Adolescents and adults with KS will be
      recruited from national KS support networks via website postings, email listservs, and
      printed newsletter postings. Adolescents will also be recruited from a private practice.
      Participants will have the option to complete an online or paper version of the survey. The
      main outcome variable is adaptation to living with a KS diagnosis....
