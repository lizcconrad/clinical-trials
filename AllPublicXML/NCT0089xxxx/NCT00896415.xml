  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining strong muscles is important for the independence and quality of life in our older
      population. Strong muscles provide mobility and reduce the chance of falls that lead to
      injury. Many researchers are carrying out studies to examine different types of exercise and
      drug treatments to prevent loss of muscle strength in older people. Often, these research
      studies use x-ray computed tomography (CT) scans to measure the size and the amount of fat in
      different muscles. These factors are known to reflect muscle health. Large studies can
      involve many research subjects recruited at many different clinics with different CT
      scanners. To ensure that these studies provide reliable results, the investigators must have
      procedures to make sure that different CT scanners measure the same results for the same
      amount of fat or muscle. The goal of our study is to develop these procedures. In this
      project, the investigators will study women because they have the highest risk of bone
      fractures resulting from falls. Thus, the subjects are being asked to volunteer for a study
      where the subjects will be scanned on different scanners.
