    <textblock>
      To study the effect of combined diazoxide-metformin therapy on body weight in youth with
      hypothalamic obesity following treatment for craniopharyngioma. A secondary objective is to
      evaluate changes in insulin resistance (IR), beta-cell function, features of the metabolic
      syndrome, muscle metabolism and intramyocellular lipid.

      Hypothesis: Treatment with diazoxide and metformin will result in weight loss or slowed
      weight gain and improved metabolic profile, compared to pretreatment levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      46 children under the age of 22 years have been treated surgically for craniopharyngioma
      tumor and are currently followed at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto. Approximately
      50% are obese (BMI â‰¥ 95th percentile for age and gender assessed from the updated Centre for
      Disease Control growth charts), all of whom have panhypopituitarism requiring hormone
      replacement therapy. These children are assessed regularly in Endocrine Clinic and also are
      invited to attend a comprehensive care clinic for evaluation by an endocrinologist (Principal
      Investigator), neurosurgical clinical nurse practitioner, dietitian, exercise physiologist,
      psychologist and social worker to provide multi-disciplinary dietary and exercise
      consultation and psychological counseling for weight related concerns. This clinic will
      provide the infrastructure for recruitment and follow-up of study patients. Recruitment of
      eight subjects for this pilot study will occur over 6 months from patients attending the
      comprehensive clinic. This number was chosen as it is equivalent to the number chosen in the
      pilot study of octreotide by Lustig which showed beneficial changes in body mass index with
      treatment.

      This study evaluates a novel combination therapy in children with hypothalamic obesity at
      very high risk for complications. Evaluation of insulin resistance and metabolic changes on
      therapy will allow a better understanding of how insulin secretion relates to weight gain in
      this population. Successful therapy in a pilot setting will provide necessary data for a
      larger randomized trial in individuals with hypothalamic obesity including children with
      craniopharyngioma and others with damage to the hypothalamus secondary to other tumors,
      surgery or cranial irradiation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Craniopharyngioma at least one year following surgery

          -  Evidence of at least one other endocrinopathy of hypothalamic origin

          -  Stable hormone replacement therapy (with one or more of thyroxine hydrocortisone,
             DDAVP, sex steroids and GH)

          -  Obesity, defined as weight &gt;120% Ideal Body Weight (IBW) or BMI &gt; 27 kg/m2, with
             normal weight for height before tumour diagnosis and weight gain &gt;2SD above mean for
             age for 1 year following tumour treatment (41).

          -  Age 9 -22 years

          -  Minimum of 6 months of standard diet and exercise intervention (run-in period). This
             was chosen to allow a period of prospective measurements to establish individual
             baseline slope of change in BMI SDS prior to initiation of active treatment with
             diazoxide and metformin.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications for Metformin or Diazoxide use (history or evidence of cardiac,
             renal, or progressive hepatic disease , diabetes or hypoxic conditions)

          -  Pharmacologic doses of glucocorticoids or use of other medications known to affect
             glucose metabolism (e.g. beta-blockers, oral hypoglycemics)

          -  Growth hormone (GH) initiation in the preceding 6 months or planned initiation in the
             next 6 months (to rule out potential confounding effect of GH on weight / body
             composition and glucose metabolism).

          -  Use of other weight loss medications

          -  Inability of the family and/or patient to comply with study protocol

          -  Non English speaking
