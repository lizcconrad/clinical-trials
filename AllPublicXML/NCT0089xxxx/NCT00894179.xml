      Purpose: The investigators plan to test a newly FDA approved pharmacologic stress agent,
      Regadenoson, in conjunction with atropine in the use of stress echocardiography for the
      diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The selective nature of Regadenoson allows for its use
      in patients with contraindications to the currently used drug, Adenosine, which is
      non-selective. Furthermore, the proposed protocol can be completed faster and without
      radiation exposure than the current protocol with adenosine.

      Design: This is a prospective study evaluating people with no prior diagnosis of coronary
      disease with a prior stress test and are scheduled for cardiac catheterization. Patients who
      meet inclusion criteria will undergo regadenoson-atropine echocardiography protocol prior to
      their catheterization. The study will be interpreted by two independent readers blinded to
      the catheterization results. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive
      values of the regadenoson-atropine study will be then be calculated using the coronary
      angiogram as a gold standard.

        This will be a prospective study evaluating stable outpatients with no prior diagnosis of
        coronary disease who may or may not have had a prior functional stress imaging test and are
        going for a clinically indicated cardiac catheterization as deemed by their physician due
        to suspected coronary artery disease either based on symptoms or based on results for prior
        functional testing
