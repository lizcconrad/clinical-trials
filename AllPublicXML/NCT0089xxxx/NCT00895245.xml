      RATIONALE: Fosaprepitant dimeglumine, palonosetron hydrochloride, and dexamethasone may help
      lessen or prevent nausea and vomiting caused by cisplatin in patients with head and neck
      cancer undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well fosaprepitant dimeglumine together with
      palonosetron hydrochloride and dexamethasone works in preventing nausea and vomiting caused
      by cisplatin in patients with stage III or stage IV head and neck cancer undergoing
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the complete response rate of anti-emetic therapy based on a single dose of
      intravenous fosaprepitant with multiple cycles of high dose cisplatin (complete response is
      defined as no emesis or rescue nausea medications needed in the 120 hours following cisplatin
      infusion).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the complete response rate of anti-emetic therapy based on a single dose of
      intravenous fosaprepitant with multiple cycles of high dose cisplatin in the delayed period
      (25-120 hours following cisplatin infusion).

      II. To determine efficacy of anti-emetic therapy based on a single-dose of intravenous
      fosaprepitant to achieve adequate control of nausea following multiple cycles of high-dose
      cisplatin as defined by a score on the visual analog scale of &lt; 25mm in the 120 hours
      following cisplatin infusion.

      III. To determine the functional impact of cisplatin induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) on
      daily life as measured by the Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE) Questionnaire total
      score.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cisplatin IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3
      courses. Patients also undergo 3-D conformal radiotherapy or intensity-modulated radiotherapy
      once daily 5 days a week for up to 7 weeks.

      Patients receive fosaprepitant dimeglumine IV, palonosetron hydrochloride IV, and
      dexamethasone IV on day 1 (prior to cisplatin infusion). Patients then receive oral
      dexamethasone on days 2-4. Patients with no emesis or requirement for rescue anti-emetics in
      the first 120 hours after cisplatin infusion continue to receive the anti-emetic regimen as
      above with the second and third courses of cisplatin.

      Patients complete an emesis diary (that includes a nausea visual analog scale) daily for 5
      days after each cisplatin infusion. Patients also complete a Functional Living Index-Emesis
      Questionnaire on day 8 of each course of chemotherapy.

All patients discontinued trial after only one cisplatin infusion.</description>

    <description>FLIE is a patient-completed quality of life assessment modified from the original Functional Living Index - Cancer questionnaire. FLIE contains two domains: nausea and vomiting with nine items in each domain. The first item asks the patient to rate how much nausea (or vomiting) has occurred over a 5 day period. The remaining eight items ask patients to rate the impact of nausea (or vomiting) on various aspects of a patient's life (for example, ability to enjoy meals/liquids). Each item is answered using a 7 point visual analog scale with 7 being &quot;none /not at all&quot; and 1 being &quot;a great deal&quot;. The two domains are summed for a total score with a possible range of 18-126. Higher scores indicate a more favorable quality of life. A total score of &gt;108 defines those patients who had a minimal impact of CINV on quality of life. All particpants discontinued the trial after one cycle of cisplatin.</description>

        <title>Impact of Cisplatin-induced Nausea and Vomiting on Daily Life During the 5 Day Period Following Cisplatin Infusion for Multiple Cycles as Measured by the Functional Living Index-Emesis Questionnaire</title>
        <description>FLIE is a patient-completed quality of life assessment modified from the original Functional Living Index – Cancer questionnaire. FLIE contains two domains: nausea and vomiting with nine items in each domain. The first item asks the patient to rate how much nausea (or vomiting) has occurred over a 5 day period. The remaining eight items ask patients to rate the impact of nausea (or vomiting) on various aspects of a patient’s life (for example, ability to enjoy meals/liquids). Each item is answered using a 7 point visual analog scale with 7 being &quot;none /not at all&quot; and 1 being &quot;a great deal&quot;. The two domains are summed for a total score with a possible range of 18-126. Higher scores indicate a more favorable quality of life. A total score of &gt;108 defines those patients who had a minimal impact of CINV on quality of life. All particpants discontinued the trial after one cycle of cisplatin.</description>
