    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect data on patients who are on breathing machines
      (ventilators) in the Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit (TSICU). This data may help us to
      determine if one form of assisted breathing is better than another. The two forms of assisted
      breathing being compared in this study are called BiVent and SIMV. (7) BiVent and SIMV are
      both delivered by a ventilator but differ in how they assist breathing. SIMV is an older form
      of mechanical breathing that blows air into the lungs to inflate the lungs. BiVent is a newer
      form of mechanical ventilation that permits the patient to pull air into the lungs as we
      normally do. Both BiVent and SIMV are currently being used on a regular basis in the TSICU.
      The investigators hope that this study will determine if one method of assisted breathing is
      better than another in preventing complications associated with mechanically assisted
      breathing.

      SOLV Hypothesis:

      A prospective, randomized trial directly comparing open lung ventilation (OLV) with
      spontaneous breathing (SB) utilizing BiVent on the Maquet Servo-I versus synchronized
      intermittent mechanical ventilation (SIMV) will be conducted in the trauma-surgical intensive
      care unit at the University Hospital (TSICU). Both OLV-SB and SIMV protocols have been
      designed according to lung protective strategies. The primary goal of the SOLV trial is to
      see determine if the early application of open lung ventilation will less ventilator days. In
      addition, several secondary endpoints will be evaluated. It is not anticipated that this
      study will be powered to show a mortality difference.
