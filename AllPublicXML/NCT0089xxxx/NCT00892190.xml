  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, prospective, single institution dose-escalation study. The patient
      population includes non-induction candidate elderly patients with AML or MDS and/or patients
      with high-risk or relapsed/refractory AML or MDS. Five dose cohorts will be evaluated using a
      fixed dose of ATRA in combination with an escalating dose of dasatinib. The investigators
      will treat with an escalating dose of dasatinib from 70mg to 140mg daily. Dose escalation
      will proceed in a standard 3+3 fashion. A de-escalation to a 50 mg total daily dose of
      dasatinib is planned if DLT is greater than or equal to 33% is observed at the first dose
      level. Once the MTD for the combination of the drugs has been established, up to 6 additional
      patients will be enrolled at the MTD level to obtain additional safety information about the
      combination and to allow for preliminary laboratory correlate analysis.

      Primary Objective:

      1. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of dasatinib and ATRA in
      relapsed or elderly, non-induction candidate acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or MDS patients
      and to identify the maximally tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLT).

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of dasatinib and ATRA when administered
           as combination therapy for patients with AML or MDS

        2. To determine if the combination therapy of dasatinib and ATRA promotes differentiation
           of AML or MDS .
