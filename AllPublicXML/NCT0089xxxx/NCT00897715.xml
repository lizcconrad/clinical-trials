  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been an exponential growth in the number of people with Chronic Kidney Disease
      (CKD) needing dialysis or transplantation, increasing from 209,000 in 1991 to 472,000 in
      2004. This is highly concerning due to both the human cost and the burden that it represents
      to the health care system. Recent comparison of the NHANES surveys showed that CKD prevalence
      increased from 10% in 1988-1994 to 13% in 1999-2004. Patients with CKD are more likely to die
      from premature cardiovascular death than to reach ESRD. In those that reach ESRD,
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for over half of the deaths in dialysis. The prevalence
      of CKD for the VA population is 20%, and 31.6% for diabetics, higher than in the general
      population. These observations emphasize the need of risk stratification, early detection,
      and prevention efforts with respect to CKD progression and the CVD burden that afflicts CKD
      through targeted interventions in high-risk groups (personalized medicine).

      CKD is multifactorial, however familial aggregation of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and CKD
      have been reported for all types of nephropathy underscoring &quot;kidney disease genetic
      susceptibility &quot;. Genetic predisposition to ESRD is stronger in African Africans. African
      Americans with a first-degree relative with ESRD have a 9-fold increase risk of ESRD vs. a
      3-5 fold increase in whites.

      Studies consistently show that CKD is an inflammatory process and that biomarkers of
      inflammation increase since early stages of CKD. CVD is also an inflammatory process, and
      genes that affect inflammation are associated with higher risk of CVD. Since inflammation is
      a common denominator of both disease processes (CKD and CVD), it is likely that genes that
      govern inflammation may be involved in both, the predisposition to CKD and the burden of CVD
      attributable to CKD. Additionally if inflammation plays a central role in the burden of CVD
      in CKD than drugs that modulate inflammation should impact both: CKD progression and
      non-traditional CV risk factors and CVD.

      The overall goal of this proposal is to study genetic predisposition to CKD, and CVD risk in
      CKD through inflammatory pathways, and the effect that a potent anti-inflammatory
      intervention like interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), will have in inflame patients
      with CKD stages 3&amp;4. Specific Aims: 1) To determine if specific polymorphism/haplotypes,
      genotype combinations and gene-environmental interactions that can affect inflammation,
      available from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (DNA data set),
      specifically in the CRP,IL-1, IL-10 and TNF- genes, are associated with CKD. 2) To determine
      if the specific polymorphisms and haplotypes studied in Aim 1 are associated with faster CKD
      progression and CV outcomes in a longitudinal cohort from the African American Study of
      Kidney Disease. 3)To determine if a targeted anti-inflammatory intervention, an IL-1 receptor
      antagonist, will modulate systemic inflammation, endothelial function, oxidative stress and
      urinary cytokines, the proposed surrogate markers of CVD and CKD progression in inflame
      patients with CKD stages 3&amp;4.

Note that essentially the same study was also conducted at the University of Colorado (NCT01663103). Results were combined with Colorado for publication. However, the results reported here are only based on the subjects enrolled at the VA Nashville.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>There is about a 2-week screening period between enrollment and assignment to a treatment group to access inclusion/exclusion criteria. Although 45 subjects were enrolled, only 15 subjects were assigned to a treatment group (30 subjects were screen failures).</pre_assignment_details>

            <groups_desc>For the primary specific aim, we will compare the mean percent change on hsCRP between the intervention arm and the placebo arm using linear regression. We anticipate that the intervention will conservatively decrease hsCRP by 54%; whereas, placebo will have no effect. Accordingly, we have estimated that we will need 24 subjects in the experimental arm and 24 controls to have an 80% power, with an alpha of 0.05 to detect the above mentioned effect size.</groups_desc>
