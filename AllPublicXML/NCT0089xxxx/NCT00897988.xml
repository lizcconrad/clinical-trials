      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue in the laboratory from patients with cancer may
      help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at the DNA in tumor tissue samples from patients
      with human papilloma virus-associated cancer of the oropharynx.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Analyze PIK3CA expression and mutation and p110α amplification and expression in tumor
           tissue samples from patients with human papilloma virus positive (HPV+) and human
           papilloma virus negative (HPV-) squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oropharynx.

        -  Determine proliferation and survival after PI3K inhibition in HPV(+) and HPV(-)
           oropharyngeal SCC cell lines and in HPV E6 and E7 expressing cells.

        -  Determine proliferation and survival after PI3K inhibition in short-term cultures of
           tumor tissue samples from patients with HPV(+) and HPV(-) primary SCC of the oropharynx.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected tumor tissue samples are analyzed for HPV DNA by PCR
      amplification and direct sequencing of PCR products; expression of E6 protein and relative
      expression of PIK3CA by qRT-PCR; amplification of PIK3CA by Southern blotting; mutation of
      PIK3CA; expression of p110α, phospho-AKT, total AKT, and FOXO1 by polyacrylamide gel
      electrophoresis (PAGE) and immunoblotting; and the effect of PI3K inhibition on cell cycle
      and apoptosis by flow cytometry. Pharmacological studies are performed on oropharyngeal
      squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and short-term cultures and HPV E6 and E7 expressing cells
      using LY 294002 in vitro to analyze response to PI3K inhibition. Results of response to PI3K
      inhibition will be correlated with HPV status, PIK3CA expression, amplification, and
      mutation, and p110α expression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 HPV(+) and 20 HPV(-) tumor tissue specimens from patients
      will be accrued for this study.
