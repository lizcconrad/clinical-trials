  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomised controlled trial to assess the sustained
      effects on weight, selected risk factors and sense of well-being of offering individualized
      weight management advice in the primary care setting to patients who wish to lose weight; and
      to identify the key factors influencing the success of the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary care could make a substantial impact on the increasing prevalence of overweight and
      obesity and their associated adverse impact on health. The lack of a proven intervention may
      deter health professionals in primary care from providing support to their overweight
      patients as few obese people recall receiving weight control advice from a health
      professional.

      In this study we aim to conduct a large scale randomised controlled trial to assess the
      effectiveness of a longer-term structured lifestyle support programme provided by a research
      nurse and the provision of pedometers compared to usual care in overweight/ obese adults who
      wish to lose weight. We will assess the degree of weight loss over a period of 12 months as
      well as related factors such as changes in waist circumference, quality of life and
      cost-effectiveness of the interventions.

      The research is highly relevant to policy making at both national and local levels.
