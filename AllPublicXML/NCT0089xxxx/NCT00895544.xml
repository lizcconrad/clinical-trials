          -  have an understanding of the study and its procedures, agree to its provisions, and
             give written informed consent prior to study entry

          -  are generally healthy, as determined by the investigator's clinical judgment through
             collection of medical history and performance of a physical examination

          -  are physically and mentally capable of participating in the study and follow its
             procedures

          -  agree to keep a daily record of symptoms for the duration of the study

          -  if female of childbearing potential: have a negative urine pregnancy test result
             within 24 hours prior to the scheduled first vaccination and agree to employ adequate
             birth control measures for the duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from participation in this study if they:

          -  have a history of exposure to H5N1 virus or a history of vaccination with an H5N1
             influenza vaccine

          -  are at high risk of contracting H5N1 influenza infection (e.g. poultry workers)

          -  currently have or have a history of a significant neurological, cardiovascular,

          -  have a disease or are currently undergoing a form of treatment or were undergoing a
             form of treatment within 30 days prior to study entry that can be expected to
             influence immune response. Such treatment includes, but is not limited to, systemic or
             high dose inhaled (&gt; 800µg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent)
             corticosteroids, radiation treatment or other immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs

             entry

          -  have donated blood or plasma within 30 days prior to study entry

          -  have received any live vaccine within 4 weeks or inactivated vaccine within 2 weeks
             prior to vaccination in this study

          -  have a functional or surgical asplenia

          -  have a known or suspected problem with alcohol or drug abuse

          -  were administered an investigational drug within 6 weeks prior to study entry or are
             concurrently participating in a clinical study that includes the administration of an
             investigational product

          -  are a member of the team conducting this study or are in a dependent relationship with
             one of the study team members. Dependent relationships include close relatives (i.e.,
             children, partner/spouse, siblings, parents) as well as employees of the investigator
             or site personnel conducting the study
