            <non_inferiority_desc>Point estimates and 90% confidence intervals were calculated for the Arm B to Arm A and Arm D to Arm C ratios of geometric means for Cmax, AUC(INF) and AUC(0-T) of saxagliptin and metformin, respectively. Potency-corrected results were also provided. Bioequivalence will be concluded if the 90% confidence intervals for the test-to-reference ratios of geometric means are entirely contained within 80% to 125% for both Cmax and AUC(INF).

        <description>An AE is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an important medical event.</description>
        <time_frame>AEs collected from Day 1/Period 1 through study discharge (study duration: approximately 45 days). SAEs collected from date of written consent until 30 days post discontinuation of dosing or subject’s participation in the study.</time_frame>
