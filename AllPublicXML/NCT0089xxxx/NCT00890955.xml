  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amrubicin has shown single-agent activity in lung cancer. The combination of cyclophosphamide
      and anthracyclines has been studied and concluded that the combination was tolerable, could
      be given safely, and therapeutically useful.

      This Phase I study will evaluate the combination of cyclophosphamide with amrubicin in
      relapsed solid tumors and will define the MTD of the combination in a US population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      This study will follow the 3+3 design with the following dose levels:

        -  Dose Level -1: Amrubicin 20mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2

        -  Dose Level 1: Amrubicin 25mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2

        -  Dose Level 2: Amrubicin 30mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2

        -  Dose Level 3: Amrubicin 35mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2

        -  Dose Level 4: Amrubicin 40mg/m2, Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2

      Dose escalation starts from dose level 1.

      Amrubicin will be given as a slow IV push or infusion over approximately 5 minutes once daily
      for 3 consecutive days starting on day 1 of each 21 day cycle.

      Cyclophosphamide will be given at a fixed dose as an IV infusion over 30-60 minutes on day 1
      of each 21 day cycle (following amrubicin).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid organ malignancy that is

          -  Must have measurable or evaluable disease per RECIST as evaluated by imaging within 30
             days prior to registration for protocol therapy.

          -  Must have completed chemotherapy at least 28 days prior to registration for protocol
             therapy and recovered from the acute toxic effects.

          -  Prior radiation therapy is allowed to &lt; 25% of the bone marrow. Patients must have
             recovered from the acute toxic effects of radiation prior to registration for protocol
             therapy.

          -  Must be willing to consent to the blood sample collection for SNP analysis.

          -  Females of childbearing potential and males must be willing to use an effective method
             of contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) from the
             time of consent until at least 30 days following completion of protocol therapy.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days
             prior to registration for protocol therapy. Patients are considered not of child
             bearing potential if they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a hysterectomy,
             bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are postmenopausal.

          -  Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health
             information.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No prior therapy with cyclophosphamide or anthracyclines.

          -  No treatment with any investigational agent within 28 days prior to registration for
             protocol therapy.

          -  No suspected, diffuse idiopathic interstitial lung disease or history of pulmonary
             fibrosis.

          -  No evidence of severe or uncontrolled other systemic disease or any concurrent
             condition which in the investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the patient to
             participate in the trial or which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol.

          -  No symptomatic brain metastases. Patients with treated brain metastasis must be off
             steroids and must have completed radiation at least 21 days prior to registration for
             protocol therapy.
