      The purpose of this trial is to study the pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin during continuous
      venovenous hemofiltration.

      Background: Anidulafungin is a cyclic lipopeptide antifungal agent of the echinocandin class.
      Members of this class of antifungal agents are known to inhibit the synthesis of glucan
      polymers in fungal cell walls. The spectrum of activity of anidulafungin includes Candida
      (all species, including strains resistant to fluconazole), Aspergillus, and Pneumocystis.

      In intensive care patients continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHF) is a
      well-established extracorporal renal replacement therapy with a high clearance rate.

      Pharmacokinetic studies of antifungal agents in critically ill patients treated with CVVHF
      are rare. No data about anidulafungin in CVVHF are available although intensive care patients
      are perfect candidates for anidulafungin treatment due to their high risk profile for
      systemic fungal infections.

      Study objective: The study is conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin
      during CVVHF in critically ill patients.

      Study design: open, 1 arm

      Study population: 10 critically ill adult patients administered to the ICU with acute renal
      failure and suspected or proven fungal infection.

      Treatment/Dosage/Route: On the first day 200 mg of anidulafungin will be administered
      intravenously over 3 hours (loading dose). The following days 100 mg of anidulafungin will be
      administered intravenously over 1.5 hours.

      Main outcome variables: The following pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined: area
      under the curve (AUC), half-live (t1/2), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and elimination
      fraction.

      Methods: High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) will be used to determine anidulafungin
      concentrations.
