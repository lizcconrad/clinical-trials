  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of tissue adhesives for the closure of surgical incisions is becoming increasingly
      common. Several publications exist purporting the equivalence of tissue adhesive to suture
      with regard to dehiscence, infection, and cosmesis. Two of the most frequently used adhesives
      are Histoacryl© and Dermabond©. Despite their popularity, only one study exists comparing the
      two. In this non-English study only small wounds in an exclusively pediatric population were
      studied (12). Operative time, cost, and objective measures of scar size were not examined. In
      the present study we aim to evaluate the relatively large surgical incisions resulting from
      breast reduction, mastopexy, panniculectomy, and abdominoplasty closed with either
      Histoacryl©, Dermabond©, or subcuticular suture. The primary aim is to investigate
      differences in time to wound closure. Secondary aims are to compare the three approaches with
      respect to cost, dehiscence, infection, scar size, and cosmesis.

        1) and 2): Reduction Mammoplasty or mastopexy patients: Patients who present to the plastic
        surgery clinic and are scheduled for breast procedures will be recruited and consented by a
        clinical studies co-ordinator. This will include patients undergoing a standard Wise
        pattern reduction mammoplasty (reduction and lift) or a standard Wise pattern mastopexy
        (lift only). See exclusion criteria below.

        1) and 2): Abdominoplasty or panniculectomy patients: Patients who present to the plastic
        surgery clinic and are scheduled for abdominal procedures will be recruited and consented
        by a clinical studies coordinator. See exclusion criteria below.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: Younger than 21

          -  Gender: Females only. Given the nature of the procedures, as well as our clinical
             experience, we cannot anticipate recruiting enough male patients to be able to
             evaluate them as a subgroup. Since there may be differences in distributions of
             measures, to keep the groups more homogeneous we plan to recruit only females from the
             outset. Having either:

          -  Reduction Mammoplasty or mastopexy patients:

               -  Patients who present to the plastic surgery clinic and are scheduled for breast
                  procedures will be recruited and consented by a clinical studies co-ordinator.

               -  This will include patients undergoing a standard Wise pattern reduction
                  mammoplasty (reduction and lift) or a standard Wise pattern mastopexy (lift
                  only). See exclusion criteria below.

          -  Abdominoplasty or panniculectomy patients:

               -  Patients who present to the plastic surgery clinic and are scheduled for
                  abdominal procedures will be recruited and consented by a clinical studies
                  coordinator. See exclusion criteria below.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Though women of childbearing age will be allowed to participate in this study, no
             pregnant patients will be enrolled.

          -  Patients with any factors that may have an adverse effect on wound healing:

               -  previous hypertrophic scars or keloid

               -  known vitamin C deficiency

               -  known zinc deficiency

               -  smoking

               -  steroid use

               -  known connective tissue disorder

               -  hypoalbuminemia

               -  any factor not listed that the attending consultant seeing the patient feels
                  would adversely effect wound healing.

          -  Patients who have a known sensitivity to adhesives
