      The purpose of this study is to characterize the removability of the Attain StarFix® Model
      4195 Left Ventricular (LV) Lead (StarFix®). The goal of the trial is to evaluate the lead
      removal success in patients that are indicated for left ventricular lead removal. This study
      is required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a condition of approval for the
      Attain StarFix® Model 4195 LV Lead.

        Patients will be chosen by investigators participating in the study at up to 25 experienced
        extraction centers throughout the United States and Canada. Patients of both genders that
        are indicated for a Model 4195 or a non-Model 4195 Medtronic lead extraction who meet all
        inclusion criteria may be in the study.
