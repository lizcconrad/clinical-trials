      This study will examine a contingency management (CM) intervention designed to provide
      incentives for losing weight versus participating in a manual-guided behavioral weight loss
      intervention alone. Participants in the CM condition will earn the opportunity to win prizes
      by losing weight and completing activities that contribute to weight loss, such as keeping
      daily food and physical activity diaries, choosing healthy foods, exercising, and using other
      weight loss strategies. The investigators will determine if the CM improves weight loss
      relative to the usual care manual-guided intervention alone.
