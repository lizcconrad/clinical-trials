  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burns represent one of the most severe and dreaded traumas. Burned and traumatized tissue is
      known as eschar. The dead eschar, if not removed, often becomes heavily contaminated and is
      the source of local and/or systemic infection or sepsis. The local inflammation and infection
      destroy healthy surrounding tissues and extends the original damage. In order to prevent
      these complications, and in order to minimize the risk of infection, it is imperative to
      evaluate the burn and remove all of the offending eschar at the earliest possible
      opportunity. This removal of dead tissue is termed &quot;debridement&quot;.

      The most direct debridement method for eschar removal is surgery. Traditional, conservative
      non-surgical debridement is a lengthy process which often involves many complications.

      The objectives of this study are as follows:

        1. To evaluate the safety and efficacy (exploratory) of DGD in hospitalized patients with
           Partial Thickness (mid and deep dermal) thermal burns of 4-30% total body surface area
           (TBSA), but with total burn wounds of no more than 30% TBSA. Measures have already been
           taken in previous studies involving deeper wounds to control safety parameters (such as
           pain, fever and infection). Nevertheless, as part of the effort to expand the burn
           population in the future phase 3 study to the more superficial wound group, it is
           important to first explore these parameters in a small group involving this burn
           population.

        2. To explore DGD absorption as measured by Pharmacokinetic testing.

    <description>DGD is a mixture of lyophilized enzymes derived from purified Bromelain from pineapple stem.
Two grams or 5 grams of Debrase powder are dissolved in 20 grams or 50 grams of Gel Vehicle to obtain DGD. DGD is applied to the burn wound at a dose of 2g Debrase/20g Gel per 100 cm2 of skin or 5g Debrase/50g Gel per 250 cm2 for a duration of four hours. In an average human adult, 100 cm2 represents approximately 1% of Total Body Surface Area (TBSA).
Please note that for individuals of exceptional size (e.g. children), it is important to calculate the dosage based on the 100 cm2 measurement.
The Debrase powder and the Gel Vehicle are to be mixed at the patient bedside for a maximum of 15 min prior to use.
DGD should not be applied to more than 15% TBSA in one session. If the wound area to be treated is more than 15% TBSA, DGD should be applied in two or more separate sessions.
DGD should not be applied more than twice to the same burn wound area.</description>
