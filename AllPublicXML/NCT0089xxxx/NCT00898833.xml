      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and urine from patients with cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help
      doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is measuring plasma and urine biomarkers in patients with
      advanced prostate cancer that did not respond to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Correlate plasma and urine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels with
           survival duration in patients with advanced hormone-refractory adenocarcinoma of the
           prostate previously enrolled on CALGB-9480.

        -  Determine whether plasma chromogranin A (CgA) and plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels
           predict survival duration in these patients.

        -  Determine whether plasma human Kallikrein 2 (hK2) levels are prognostic for overall
           survival of these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the prognostic significance of plasma and urine VEGF levels, plasma CgA
           levels, plasma IL-6 levels, and plasma hK2 levels in relation to overall survival of
           these patients.

        -  Correlate plasma VEGF levels with urine VEGF levels in these patients.

        -  Correlate plasma CgA levels with previously measured serum prostate-specific antigen
           (PSA) and plasma VEGF levels in these patients.

        -  Correlate plasma hK2 levels with PSA changes after treatment with suramin to determine
           if hK2 may have predictive value, independent or additive to measures of disease
           response in these patients.

        -  Correlate plasma hK2 levels with PSA levels in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Plasma from patients is collected for measurement of the following biomarkers:
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), chromogranin A, interleukin-6, and human
      Kallikrein 2. Urine is collected for VEGF measurement.
