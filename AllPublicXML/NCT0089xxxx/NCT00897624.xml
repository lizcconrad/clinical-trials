      RATIONALE: Studying samples of bone marrow and blood from patients with cancer may help
      doctors find out the extent of disease.

      PURPOSE: This research study is collecting bone marrow and blood samples from patients with
      metastatic choroid melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Develop and validate a method of detecting tumor cells in the bone marrow and blood in
           patients with metastatic choroid melanoma.

      OUTLINE: While patients are under general anesthesia for standard treatment of their disease,
      samples of bone marrow from the iliac crest and blood are collected. Samples are analyzed for
      the expression of tyrosinase and Melan-a via RT-PCR.
