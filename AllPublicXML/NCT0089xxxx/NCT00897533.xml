      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.
      It may also help doctors predict how patients respond to treatment with erlotinib.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is developing a model to predict progression-free survival
      after erlotinib in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess mesenchymal and epithelial markers in tissues from patients with non-small cell
           lung cancer treated with erlotinib hydrochloride on clinical trial ECOG-E3503.

        -  Determine the loss of epithelial markers (E-cadherin) and gain of mesenchymal markers
           (vimentin/cytokeratin co-expression) in these patients.

        -  Assess whether mesenchymal and epithelial markers are predictive of progression-free
           survival (PFS) of these patients.

        -  Identify a single nucleotide polymorphism profile via whole genome mapping and other
           known biomarkers to predict PFS of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Tissue samples are analyzed by whole genome mapping for single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP) rate and by signal detection rate and by quantitative immunohistochemistry
      for mesenchymal (vimentin/cytokeratin) and epithelial (E-cadherin) marker transitions. After
      biomarker identification and gene mapping are complete, a model to predict progression-free
      survival in these patients is developed.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 137 samples will be accrued for this study.
