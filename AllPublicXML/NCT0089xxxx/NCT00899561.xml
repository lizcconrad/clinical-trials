  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a previous study (Berger el al. Old and new aspects of middle turbinate histopathology.
      Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2009;140:48-54), the investigators reported significant
      histopathologic changes in the middle turbinate mucosa of patients with chronic
      rhinosinusitis compared with normal controls. However, patients' mean Lund-MacKay CT score
      was 6.5Â±6.7 and were considered as having a relatively limited sinus disease (a score of
      1-8). Nine to sixteen was considered as intermediate sinus disease, and 17-24 extensive. No
      osteomyelitic changes were seen in this study group.

      The investigators hypothesize that a comparison between the three groups of patients with
      chronic rhinosinusitis having limited, intermediate, and extensive sinus disease would show
      that the higher the CT staging, the greater the histopathologic changes of the middle
      turbinate. The investigators also expect to find osteomyelitic changes in the middle
      turbinate of patients with higher CT staging.
