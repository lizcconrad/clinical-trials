      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood, urine, sputum, mouth cells, and bronchial tissue from
      healthy participants in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur
      in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors learn more about
      the development of cancer.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking for molecular markers in predicting lung cancer
      development using tissue samples from healthy participants.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To obtain biological specimens from healthy participants with no known risk of lung
           cancer to use as controls in the study of lung cancer progression.

        -  To identify new molecular abnormalities specific to the development of squamous cell
           carcinoma of the lung.

      OUTLINE: Serum, urine, sputum, and buccal cell samples are collected. Patients also undergo
      bronchoscopy for collection of bronchial tissue and bronchial brush samples. The samples are
      used for genomic and proteomic studies to identify new molecular abnormalities specific to
      the development of lung cancer.
