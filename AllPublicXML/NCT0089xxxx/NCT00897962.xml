      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at blood glycan biomarkers in women with stage IV
      breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To profile serum glycan biomarkers in women with metastatic stage IV breast cancer,
           healthy controls, and patients with noncancer medical illness.

        -  To determine whether serial serum glycan biomarkers correlate with response of
           metastatic disease to treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Blood is collected from patients with metastatic breast cancer, patients with noncancerous
      illness, and healthy volunteers. Samples are analyzed for serum glycan biomarkers by
      matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and Fourier transform ion-cyclotron
      resonance mass spectrometry (FT ICR MS) methods.

      Blood samples are collected every 3 months for up to 18 months from patients with metastatic
      breast cancer. Patients without cancer have a single sample collected.
