      The purpose of this study was to determine the safety of AZX100 Drug Product and to determine
      whether it was effective in preventing or reducing re-growth of surgically removed keloid

    <measure>Differences Among the 3 Dosage Groups in the Patient (PSAS) and Observer (OSAS) Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy was based on the difference between mean POSAS scores of placebo, 0.3 mg AZX100, and 1 mg AZX100 12 months after surgery. This gave four comparisons to placebo: patient or observer and 0.3 mg and 1 mg AZX100. PSAS included patients' ratings on a scale of 1-10 (1 was normal skin or no complaints and 10 was the worst imaginable scar or the worst difference) for the following: Is the scar painful? Is the scar itching? Is the color of the scar different? Is the scar more stiff? Is the thickness of the scar different? Is the scar irregular? The possible minimum score was 6 and the maximum (worst) score was 60. OSAS included observers' ratings on a scale of 1-10 (1 was normal skin and 10 was the worst scar imaginable) for vascularization, pigmentation, thickness, relief, and pliability. The possible minimum score was 5 and the possible maximum (worst) score was 50.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Between-group Mean Differences in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Scores by Independent Blinded Raters</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>At 12 months, two independent dermatologists who were blinded to study treatment evaluated the scar images using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of 0-100 mm, with 0 being normal skin and 100 being the worst scar imaginable. The scars were presented in a scrambled order. Efficacy was based on the difference between VAS scores of placebo and 0.3 mg AZX100, and placebo and 1 mg AZX100, for each of the two raters separately. Data from the two raters was not combined.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Between-group Mean Differences in Objective Measures Obtained Via 3D Photography (Elevation, Length, Width)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary outcome included measurements based on 3D photography of the scar surface at Month 12 and included maximum length, maximum width perpendicular to the maximum length, and minimum, maximum and mean elevation. All elevation measurements were made relative to the interpolated smooth skin surface. A value closest to zero was preferred, because zero was equal to the normal skin surface. The minimum elevation value was calculated as the lowest point of the scar below the interpolated smoooth skin surface and was always a negative number. A more negative number was worse, because it indicated a deeper measurement below the interpolated smooth skin surface. The maximum elevation value was calculated as the highest point of the scar above the interpolated smooth skin surface. A larger number was worse because it indicated a higher peak above the interpolated smooth skin surface. The mean elevation of the scar relative to the interpolated smooth skin surface was also calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Between-group Mean Differences in Objective Measures Obtained Via 3D Photography (Volume)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary outcome included measurements based on 3D photography of the scar surface at Month 12 and included positive volume, negative volume and total volume. All volume measurements were made relative to the interpolated smooth skin surface. A value closer to zero was preferred, because zero was equal to the normal skin surface. Positive volume was calculated as the volume of the scar above the interpolated smooth skin surface. Negative volume was calculated as the volume of the scar below the interpolated smooth skin surface, and was always a negative number. Total volume was calculated as the sum of the positive volume and the absolute value of the negative volume.</description>

        <title>Differences Among the 3 Dosage Groups in the Patient (PSAS) and Observer (OSAS) Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) Scores</title>
        <description>Efficacy was based on the difference between mean POSAS scores of placebo, 0.3 mg AZX100, and 1 mg AZX100 12 months after surgery. This gave four comparisons to placebo: patient or observer and 0.3 mg and 1 mg AZX100. PSAS included patients' ratings on a scale of 1-10 (1 was normal skin or no complaints and 10 was the worst imaginable scar or the worst difference) for the following: Is the scar painful? Is the scar itching? Is the color of the scar different? Is the scar more stiff? Is the thickness of the scar different? Is the scar irregular? The possible minimum score was 6 and the maximum (worst) score was 60. OSAS included observers' ratings on a scale of 1-10 (1 was normal skin and 10 was the worst scar imaginable) for vascularization, pigmentation, thickness, relief, and pliability. The possible minimum score was 5 and the possible maximum (worst) score was 50.</description>

        <title>Between-group Mean Differences in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Scores by Independent Blinded Raters</title>
        <description>At 12 months, two independent dermatologists who were blinded to study treatment evaluated the scar images using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of 0-100 mm, with 0 being normal skin and 100 being the worst scar imaginable. The scars were presented in a scrambled order. Efficacy was based on the difference between VAS scores of placebo and 0.3 mg AZX100, and placebo and 1 mg AZX100, for each of the two raters separately. Data from the two raters was not combined.</description>

        <title>Between-group Mean Differences in Objective Measures Obtained Via 3D Photography (Elevation, Length, Width)</title>
        <description>This secondary outcome included measurements based on 3D photography of the scar surface at Month 12 and included maximum length, maximum width perpendicular to the maximum length, and minimum, maximum and mean elevation. All elevation measurements were made relative to the interpolated smooth skin surface. A value closest to zero was preferred, because zero was equal to the normal skin surface. The minimum elevation value was calculated as the lowest point of the scar below the interpolated smoooth skin surface and was always a negative number. A more negative number was worse, because it indicated a deeper measurement below the interpolated smooth skin surface. The maximum elevation value was calculated as the highest point of the scar above the interpolated smooth skin surface. A larger number was worse because it indicated a higher peak above the interpolated smooth skin surface. The mean elevation of the scar relative to the interpolated smooth skin surface was also calculated.</description>

All volume measurements were made relative to the interpolated smooth skin surface. A value closer to zero was preferred, because zero was equal to the normal skin surface. Positive volume was calculated as the volume of the scar above the interpolated smooth skin surface. Negative volume was calculated as the volume of the scar below the interpolated smooth skin surface, and was always a negative number.

          <title>Between-group Mean Differences in Objective Measures Obtained Via 3D Photography (Volume)</title>
          <description>This secondary outcome included measurements based on 3D photography of the scar surface at Month 12 and included positive volume, negative volume and total volume. All volume measurements were made relative to the interpolated smooth skin surface. A value closer to zero was preferred, because zero was equal to the normal skin surface. Positive volume was calculated as the volume of the scar above the interpolated smooth skin surface. Negative volume was calculated as the volume of the scar below the interpolated smooth skin surface, and was always a negative number. Total volume was calculated as the sum of the positive volume and the absolute value of the negative volume.</description>
          <population>In this early phase study, the efficacy and safety analyses were performed using an evaluable subject sample, which included all subjects who received study agent and provided some efficacy or safety data.</population>
