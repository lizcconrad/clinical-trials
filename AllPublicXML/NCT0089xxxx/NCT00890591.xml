    <textblock>
      In patients naive to treatment or after a 2-week washout period for patients whose treatment
      was ineffective, the use of olmesartan was assessed in a 4-phase treatment scheme:
      monotherapy, addition of hydrochlorothiazide (2 phases), addition of amlodipine.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study pop. was defined by the inclusion criteria. This study was carried out in 14 centers in Brazil with inclusion 2 months after the first study subject, started in Aug 06. After the screening visit, the patients that met inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected to participate in the study. The last patient out was in Jul 07.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A wash out period was needed in case of a previous inefficient antihypertensive medication, so it was interrupted from 2 to 3 wks before the enrollment. The patient could be excluded considering the exclusion criteria.</pre_assignment_details>
