    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV randomized controlled study assessing the effectiveness of a commercially
      available nutritional supplement on malnourished prevalent hemodialysis patients. Patients
      will be randomized to either receive one can of Nepro with Carb Steady at each dialysis
      treatment for 6 months or to receive the standard of care counseling for malnutrition. The
      primary hypothesis is that hypoalbuminemic maintenance hemodialysis patients will demonstrate
      an improvement in albumin levels with oral nutritional supplement provided in-center thrice
      weekly in addition to standard of care as compared to malnourished maintenance hemodialysis
      patients provided standard of care alone.
