      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may
      help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at the cancer genome using tumor samples from
      patients with stage I or stage II non-small cell lung cancer treated on clinical trial
      ACOSOG-Z0030.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To investigate the clinical relevance of conducting comprehensive molecular analyses on
           clinically annotated high-quality tumor biospecimens from patients with stage I or II,
           N0 or N1 (less than hilar) non-small cell lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Biological specimens are collected from participating clinical sites and analyzed by
      transcription profiling of RNA and microRNA; detection of DNA copy number changes and
      chromosomal rearrangements; epigenetic modifications analyses; and sequencing of genomic
      segments, genes, and regulatory regions to assess sequence variation. Clinical information
      associated with each specimen donor is also collected.
