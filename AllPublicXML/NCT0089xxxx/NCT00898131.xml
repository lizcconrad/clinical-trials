      RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of tumor tissue from patients with breast cancer to
      study in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase I study is collecting tissue samples for future research from women
      undergoing surgery for breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Collect breast tissue for future research from women undergoing surgery for breast
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Create microarrays by tumor type for internal use by Specialized Program of Research
           Excellence.

      OUTLINE: Tumor tissue is collected and analyzed to create microarrays by tumor type for
      future research studies.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,250 patients will be accrued for this study.
