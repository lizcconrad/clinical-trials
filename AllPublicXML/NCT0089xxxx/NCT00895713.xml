      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with intramuscular hepatitis B virus
      immune globulin Grifols, a new specific hepatitis B immune globulin, is effective and safe
      for the prevention of hepatitis B virus recurrence after orthotopic liver transplantation.

          4. Unknown serum HBV replication status (no data about HbeAg and HBV DNA) within 3 months
             before transplantation.

          5. Previous recurrence of HBV in the transplanted liver defined by serum HBV DNA-
             positive by sensitive hybridisation (lower detection limit 105 genomes/ml) assay or
             any less sensitive technique, and/or serum HBeAg-positive, and/or serum
             HBsAg-positive.

          6. Re-transplanted liver even for reasons not related to HBV infection.

             investigational product administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, makes the subject
             inappropriate for entry in this clinical trial.

         27. Impossibility to donate a serum sample before the first investigational product
             administration.
