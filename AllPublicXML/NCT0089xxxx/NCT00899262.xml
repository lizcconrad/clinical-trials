      RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of sputum and tissue to study in the laboratory may
      help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking samples of sputum and tissue from lung cancer
      patients, participants at high risk for developing lung cancer, and from healthy volunteers
      (both smokers and non-smokers).

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To test and make a preliminary assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of Fourier
           transform infrared technology (FTIR) for use in the early detection of lung cancer in
           sputum samples from patients who have or participants at high risk for developing lung
           cancer and from non-high-risk smoking and non-smoking volunteers.

        -  To permit identification of specific metabolic biomarkers within FTIR spectra that can
           distinguish between lung cancer, high-risk, and non-high-risk cases.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Sputum samples and endobronchial biopsy tissue specimens are collected prior to routine
      bronchoscopy as part of a standard clinical assessment for the early detection of lung
      cancer. Sputum samples are examined for levels of bronchial and non-bronchial cells using
      established cytological and immunohistochemical procedures. Samples are also examined for
      metabolic biomarkers using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to generate
      complete metabolic fingerprints (i.e., spectra) that can distinguish metabolic differences
      between cancer, non-cancer, and early disease (i.e., dysplasia or metaplasia). These
      molecular biomarkers, which are detected within FTIR spectra, may be further analyzed in
      matched endobronchial biopsy tissue samples for histological confirmation. Additional
      clinico-pathological data is collected for each participant to allow development of
      predictive statistical models from the data.

      All study participants are followed annually.
