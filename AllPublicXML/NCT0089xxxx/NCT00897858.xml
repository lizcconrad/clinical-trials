      RATIONALE: Studying samples of cerebrospinal fluid from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is studying cerebrospinal fluid proteins and angiogenesis
      proteins in young patients with newly diagnosed central nervous system tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Investigate the feasibility of centrally collecting and processing high-quality
           cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from pediatric patients with newly diagnosed central
           nervous system tumors for proteomic studies.

        -  Identify protein markers that might indicate the presence of a brain tumor using CSF
           samples collected from these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection from any or all of the following 5
      sites: lumbar, cervical, ommaya, intra-operative (ventricular, cisternal), and/or external
      ventricular drain. CSF is obtained within 8 weeks of diagnosis but prior to (or concurrent
      with) the initiation of any post-operative therapy (excluding corticosteroids).

      CSF samples are examined for proteomic biomarkers by 2D gel electrophoresis, low-mass
      fingerprinting, and stable isotope labeling.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 99 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Feasibility implies registering patients, submitting samples for proteomic investigation, and successfully analyzing the data at the lab in a timely fashion. The number of patients with proteomic data received at the PBTC Operations and Biostatistics Center will be assessed at 12, 18, 24, and 30 months after the 4th institution receives IRB approval for the study.</description>

        The study population consists of newly diagnosed pediatric patients with a CNS tumor and no
        prior irradiation or chemotherapy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is withdrawn as part of
        initial diagnosis/staging, the administration of intrathecal therapy, or CSF diversion.
