  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of myoma removal was studied on 28 patients with hypertension and myoma by holter
      monitoring and erythropoetin level check.

      Background:

      Myoma is the most common gynecoid tumor and produces many vasoactive substances, which may be
      a cause for secondary hypertension. Early reports suggested the association of myoma and
      hypertension. We studied the effect of myoma removal on hypertension and erythropoietin level
      to evaluate this hypothesis.

      Patients &amp; Methods:

      In this single centered prospective cohort study, in twenty eight patients who were
      candidates for myomectomy due to myoma, 24 hour holter monitoring of blood pressure and serum
      erythropoietin were checked before and 6 weeks after hysterectomy.
