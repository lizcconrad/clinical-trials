  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the prevalence of
      neurocognitive impairment among HIV-infected patients continues to be an important issue.
      Although severe forms of AIDS-related dementia have diminished, milder forms of cognitive
      impairment have been noted among approximately 30% of asymptomatic HIV patients. Studies
      among HIV-infected U.S. military personnel regarding neurocognitive function have largely
      been limited to the early 1990s, before the advent of HAART. In these studies subtle
      neurobehavioral changes were noted among asymptomatic HIV-positive military personnel.

      This study proposes to determine the prevalence of neurocognitive deficits among HIV-positive
      military beneficiaries during the era of HAART who are participants of the U.S. Military HIV
      Natural History Study. The prevalence ascertained in this study will be compared to
      HIV-negative military beneficiaries who are demographically similar to the HIV positive
      group. The sample size of the study is to have complete testing on 200 HIV positive and 50
      HIV-negative participants; due to the possibility of attrition before study completion, the
      investigators will enroll up to 300 participants (240 HIV-positive and 60 HIV-negative) to
      achieve this sample size. The investigators' rates among HIV-positive patients found in this
      study will also be contextualized in the setting of the prevalence of prior neurocognitive
      deficits seen in a HIV positive U.S. military population studied in the 1990s, contemporary
      rates among civilian HIV-infected persons, and normative values in the general HIV-negative
      population. Compared to other data in the field of neuropsychology, this study is novel in
      that the HIV population studied is composed largely of HIV patients who have been diagnosed
      early in their HIV infection; have open, free access to antiretrovirals to begin therapy
      earlier than most other cohorts; and consists of highly-functioning, educated individuals.

        The study population will consist of 50 HIV-negative patients and at least 200 HIV-positive
        patients who are 18-50 years of age and current participants of &quot;A Retrospective and
        Prospective Observational Study of the Natural History of HIV Infection in Active Duty U.S.
        Military Personnel and Department of Defense Beneficiaries&quot;(RV168).
