      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may
      help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at molecular markers and genetic markers in patients
      undergoing radiation therapy for cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine local-regional control in patients undergoing radiation therapy for cancer, as
           a function of expression of specific molecular/genetic markers.

      Secondary

        -  Determine complications of radiation therapy for patients undergoing radiation therapy
           for cancer.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected tissue samples are analyzed using immunohistochemical staining
      and other molecular/genetic study methods to detect markers, including p53, cyclin D1,
      HER-2-neu, bcl-2/BAX, and EGFR. Patient charts are also reviewed with emphasis on
      local-regional relapse.

        All patients undergoing radiation therapy for malignant disease will be eligible for these
        studies. Initially we will focus on specific disease sites, such as breast, prostate and
        lung, but ultimately we will expand this to include any disease site. Patients who met
        standard criteria for radiation therapy but ultimately did not receive radiation therapy
        will be used as a control arm if needed.
