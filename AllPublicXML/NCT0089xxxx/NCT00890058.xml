      The CIRAS study will investigate postmenopausal breast cancer patients with hand pain and
      compare those receiving aromatase inhibitors (cases) to breast cancer patients with hand pain
      not receiving aromatase inhibitors (controls) in order assess whether this syndrome is an
      inflammatory arthritis.

      This study is for women with post-menopausal breast cancer and hand pain. Patients do not
      need to be taking aromatase inhibitors to be eligible for the study. We want to study the
      joint findings in patients with hand pain and breast cancer undergoing treatment with
      aromatase inhibitor medications and compare them to patients with hand pain and breast cancer
      not treated with these medications.

      Aromatase inhibitor drugs are used in certain types of breast cancer to reduce the risk of
      cancer returning after treatment. One of the side effects of aromatase inhibitors is the
      development of joint pain, a complication known as the Arthralgia Syndrome. The cause of the
      Arthralgia Syndrome is not known, but we suspect that the pain may be due to inflammation in
      the joints. Currently, the only effective treatment is to stop the aromatase inhibitor, and
      so affected patients may miss out on an otherwise useful treatment to prevent return of their
      cancer.

      Post-menopausal patients with breast cancer and hand pain can enroll in the study. Patients
      will be asked to come for a separate visit which will take about half a day.

        Postmenopausal women with stage I-III breast cancer currently undergoing treatment at the
        Lombardi Cancer Center will be screened for the presence of joint and hand
        symptoms.Patients with symptoms who are receiving aromatase inhibitors will be considered
        to be cases, while those with symptoms who are not receiving aromatase inhibitors will be
        considered to be controls.
