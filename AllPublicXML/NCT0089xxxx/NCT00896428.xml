  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe asthma is a difficult to treat disease, characterized by bronchial remodelling, which
      is an abnormal repair process that contributes to the development of poorly reversible airway
      narrowing. Such remodelling is now considered as one of the main prognostic factors.
      Gallopamil-sensitive calcium influx plays a key role in this remodelling process in vitro.
      The objective of this study is to compare the effects of gallopamil versus placebo on the
      bronchial smooth muscle remodelling in severe asthmatic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchial remodelling mainly involves an increased mass of bronchial smooth muscle (BSM),
      which is related with an increase proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Recently, using BSM
      cells obtained from severe asthmatics, we have demonstrated that such an increase
      proliferation was induced by an activation cascade (Trian, J Exp Med, 2007). It first started
      with a gallopamil-sensitive calcium influx which induced the activation of calcium-calmodulin
      kinase IV (CamK-IV). CamK-IV then enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis through the subsequent
      activation of various transcription factors including PGC-1α, NRF-1 and mt-TFA. BSM cell
      proliferation was mainly mitochondria-dependent in vitro in severe asthma whereas that of
      controls was virtually mitochondria-independent. However, in vivo effects of gallopamil
      remain to be investigated. We will thus enrol 32 severe asthmatic patients in a phase 2
      randomized double blind study against placebo and evaluate the effect of gallopamil on BSM
      remodelling. Since inflammation also activates mitochondrial biogenesis in BSM cells, we will
      initially optimized asthma treatment for 3 months by both controlling co morbidities and
      decreasing bronchial inflammation using exhaled NO and eosinophil count within the induced
      sputum. We will then perform fiberoptic fibroscopy before and after 12 month treatment with
      gallopamil.
