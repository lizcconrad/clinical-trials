    <textblock>
      This laboratory study is looking at tumor samples from patients with Ewing sarcoma. Studying
      samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn
      more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer

      Study Subtype: Ancillary/Correlative Observational Study Model: Cohort Time Perspective:
      Prospective Biospecimen Retention: Samples With DNA Biospecimen Description: Tissue Study
      Population Description: Samples collected from AEWS0031 and patients registered on AEWS08B1
      Sampling Method: Non-Probability Sample

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if mutation of p53, and/or deletion of the p16 locus, have prognostic value in
      patients with Ewing sarcoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the incidence of p53 mutation in Ewing sarcoma samples collected from COG
      studies.

      II. Estimate the incidence of p16 deletions in Ewing sarcoma samples collected from COG
      studies.

      III. Prepare and archive amplified genomic DNA from Ewing sarcoma samples collected from COG
      studies for future biologic analysis.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Previously archived tumor samples are analyzed for p53 mutations and p16 deletion by
      immunohistochemistry, FISH, PCR, and DNA sequencing.
