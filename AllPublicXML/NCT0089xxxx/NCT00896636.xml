      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and breast tissue from healthy women in the laboratory
      may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related
      to breast cancer risk.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at breast tissue in women not previously diagnosed
      with breast cancer who are undergoing fine-needle aspiration.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine if breast tissue DNA methylation profile and hormone concentration change
           across follicular and luteal phase, or across menopause, in random fine needle
           aspiration samples of women with no prior diagnosis or treatment for breast cancer.

        -  To determine if DNA methylation profile and breast hormone levels correlate with
           mammographic density, cytomorphology, or Gail risk estimates.

        -  To develop a high throughput commercial assay for DNA methylation profiling for
           assessing breast cancer risk.

        -  To develop a highly sensitive, specific, and novel nanoassay for estradiol and
           progesterone.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Premenopausal women are stratified by menstrual cycle phase (mid-follicular [day 5-10] vs
      mid-luteal [day 20-25]), based on an adjusted 28-day cycle.

      Patients undergo breast density measurement by digital mammography. Blood samples are
      obtained and analyzed for estradiol, progesterone, and follicle-stimulating hormone
      measurements, to define menstrual/menopausal status, and for DNA extraction. Patients also
      undergo random fine needle aspiration. Biopsy material from aspiration is analyzed for
      cytomorphology, steroid radioimmunoassay (RIA), steroid nanoassay, and DNA methylation
      studies (via polymerase chain reaction). The aspiration samples are also analyzed for
      estradiol and progesterone levels using high-pressure liquid chromatography and RIA.
