      RATIONALE: Studying samples of fingernails in the laboratory from patients with breast cancer
      may help in evaluating bone health in postmenopausal women undergoing hormone therapy for
      breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is examining fingernails as a way of evaluating bone health in
      postmenopausal women with breast cancer undergoing hormone therapy on clinical trial
      IBCSG-1-98.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the effects of tamoxifen vs letrozole on the chemical properties of fingernails
           by Raman spectroscopy in postmenopausal women with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant
           hormonal therapy on protocol IBCSG-1-98.

        -  Determine the efficacy of nail structure for evaluating bone fragility.

      Secondary

        -  Compare fingernail assessments in patients who have had a bone fracture vs those who
           have not.

        -  Determine the natural variation in chemical (Raman spectroscopy) properties of 2
           fingernails sourced at 1 appointment from the same donor.

        -  Evaluate the effect of further drug treatment (after 6 months) on the chemical
           properties of fingernails.

      OUTLINE: This is a single-blind, multicenter, pilot study. Patients are stratified according
      to treatment on protocol IBCSG-1-98 (tamoxifen vs letrozole) and bone fracture (yes vs no).

      Fingernail clippings are collected at baseline and 6 months later. Fingernail clippings are
      examined by Raman spectroscopy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
