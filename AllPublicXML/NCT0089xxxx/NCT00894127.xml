      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the Biomoda CyPath™ Early Lung
           Cancer Detection Assay using sputum specimens from two cohorts of participants and
           estimate the required sample size to finalize a protocol for a pivotal study.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the capability of the Biomoda CyPath™ Early Lung Cancer Detection Assay in a
           clinical setting to identify cancer cells, as assessed by TCPP labeled cancer cells
           demonstrating red fluorescence under a microscope with ultraviolet (UV) light being
           observed with a FITC (Fluorescein isothiocyanate) Filter.

        -  To assess the capability of the Biomoda CyPath™ Early Lung Cancer Detection Assay to
           detect pre-invasive cancer in comparison with PAP sputum cytology and routine CT scan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Meso Tetra (4-Carboxyphenyl) Porphine (TCPP) is a porphyrin that can label cancer cells by
      reacting to the increased number of low-density lipoproteins coating the surface of cancer
      cells and the porous nature of the cancer cell membrane, causing the cell to fluoresce under
      specific wavelengths of light. The primary objective of this clinical trial was to determine
      the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the CyPath® Lung Cancer Detection Assay (&quot;CyPath®
      Assay&quot;) using sputum specimens from two cohorts of Participants. The Study design included a
      protocol to assess the capability of the Biomoda CyPath® Lung Cancer Detection Assay to
      detect cancer in comparison with routine high-resolution, low-dose Computed Tomography (LDCT)
      scans.

      Optimization of the Assay can lead to improved sensitivity and specificity. Increase in
      sample size and evaluation of the entire sputum sample can increase data collection and
      differentiation between cohorts. Technicians in the current Study examined 12 slides
      containing approximately 600,000 cells. The average sputum sample pellet translates to a
      potential of approximately 3.5 million cells for evaluation. Evaluating the full sputum
      sample with the CyPath® Assay can be accomplished through flow cytometry and would increase
      the capture and analysis of exfoliated cancer cells in the sample. In-house studies evaluated
      samples from five different cancer cell lines using flow cytometry. Preliminary results
      showed that cancer cell lines were detected with significant fluorescence apart from normal
      cell fluorescence. Refinements for using the flow cytometer include optimizing the
      liquid-based assay and sample analysis and focus on concentration, incubation time and
      optimal sample volume.

    <description>Various measurements were taken to report the validity of the findings. Sensitivity in this study was defined as the percentage of tumor cells that were positively identified. Specificity was the percentage of true positive signals and accuracy calculated as the percentage of those patients identified as having cancer.
Testing for the study was performed at multiple locations to assess the efficacy of the CyPath Assay to detect lung cancer cells exfoliated from lung tumors present in deep-lung sputum. Participants who satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study and assigned to one of two cohorts (smoker with clear Low dose CT scan or &quot;high-risk&quot; normals,&quot; and lung cancer confirmed by pathology or &quot;cancer&quot;).</description>

          <description>Deep-lung sputum was obtained from two cohorts, including (1) high-risk control group comprised of individuals not diagnosed but at high risk for lung cancer (n=102) and, (2) cancer group comprised of individuals with confirmed lung cancer diagnosis (n=26), was labeled in exact manner with TCPP and evaluated to detect red fluorescent [ie, cancer] cells (RFCs) from deep-lung sputum samples.
