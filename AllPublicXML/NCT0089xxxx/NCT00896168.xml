  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of iInfliximab plus methotrexate
      (MTX) in treatment of Rheumatoid rheumatoid Arthritis arthritis (RA) (it is an autoimmune
      disease that causes pain, swelling, stiffness and loss of function in joints) in participants
      with moderate disease versus participants with severe disease and to compare the efficacy and
      safety of the MTX subgroups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center (study
      conducted in more than 1 center), prospective (study following participants forward in time)
      study comparing the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) scores of participants with
      moderate RA (defined as having a score greater than 3.2, but less than 5.1 on the Disease
      Activity Score 28 [DAS 28]) to those participants with severe RA (defined as having a score
      greater than 5.1 on the DAS 28 score) disease while being treated with infliximab and MTX.
      DAS evaluates RA activity by several parameters including the number of swollen and tender
      joints and the participant's own assessment of their pain. Participants will receive
      infliximab 3 milligram (mg) per kilogram (kg) intravenous infusion (drug given into a vein)
      (over no less than 2 hours) at Weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22 along oral MTX in a stable dose of
      7.5 to 20 mg per week (equal to the dose used before participation in the study) for 22
      Weeks. Participants will have a follow-up visit on Week 26. Efficacy will primarily be
      assessed by the percentage of participants obtaining ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response at Week
      26. Participants' safety will be assessed throughout the study.

    <description>Number of swollen joints were determined by examination of 28 joints and identifying when swelling is present. The number of swollen joints was recorded on the joint assessment form at each visit; the swelling was graded on a scale ranging from 0-2 (0=no swelling, 1=swelling, but bony landmarks seen, 2=swelling but bone marks not seen). Participants categorized as Hepatitis B Virus antigen (HBsAb) positive/negative (at least 1 of HbsAg, HBeAg, Anti-HbeAg and Anti-HbcAg were positive or all were negative).</description>
