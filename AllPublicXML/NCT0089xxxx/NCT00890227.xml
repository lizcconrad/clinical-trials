  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to compare two methods of surgery to treat scoliosis and/or
      kyphosis of the spine.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there are two different surgical methods used in the treatment of these problems.
      One method includes an all open posterior spinal fusion (large incision with opening of the
      muscles); this is also known as a traditional technique. The second method involves an open
      surgery for the portion of the spine requiring a fusion except the very top area, where
      minimally invasive technique (smaller incision and without opening of the muscles) is used.

      One possible side effect of either method for surgical repair is a condition called proximal
      junctional kyphosis (PJK). PJK occurs in the form of fracture at the top vertebra involved in
      the surgery or as a loss of correction of spinal alignment achieved, through gradual bending
      forward of the spine over time. In this study we want to compare the rate of PJK between two
      groups of patients undergoing long posterior spinal instrumentation fusion.

      People undergoing long posterior spinal instrumented fusion may join.

      About 68 people will join.
