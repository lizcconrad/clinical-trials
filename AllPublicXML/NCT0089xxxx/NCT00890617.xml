      RATIONALE: Cryotherapy kills tumor cells by freezing them. Giving cryotherapy before surgery
      may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well cryotherapy works in treating patients with
      primary stage I non-small cell lung cancer or lung metastasis.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the histologic result of treating patients with primary stage I non-small cell
           lung cancer or lung metastasis after neoadjuvant percutaneous cryotherapy (PTC).

      Secondary

        -  Provide a qualitative assessment of the histology from the ablation and tumor margins,
           comparing histologic observations with imaging-enhancement patterns by CT or PET scan
           before and after PTC.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo CT-guided percutaneous cryotherapy (PTC) over 2 hours.
      Approximately 3 weeks after completion of PTC, patients undergo thoracotomy consisting of
      lobectomy of the primary lung cancer or wedge resection with adequate margin for the
      metastatic lesion, and mediastinal lymph node dissection.

      Tissue samples from ablation and tumor margins are collected during thoracotomy and compared
      with imaging-enhanced patterns of CT or PET scans taken at baseline and after PTC.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 6 months.
