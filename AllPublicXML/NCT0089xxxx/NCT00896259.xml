  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A group of orthopedic physiotherapists have developed a late phase program to educate and
      instruct total hip replacement patients in progressive exercises appropriate for their level
      of recovery. The components of this program include an educational presentation, individual
      assessment and exercise prescription. The investigators' intent is to pilot the program using
      a sample of patients. The objective of this pilot project:

      To examine the effects of the late phase education session and home-based exercise program in
      restoring hip muscle strength, gait and function
