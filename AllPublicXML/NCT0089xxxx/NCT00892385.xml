      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as methoxyamine and temozolomide, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving methoxyamine together with temozolomide may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of methoxyamine when
      given together with temozolomide in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of methoxyamine given in conjunction with
           temozolomide in patients with and without CNS disease.

        -  To determine the dose limiting toxicities of the combination of methoxyamine and
           temozolomide in patients with and without CNS disease.

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of these two agents when given alone or in
           combination, as well as the pharmacokinetic profile of methoxyamine after single
           one-hour IV administration.

        -  To determine relative DNA damage, as single or double strand breaks by comet assay in
           blood mononuclear cells which will serve as a surrogate for tumor response to the drug
           combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of methoxyamine.

      Patients receive oral temozolomide for 5 days every 28 days and methoxyamine IV over 1 hour
      every 28 days. Methoxyamine IV administration will follow, within 5 minutes, initial
      administration of TMZ on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for correlative studies. Samples are analyzed for
      methoxyamine and temozolomide pharmacokinetics, apurinic/apyrimidinic sites, and DNA strand
      break determination by comet assay.
