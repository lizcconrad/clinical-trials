  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will enroll subjects with advanced hematologic malignancies who do not have a
      suitable related or unrelated donor to undergo a Stem Cell Transplant.

      In this study, subjects will undergo a Stem Cell Transplant using Cord Blood. Part of the
      cord blood will be used for the Stem Cell Transplant and part of the cord blood will be sent
      to a laboratory in order to grow the T cells (from the cord blood) and increase the activity
      of the cord blood T cells.

      The purpose of this part of the study is to see if it is safe to give study subjects
      activated T cells made from a small portion of their donor UCB unit immediately after the UCB
      transplant. Activated T cells have been used safely in stem cell transplantation studies in
      the past, but they have never been studied UCB transplantation.

      The main study intervention includes CD3/CD28 ex vivo costimulated T cells derived from a
      thawed umbilical cord blood unit, co-infused following a myeloablative conditioning regimen.

      Activated T cells are T cells that have been activated in the laboratory by exposure to 2
      compounds or molecules called CD3 and CD28; when T cells are exposed to both of these
      compounds at the same time, they become activated or &quot;stimulated&quot; and may be more effective
      in fighting infections, cancer cells, and promoting the recovery of red cells, white cells,
      and platelets after transplantation. At the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania,
      activated T cells are prepared at the Clinical Cell and Vaccine Production Facility, also
      known as the CVPF.
