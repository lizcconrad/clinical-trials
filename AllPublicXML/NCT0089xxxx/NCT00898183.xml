      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to
      treatment.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is assessing genes and immune response in tumor samples from
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Characterize the frequency of non-random cytogenetic abnormalities in regional and
           distant melanoma metastases and explore their association with clinical outcome of
           patients with metastatic melanoma.

        -  Characterize the frequency of specific genetic alterations at either the DNA, mRNA, or
           protein level and explore the association of these abnormalities with clinical outcome
           in these patients.

        -  Characterize the host immunologic response to metastatic melanoma by determining whether
           the in vivo pattern of cytokine expression is consistent with specific subsets of T
           helper cells within melanoma deposits and to explore whether host immunologic response
           varies based on the site of metastatic disease and/or correlates with clinical outcome
           in these patients.

        -  Obtain peripheral blood, sera, and paraffin embedded tumor blocks from these patients.

        -  Correlate the most prevalent gene copy alteration observed in metastatic disease with
           the risk of progression in tissue samples from patients registered on SWOG-9035 (primary
           melanoma).

      OUTLINE: Fresh and snap frozen tumor tissue samples are obtained from biopsy or surgical
      procedures in the coordinated study. Specimens undergo mRNA and DNA analysis of tumor-related
      genes and cytokine gene expression. Peripheral blood samples are obtained and processed for
      sera and mononuclear cell testing. Tumor tissue samples embedded in paraffin or on unstained
      slides are also obtained.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 120 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-4
      years.
