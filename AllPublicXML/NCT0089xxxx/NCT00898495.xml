      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue in the laboratory from patients with cancer may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.
      It may also help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at genes to see if they can predict outcome in
      patients with esophageal cancer treated with cisplatin, radiation therapy, and surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Correlate patient outcomes with neoplastic cell genotypes, specifically 18 single
           nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 16 major genes involved in platinum metabolism and
           disposition and DNA repair, in patients with esophageal cancer treated with neoadjuvant
           cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical resection on clinical trial
           ECOG-1201.

        -  Correlate patient outcomes with neoplastic cell genotypes, specifically loss of
           heterozygosity, in these patients.

        -  Correlate patient outcomes with normal (germline) cell genotypes, specifically SNPs
           related to platinum metabolism and disposition and DNA repair.

        -  Compare the predictive ability of neoplastic vs germline cell genotypes.

      OUTLINE: This is a retrospective, cohort, multicenter study.

      Neoplastic and normal (germline) cells are collected from pretreatment and post-treatment
      specimens using laser-capture microdissection. Single nucleotide polymorphisms are examined
      by real-time PCR. Loss of heterozygosity is assessed by analyzing short tandem repeat markers
      in neoplastic and germline tissue.
