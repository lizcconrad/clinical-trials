      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and pleural or peritoneal fluid from patients with
      metastatic breast cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify biomarkers related to
      breast cancer and learn more about how breast cancer begins and spreads in the body.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at a new way of identifying circulating breast cancer
      cells in blood and in pleural or peritoneal fluid in women with metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To compare identification of circulating breast cancer cells (CBCCs) in blood or pleural
           or peritoneal fluid by a novel technique using stem cell marker retinaldehyde
           dehydrogenase (ALDH) and surface antigen expression (CD44+, CD24-) to the standard
           technique using the CellSearch® system in women with metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To determine whether CBCCs have the potential to grow into metastatic lesions.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo sample collection to help develop a new technique using stem cell
      marker retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and surface antigen expression (CD44+, CD24-) in
      isolating circulating breast cancer cells (CBCCs) from blood and pleural or peritoneal fluid.
      Blood may also be drawn to measure the number of circulating tumor cells using the standard
      CellSearch® system.

      Mononuclear cells are isolated by density centrifugation. Cells are stained against surface
      antigens that provide specific expression patterns for CBCCs (CD44, CD24). Cells are analyzed
      on a fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) Calibur flow cytometer and sequentially gated
      (ALDHhigh→CD44+ vs CD24-/low or CD44+ vs CD24-/low→ALDHhigh) for detection of CBCCs. For
      further confirmation of epithelial origin, ALDHhighCD44+CD24-/low cells are isolated using a
      FACSAria flow sorter, cytocentrifuged onto glass slides then stained for the expression of
      epithelial-specific cytokeratins 5, 8, 14, 18 and 19 by standard immunohistochemical
      techniques. Using the phenotype that is found to most highly enrich for epithelial cells,
      cells are isolated by FACS and assayed for clonogenic growth.
