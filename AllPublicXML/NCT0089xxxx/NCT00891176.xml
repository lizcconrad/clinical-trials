    <textblock>
      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of an extension phase when
      subjects are aged 3, 4 and 6 years of age. The objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary
      phase are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT number = NCT00334334). The objectives
      &amp; outcome measures of the booster phase are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT
      number = NCT00463437).

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the persistence of pneumococcal, meningococcal
      serogroup C, Hib and Hepatits B antibodies after booster vaccination, when the subjects are
      aged 3, 4 and 6 years. No vaccine will be administered during this persistence phase of the
      study.

      This multicenter study is open. No vaccine will be administered during this persistence phase
      of the study. The subjects were randomized in the primary vaccination study 107005 and will
      not be further randomized in this study.

      <pre_assignment_details>At 3 years of age, 582 subjects were enrolled. One subject who did not participate in the primary study was enrolled by mistake and was therefore withdrawn from the study. Therefore the total number of subjects participating at the 36 months of age time point was 581.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Opsonophagocytic activity was measured by a killing-assay. The results were presented as the dilution of serum (opsonic titer) able to sustain 50% killing of live pneumococci under the assay conditions. The cut-off of the assay was an opsonic titer of 8.</description>

          <description>Subjects who received concomitantly in the primary study (NCT00334334): 3 primary doses of Synflorix intramuscularly into the right thigh at 2, 4 and 6 months of age, 3 primary doses of Menitorix intramuscularly into the lower left thigh at 2, 4 and 6 months of age and 3 primary doses of Infanrix penta intramuscularly into the upper left thigh at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. During the booster study (NCT00463437) subjects received the same vaccines as during the primary study at 11-18 months of age, with the exception of Spain, where Infanrix IPV was given instead of Infanrix penta.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>GSK agreements may vary with individual investigators, but will not prohibit any investigator from publishing. GSK supports the publication of results from all centers of a multi-center trial but requests that reports based on single-site data not precede the primary publication of the entire clinical trial.</restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>A decrease in the specificity of the anti-HB ELISA assay had been observed in some studies for low levels of antibody when tested by ELISA.The tables show both the results obtained by ELISA and updated results following complete retesting by CLIA.</limitations_and_caveats>
