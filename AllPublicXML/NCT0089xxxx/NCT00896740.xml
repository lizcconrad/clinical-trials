      RATIONALE: Studying samples of bone marrow from patients with Fanconi anemia and from healthy
      participants in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA
      and identify biomarkers related to Fanconi anemia.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is evaluating gene function in bone marrow cells from patients
      with Fanconi anemia and from healthy participants.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Describe the complete hematopoietic transcriptomes of Fanconi cells of every common
           complementation group (e.g., A, C, G, and F) as well as transcriptomes of neoplastic
           cells derived from bone marrow of patients with Fanconi anemia.

        -  Define large-scale dynamic gene expression data in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients and healthy volunteers undergo bone marrow aspiration or biopsy for biological
      studies. Samples are analyzed for gene expression profiles using microarray assays.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients and 10 healthy volunteers will be accrued for this
      study.
