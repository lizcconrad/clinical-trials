      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of
      deferiprone in subjects with Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA).

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the long-term efficacy of deferiprone for the
      treatment of FRDA.

      The tertiary objectives are to evaluate the effect of deferiprone on:

        1. cardiac function,

        2. quality of life, and

        3. functional status.

      This is a multi-centre, open-label, non-randomized, single treatment, safety and efficacy
      study. All subjects who completed the LA29-0207 study are eligible for participation.
      Participants will receive deferiprone oral solution at the same dose (20 or 40 mg/kg/day)
      that they were assigned for LA29-0207. The duration of treatment will be 52 weeks.

          4. Signed and witnessed written informed consent/assent, obtained prior to the first

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Serum Ferritin and Hemoglobin (Hb) levels are below the reference range for age and
             sex-matched controls.

          2. Unable to complete T25FW AND with a score &gt; 5 minutes in the 9HPT. Subjects who can
             complete T25FW or with a score â‰¤ 5 minutes in the 9HPT will be allowed to enrol).

          3. Doubling of score on 9HPT or T25FW compared to their study baseline results in
             LA29-0207.
