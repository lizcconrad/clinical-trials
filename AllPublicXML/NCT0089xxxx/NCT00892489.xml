  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalence between the Phase 3 and the
      to-be-marketed formulations of extended release (ER) OROS paliperidone and to evaluate the
      effect of food on the highest to be marketed tablet strength. Additionally, the safety and
      tolerability of the treatments in healthy volunteers will be assessed.

      This study is designed as a single-center, open-label, randomized, 3 treatment-period,
      crossover study in healthy male adults. The study consists of a screening phase and an
      open-label treatment phase during which each volunteer will receive 3 treatments of study
      drug in a random order and separated by a washout period of 10 to 14 days. Treatment A
      consists of a single oral dose of 15 mg ER OROS paliperidone Phase 3 formulation in the
      fasted state; Treatment B consists of a single oral dose of 15 mg ER OROS paliperidone
      to-be-marketed formulation in fasted state; and Treatment C consists of a single oral dose of
      15 mg ER OROS paliperidone to-be-marketed formulation after consumption of a high-fat
      breakfast. There are slight formulation differences between the ER OROS paliperidone
      formulation that was used in Phase 3 efficacy studies and the formulation that is intended to
      be marketed. What is more important, however, is that the highest tablet strength used in
      Phase 3 and the tablet strength that is planned for the market as commercial formulation are
      different. For Phase 3 studies, 9 mg was the highest tablet strength and the highest dose of
      15 mg was administered as 2 tablets of 3 mg and 1 tablet of 9 mg. The highest to-be-marketed
      tablet strength is 15 mg. This study is designed to demonstrate the bioequivalence between
      the Phase 3 formulation and the highest tablet strength of the to-be-marketed formulation and
      to assess the effect of food on the highest to-be-marketed tablet strength. Safety and
      tolerability will be monitored throughout the study. All volunteers will receive each of the
      following 3 treatments in the order specified by the random assignment:Treatment A, oral ER
      OROS paliperidone Phase 3 formulation as 2 tablets of 3 mg and 1 tablet of 9 mg in the fasted
      state; Treatment B, oral ER OROS paliperidone to-be-marketed formulation as 1 tablet of 15 mg
      in the fasted state; Treatment C, oral ER OROS paliperidone to-be-marketed formulation as 1
      tablet of 15 mg after a high-fat breakfast.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body Mass Index (weight [kg]/height [m²]) of 18 to 28 kg/m², inclusive

          -  Have a supine (after 5 minutes rest) blood pressure between the range of 100 to 140
             mmHg systolic, inclusive, and 50 to 90 mmHg diastolic, inclusive

          -  Healthy on the basis of a prestudy physical examination, medical history, ECG, and the
             laboratory results of serum chemistry, hematology and urinalysis performed within 21
             days before the first dose. If the results of the serum chemistry, hematology or
             urinalysis testing are not within the laboratory's reference ranges the volunteer can
             be included only if the investigator judges that the deviations are not clinically
             significant. For renal function tests, the values must be within the normal laboratory
             reference ranges.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Drug allergy to risperidone, paliperidone, or any of its excipients

          -  Known allergy or history of significant hypersensitivity to heparin, in case a heparin
             lock will be used

          -  Recent history of alcohol or substance abuse, a positive test result for the urine
             drug screen at screening or upon admittance to the testing facility or a positive
             result for the alcohol urine test upon admittance to the testing facility

          -  Relevant history or presence of any cardiovascular (including myocardial infarct or
             cardiac arrhythmia), respiratory, neurologic (including seizures), psychiatric, renal,
             hepatic, gastrointestinal (including surgeries, severe gastrointestinal narrowing, and
             malabsorption problems), endocrine, hematologic or immunologic disease

             decrease of &gt;10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure after standing for at least 2 minutes
             that is not associated with an increase of &gt;15 beats per minute (bpm) in heart rate

          -  Bradycardia (heart rate &lt;50 bpm) as determined by screening ECG

          -  History of or a positive test result for any of the serology tests (hepatitis B, C,
             and HIV)

          -  History of smoking or use of nicotine-containing substances within the last 2 months,
