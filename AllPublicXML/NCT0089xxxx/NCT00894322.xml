  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety of
      exenatide once weekly suspension in both healthy subjects and in subjects with type 2
      diabetes. The study will also evaluate efficacy in the type 2 diabetes patients. Development
      of this exenatide once weekly presentation would eliminate the need to reconstitute the
      product prior to use.

        <description>Cohort 1: Blood samples for the assessment of plasma exenatide were collected at time = -15, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 360, and 480 minutes relative to study medication injection at time = 0 on Day 1 and the mean is presented below. At all visits following the single injection, a single blood sample was collected for assessment of exenatide concentrations. AUC was measured in picograms * hours per milliliter (pg*hr/mL). Exenatide was measured using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). AUC calculated using linear trapezoidal method from time x to time y; AUC (0-8h) and (0-tlast) are presented below. Pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluable population consisted of all ITT participants who had at least 4 detectable plasma exenatide measurements [not less than (&lt;) lower limits of quantification (LLOQ)] from Day 1 to Week 12 and had reliable PK data.</description>

Participants may be counted in more than one medication class and no more than once in each class. Categories by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary version C1, 01 March 2009.

        <description>Cohort 1: Blood samples for the assessment of plasma exenatide were collected at time = -15, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 360, and 480 minutes relative to study medication injection at time = 0 on Day 1. At all visits following the single injection, a single blood sample was collected for assessment of exenatide concentrations. AUC (0-168 h) data represents average concentration rather than maximum concentration. Exenatide concentration was measured using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). AUC calculated using linear trapezoidal method from time x to time y and measured in pg*h/mL. PK evaluable population consisted of all ITT participants who had at least 4 detectable plasma exenatide measurements (not &lt; LLOQ) from Day 1 to Week 12 and had reliable PK data.</description>

        <description>Cohort 2: Blood samples for the assessment of plasma exenatide were collected on Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. At Week 10, blood samples were collected at time = -15, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 360 minutes relative to study medication injection at time = 0. AUC was measured in picograms * hours per milliliter (pg*hr/mL). Exenatide was measured using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). AUC calculated using linear trapezoidal method from time x to time y; AUC (0-6h) measured at Week 10, AUC (0-168h) steady state measured between Weeks 10 and 11, and AUC (0-tlast) for time interval between Weeks 10 and 12 (approximately336 hours) are presented below. PK evaluable population consisted of all ITT participants who had at least 4 detectable plasma exenatide measurements (not &lt; LLOQ) from Day 1 to Week 12 and had reliable PK data.</description>

        <title>Average Exenatide Concentration (Cave) of 2 mg Exenatide (Cohort 2) in Participants With Diabetes in the Pharmacokinetic Evaluable Population</title>
        <description>Cohort 2: Blood samples for the assessment of plasma exenatide were collected on Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. At Week 10, blood samples were collected at time = -15, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 360 minutes relative to study medication injection at time = 0. At all visits following the single injection, a single blood sample was collected for assessment of exenatide concentrations. Cave(0-168h) and Cave(0-tlast) was the time-weighted mean concentration over the sampling period from time x to time y corresponding to AUC (0-168h), and AUC (0-tlast), respectively. Cave was measured in picograms per milliliter (pg/mL). Exenatide concentration was measured using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). PK evaluable population consisted of all ITT participants who had at least 4 detectable plasma exenatide measurements (not &lt; LLOQ) from Day 1 to Week 12 and had reliable PK data.</description>
