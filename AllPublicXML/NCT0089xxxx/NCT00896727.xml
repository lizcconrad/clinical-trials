      RATIONALE: Studying the proteins expressed in tumor tissue samples in the laboratory from
      patients with cancer may help doctors learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. It may
      also help doctors predict how patients respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at protein expression in predicting response to
      treatment using tumor tissue samples from women with stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA breast
      cancer treated on clinical trial SWOG-9313.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess in-situ protein expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR),
           HER-2, and p53 by automated quantitative analysis (AQUA™) and multiplexed analysis at 2
           markers per slide using tumor tissue from women with stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA
           breast cancer treated on clinical trial SWOG-9313.

        -  Assess the main effects of ER, PR, HER-2, and p53, as well as interactions to generate
           classes formed by clustering of biomarkers, on a large breast cancer tissue microarray
           to predict disease-free and overall survival of patients who received high-dose
           cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin hydrochloride on clinical trial SWOG-9313.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to receptor status
      and menopausal status.

      Tumor tissue samples are analyzed by quantitative protein expression analysis (AQUA™, a
      fluorescent antibody technique) for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, p53 and HER-2.
      AQUA™ is used to assess markers individually and as ratios with the use of clustering
      algorithms to define reproducible classifications of tissue from patients treated on
      SWOG-9313 as a function of molecular classification.

      Results of the AQUA™ testing are compared to immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ
      hybridization (FISH) results obtained on SWOG-9313.
