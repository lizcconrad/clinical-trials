  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of allergic diseases has increased and a relation between allergy and dietary
      fatty acids has been proposed. Modulation of the maternal immune function during pregnancy
      may have an impact on future clinical outcomes in the child. The aim of this study was to
      determine the effects of omega (ω) - 3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA)
      supplementation during pregnancy and lactation on the development of allergic disease (i.e.,
      allergic eczema) in the child at 2 years of age. Pregnant women with allergic disease in
      their immediate family were supplemented daily with 2.7 g ω-3 LCPUFA (n=70) or 2.8 g
      soybean-oil as placebo (n=75) from gestational week (gw) 25 until the third month of
      breastfeeding. Skin prick tests, detection of circulating specific IgE antibodies and
      clinical examinations of the infants were performed at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months of age. The
      mothers and children were monitored regarding immune modulatory effects during the entire
      study period.
