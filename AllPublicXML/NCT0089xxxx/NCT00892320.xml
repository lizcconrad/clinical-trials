      The purposes of this study are to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of
      extended-release (ER) OROS paliperidone in healthy Japanese adults and to assess the safety
      and tolerability.

      This study was designed as a randomized, open-label, single-center, crossover study to
      evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of extended-release (ER) OROS
      paliperidone in healthy Japanese adults. Of the 20 Japanese volunteers who are to be
      enrolled, at least 6 are to be men and 6 are to be women. All volunteers will receive single
      doses of 3 mg ER OROS paliperidone with and without a standard Japanese breakfast. There will
      be a 1-week washout between treatments, for a total treatment duration of approximately 2
      weeks. Volunteers are to be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequence groups (fed and
      fasted; fasted and fed). The pharmacokinetics of paliperidone will be assessed for 96 hours
      after each dosing. Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study. Prior to
      initiating clinical trials in Japan, a food effect study is required to evaluate the effect
      of food on the pharmacokinetics of ER OROS paliperidone in Japanese adults.

      3 mg tablets, single oral dose, once under fasting and once under fed conditions

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Japanese volunteers must have been born in Japan of Japanese parents and not lived
             outside of Japan for more than 5 years

          -  Female volunteers must be surgically sterile, or practicing an effective method of
             birth control (e.g., prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections,
             intrauterine device, double-barrier method, contraceptive patch, male partner
             sterilization) before entry and throughout the study, have a negative serum beta-HCG
             pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test on Day -1

          -  Volunteers must sign an informed consent document indicating that they understand the
             purpose of and procedures required for the study and are willing to participate in the
             study

          -  Volunteers must sign informed consent document for pharmacogenomic testing

          -  However, participation in the genetic testing component is not mandatory for
             participation in the remainder of the study

          -  Volunteers must have a weight as defined by Body Mass Index or Quetelet Index (weight
             [kg]/height (m)Â²) within the range of 18.0 - 25.0, extremes included and must be
             normotensive with supine (5 min) blood pressure between the range of 100-139 mm Hg
             systolic and 60-89 mm Hg diastolic

          -  Volunteers must be healthy on the basis of a pre-study physical examination, medical
             history, electrocardiogram, and the results of blood biochemistry and hematology tests
             and a urinalysis carried out less than 3 weeks before the first dose. If the results
             of the biochemistry or hematology tests or the urinalysis testing are not within the
             laboratory's reference ranges the volunteer can be included only on condition that the
             investigator judges that the deviations are not clinically significant. For liver
             function tests (AST, ALT, bilirubin) the values must be within 2 times the upper limit
             of the normal reference ranges

          -  Volunteers must smoke less than 10 cigarettes per day and agree not to change smoking
             habits during the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Relevant history of any significant and/or unstable cardiovascular, respiratory,
             neurologic (including seizures or significant cerebrovascular), renal, hepatic,
             endocrine, psychiatric, or immunologic disorders

          -  History of any severe preexisting gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or
             iatrogenic)

          -  Inability to swallow study medication (volunteers may not chew, divide, dissolve, or
             crush the study medication)

          -  History or suspicion of alcohol, barbiturate, amphetamine or narcotic abuse

          -  Drug allergy to risperidone, paliperidone or any of its excipients

          -  Use of concomitant medication (including vitamins and herbal supplements), except for
             paracetamol (acetaminophen) and hormonal contraceptives. All other medication must
             have been stopped at least 14 days before the first dose in the study

          -  At screening, 2 and 3 minutes after standing, experience a decrease of greater than or
             equal to 20 mmHg systolic blood pressure, a decrease of greater than or equal to 10
             mmHg diastolic blood pressure, or an increase of greater than or equal to 20 beats per
             minute in heart rate or with symptoms of lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting upon
             standing from the supine position

          -  Positive serology tests for hepatitis B, C or HIV
