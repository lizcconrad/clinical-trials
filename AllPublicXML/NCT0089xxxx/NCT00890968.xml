      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Triamcinolone Acetonide (TAC) DuraPeel is
      safe and effective in the treatment of hand dermatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Triamcinolone acetonide is a commonly used, safe, and effective topical corticosteroid
      indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of
      corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. However, the effectiveness of topical agents such as
      creams or ointments is limited by patients' routine activities using bare hands that may
      remove the topical agent from the hands. The use of a topical corticosteroid in a vehicle
      that allows the product to remain in contact with the skin and is not susceptible to
      inadvertent removal would be beneficial.

      The DuraPeel membrane is expected to optimize exposure to the steroid by remaining on the
      treatment area for a prolonged period of time.

      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.5%
      DuraPeel. Eligible subjects will receive Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.5% DuraPeel or Placebo
      DuraPeel. The study duration will be approximately 4 weeks.

          -  Dermatitis of mild to moderate severity, as defined by an Investigator's Global
             Assessment (a score of 2 or 3 on the Target Hand)

          -  Individual signs of hand dermatitis disease of at least mild scaling and mild erythema
             (a score of 2 or more on the Target Hand)

          -  Written informed consent
