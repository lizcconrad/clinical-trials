  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the combined effect of denosumab treatment and discontinuation on cortical
      thickness at the distal radius by High Resolution-Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography
      (HR-pQCT). Participants randomized to either denosumab or placebo in the 20050179
      (NCT00293813) study who completed that study (ie, attended an end of study visit) can be
      included in this study. At least 12 months should have elapsed since the patient's 20050179
      end of study visit.

          -  Received any investigational product other than denosumab in two years before the
             screening visit.

          -  Received &gt; 3 months (or equivalent) of osteoporosis treatment since having completed
             the 20050179 study.

          -  Current use of the following osteoporosis agents: bisphosphonates, calcitonin,
             fluoride, parathyroid hormone analogue, selective estrogen receptor modulators,
             systemic oral or transdermal estrogen (except vaginal preparations and estrogen creams
             which are acceptable), strontium or tibolone.

          -  Currently enrolled in or has not yet completed at least 1 month since ending other
             investigational device or drug trial(s) (other than Amgen trial 20080287), or subject

      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
