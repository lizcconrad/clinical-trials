  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 300,000 children are fighting in armed conflicts all over the world. In Uganda an
      estimated number of 25,000 children have been abducted and forced to fight or work as porters
      and sex slaves on the side of the rebels during the conflict between the Lord's Resistance
      Army (LRA) and the Ugandan government. Each year, thousands of former child soldiers have
      returned to their communities after they had fled or were freed from the rebels. It is well
      known that a high percentage of these youths are suffering from mental health problems. This
      could be one of the possible reasons why they are facing difficulties to reintegrate into
      their communities.

      The main aim of the proposed project is two-fold. On the one hand, the investigators want to
      systematically explore the relationship between mental health and important variables for
      reintegration into the communities like aggression, hostility, feelings of revenge,
      compromises and conflict behaviour and readiness for reconciliation in formerly abducted and
      other vulnerable youth (orphans, child mothers and handicapped youths) in Northern Uganda. On
      the other hand, the investigators want to probe the efficacy of existing and newly developed
      interventions for formerly abducted and other vulnerable youths that are supposed to foster
      their mental well-being as well as their reintegration into the society and therewith are
      part of the long-term prevention of new conflicts in Northern Uganda.
