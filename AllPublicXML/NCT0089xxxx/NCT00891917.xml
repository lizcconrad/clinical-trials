      The purpose of this study is to measure the effects of LiQ-NOL supplementation on language
      production using the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals test, language sampling
      using the mean length of utterance test, and speech articulation using the Goldman-Fristoe
      Test of Articulation.
