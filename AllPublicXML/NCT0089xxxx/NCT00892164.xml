      The objective of this study is to compare the results of total thyroidectomy using the new
      harmonic scalpel device to that with the electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The harmonic scalpel and the electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing system (LIGASURE PRECISE)
      have been both shown to be safe and effective in thyroid surgery. The moderate dissection
      capabilities of the previous harmonic scalpel instruments available for thyroid surgery have
      led to an innovative technical improvement of the device (FOCUS) that has very recently been
      implemented and has been made available in 2008. Comparison of the utilization of this new
      device, however, with the electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer has not been performed in any
      study. The objective of this study is to compare the results of total thyroidectomy using the
      FOCUS to that with the LIGASURE device in respect to hemostasis, operative time and
      perioperative complications. All patients undergoing a total thyroidectomy in our endocrine
      surgery department are randomized into those operated with FOCUS (Group A) and those with
      LIGASURE (Group B).
