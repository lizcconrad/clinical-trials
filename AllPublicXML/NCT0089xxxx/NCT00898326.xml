      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with prostate cancer after
      receiving implant radiation therapy and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist may
      help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer and help doctors predict how patients will
      respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at PSA levels and biopsy samples after undergoing
      implant radiation therapy and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy in
      patients with stage I or stage II prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To analyze biopsy results at 36 months after permanent iodine I 125 implantation therapy
           and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy for patients with
           untreated intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients received luteinizing hormone releasing-hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy and
      permanent iodine I 125 implantation on protocol JUSMH-BRI-GU05-01.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection and tissue biopsy for biomarker/laboratory analysis
      at 36 months after receiving brachytherapy and releasing-hormone agonist therapy. PSA levels
      and biopsy results are compared.
