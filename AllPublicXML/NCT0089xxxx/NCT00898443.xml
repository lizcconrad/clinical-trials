        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 1-3 postpartum women desiring Postpartum
             Bilateral Tubal Ligation (PPBTL) for infertility

          -  Functional epidural catheter placed for labor and delivery analgesia

          -  The epidural is still taped within 1cm of the original depth when it was functional
             for labor analgesia

          -  1-45 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  ASA 4 status

          -  History of dural puncture (&quot;wet tap&quot;) during initial epidural catheter insertion

          -  History of marginal or inadequate epidural analgesia for labor

          -  Cesarean section for delivery

          -  Examination demonstrates that the indwelling catheter has migrated more than 1 cm from
             the original depth when secured

          -  The end of indwelling epidural catheter appears to have not been capped appropriately
             or the cap was not maintained intact

          -  Prolonged sensory or motor block, bladder or anal sphincter dysfunction, nerve damage,
             inability to ambulate, post-dural puncture headache (PDHD), or seizures, during or
             after delivery and following cessation of the epidural catheter dosing

          -  Pseudocholinesterase deficiency

          -  Allergy to NesacaineÂ® (chloroprocaine) or lidocaine

          -  General anesthesia provided for delivery

          -  History of substance abuse disorder

          -  History of major psychiatric disorder

          -  Non-English reading/speaking participants
