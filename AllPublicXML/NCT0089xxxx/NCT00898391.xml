    <textblock>
      This research trial studies is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in blood samples from patients
      with neuroblastoma. Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may
      help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Perform in a blind study a multicentric study by analyzing serum from patients at
      diagnosis (with a known tumor v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene neuroblastoma
      derived homolog (MYCN) status determined in the Children's Oncology Group [COG] reference
      lab), in order to confirm our previous data and to define the most appropriate MYCN/control
      ratio cutoff capable of determining positive and negative cases.

      II. Define the limits of the procedure in non-metastatic patients and in those with reduced
      tumor burden (International Neuroblastoma Staging System [INSS] stage 1 and 2).

      OUTLINE:

      Circulating DNA is extracted from serum. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of
      MYCN is performed and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Real-time quantitative PCR is
      also performed.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Serum samples from neuroblastoma (NB) patients obtained through the COG (and legacy
             Children's Cancer Group [CCG]/Pediatric Oncology Group [POG] Biology Studies)

               -  The MYCN status on corresponding tumors have been determined using standard
                  techniques; the panel of samples must be obtained from NB patients with and
                  without MYCN amplification tumors

          -  Cases will be drawn from clinical subsets at greatest likelihood to benefit from this
             testing ability, stage 1 and 2 NBs (both infants and toddlers), stage 4 patients under
             18 months of age, and 4S patients
