  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outcome for children with high-grade gliomas and diffuse intrinsic brainstem gliomas
      remains poor despite the use of multi-modal therapy with surgery, radiation therapy and
      chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Novel therapies are needed to improve the outcome of these children. Recent studies have
      demonstrated very promising results of treatment with bevacizumab/irinotecan in patients with
      recurrent high grade gliomas. Based on these promising results, and the tolerability of the
      irinotecan and bevacizumab in children with recurrent CNS malignancies both anecdotally and
      in a study conducted by the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, we have designed a novel study
      incorporating concurrent radiation therapy with bevacizumab ± temozolomide followed by
      bevacizumab, irinotecan ±temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas and
      diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas.
