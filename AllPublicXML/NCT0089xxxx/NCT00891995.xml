  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if very tight blood glucose control from the onset
      of Type 1 Diabetes can preserve beta cell function. Study subjects will be randomly assigned
      to receive either standard diabetes management or intensive diabetes management, which
      involves several days of closed loop therapy followed by home use of a continuous glucose
      monitor and insulin pump.

      The specific aim of this study is to determine if early restoration of metabolic control will
      improve C-peptide production compared to children receiving routine diabetes management and
      the secondary aim is to determine if allowing the islet cells to be less metabolically active
      will have an impact on the underlying autoimmune process.

      Following completion of the baseline procedures (Mixed Meal Tolerance Test and blood sample
      collection), participants are randomized to either the Standard Treatment Group or the
      Intensive Treatment Group which includes 4-6 days of inpatient closed loop therapy followed
      by outpatient use of an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor for diabetes management.

      All subjects will be seen 7 times in the first year and 4 times in the second year for
      follow-up testing. Subjects who are still producing insulin after 2 years may be asked to
      return every 6 months for an additional 2 years.

    <description>In the primary analysis of the 12-month Mixed-Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT) results, the geometric mean (95% C.I.) of C-peptide average AUC (=AUC/time) was 0.43 (0.34, 0.52) pmol/ml in the intensive treatment group and 0.52 (0.32, 0.75) pmol/ml in the usual care group (P=0.49).</description>

    <description>Outcome measure in the table is the incidence of 2 hour peak C-peptide&gt;=0.2 pmol/ml. Since the formal clinical trial stopped at 12 months due to lack of efficiency (later follow-up were used to collect data for secondary analyses by pooling the two groups), only the outcome at 12 months are reported.</description>

These indices were calculated by giving equal weight to each of the 24 h of the day. At least 24 h of CGM data were required for calculating these indices.</description>
