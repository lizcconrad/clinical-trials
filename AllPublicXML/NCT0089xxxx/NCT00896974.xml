  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is looking at 9cUAB30 in healthy participants. Studying samples of blood
      and urine from healthy participants may help doctors learn more about how 9cUAB30 is used by
      the body.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the single-dose pharmacokinetics of 9cUAB30 in healthy volunteers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicities of this drug in these participants. II. To correlate the
      pharmacokinetics with the toxicity of this drug in these participants.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive a single dose of oral 9cUAB30 on day 1. Blood and urine samples are
      collected at baseline, periodically on day 1, and then on day 8 for pharmacokinetic studies
      by high performance liquid chromatography.

      After completion of treatment, participants are followed at days 8 and 30.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Single dose pharmacokinetics of 9cUAB30</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 18, 20, and 24 hours, and day 8</time_frame>
    <description>Scatterplots will be used to explore possible associations. Jonckheere-Terpstra trend test will be performed to determine the significance of the association between increasing dose level and each of the pharmacokinetic parameters. A Spearman rank correlation analysis will be performed to determine the relationship between actual dose administered and the pharmacokinetic parameters. Additionally, logistic regression analyses will be performed to correlate PK parameters with toxicity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grade II or greater toxicities assessed using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patient toxicity will be summarized in several ways; the presence or absence of any toxicities, worst CTCAE grade, and strongest investigator-defined relationship will all be examined and characterized by dose. The different pharmacokinetic measures will be correlated with toxicity measures with polyserial correlation, a method for estimating the correlation between a continuous variable and an ordinal variable whose underlying distribution is continuous.</description>
