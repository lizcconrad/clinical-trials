      Specific Aim 1: To determine the effects of treatment with quetiapine or lithium on brain
      activation in adolescents. The investigators will use functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) to examine brain activation during an attentional task.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the effects of treatment with quetiapine or lithium on
      neurometabolite measures, early in their illness course. The investigators will use 1H-MRS to
      identify myo-inositol (mI), N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), and glutamate (Glu) levels in
      prefrontal ALN regions.

      Specific Aim 3: To determine the relationships among the changes in brain activation and
      neurometabolite measures, as well as symptomatic improvement in manic adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypotheses 1 &amp; 2 predict that following 6 weeks of treatment with lithium or quetiapine,
      manic adolescents who demonstrate symptomatic improvement will exhibit normalized (decreased)
      VLPFC and ACC activation and increased activation of compensatory posterior attentional brain
      areas as well as normalization of VLPFC and ACC neurometabolite measures (increased NAA and
      decreased Glu levels) compared with those who do not experience symptomatic improvement and
      healthy adolescents.

      Hypothesis 3 predicts significant associations between fMRI activation changes (i.e.
      decreased activation in VLPFC and ACC ROIs and increased activation in the posterior
      attention ROI) and MRS changes (increases in NAA and decreases in Glu levels in the VLPFC and
      ACC) for patients who exhibit symptomatic improvement with either treatment.

      Hypothesis 4 predicts that decreases in mI levels at 1 week will be associated with lithium,
      but not quetiapine, response at endpoint.

      In contrast, Hypothesis 5 predicts higher baseline Cho levels will be associated with
      quetiapine, but not lithium, response at endpoint.

        Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

        Inclusion - Bipolar Disorder Subjects:

          -  DSM-IV-TR12 criteria for bipolar disorder, type I, manic or mixed episode, diagnosed
             by the Washington University in St. Louis Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and
             Schizophrenia (WASH-U-KSADS)166,101,102-103,104-105,108

          -  Baseline YMRS112-114 score &gt; 20;

          -  Ages 12-17 years 11 months old;

          -  Fluent in English;

          -  Provision of written informed consent by a legal guardian and written assent by the
             subject;

          -  Tanner scale stages III-V167, in order to include only post-pubescent subjects and
             minimize brain changes associated with the onset of puberty;168-169

          -  Less than 2 years from onset of bipolar disorder, defined by age at onset of first
             DSM-IV-TR affective episode (mania, hypomania, depression or mixed), to establish that
             our sample is early in their illness course;

          -  No prior psychiatric hospitalizations, &lt;3 months of lifetime psychotropic medication
             exposure (with the exception of psychostimulants, since excluding patients with
             psychostimulant exposure would significantly limit the generalizability of our
             findings), and no active psychotropic medication during the week (72 hours for
             psychostimulants and benzodiazepines) prior to the index assessment (no treatment with
             fluoxetine during the prior month). Please note that patients will NOT be taken off
             medications for the purpose of this study; instead, this criterion is to exclude
             subjects receiving treatment at the time of index assessment;

          -  Does not have a history of intolerance or non-response to lithium or quetiapine;

          -  Manic or depressive symptoms do not result entirely from acute medical illness or
             acute intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol as determined by medical
             evaluation and rapid symptom resolution;

          -  No lifetime DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), since PTSD
             has been associated with abnormalities in prefrontal NAA and function170-171,172.
             Furthermore, bipolar patients with co-occurring PTSD are less likely to respond to
             lithium monotherapy, and often need a serotonin specific reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) as
             adjunctive treatment to a mood stabilizer.173,174 ;

          -  If female and of child bearing potential, agrees to use one of the following method of
             birth control: complete abstinence from sexual intercourse, barrier (diaphragm or
             condom), or oral/injectable contraceptive.

        Inclusion - Healthy Controls:

          -  Ages of 12-17 years and 11 month;

          -  No history of any DSM-IV-TR Axis I disorder (nicotine dependence is permitted);

          -  No first- or second-degree relatives with an affective or psychotic disorder;

          -  No medications with central nervous system effects within 5 half-lives;

          -  Fluent in English;

          -  Tanner stage III-V;

          -  Provision of informed consent and assent.

        Exclusion - Bipolar Subjects &amp; Healthy Controls:

          -  Contraindication to an MRI scan (e.g., braces or claustrophobia);

          -  An unstable medical or neurological illness that could influence fMRI or MRS results;

          -  IQ &lt; 70, as determined by The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) ;

          -  A positive pregnancy test;

          -  A history of major medical or neurological illness or a significant episode (&gt; 10
             minutes) of loss of consciousness;

          -  Any lifetime DSM-IV-TR substance use disorder (nicotine dependence is permitted);

          -  A lifetime DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of any pervasive developmental disorder;

          -  The patient lives &gt;100 miles from the University of Cincinnati or is not able to
             attend follow-up visits.
