          <description>Participants received tacrolimus (extended-release formulation not permitted) within 30 days of transplant, dosed according to center’s standard of care. At 3-5 months post-transplant, participants were randomized, tacrolimus was discontinued (withdrawal was to be completed within 2 weeks [maximum of 4 weeks] of sirolimus initiation) and participants received sirolimus tablets, orally, at a dose to achieve trough levels of 7-15 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) during the first year post-transplant, then 5-15 ng/mL. Participants remained on an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor (mycophenolate mofetil [MMF] or mycophenolate sodium [MPS]; switching between the two was permitted). Corticosteroids were maintained at a minimum of 2.5 milligrams per day (mg/day) of prednisone (or equivalent); withdrawal was prohibited after randomization. Participants received study drug during the post-randomization period for up to a maximum of 18 months post-transplant.</description>

At 3-5 months post-transplant, participants were randomized, tacrolimus was discontinued (withdrawal was to be completed within 2 weeks [maximum of 4 weeks] of sirolimus initiation) and participants received sirolimus tablets, orally, at a dose to achieve trough levels of 7-15 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) during the first year post-transplant, then 5-15 ng/mL.

Corticosteroids were maintained at a minimum of 2.5 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent); withdrawal was prohibited after randomization. Participants received study drug during the post-randomization period for up to a maximum of 18 months post-transplant.</description>

Graft loss was defined as physical loss (nephrectomy or retransplantation), functional loss (requiring dialysis for greater than or equal to [≥]56 days with no return of graft function), or death.</description>

          <description>Biopsy-confirmed acute rejection was defined according to updated Banff criteria (2007) for renal allograft rejection. Graft loss was defined as physical loss (nephrectomy or retransplantation), functional loss (requiring dialysis for greater than or equal to [≥]56 days with no return of graft function), or death.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With BCAR by Severity of First BCAR and Time of Onset From Post-Randomization to 6, 12, 18, and 24 Months Post-Transplant</title>
        <description>BCAR was categorized as antibody-mediated (AM) or T-cell. AM BCAR severity was graded as Grade I (mild), Grade II (moderate), and Grade III (severe). T-cell BCAR severity was graded as 'Grade Ia, Ib (mild), Grade IIa, IIb (moderate), and Grade III (severe). If a participant had both T-cell BCAR and antibody-mediated BCAR on the first rejection, the participant was counted in each category.</description>

            <description>Participants received tacrolimus (extended-release formulation not permitted) within 30 days of transplant, dosed according to center’s standard of care. At 3-5 months post-transplant, participants were randomized, tacrolimus was discontinued (withdrawal was to be completed within 2 weeks [maximum of 4 weeks] of sirolimus initiation) and participants received sirolimus tablets, orally, at a dose to achieve trough levels of 7-15 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) during the first year post-transplant, then 5-15 ng/mL. Participants remained on an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor (mycophenolate mofetil [MMF] or mycophenolate sodium [MPS]; switching between the two was permitted). Corticosteroids were maintained at a minimum of 2.5 milligrams per day (mg/day) of prednisone (or equivalent); withdrawal was prohibited after randomization. Participants received study drug during the post-randomization period for up to a maximum of 18 months post-transplant.</description>

At 3-5 months post-transplant, participants were randomized, tacrolimus was discontinued (withdrawal was to be completed within 2 weeks [maximum of 4 weeks] of sirolimus initiation) and participants received sirolimus tablets, orally, at a dose to achieve trough levels of 7-15 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) during the first year post-transplant, then 5-15 ng/mL. Participants remained on an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor (mycophenolate mofetil [MMF] or mycophenolate sodium [MPS]; switching between the two was permitted). Corticosteroids were maintained at a minimum of 2.5 milligrams per day (mg/day) of prednisone (or equivalent); withdrawal was prohibited after randomization. Participants received study drug during the post-randomization period for up to a maximum of 18 months post-transplant.</description>

At 3-5 months post-transplant, participants were randomized, tacrolimus was discontinued (withdrawal was to be completed within 2 weeks [maximum of 4 weeks] of sirolimus initiation) and participants received sirolimus tablets, orally, at a dose to achieve trough levels of 7-15 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) during the first year post-transplant, then 5-15 ng/mL. Participants remained on an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor (mycophenolate mofetil [MMF] or mycophenolate sodium [MPS]; switching between the two was permitted). Corticosteroids were maintained at a minimum of 2.5 milligrams per day (mg/day) of prednisone (or equivalent); withdrawal was prohibited after randomization.

At 3-5 months post-transplant, participants were randomized and tacrolimus continued. Participants remained on an IMPDH inhibitor (MMF or MPS; switching between the two was permitted). Corticosteroids were maintained at a minimum of 2.5 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent); withdrawal was prohibited after randomization. Participants received study drug during the post-randomization period for up to a maximum of 18 months post-transplant.</description>

At 3-5 months post-transplant, participants were randomized, tacrolimus was discontinued (withdrawal was to be completed within 2 weeks [maximum of 4 weeks] of sirolimus initiation) and participants received sirolimus tablets, orally, at a dose to achieve trough levels of 7-15 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) during the first year post-transplant, then 5-15 ng/mL. Participants remained on an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor (mycophenolate mofetil [MMF] or mycophenolate sodium [MPS]; switching between the two was permitted). Corticosteroids were maintained at a minimum of 2.5 milligrams per day (mg/day) of prednisone (or equivalent); withdrawal was prohibited after randomization. Participants received study drug during the post-randomization period for up to a maximum of 18 months post-transplant.</description>
