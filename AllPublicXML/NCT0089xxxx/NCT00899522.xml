      RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of tumor tissue from patients with Fanconi anemia
      to test in the laboratory may help the study of cancer in the future.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is collecting and storing tumor tissue samples from patients
      with Fanconi anemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Acquire rare solid tumor samples from patients with Fanconi anemia in order to create a
           Fanconi Anemia Cell Repository at the Oregon Health and Science University Cancer
           Institute.

        -  Study repository tissue using a variety of molecular methods, including gene
           microarrays.

        -  Develop cancer cell lines that are publicly available from tissue archived from patients
           with Fanconi anemia.

      OUTLINE: Tumor biopsies are collected from patients with Fanconi anemia and archived for
      future molecular studies, cell line generation, and general usage by the research community
      at large. Medical information about the patient's cancer is also archived.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified.

    <description>Once the pathologist has taken the material needed to establish diagnosis of cancer, the anonymized snap-frozen and fresh samples will be either shipped to our laboratory for analysis or will be picked up by a member of the principal investigator's lab team. Samples will be stored indefinitely.</description>
