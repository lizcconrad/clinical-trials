    <textblock>
      Control of body weight (BW) is important to prevent and manage type 2 diabetes. Regardless of
      the close association, little is understood about the precise relationship between BW and
      glycemic control, which might be of benefit for patients with type 2 diabetes. The
      researchers investigated the correlation between changes in BW and glycemic control in
      patients with type 2 diabetes treated with a diet therapy or pioglitazone.

    <description>The investigators analyzed the recorded data (body weight and glycohemoglobin) of 70 type 2 diabetic patients treated with the diet therapy. Recorded values at 0, 2 and 4 months for body weight (BW) and glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) were used. And changes from baseline (0 month) in BW (ΔBW) were plotted against those of HbA1c (ΔHbA1c).</description>

    <description>The investigators analyzed the recorded data (body weight and glycohemoglobin) of 23 type 2 diabetic patients treated with pioglitazone. Recorded values at 0, 2 and 4 months for body weight (BW)and glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) were used. And changes from baseline (0 month) in BW (ΔBW) were plotted against those of HbA1c (ΔHbA1c).</description>
