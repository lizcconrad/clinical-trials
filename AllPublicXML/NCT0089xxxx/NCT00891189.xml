  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a disease that affects the lungs. Symptoms include repeated episodes of wheezing,
      breathlessness, chest tightness, and nighttime or early morning coughing. Some people with
      asthma experience worse symptoms at night, which is known as nocturnal asthma (NA). The
      reason for the decline in lung function at night in some asthmatics is not well understood,
      but it may be linked to the human biological clock, which controls daily activity and sleep
      rhythms. To determine whether differences in biological clocks relate to worsening nocturnal
      lung function, this study will evaluate the circadian rhythms of people with NA, people with
      non-nocturnal asthma, and healthy people.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nocturnal worsening of asthma, frequently called NA, is a common problem among some people
      with asthma and one that leads to increased morbidity and mortality. It is still unknown why
      lung function worsens at night in some asthmatics and not others. There is a possible
      relationship between NA, biological clocks, and circadian rhythms, but more research is
      needed to understand this relationship. Although the diurnal nature of NA has been shown
      repeatedly in studies, circadian rhythms have not yet been implicated as a related factor.
      This study will examine the pathophysiology of NA as it relates to circadian biology and will
      specifically explore physiological and molecular aspects.

      This study will include people with asthma, people with NA, and healthy people. Potential
      participants will attend a screening visit to assess general health and severity of asthma,
      if present. They will also complete 2 weeks of diary recordings of their daily symptoms and
      airway function.

      Eligible participants will then attend two study visits. The first study visit will last 1
      hour and may include a methacholine challenge and bronchodilator testing, both of which will
      measure lung function. For 2 weeks before the second study visit, participants will keep
      records of their sleep patterns. The second study visit will be a hospital stay that will
      last for 2.5 days. While in the hospital, participants will undergo periodic blood draws and
      lung function testing. During waking hours, participants will remain quietly awake. During
      the first night, participants will be monitored while they sleep. During the second night,
      participants will stay awake for 28 hours, which will continue into the third day. Then, on
      the third day, participants will sleep for 8 hours while again being monitored. Upon waking,
      participants will be given a regular meal and discharged.

        Inclusion Criteria for People with Asthma:

          -  A physician diagnosis of asthma, consistent clinical history, and either 1) airway
             hyperresponsiveness indicated by a 20% or greater decrease in forced expiratory volume
             at one second (FEV1) in response to inhalation of methacholine at 8 mg/mL or less, or
             2) bronchodilator-responsive expiratory airflow limitation (if FEV1 less than 70% of
             predicted value or less than 1.5 L, improving at least 200 mL and 12% in response to
             180 Î¼g of albuterol aerosol). Patients with NA should meet the above criteria and
             demonstrate an overnight decrease in peak flow of 20% or greater on at least four of
             seven nights at home.
