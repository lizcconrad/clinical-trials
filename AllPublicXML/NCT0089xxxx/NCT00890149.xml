    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of ondansetron + BASICS Plus in reducing severe or
      binge drinking among emerging adults. BASIC Plus (Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention
      for College Students) has been the most validated brief intervention among college students.
      The BASICS program provides personal feedback, motivation, and strategies that enhance
      normative drinking patterns

  <detailed_description>

      We propose to conduct a 9 week study to test the efficacy of ondansetron in a heavy drinking
      (non-dependent) emerging adult population. We will enroll individuals between the ages of 18
      and 25 years as this period overlaps with the general population of those attending college
      and who can be defined as emerging adults. We will conduct a double-blind control study in
      which 150 individuals will be randomized into 2 groups, therefore the N will be 300.
