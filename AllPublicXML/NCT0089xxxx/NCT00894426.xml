      The aim of this study is to assess the perception of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) patients in symptoms related to morning activities. Also the researchers investigated
      how to describe the impact of symptoms on sleep quality and how to use the medication in
      Korea COPD treatments.
