    <textblock>
      Getting old is a process of transformation of the body that occurs along the vital cycle in a
      universal and progressive way causing functional restrictions in the human being. The aim of
      this work was to identify, analyze and quantify the limitations of the functional capacity of
      the institutionalized elderly who are not provided with physiotherapic assistance.

      A descriptive, qualitative, quantitative and transverse field research was made, based on an
      evaluation of the activities of daily living (ADL) using the Katz Index, with 62
      institutionalized elderly people from Casa do Pobre de Maceió, Alagoas, both genders, average
      age of 77.03 years old and different levels of functions. Activities related to the self care
      were emphasized. At first, people were classified as independent, partially dependent and
      totally dependent. According to the Katz Index score, they were classified regarding their
      functional dependency, which varies from level 0 (a totally independent person) to level 6 (a
      totally dependent person in the six evaluated functions).

    <description>An evaluation (questionnaire) was performed by the Katz Index of individuals in this group, including personal issues (sex and age) and different levels of functional independence for the elderly in their basic activities of daily living (ABVD's) such as: bathe, dress, use the bathroom for withdrawals, transfers perform, has control of the sphincters and the food itself. Subject themselves, if capable of responding to the issues of consistency index, did. The answers were given to the auxiliary nurse responsible for care to residents.</description>
