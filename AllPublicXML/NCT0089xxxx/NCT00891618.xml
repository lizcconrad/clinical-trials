      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving acupuncture to patients with
      lymphoma or a plasma cell dyscrasia can help to relieve numbness and/or tingling of the feet
      and/or hands that is related to chemotherapy.

      Acupuncture:

      Acupuncture involves the insertion of small, solid, sterile needles into specific points on
      the skin. In this study, the needles are placed in areas that are intended to help relieve
      numbness and tingling of the feet and hands. Weak electrical stimulation is also applied to
      the needles to try to improve the treatment effects of the acupuncture.

      Acupuncture Sessions:

      Your first acupuncture session will be on the same day as the tests described above, if
      possible. (If not, it will be scheduled for another day that will be no more than about 10
      days after the screening visit.)

      You will have an acupuncture session 3 times per week for 4 weeks (Weeks 1-4). You will then
      have 1 week off (Week 5). After that, you will have an acupuncture session twice per week for
      4 more weeks (Weeks 6-10). This is a total of 20 sessions. In addition to the 20 planned
      sessions, you may also choose to receive an optional 21st acupuncture session at the
      end-of-study visit that is scheduled for Week 13.

      For each session, you will be placed in a comfortable position and the study
      doctor/acupuncturist will find points on your body where the needles will be placed. All
      study participants will have the needles placed at the same points on the body (the hands,
      feet, legs, abdomen, and scalp).

      Very thin, solid, sterile, stainless steel needles will be used. All of the needles are
      specially made for acupuncture. The depth of the needle in the skin and the number of needles
      used is based on standard acupuncture procedures. The needles will remain in place for about
      20-30 minutes.

      Electrical stimulation will be added to some of the needles on the feet and hands. This
      involves placing wires on the needles, which are connected to a machine that delivers a weak
      electrical current through the wires. The strength of the electrical current will be changed
      slowly until it is at a comfortable level for you.

      Study Procedures:

      At each session, before you receive the acupuncture, the following procedures will be
      performed:

        -  Your vital signs will be measured.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may be
           experiencing.

        -  The color and coating of your tongue and the quality of your pulse will be recorded.

      Once a week, you will also be asked to complete the same 3 questionnaires as you did at the
      beginning of the study.

      Most study visits will last about 1 hour. On the weeks that you complete the questionnaires,
      it may add about 15-20 minutes.

      During the study, you may still receive your regular pain treatments. If you are receiving
      Neurontin (gabapentin), Cymbalta (duloxetine), and/or Lyrica (pregabalin), you must stay on
      the same drug(s) until you go off this study. Minor changes in the doses of your pain
      treatments are allowed, but if there is a large change, you will be taken off study early.

      Length of Study Participation:

      You may receive up to 21 acupuncture sessions over 13 weeks. If intolerable side effects or
      symptoms occur, you will be taken off study early.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      At Week 13, or if you go off study early for any reason, you will have an end-of-study visit.
      If the doctor thinks it is necessary, the following procedures will be performed:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  Your vital signs will be measured.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects you may have
           experienced.

        -  You will complete the same 3 questionnaires as before.

        -  The 4 nerve tests will be repeated in order to learn if there have been any changes in
           your nerve function.

        -  Your tongue and pulse will be evaluated.

      After the end-of-study visit, your participation in this study will be over.

      This is an investigational study. The acupuncture needles used in this study are commercially
      available and FDA approved. It is considered experimental, however, to use acupuncture to
      treat numbness and/or tingling in the feet and/or hands that is related to chemotherapy.

      Up to 30 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at The University of
      Texas (UT) MD Anderson Cancer Center.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients, or the legal guardians of patients, must have the ability to understand
             English, sign a written informed consent document, and be willing to follow protocol
             requirements.

          2. Age &gt; 18 years and have a diagnosis of a plasma cell dyscrasia or lymphoma.

          3. Patients must have neuropathy greater or equal to 2 according to Common Terminology
             Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 3.0 scale in spite of previous treatment
             with Neurontin, Cymbalta and/or Lyrica. Patients receiving any of these drugs must
             remain on the same medications throughout the study period; however, minor adjustments
             in dosage are allowed. Patients will be removed from the study if a change in type of
             medication is necessary. All patients will receive treatment to both upper and lower
             extremities, regardless of whether or not they are experiencing symptoms in all four
             extremities.)

          4. The patient's previous chemotherapy treatment must have included thalidomide and/or
             bortezomib and/or any derivatives.

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2.

          6. If the patient is a woman of child-bearing potential, she must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test and agree to use contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current active treatment with thalidomide and/or bortezomib.

          2. Local infection at or near the acupuncture site. (Although acupuncture is a minimally
             invasive procedure, patients will be excluded if there is an indication of infection.)

          3. Deformities that could interfere with accurate acupuncture point location or out of
             energy pathway as defined by traditional acupuncture theory.

          4. Concurrent use of other alternative medicines such as herbal agents, high dose
             vitamins and anticoagulation agents.

          5. Known coagulopathy and taking heparin (including low molecular weight heparin) or
             Coumadin at any dose. Patients on aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatories will be

          7. White Blood Counts (WBCs) &lt; 3.0 K/UL.

          8. Active central nervous system (CNS) disease. (The action for acupuncture may be
             associated with central nervous system activity, and patients with CNS pathology may

          9. Cardiac pacemaker.

         10. Mental incapacitation or significant emotional or psychological disorder that, in the

             to cooperate with this slightly invasive procedure or with the data collection
             process.)

         11. Currently pregnant or lactating females. (Certain acupuncture applications have been
             reported to stimulate uterine contractions and may alter lactation.)

         12. Chronic alcohol use as clinically estimated by the patient's physician.

         13. History of diabetic neuropathy or neuropathy related to HIV.

         14. Previous acupuncture treatment for any indication within 30 days of enrollment.

         15. Active treatment for lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or multiple myeloma.

Severity of neuropathy measured by FACT-GOG-Ntx total score assessment where 11-item questionnaire 5 point rating scale (0=“not at all” and 4=equals “very much”). FACT/GOG-Ntx Total Score ranges from 0 (best possible outcome) to 44 (worst possible outcome).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to Week 13. Assessments at baseline, once per week during the two treatment phases of the study, and one month (week 13) after the last acupuncture treatment.</time_frame>
        <population>Participants were excluded from primary outcome if did not complete follow up assessments.</population>
