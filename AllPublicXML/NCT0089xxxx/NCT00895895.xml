  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug called SAM-531 at
      three dosage levels. Subjects will receive either one of the 3 dosage levels of SAM-531,
      donepezil or placebo for the first 24 weeks of the study (period I). Subjects who receive
      placebo for period I will be assigned to receive the highest dose of SAM-531 SAM-531 for the
      remaining 28 weeks of the study, while subjects who received one of the three SAM-531 dosage
      levels or donepezil in period I will continue with the same study drug (period II).

      The study was stopped (date of termination was 13April2011) due to a 6 month interim
      analysis: all of the 3 SAM-531 dosage levels were declared futile. There were no safety
      concerns.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition (ADAS-Cog) Total Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>14-item scale to assess severity of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's Disease. Items: word recall, naming objects and fingers, following commands, constructional praxis, ideational praxis, orientation, word recognition, recall of test instructions, spoken language ability, word-finding difficulty, comprehension of spoken language, concentration/distractibility, number cancellation and executive maze. Rating scale ranged from 0 (not present) to 5 (severe). Total score was sum of individual scores (items 1-11) and ranged from 0 to 70 with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) Total Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>Caregiver interview-based instrument assessing 10 areas of activities of daily living (ADL) to measure participant’s actual performance over the previous 2 weeks. Items included hygiene, dressing, continence, eating, meal preparation, telephoning, outings, finance/correspondence, medications and leisure/housework. Responses scored as 1 (yes) or 0 (no), response of “Not Applicable” was not scored. Total DAD score was sum of scores for 40 items, expressed as a percentage of the number of items answered yes or no. Total score ranged from 0 to 100, higher scores represented less disability in ADL.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CANTAB Spatial Working Memory (SWM) - Between Errors (4 Boxes) at Week 24</title>
        <description>CANTAB-SWM assessed participant’s retention of spatial information, ability to manipulate remembered items and strategize. Participant asked to find tokens in on-screen boxes, move them. Difficulty ranged 4-8 boxes to assess, 2 trials per assessment. Between errors: number of times participant revisited a box where a token previously found. In 4 box assessments the maximum number of errors per trial was 20. Test ended with 20 errors in a trial. Less than 20 errors in both trials the participant went to the next level of difficulty. Scores ranged from 0 to 39. Lower scores: better performance.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CANTAB SWM - Between Errors (8 Boxes) at Week 24</title>
        <description>CANTAB-SWM assessed participant’s retention of spatial information, ability to manipulate remembered items and strategize. Participant asked to find tokens in on-screen boxes, move them. Difficulty ranged 4-8 boxes to assess, 2 trials per assessment. Between errors: number of times participant revisited a box where a token previously found. In 8 box assessments the maximum number of errors per trial was 40. Test ended with 40 errors in a trial. Less than 40 errors in both trials the participant went to the next level of difficulty. Scores ranged from 0 to 79. Lower scores: better performance.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CANTAB SWM Strategy at Week 24</title>
        <description>CANTAB-SWM assessed participant’s ability to strategize. Participant was asked to find tokens in on-screen boxes and move them. Difficulty ranged from 4 to 8 box assessments, 2 trials per assessment. Strategy score was the number of unique boxes the participant searched in the two 6 and 8 box trials. 6 box trial scores ranged from 1 (1 box searched for all 6 tokens) to 6 (6 boxes searched for 6 tokens). 8 box trial score ranged from 1 (1 box searched) to 8 (8 boxes searched for 8 tokens). Total of the 4 trial scores ranged from 4 to 28. Lower score indicated better performance.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CANTAB Pattern Recognition Memory (PRM)-Mean Correct Latency at Week 24</title>
        <description>CANTAB-PRM assessed participant’s visual pattern recognition memory in a 2-choice forced discrimination paradigm. Participants presented with a series of 12 visual patterns singly. In recognition phase, participants were required to choose between a pattern previously seen and a novel pattern. Patterns in the recognition phase appeared sequentially in reverse order on the screen. Assessment was repeated with 12 new patterns. Latency in correct responses ranged from 0 to infinity millisecond (msec), lower scores indicated better performance.</description>

        <description>CANTAB-PRM assessed participant’s visual pattern recognition memory in a 2-choice forced discrimination paradigm. Participants presented with a series of 12 visual patterns singly. In recognition phase, participants were required to choose between a pattern previously seen and a novel pattern. Patterns in the recognition phase appeared sequentially in reverse order on the screen. Assessment was repeated with 12 new patterns. Correct response total expressed as a percentage, ranged from 0 to 100, higher scores indicated better performance.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CANTAB Reaction Time (RTI) Five-Choice Accuracy at Week 24</title>
        <description>CANTAB-RTI assessed participant’s reaction, movement time and vigilance during a 5-choice reaction time trial and to measure anticipatory/premature and perseverative responses. In the trial, a yellow spot appeared on a computer screen in 1 of 5 locations, the participant responded by letting go of a press pad and touching the screen where the spot appeared. 5-Choice Accuracy was the total number of trials where participant responded correctly. Total ranged from 0 to 30, higher score indicated better performance.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in CANTAB Reaction Time (RTI) Five-Choice Accuracy at Week 24</title>
          <description>CANTAB-RTI assessed participant’s reaction, movement time and vigilance during a 5-choice reaction time trial and to measure anticipatory/premature and perseverative responses. In the trial, a yellow spot appeared on a computer screen in 1 of 5 locations, the participant responded by letting go of a press pad and touching the screen where the spot appeared. 5-Choice Accuracy was the total number of trials where participant responded correctly. Total ranged from 0 to 30, higher score indicated better performance.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CANTAB RTI Five-Choice Reaction Time at Week 24</title>
        <description>CANTAB-RTI assessed participant’s reaction, movement time and vigilance during 5-choice reaction time trial and also measured anticipatory/premature responses. In the test, a yellow spot appeared on a computer screen in 1 of 5 locations, the participant responded by letting go of a press pad and touching the screen where the spot appeared. 5-Choice Reaction Time was the time from appearance of yellow spot on computer screen to time to release press pad in trials the participant responded correctly. Total ranged from 100 to 5100 (maximum allowed) msec, lower score indicated better performance.</description>

In the test, 1 yellow spot appeared on a computer screen in 1 location, the participant responded by letting go of a press pad and touching the screen where the spot appeared. Simple Movement Time was the time from release of press pad to touch the screen where the spot had been in trials the participant responded correctly.

        <title>Change From Baseline in CANTAB RTI Simple Reaction Time at Week 24</title>
        <description>CANTAB-RTI assessed participant’s reaction, movement time and vigilance during simple (1 choice) reaction time trial and also measured anticipatory/premature responses. In the test, 1 yellow spot appeared on a computer screen in 1 location, the participant responded by letting go of a press pad and touching the screen where the spot appeared. Simple Reaction Time was the time from appearance of yellow spot on computer screen to time to release press pad in trials the participant responded correctly. Total ranged from 100 to 5100 (maximum allowed) msec, lower score indicated better performance.</description>
