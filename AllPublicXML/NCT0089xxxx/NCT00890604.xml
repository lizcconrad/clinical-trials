  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When fever is present in patients with stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or brain
      hemorrhage, it has been associated with worse outcomes including larger areas of tissue
      death, increased length of stay, worse degree of coma, lower ability to function, and higher
      mortality. Both adult and pediatric TBI national guidelines state that maintenance of normal
      body temperature should be a standard of care. However, no further standards or options are
      presented to specifically guide practice. The current ischemic stroke guidelines state that
      fever should be treated with fever-reducing agents and offer &quot;cooling devices&quot; as an option
      but do not provide specifics to guide practice. Over 50% of patients in the Neurosurgical
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Harborview Medical Center develop fever during the course of
      their stay. With elevated temperatures the body consumes more oxygen than if the temperature
      was normal, causing less oxygen to be available to the brain. This may lead to injury of the
      brain cells and a diminished capacity for healing. Thus, temperature management in
      neurologically vulnerable patients is both a prevalent and problematic challenge. Based on
      this information the goal of the present proposal is to evaluate if 1) A standardized,
      step-wise approach to temperature management using a Normothermia Protocol is successful in
      achieving and maintaining normal temperature in Neurosurgical ICU patients; and 2) If
      maintenance of normal temperature will be associated with fewer episodes of diminished
      responsiveness in their neurological exams as evidenced by a measure of depth of coma, as
      measured by the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) compared to a control group treated according to
      usual care.
