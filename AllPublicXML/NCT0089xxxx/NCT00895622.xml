    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Sometimes a tumor may not need treatment until it progresses. In this case,
      observation may be sufficient. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of
      radiation directly to the tumor, such as 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy and
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy, may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to
      normal tissue. It is not yet known whether observation is more effective than radiation
      therapy in treating patients with meningioma.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying observation to see how well it works compared with
      radiation therapy in treating patients with grade I, grade II, or grade III meningioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To estimate the rates of progression-free survival at 3 years in patients with low-risk
           meningioma undergoing observation and in patients with intermediate- or high-risk
           meningioma undergoing radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To study the concordance, or lack thereof, between central and parent institution
           histopathologic diagnosis, grading, and subtyping.

        -  To estimate the rates of overall survival at 3 years in these patients.

        -  To estimate the incidence rates of acute and late adverse events ≥ grade 2 in patients
           with intermediate- or high-risk meningioma undergoing radiotherapy.

        -  To evaluate MRI imaging predictors by central neuroradiology review at diagnosis, at any
           failure, and at 3 years.

        -  To evaluate adherence to protocol-specific target and normal tissue radiotherapy
           parameters.

      This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups according to risk.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 3 years
      and then annually for 10 years.

    <measure>Progression-free Survival Rate at 3 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>From registration to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression was determined by central review of MRI exams and is defined as an increase in measurable tumor of greater than 20% in any diameter, or as new nodular enhancement in patients with no measurable tumor on initial postoperative imaging. In the absence of neurologic progression (NP), suspected imaging progression of less than 5 mm (maximum diameter) must be confirmed on two successive follow-up MRI studies, a minimum of 3 months apart. NP is defined as a new or progressive neurologic deficit attributed to the meningioma, with or without measurable meningioma growth. Progression-free survival (PFS) rates are estimated using the binomial method.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A histologically documented World Health Organization (WHO) grade I, II, or III
             meningioma, newly diagnosed or recurrent, and of any resection extent, confirmed by
             central pathology review. Patients are partitioned according to three groupings: Group
             I (low risk), Group II (intermediate risk), and Group III (high risk) as defined
             below:

               -  Group I (low risk): Patients with a newly diagnosed WHO grade I meningioma that
                  has been gross totally resected (Simpson's grade I, II, or III resections, with
                  no residual nodular enhancement on postoperative imaging) or subtotally resected
                  (residual nodular enhancement or Simpson grade IV or V excision). The extent of
                  resection will be based upon the neurosurgeons' assessment and postoperative MR
                  imaging.

               -  Group II (intermediate risk): Patients with a newly diagnosed gross totally
                  resected WHO grade II meningioma or patients with a recurrent WHO grade I
                  meningioma irrespective of the resection extent. Resection extent will be
                  recorded on the same basis described above for the low-risk group.

               -  Group III (high risk): Patients with a newly diagnosed or a recurrent WHO grade
                  III meningioma of any resection extent; patients with a recurrent WHO grade II
                  meningioma of any resection extent; or patients with a newly diagnosed subtotally
                  resected WHO grade II meningioma. In the setting of a newly diagnosed meningioma,
                  the histologic diagnosis must have been reached within 6 months of Step 2
                  registration. Resection extent will be recorded on the same basis described above
                  for the low-risk group.

               -  1.1 In the setting of a newly diagnosed meningioma, the histologic diagnosis must
                  have been reached within 24 weeks prior to Step 2 registration. In the setting of
                  a recurrent meningioma, there are no such time constraints. Additional resection
                  or biopsy is encouraged for patients with recurrence but is not requisite. If
                  further biopsy or resection is performed at recurrence, these specimens must be
                  submitted; submission of the original pathology specimens is encouraged but not
                  required. The diagnosis of recurrence solely on the basis of imaging findings is
                  permitted, but if no additional resection is performed, specimens from prior
                  resection must be submitted.

               -  1.2 In cases of newly diagnosed or surgically treated recurrent meningioma, the
                  operating neurosurgeon must provide a Simpson grade for the degree of resection.

          2. History/physical examination, including neurologic examination, within 8 weeks prior
             to Step 2 registration

          3. Zubrod Performance Status 0-1

          4. Age ≥ 18

          5. All patients must have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan within 12 weeks prior
             to Step 2 registration. Both preoperative and postoperative MRIs are required for all
             newly diagnosed patients in groups I, II, or III. In the setting of group II or III
             patients with recurrent/progressive meningioma and without recent surgery, a
             pre-operative study may not apply, although MRI documentation of recurrence or
             progression is required. MRIs must include precontrast T1, T2, and flair images and
             multiplanar (axial, sagittal, and coronal) postcontrast T1. The postoperative study
             must be completed within 12 weeks of surgery.

               -  5.1 Group I: All group I patients will have surgery. Preoperative and
                  postoperative MRIs are thus required in order to assess resection extent.

               -  5.2 Group II: Surgery will be undertaken for the subgroup with a gross totally
                  resected WHO grade II meningioma. For these patients preoperative and
                  postoperative MRIs are necessitated. For the other subgroup with recurrent WHO
                  grade I meningioma, preoperative and postoperative MRIs are required if surgery
                  is undertaken for the recurrent/progressive tumor. However, only the follow-up
                  imaging documenting recurrence or progression will apply if further surgery is
                  not completed.

               -  5.3 Group III: Surgery will be undertaken for the subgroup with a newly diagnosed
                  WHO grade III meningioma. For these patients preoperative and postoperative MRIs
                  are obligatory. For the subgroups with recurrent WHO grade II or III meningioma,
                  preoperative and postoperative MRIs are required if surgery is undertaken for the
                  recurrent/progressive tumor. However, only the follow-up imaging documenting
                  recurrence or progression will apply if further surgery is not completed.

          6. For woman of childbearing potential who are intermediate or high risk:

               -  6.1 Negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to Step 2 registration

               -  6.2 The patient must agree to practice adequate contraception from the time of
                  the negative serum pregnancy test throughout the entire course of EBRT.

          7. Patient must sign study-specific informed consent prior to study entry

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Extracranial meningioma

          2. Multiple meningiomas

          3. Hemangiopericytoma

          4. Major medical illnesses or psychiatric impairments which, in the investigators
             opinion, will prevent administration or completion of the protocol therapy or preclude
             informed consent

          5. Previous radiation therapy to the scalp, cranium, brain, or skull base

          6. Prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free
             for a minimum of 3 years (for example, carcinoma in situ of the breast, oral cavity,
             or cervix are all permissible)

          7. Patients with severe, active comorbidity including, but not restricted to:

               -  7.1 Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization at
                  the time of Step 2 registration

               -  7.2 Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months

               -  7.3 Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the
                  time of Step 2 registration

               -  7.4 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory
                  illness requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of Step
                  2 registration

               -  7.5 Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation
                  defects. Note, however, that laboratory tests for liver function and coagulation
                  parameters are not required for entry into this protocol.

               -  7.6 Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Centers for
                  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition; note, however, that HIV testing
                  is not required for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with
                  AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this
                  protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive.

               -  7.7 Active connective tissue disorders such as lupus or scleroderma if the
                  patient is intermediate or high risk

          8. Inability to receive gadolinium

        <title>Progression-free Survival Rate at 3 Years</title>
        <description>Progression was determined by central review of MRI exams and is defined as an increase in measurable tumor of greater than 20% in any diameter, or as new nodular enhancement in patients with no measurable tumor on initial postoperative imaging. In the absence of neurologic progression (NP), suspected imaging progression of less than 5 mm (maximum diameter) must be confirmed on two successive follow-up MRI studies, a minimum of 3 months apart. NP is defined as a new or progressive neurologic deficit attributed to the meningioma, with or without measurable meningioma growth. Progression-free survival (PFS) rates are estimated using the binomial method.</description>

Adverse events are graded using CTCAE v3.0. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE v3.0 assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild AE, Grade 2 Moderate AE, Grade 3 Severe AE, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5 Death related to AE.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival Rate at 3 Years (Kaplan-Meier Method)</title>
        <description>Progression was determined by central review of MRI exams and is defined as an increase in measurable tumor of greater than 20% in any diameter, or as new nodular enhancement in patients with no measurable tumor on initial postoperative imaging. In the absence of neurologic progression (NP), suspected imaging progression of less than 5 mm (maximum diameter) must be confirmed on two successive follow-up MRI studies, a minimum of 3 months apart. NP is defined as a new or progressive neurologic deficit attributed to the meningioma, with or without measurable meningioma growth. Progression-free survival time is defined as time from registration to the date of progression, death, or last known follow-up (censored). Progression-free survival rates are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
