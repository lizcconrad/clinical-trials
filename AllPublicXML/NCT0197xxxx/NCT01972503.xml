      In this study, the investigators assessed whether intraoperative Intraportal infusion of 5-FU
      and oxaliplatin is able to prevent liver metastasis and improve survival in patients with
      Stage II or Stage III colorectal cancer without apparent liver metastasis based on a thorough
      preoperative evaluation.

      Patients with stage II or stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) were randomly assigned to two
      arms.Arm A: 5-FU 1g and oxaliplatin 100mg + curative resection (study group, n=132). Arm B:
      curative resection alone (control group, n=132).Follow-up: X-ray, US, CT, blood test,
      colonoscopy,every 3months.

      The study endpoints were disease-free survival, overall survival, and liver metastasis-free
      survival as evaluated by intent-to-treat analysis.
