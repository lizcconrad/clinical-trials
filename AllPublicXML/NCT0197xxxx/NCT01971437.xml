  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an ethically approved randomised controlled study looking at whether
      Cystodistension(filling the bladder with fluid under pressure) provides any benefit over
      cystoscopy alone (looking in the bladder) in women with refractory overactive bladder. Urine
      samples will also be assessed for underlying infected cause of OAB using urinalysis,
      microscopy and culture and cytokine assays (In collaboration with the University of Kent). We
      hypothesize that Cystodistension has a therapeutic benefit to women with refractory OAB and
      the there is an increase prevalence in chronic urinary infections with raised cytokines in
      women with refractory OAB.

  <detailed_description>

      We aim to measure outcomes initially, 6 weels and 6months follow-up.

        1. Resolution measured by Urgency Perception Scale (UPS). Resolution of urgency will be
           assessed with the UPS. The numbers of women with a Level 3 UPS score (hold and finish
           task) will be compared using Chi square test in patients treated with cystodistension vs
           non cystodistension arms.

        2. Change in quality of life status determined by quality of life questionnaires will
           ismilarly be comapred between the 2 arms of the study.

        3. Change in urinary symptoms defined by Patient's Perception of Intensity Scale. Change in
           uregncy scores will be compared between the 2 arms of the study.

      Secondary Outcome Measure:1. Prevalence of chronic urinary infection and organisms in
      patients with refractory OAB 2. To identify whether urinary cytokines are present in a higher
      proportion of patients with OAB.

      Inclusion Criteria

        1. Women with only OAB symptoms

        2. Women who have failed bladder drill and anticholinergic agents

        3. Women who stopped medication due to side-effects or lack of efficacy

        4. Currently receiving no treatment

      Exclusion Criteria

        1. Patient with co-existing urodynamic stress incontinence

        2. Patients with neurological diseases

        3. Patients with pre-existing voiding dysfunction
