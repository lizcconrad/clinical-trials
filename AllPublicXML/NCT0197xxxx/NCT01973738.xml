    <textblock>
      Although there are two kinds of selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) :raloxifene
      (RLX) and bazedoxifene (BZA), the difference is still unclear. In this study, we plan to
      compare clinical efficacy and safety between RLX and BZA.

      Selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) is an important option for postmenopausal
      osteoporosis. There are two SERM approved in Japan for the treatment of postmenopausal
      osteoporosis in women at increased risk of fracture. One is raloxifene (RLX), and the other
      is bazedoxifene (BZA). There are few reports concerning to the clinical efficacy and safety
      data. In this study, we plan to compare clinical efficacy and safety between RLX and BZA.

      The main objective of this study is to reveal the effects of RLX and BZA on bone mineral
      density, bone turnover markers, and bone quality markers.

    <description>The investigators plan to analyze 300 patients who undergo selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) treatments for five years.
We investigate the efficacy of two SERMs: raloxifene (RLX) and bazedoxifene (BZA). Bone mineral density (BMD) andd laboratory analyses (bone markers, routine chemistry, urine, and bone quality marker of pentosidine) at baseline and every four to six months. We also investigate the side effects. Statical analyses are performed using Spearman correlation coefficients, paired t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test and Fisher's exact test to compare the efficacy and safy between RLX and BZA.</description>
