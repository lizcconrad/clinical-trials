      MigraineBoxTM is a simple, contoured cooling bath for the head and neck. Effectiveness of
      MigraineBoxTM will be studied in primary headaches in the emergency department. The user
      simply reclines his/her head and neck into this device that has contours that support the
      head and neck. Luke warm water is filled into the MigraineBoxTM before use and then a frozen
      insert is placed inside. This will gradually cool the water surrounding the patient's head
      and theoretically provide headache relief.
