  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sjogren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is a rare genetic disease in which patients typically exhibit
      ichthyosis (dry, scaly skin), intellectual disability, spasticity, seizures and a distinctive
      maculopathy. The purpose of this study is to define the clinical spectrum and natural history
      of Sjogren-Larsson syndrome, and identify biomarkers that correlate with disease phenotype
      while establishing a registry for future investigations of biochemical pathogenesis and
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a clinical component and a scientific component consisting of
      laboratory investigations of potentially useful biochemical (lipid and protein) markers. Up
      to 50 SLS patients of all ages, gender and ethnic origins will be enrolled. A detailed
      clinical evaluation will be performed to determine the presence and extent of disease
      involving the skin, nervous system and eyes. Clinical testing will include brain magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS), electroencephalography (EEG), neurocognitive
      tests, ophthalmologic examination with retinal photographs and optical coherence tomography
      (OCT), photographs of the skin and tests of cutaneous transepidermal water loss. Laboratory
      investigations will include lipid analyses (e.g. fatty alcohols, farnesol, fatty acids, ether
      glycerolipids, etc.) of blood, skin and urine; proteomic analysis of skin (stratum corneum);
      and measurements of leukocyte fatty alcohol and farnesol oxidation. A skin biopsy (optional)
      will be obtained for electron microscopy, measurement of lanthanum perfusion (transepidermal
      water loss), and/or establishing keratinocyte cultures. Correlations between clinical
      abnormalities and laboratory measurements will be tested to identify the most useful
      biomarkers for future diagnostic and therapeutic studies. To characterize the progression of
      phenotypic features over time, patients &lt;6 years of age will be followed yearly and patients
      ≥6 years of age will be followed every 3 years. In addition, a SLS patient registry will be
      established as a resource for future investigations in SLS.

    <description>Determine the spectrum of clinical disease severity and changes in severity of symptoms over time. Each organ system will be evaluated using validated clinical exams (for example, Modified Ashworth Spasticity Score for neurologic severity) or categorical tests (such as EEG normal or abnormal). The clinical data will be used to develop a quantitative SLS severity score whereby patients will be described (for example, overall severity 1 to 5 with score 1 being the mildest phenotype and score 5 being the most severe). These quantitative outcome measures will be followed over time to assess disease progression.</description>

    <description>Blood, urine and skin biomarkers will be explored to identify tests that correlate with clinical severity of SLS. Multiple tests will be performed and outcome measures will be statistically compared to the clinical severity score to determine correlation coefficients, which will be used to establish new biomarkers for SLS.</description>

        The study population will come from cohorts of Sjögren-Larsson syndrome patients currently
        followed at STAIR sites, from the RDCRN contact registry, and from the pool of new patients
        who directly contact STAIR sites or are referred to STAIR centers by their physicians.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The only eligibility criterion is that subjects have a genetically or biochemically
             confirmed diagnosis of Sjogren-Larsson syndrome.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The primary exclusion criteria are the patients' failure to consent or inability to
