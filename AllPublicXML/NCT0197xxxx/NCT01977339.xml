  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the quality and duration of pain relief after a total
      knee replacement provided by a single shot of standard bupivacaine versus a single shot of
      liposomal bupivacaine, at the site of the femoral nerve. It is hypothesized that the
      liposomal bupivacaine formulation will provide more effective pain relief than standard
      bupivacaine.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Opiate consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the cumulative 72 hour opiate consumption after total knee arthroplasty (TKA)in patients who received a single dose of liposome bupivacaine with those who received a single shot femoral nerve block with 0.25% bupivacaine.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-operative VAS scores</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hr, 4 hrs, 8 hrs, 12 hrs, 24 hrs, 48 hrs, 72 hrs</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked to describe the pain intensity under two circumstances: pain at rest, and pain on movement. Postoperative pain intensity will be evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) system at 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours. The VAS used will be the 11 point verbal response pain scale with 0 being no pain at all and 10 being the worst possible pain. The patients will be asked to rate their pain levels using this numeric scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Sensory mapping (temperature)</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Sensation in the distribution of the femoral nerve as assessed by temperature using an alcohol swab (0=no sensation, 1=decreased sensation, 2=normal).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Motor function assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to walk 20 meters unassisted with the optional use of a 4-legged walker at baseline, and at 24, 48 and 72 hours post-operatively.</description>
