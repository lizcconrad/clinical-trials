  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to answer the question &quot;Is it possible to inject the
      COMBIG-DC vaccine in a hepatic tumor without getting unacceptable side effects&quot;?
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma will get COMBIG-DC vaccinations at three
      occasions with 2-3 weeks and 3-5 weeks between vaccination 2 and 3 respectively. Adverse
      events will be registered until 6 months after last vaccination, as well as changes in vital
      signs (heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature) and lab parameters. Immunologic
      response will be evaluated by measuring immunologic markers in blood. The size of the
      tumor/tumors will be evaluated after 3 and 6 months and thereafter every three months until
      tumor progression.

      For patients included after approval of Amendment 3 (2015-12-10), COMBIG-DC will be given as
      add on to standard treatment; sorafenib or Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE).
