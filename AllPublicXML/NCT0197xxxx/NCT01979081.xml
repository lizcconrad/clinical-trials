    <textblock>
      The Physical Functioning Inventory (PFI) is a standardized patient reported outcome measure
      that assesses preclinical disability. Preclinical disability is a functional state in which
      people are still able to complete daily living tasks (e.g., walking, bathing) but are
      changing the frequency or modifying the way that they complete the tasks. The investigators
      have done some preliminary research using the PFI as an online monitoring tool (Richardson
      2012), but further study is required to examine its psychometric properties and its
      suitability for use as a primary outcome measure. This measurement study has been designed to
      identify the optimal number of items on the PFI and to determine the reliability, validity,
      and responsiveness of the PFI when administered to a sample of adults and older adults both
      with and without chronic conditions. This project will also allow us to evaluate the use of
      self-monitoring of physical function and the added value of rehabilitation professionals to
      support self-monitoring. Using the results of the PFI, the investigators aim to develop a
      &quot;tailored&quot; population-based rehabilitation self-management intervention delivered through a
      secure messaging system in the patient's electronic personal health record (myOSCAR) that
      focuses on the early detection and prevention of preclinical disability.

    <description>The PFI will be administered at baseline, then again 3-5 days later to assess test-retest reliability. It will then be administered at 6 months, 12 months and 18 months to determine its longitudinal validity. It will be administered a final time 3-5 days after the 18 month time frame to re-evaluate the measures test-retest reliability.</description>

    <measure>Mobility Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-5 days later, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 3-5 days later</time_frame>
    <description>The Mobility Survey has been created from work by Manty (2007). Self-reported mobility is determined by asking participants to rate their ability to walk 2.0km, walk 0.5km, and climb up 1 flight of stairs on a scale of 1 (able to manage without difficulty) to 5 (unable to manage even with help). To identify persons at an early stage of mobility limitation (preclinical mobility limitation), additional questions were posed to participants who reported no task difficulty. The questions concerned the modification of task performance and the alternatives given were resting in the middle of the performance, using an aid, taking support from handrails, having reduced the frequency of performing the task, having slowed down performance of the task, experiencing tiredness when performing the task, or some other change in carrying out the task.</description>

    <description>The participant is asked to identify up to 5 important activities that they are unable to do or have difficulty with because of their health. For each of the activities the participant is asked to rate their ability to perform that activity on a scale of 0 (unable to perform the activity) to 10 (able to perform the activity like I always have).</description>
