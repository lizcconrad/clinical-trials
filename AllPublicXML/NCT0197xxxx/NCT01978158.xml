  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxygen is a widely available gas that is cheap, easy to get and extensively used in medicine.
      From animal studies it has become apparent that increasing or lowering the degree of oxygen
      in the blood, the inflammatory response can be altered. We will investigate of this is also
      true in humans by increasing, lowering or keeping oxygen levels normal while giving healthy
      subjects a short inflammatory stimulus.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the effects of hyperoxia and hypoxia
      compared to normoxia in the human endotoxemia model on the innate immune reponse in healthy
      volunteers.

      A parallel, randomized study in healthy male volunteers. The subjects will be randomized to
      hypoxia, hyperoxia, or normoxia, and will all undergo experimental human endotoxemia
      (administration of 2 ng/kg LPS iv).

      In the hypoxia group: the subjects will breathe an individualized mix of nitrogen and room
      air for 3.5 hours using an air-tight respiratory helmet. The gas mixture will be adjusted to
      achieve a saturation of 80-85%. In the hyperoxia group, subjects will breathe 100% oxygen for
      3.5 hours using the same respiratory helmet. In the normoxia group, subjects will breathe
      room air (21% oxygen, 79% nitrogen) also wearing the respiratory helmet. 1 hour after oxygen
      status adjustment (t=0), all subject will be administered an intravenous bolus (2ng/kg) of
      LPS derived from E coli O:113. 2.5 hours after LPS administration, the helmets will be
      removed and all subjects will breathe ambient room air.

      The primary study endpoint is the difference in plasma cytokines between the hypoxia and
      normoxia group, and between the hyperoxia and normoxia group. Secondary objectives include
      HIF-1α protein and mRNA, aHIF mRNA expression in circulating leukocytes, measures of ROS,
      leukocyte phagocytosis, and cytokine production by leukocytes stimulated ex vivo with various
      inflammatory stimuli, and measurement of basic hemodynamic and ventilatory parameters and
      temperature.
