  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment of surgery followed by radiation therapy can stop tumors from growing
      in the head and neck region in most patients. However, the cancer can recur or can spread to
      other parts of the body. Cetuximab is a drug that may delay or prevent tumor growth by
      blocking certain cellular chemical pathways that lead to tumor development. It was approved
      by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006 for the treatment of head and
      neck cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to determine how easily cetuximab can be added to treatment with
      radiation therapy in patients with cutaneous cancer of the head and neck. This study will
      also look at how well cetuximab added to radiation therapy works over time and how well this
      treatment is tolerated.

      This is a Phase II trial to characterize the feasibility of treating patients with locally
      advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck with post-operative
      radiotherapy and cetuximab. Cetuximab has previously been given safely in conjunction with
      head and neck radiotherapy for mucosal squamous cell carcinoma in multiple phase III trials,
      and so Phase I data is not necessary here.
