    <textblock>
      This 5 year study, targeting Pregnant Drug Abusers in treatment, is a randomized trial of an
      Enhanced Behavioral Skills Training (E-BST) intervention compared to a time-and
      attention-matched Health Promotion Comparison (HPC) condition. E-BST is an adaptation of the
      original BST intervention (Eldridge, St. Lawrence et al., 1997), designed to strengthen
      relationship-based social competency skills of the original BST that were crucial in
      sustaining adherence to protective behavior.
