  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation issue during percutaneous coronary interventions is an important issue for
      operators due to the long term stochastic risk of cancer induction, but is often
      under-evaluated. Many factors may be associated with the radiation dose adsorbed by
      operators. In particular the most important are the position taken by the operator, the use
      of dedicated X-ray shield and the duration of the procedure. However other factors (as
      operator height or the angulation of the radiation tube) might have some important effects
      but are often under-evaluated .

      Aim of our observational study is to evaluate the most important determinants of the
      radiation dose adsorbed by operators during different coronary procedures (diagnostic
      coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary interventions) and through different vascular
      accesses (right or left transradial approach or transfemoral approach).

      All patients who underwent to percutaneous coronary diagnostic or interventional procedures
      will be enrolled in this observational study.

      Each operator will be equipped with dedicated dosimeters placed at left wrist, at thorax
      level outside the lead apron and at head level to evaluate the radiation dose at crystalline.
      Effective doses delivered to patients will be expressed as dose area product (DAP) and
      measured in Gycm2.
