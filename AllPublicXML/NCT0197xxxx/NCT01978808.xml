      For diagnosis of pancreatic tumors, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and EUS-guided fine needle
      aspiration (EUS-FNA) are well established techniques in clinical practice. We hypothesize
      that a FNA needle with a side port could improve the diagnostic yield. The aim of this
      prospective randomized study is to determine whether there is a difference in diagnostic
      yield in patients with pancreatic masses for evaluation.

      For diagnosis of pancreatic tumors, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and EUS-guided fine needle
      aspiration (EUS-FNA) are well established techniques in clinical practice. In the case of
      EUS, an ultrasonic transducer located at the tip of the echoendoscope allows the endoscopist
      to visualize the wall of gastrointestinal tract as a series of definable layers corresponding
      to histology, and also enables detailed images of areas outside of the digestive tract. EUS
      has a significant clinical impact because it allows assessment of submucosal GI lesions,
      loco-regional staging of gastrointestinal malignancy, tissue diagnosis by EUS-FNA and staging
      of pancreaticobiliary lesions, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, and mediastinal disease. In
      prospective trials, EUS-FNA has been clearly established to be an important diagnostic tool
      with excellent safety profile.

      Olympus has recently made commercially available a new 22 gauge FNA needle with a side port
      at the needle tip to facilitate the process of FNA and increase the diagnostic yield. There
      have been preliminary unpublished retrospective data that suggested the yield might be
      raised. However, there are no prospective multicenter randomized controlled studies to
      ascertain the validity of the assumption. The aim of this prospective randomized study is to
      determine whether there is a difference in diagnostic yield between EZ-Shot 2 (model:
      NA-220H-8022) and EZ-Shot 2 with side port (NA-230H-8022) in patients with pancreatic masses
      for evaluation. We hypothesize that a FNA needle with a side port could improve the
      diagnostic yield.
