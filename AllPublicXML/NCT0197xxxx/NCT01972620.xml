      Analgesic efficacy of multi-modal analgesia is superior to standard analgesia for patients
      undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Topical
      cystic plate and port-site incision 0.25% bupivacaine significantly reduces pain after
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      Background: Peri-portal nerve stimulation has recently been suggested as a mechanism for pain
      after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LapChole). We therefore conducted a PRCT to evaluate
      whether somatovisceral pain blockade reduces pain after LapChole.

      Hypothesis:Analgesic efficacy of multi-modal analgesia is superior to standard analgesia for
      patients undergoing elective LapChole for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Specifically, topical
      cystic plate and port-site infiltrationwith0.25% bupivacaine significantly reduces pain after
      LapChole.

      Design: Single-blinded PRCT Setting: Academic medical centers Patients and Methods: Between
      February and May 2010 we randomly assigned 63 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis in a
      1:1 ratio to institutional standard non-opioid/opioid analgesic combinations (n=32), and
      institutional standard analgesia plus topical 0.25%bupivacaine spray onto the cystic plate
      and local 0.25% bupivacaine port-site injection,post-LapChole (n=31). Primary endpoint was
      patient-reported pain 1, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours, and 1 week post-LapCholeusing the Visual
      Acuity Score (VAS, 0-10).

      Results: Study groups were comparable clinicopathologically. There were no
      study-procedure-associated adverse events. A statistically significant reduction in mean pain
      score was apparent in patients receiving multi-modal analgesia at all early (1-6 hours)
      post-operative time points and at one week following LapChole(p&lt;0.05).

      Conclusion: This PRCT shows significantly improved pain reduction with somatovisceral pain
      blockade than institutional standard analgesic combinations following LapChole for
      symptomatic cholelithiasis. For centers not utilizing adjunctive local anesthetic for this
      operation, this multi-modal analgesic approach can improve patient comfort during
      recovery.This approach serves as the basis for a planned 4-arm PRCT designed to provide
      further insights into the role of local anesthetics in multi-modal operative site analgesia.

    <description>Thirty-one patients were enrolled in this arm. Standard analgesia according to institutional standard and 50:50 mixture of normal saline (8 ml) and 0.5% Bupivacaine was prepared within a 20 ml syringe (Total volume = 16 ml; Final concentration = 0.25%). Following delivery of the gallbladder specimen 8 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine solution was sprayed onto the cystic plate (gallbladder fossa) with a spinal needle advanced under direct laparoscopic vision via a 5mm right subcostal laparoscopic port. The anesthetic solution was sprayed at an operating distance from the cystic plate of ~ 2 cm. Following evacuation of the pneumoperitoneum, the remaining 8 ml of 0.25% Bupivacaine was infiltrated subcutaneously at each of the 4 laparoscopic port sites (2 ml per port site) prior sutured closure.</description>
