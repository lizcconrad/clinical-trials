    <textblock>
      This is a global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group
      study using avatrombopag to treat adults with thrombocytopenia associated with liver disease.
      The study will evaluate avatrombopag in the treatment of thrombocytopenia associated with
      liver disease prior to an elective procedure to reduce the need for platelet transfusions or
      any rescue procedure for bleeding due to procedural and post-procedural bleeding
      complications. Participants will be enrolled into 2 cohorts according to mean baseline
      platelet count and, within each baseline platelet count cohort will be further stratified by
      risk of bleeding associated with the elective procedure (low, moderate, or high) and
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) status (Yes or No).

      This study will consist of 3 phases: Prerandomization, Randomization, and a Follow-up Phase.
      The Prerandomization Phase includes one Screening Visit that will take place from Day -14
      through Day -1; the Randomization Phase includes the Baseline Period, Treatment Period, and
      Procedure Day Period (5 to 8 days after last dose of study drug [Study Day 10 to 13]). The
      Follow-up Phase comprises 2 visits: 7 days post Procedure Day and 30 days after receiving the
      last dose of study drug. Permitted procedures include: Paracentesis; Thoracentesis;
      Gastrointestinal endoscopy with or without plans for biopsy, colonoscopy, polypectomy, or
      variceal banding; Liver biopsy; Bronchoscopy with or without plans for biopsy; Ethanol
      ablation therapy or chemoembolization for HCC; Vascular catheterization (including right side
      procedures in participants with pulmonary hypertension); Transjugular intrahepatic
      portosystemic shunt; Dental procedures; Renal biopsy; Biliary interventions; Nephrostomy tube
      placement; Radiofrequency ablation; and Laparoscopic interventions.

    <description>Responders were defined as participants who did not require a platelet transfusion or any rescue procedure for bleeding after randomization and up to 7 days following a scheduled procedure.

    <description>Responders were defined as participants who achieved a platelet count greater than or equal to 50 x 10^9/L on the procedure day.

    <description>The severity of bleeding events was assessed by the investigator (or appropriately delegated study site personnel) using the WHO bleeding scale. The WHO bleeding scale is a clinical investigator-assessed five-point scale with Grade 0 = No bleeding, Grade 1 = Petechial bleeding, Grade 2 = Mild blood loss (clinically significant), Grade 3 = Gross blood loss requires transfusion (severe), and Grade 4 = Debilitating blood loss, retinal or cerebral associated with fatality. Participants with missing information are considered as having a WHO bleeding score greater than or equal to 2 in the analysis.</description>

    <time_frame>From date of first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug, up to approximately 3 years and 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety assessments consisted of monitoring and recording all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events, including platelet transfusion-related complications; routine laboratory evaluation for hematology, serum chemistry, and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs and electrocardiograms (ECGs); the performance of physical examinations; and Doppler sonography. AE severity was graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, where Grade 1 = mild, Grade 2 = moderate, Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening, and Grade 5 = Death related to the AE. All AEs graded as 4 or 5 were considered to be serious. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as an AE that started on or after the date of first dose of study drug, up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Treatment-related AEs were considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to study drug.</description>

The WHO bleeding scale is a clinical investigator-assessed five-point scale with Grade 0 = No bleeding, Grade 1 = Petechial bleeding, Grade 2 = Mild blood loss (clinically significant), Grade 3 = Gross blood loss requires transfusion (severe), and Grade 4 = Debilitating blood loss, retinal or cerebral associated with fatality.

        <title>Number of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event</title>
        <description>Safety assessments consisted of monitoring and recording all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events, including platelet transfusion-related complications; routine laboratory evaluation for hematology, serum chemistry, and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs and electrocardiograms (ECGs); the performance of physical examinations; and Doppler sonography. AE severity was graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, where Grade 1 = mild, Grade 2 = moderate, Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening, and Grade 5 = Death related to the AE. All AEs graded as 4 or 5 were considered to be serious. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as an AE that started on or after the date of first dose of study drug, up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Treatment-related AEs were considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to study drug.</description>
