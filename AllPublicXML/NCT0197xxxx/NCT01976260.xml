      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the ePrime fractional
      radiofrequency system to the 1550-nm fractional photothermolysis system (Fraxel) in the
      ability to improve acne scar appearance.

      Participants in this study will be patients at the dermatology clinic with icepick and boxcar
      acne scars on at least one 2 x 2 cm area on each side of face. Subjects will be randomly
      assigned to receive fractional radiofrequency treatment to either the right or left side of
      the face and the contralateral side will receive 1550-nm fractional photothermolysis.
      Subjects will receive treatments at baseline, week 4, and week 8 for a total of three
      treatments. Follow up visits will take place at week 16, two months following the last
      treatment visit. This study is a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of these
      procedures.

    <description>The primary outcome was a blinded rating of the treatment area (Fractional Radiofrequency Versus Fractional Photothermolysis) with the best cosmetic appearance. A dermatologist will blindly evaluate the treated areas of each side from live subjects at baseline and on the final follow up visit (week 16).</description>
