      Phase I Multicenter, Open-label, Clinical and Pharmacokinetic Study of PM01183 in Combination
      with Fixed Doxorubicin in Non- Heavily Pretreated Patients with Selected Advanced Solid
      Tumors to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose (RD) of PM01183
      in combination with doxorubicin, to characterize the safety profile and feasibility of this
      combination, to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of this combination, to obtain
      preliminary information on the clinical antitumor activity,to explore the feasibility, safety
      and efficacy of a potential improvable dose of this combination in selected tumor types [i.e.
      small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and endometrial cáncer] and to evaluate the pharmacogenomics
      (PGx) in tumor samples of patients exposed to PM01183 and doxorubicin at the RD in order to
      assess potential markers of response and/or resistance.

      The study has currently met its primary end point and is now recruiting patients to be
      treated at the RD expansion cohort of selected tumor types, specifically: endometrial
      adenocarcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors, and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).
