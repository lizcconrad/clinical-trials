  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      in this study , effectiveness of supragingival irrigators containing chlorhexidine is
      compared with routine oral health measures in patients with blood dyscrasia whom can not use
      effective oral health measures(e.g brushing ) due to their systemic condition(e,g,neutropenia
      ,thrombocytopenia,..)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since some patients with hematologic malignancies cannot brush effectively and are at
      increased risk of bleeding and infection due to severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia we
      want to access whether a none invasive method ( water jet systems containing chlorhexidine )
      Can help this patients to get better oral health indexes in comparison with routine oral
      health measures in these type of patients.
