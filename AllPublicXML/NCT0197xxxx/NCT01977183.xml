  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to study the effects of potato resistant starch on the
      microbiota (microorganisms or bacteria) and short chain fatty acids levels of the gut. Levels
      will be measured and compared between elderly adults and in pre-elderly, adults from the
      general public. A correlation between the use of potato resistant starch and specific
      clinical and quality of life endpoints between elderly adults and in pre-elderly, adults from
      the general public will be studied.

      Hypothesis 1: The investigator hypothesizes that the microbiome in elderly adults (≥70 years)
      is less diverse and more prone to imbalance compared to adults (30-50 years) from the general
      population and that this imbalance of the gut microflora in the elderly adults is partially
      related to inadequate RS in their diet.

      Hypothesis 2: The investigator hypothesizes that ingestion of potato resistant starch of food
      grade quality (MSPrebiotic) will stabilize the gut microbiome (i.e. high
      Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio)in LTC residents (i.e. similar to that of adults from the
      general population), thereby improving gut health and reducing the risk of diarrhea and/or
      gut infection.

      To assess the impact on the potato resistant starch on the microbiota, pyrosequencing will be
      performed on stool samples to determine the original composition and assess any changes over
      the study period. In addition the impact of the potato resistant starch on inflammatory
      markers will be assess through blood samples collected over the study period.
