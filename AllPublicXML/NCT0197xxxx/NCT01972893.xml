  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ZYD1 is a novel GLP-1 receptor agonist. The ZYD1 exhibits increased stability to proteolytic
      cleavage, especially against dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-IV).

      ZYD1 is a potent antidiabetic agent without gastrointestinal side-effects. A first in human
      (FIH) Phase I study intends to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of ZYD1 in normal healthy adult volunteers.

    <measure>To evaluate Safety and tolerability of ZYD1</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>The safety and tolerability shall be evaluated using physical examinations, standard laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry and urine examination), and electrocardiogram (ECG). Spontaneously reported and solicited adverse events will also be used for safety parameters.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamic (PD) effect after single and multiple subcutaneous dose administrations in healthy adult male volunteers Gender effect study.</measure>
    <time_frame>1. For Plan I and III - Pre-dose (before dosing), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 ,8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 120 hrs post dose 2. Plan II - Day 01 - Pre-dose, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 hours following first dosing. Day 02 to 06 - Pre-dose of each . Day 07 - Pre-dose, 1, 2, 3,</time_frame>
    <description>PK parameters evaluated for Plan I and Plan III: Cmax, Tmax, Area Under Curve (AUC)0-t, AUC 0-inf, T1/2, z, Clearance(CL), Volume of distribution (Vd) Plan II: Cmin, Tmin, Cavg, % Fluctuation, Accumulation Index, Clss, Cmax, Vd or Vss
For urine data (Plans I, II, and III):
Amount recovered, % recovered
The following PD parameters (Plan I-III) will be evaluated: Plasma glucose, Serum insulin, C-Peptide, Glucagon
Gender effects: PK and PD effect in female volunteers at preselected single dose will be compared with the results of single-dose study in male volunteers.</description>
