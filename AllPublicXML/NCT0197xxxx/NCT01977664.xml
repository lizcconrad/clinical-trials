      Donated oocytes is from a patient with repeated oocyte maturation failure in IVF cycles.
      Cytoplasm of matured metaphase II oocyte and active MPF were injected into the donated
      oocytes.

      The study reported a woman with syndrome of repeated oocyte maturation failure where there is
      repeated production of immature oocytes.She underwent two IVF cycles in other hospital. All
      oocytes obtained were immature and the treatment were stopped.She underwent her third try in
      our hospital. The couple gave their informed consent: ICSI will be performed if maturation
      occurred, otherwise, the treatment would be stopped and the oocytes would be donated for
      study if the oocytes were not matured after 24 hours of culture. After ovarian
      hyperstimulation,14 oocytes were obtained. None of them was matured. The cycle was canceled
      and the oocytes were donated for study.To induce the immature oocytes in vitro, oocytes were
      1)cultured in follicular fluid containing matured metaphase II oocyte; 2) performed
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) to induce intracellular Ca2+]i oscillations;
      3)injected with active maturation promoting factor (MPF), 4)injected with cytoplasm of
      matured metaphase II oocyte.
