    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, comparative Phase 3 trial to investigate the efficacy of fixed dose
      combination (FDC) of bisoprolol and amlodipine in hypertensive subjects (superiority of FDC
      over monotherapies).

An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment emergent AEs was AEs that started or worsened in severity on or after the date of first dose of IMP until the end of the study. AEs leading to death and discontinued were also presented.</description>

Bisoprolol/Amlodipine FDC tablet was orally administered at an initial dose of 5 mg/5 mg once daily for 6 weeks. If BP was controlled at Week 6 (Day 43), the same dose was continued for next 6 weeks. If the BP was not controlled at Day 43, the dose was increased to Bisoprolol/Amlodipine 5 mg/10 mg or 10 mg/5 mg for next 6 weeks. Subjects who had controlled BP at Week 12 (Day 85), continued with the same dose that they were receiving for next 6 weeks. If their BP was not controlled at Day 85, dose was increased to the next level (Bisoprolol/Amlodipine 5 mg/10 mg for subjects receiving Bisoprolol/Amlodipine 5 mg/5 mg dose and Bisoprolol/Amlodipine and 10 mg/10 mg for subjects receiving Bisoprolol/Amlodipine 5 mg/10 mg dose) until Week 18 (Day 127).
