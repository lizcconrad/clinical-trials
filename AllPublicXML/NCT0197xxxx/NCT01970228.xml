  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip replacement is the well-established surgical method for treatment of hip
      osteoarthritis and related diseases. The outcome of the procedure is commonly satisfactory
      and most patients will not need any revision surgery. However, the procedure has its
      complications, including (1) periprosthetic infection, (2) mechanical loosening caused by
      wear particles and (3) adverse reaction caused by metal ions released from metal-on-metal
      bearing surfaces. The unsolved clinical problem is related to the differential diagnosis of
      these conditions. The purpose of this prospective clinical study is to compare the efficacy
      of two techniques of PET/CT imaging in the differential diagnosis of these complications.
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/Computed Tomography (CT) imaging, performed during a
      single day, will include the head-to-head comparison of 18F-Fluoro-D-Glucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT
      and 68Gallium-citrate (68Ga-citrate) PET/CT imaging.

      (68Ga) gallium citrate is a novel PET tracer aimed for detection of skeletal infections. It
      has not been previously applied to diagnose periprosthetic joint infections in arthroplasty
      patients. This exploratory prospective study, representing the first of its kind, examines
      the use of 68Ga-citrate as a diagnostic tool of periprosthetic infections aside with 18F-FDG
      tracer as the standard reference.

      The first study group (n=10) will include total hip replacement patients without infection.
      The recruited patients should suffer from pain and/or functional impairment due to adverse
      reaction to metal debris (ARMD) caused by metal-on-metal bearings. The diagnosis of ARMD
      should be based on metal artifact reduction sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MARS-MRI).
      The patients will undergo the same-day comparison of the two PET/CT tracers.

      The second study group (n=10) will include total hip replacement patients with
      bacteriologically confirmed periprosthetic joint infection. The third group (n=10) will
      include patients with aseptic loosening of total hip prosthesis.
