      Specific Aim 1: To identify differences in pain perception and satisfaction with pain control
      in women undergoing urogynecologic surgery receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDS)
      postoperatively by oral ibuprofen, intravenous ibuprofen, or intravenous ketorolac. Specific
      Aim 2: To compare the differences in narcotic usage and medication side effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patient will be informed that they may receive either ibuprofen or ketorolac and that the
      medication may be given (IV) or per os (PO). Patients were also informed that their pain may
      improve or worsen during the study, and that they could request additional pain medication
      (as a rescue medication) at any time.

      After surgery, all patients will be placed initially on a patient controlled analgesia (PCA)
      of hydromorphone with standardized settings of allowing the patient to dispense 0.2 mg of
      medication every 6 minutes (lockout rate) and an hourly maximum of 2.0 mg/hour. A one-time
      nursing bolus of 0.4 mg will also be ordered. The PCA will be discontinued on the morning
      after surgery no later than 12:00 noon. The patient will then be started on PO pain
      medication, either hydrocodone/acetaminophen or oxycodone/acetaminophen.

      Immediately after surgery, patients will then be assigned to one of three treatment arms with
      a computer-generated randomization schedule that is to be based on their order of enrollment.
      Patients were informed they could withdraw at any point. Three visual analog scores (VAS)
      will be obtained from the patient before noon on the first day after surgery. One scale to
      assess pain at rest, one scale to assess pain with ambulation, and one scale to assess
      satisfaction with pain control.

      The medications will each be given every 8 hours in order to keep all medications on a
      similar doing regimen. This will allow the patients to receive a total of three doses of
      medication over 24 hours, regardless of which arm of the study they are randomized to.
