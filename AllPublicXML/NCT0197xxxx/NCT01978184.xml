  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase II trial that will examine the ability of the hydroxychloroquine
      to improve the clinical activity of a pre-operative regimen of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel
      in subjects with potentially resectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Eligible subjects
      will receive 2 cycles of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (day 1, 8, 15) with or without
      hydrocychloroquine followed by surgical resection. Primary endpoint will be histologic
      response as graded by Evans criteria. Secondary endpoints will be CA19-9 response and PET
      response. Pre and post treatment tissue biopsies will be obtained to assess for levels of
      autophagy in tumor, liver and peripheral blood.

    <description>Gemcitabine and Abraxane will be administered on an outpatient basis on Days 3, 10, 17, 31, 38, and 45 as an intravenous infusion. The dose on Day 3 will be 1000 mg/m of gemcitabine followed by a 125 mg/m2 of abraxane and the infusion will take 1 hour. The second dose and infusion time may be decreased. Prior to each gemcitabine infusion, subjects will be pre-medicated with an FDA-approved anti-emetic (anti-nausea medication) in an effort to prevent nausea, at the discretion of the study physician.</description>

Hydroxychloroquine is an oral drug (capsule) that subjects will take once or twice a day at home. The dose of hydroxychlorquien will be 1200mg. This is an experimental drug. Subjects will take their first dose of hydroxychloroquine on Day 1 (48 hours before the first infusion of gemcitabine/abraxane), and will continue to take it every day until the day before surgery.</description>
