  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fruquintinib is a novel oral small molecule compound discovered and developed by Hutchison
      MediPharma that selectively inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 1,
      2, and 3 and has demonstrated potent inhibitory effects on multiple human tumor
      xenografts.Based on first-in-human study, both 4mg QD and 5mg 3wks on/1wk off are safety and
      efficacy, this phase Ib study is to evaluable the safety, tolerability and efficacy of these
      2 regimens with mCRC failed 2nd therapy or more and to determine the recommended dose and
      regimen in phase II/III study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib, randomize, interventional, open-label, multicenter study to provide
      fruquintinib to subjects diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer who have failed after
      standard therapy and for whom no therapy alternatives exist.

      The primary endpoint of this study will be safety.
