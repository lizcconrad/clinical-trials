  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel, 3-arm, randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled, and double-blind
      clinical study for eight weeks of therapy to investigate the clinical efficacy of DLBS1449 in
      elevating high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in diabetic patients. The hypothesis of
      interest for the study is: the administration of DLBS1449 will elevate HDL-cholesterol level
      from baseline to the end of study significantly higher than the elevation resulted by
      placebo. In addition, the administration of DLBS1449 at the dose of 150 mg daily will provide
      a significantly better response than that of the lower dose (DLBS1449 75 mg daily).

      There will be three groups of treatment by dosage regimen in this study. Eligible subjects
      will be randomized to receive any of the following regimens: 1) DLBS1449 at a dose of 1 x 75
      mg daily, or 2) DLBS1449 at a dose of 1 x 150 mg (two capsules of DLBS1449 75 mg) daily; or
      3) placebo, once daily. Study medication should be administered once daily, in the evening
      with meal, for eight weeks. Clinical and laboratory examinations to evaluate investigational
      drug's efficacy and safety will be performed at baseline and at interval of four weeks over
      8-week course of therapy.
