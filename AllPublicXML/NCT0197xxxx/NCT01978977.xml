      Investigators propose to assess,the safety and tolerability profile (number of participants
      with adverse events)of bevacizumab (Avastin) when combined with standard chemotherapy as
      first line treatment of patients with metastatic Breast Cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays in clinical practice patients with previously untreated metastatic breast cancer
      often receive taxane-based chemotherapy (paclitaxel or docetaxel) in combination with
      bevacizumab as it has been shown to increase progression-free survival. There is currently
      minimal information whether bevacizumab should be given as maintenance therapy after
      discontinuation of chemotherapy.
