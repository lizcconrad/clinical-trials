    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of rituximab alone vs combination
      of rituximab and cyclophosphamide in the treatment of pemphigus not responding adequately to
      routine medications.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with the diagnosis of pemphigus based on clinical, histopathological and
             immunological features the following:

          -  Refractory disease defined as continuing extension of old lesions, development of new
             lesion, or failure of established lesions to begin to heal despite 3 weeks of therapy
             on 1.5 mg/kg/day of prednisolone or its equivalent with or without the concurrent use
             of cyclophosphamide 2mg/kg/day for 12 weeks or azathioprine 2.5 mg/kg/day for 12
             weeks. Patients who fail to respond to 6 DCP/DP are also considered as refractory
             disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:
