    <textblock>
      Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI), first described by Albright in 1942, is defined as an
      increase in Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), an insufficiency of the ovarian function
      leading to an early menopause (&lt;40 years of age).Today, only 35% of POI's etiology can be
      explained. Causes enlightening POI may be enumerated as follows, according to their
      frequency: genetic mutations, autoimmune defects and abnormalities detected on the X
      chromosome.The purpose of the study is to determine the frequency of the genetic
      abnormalities and polymorphisms described above in the POI Turkish population

    <description>In the framework of our project, abnormalities on the X chromosome will be studied by karyotyping, follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR),nuclear receptor subfamily 5,group A,member 1 (NR5A1),Newborn ovary homeobox gene (NOBOX),Bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP15) genes will be analyzed by sequencing and finally repeat size analysis for FMR1 gene will be performed fragment analyses, on 75 POI and 25 healthy control population.Collected data will enable us to determine the frequency of the abnormalities and polymorphisms described above in the POI Turkish population. Patients free of those genetic variants will help us to identify new loci or genes implicated in POI.</description>
