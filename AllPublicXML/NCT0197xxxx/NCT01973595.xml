  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether incorporating almonds into the diets of
      families with young children will induce beneficial changes in gastrointestinal function, the
      fecal microbiota profile, and immune and inflammatory processes of the adults and children
      resulting in improved quality of life. The investigators anticipate finding an increase in
      beneficial bacteria, improved intestinal function, and decreased inflammation during the
      almond intervention.

      This is a randomized, crossover study. After obtaining informed consent, healthy adults aged
      18-40 years with children aged 3-6 years will be randomized to either consume almonds and
      almond paste during the first arm of the study or during the second arm of the study. During
      the intervention period, adult participants will consume 1.5 ounces of almonds per day, and
      children will consume 0.5 ounces of almonds per day for 3 weeks. After a 4-week washout
      period, participants will be crossed to the other treatment (no almond consumption or almond
      consumption).

      Participants will complete daily questionnaires throughout the intervention period, and one
      week before and after each intervention period. Blood samples will be collected from adults
      at the baseline and final time points of each intervention. Stool samples will be collected
      during the pre-baseline and final weeks of each intervention. Dietary intake will be assessed
      weekly during each intervention period. Gastrointestinal symptoms questionnaires will be
      completed weekly during each intervention.

    <description>Three dietary recalls occurred per study arm, and each recall was scored for quality. The quality scores were averaged per arm and then compared between study arms for each subject/group using the Healthy Eating Index-2010.The Healthy Eating Index assesses diet quality based on 12 components, when summed has maximum points of 100 (HEI scale 0-100).
High component scores indicate intakes close to the recommended ranges or amounts; low component scores indicate less compliance with the recommended ranges or amounts.
National averages total score: children: 54.9 [4-8 years] and adults: 57.4 [31-50 years])</description>

        <description>Three dietary recalls occurred per study arm, and each recall was scored for quality. The quality scores were averaged per arm and then compared between study arms for each subject/group using the Healthy Eating Index-2010.The Healthy Eating Index assesses diet quality based on 12 components, when summed has maximum points of 100 (HEI scale 0-100).
High component scores indicate intakes close to the recommended ranges or amounts; low component scores indicate less compliance with the recommended ranges or amounts.
National averages total score: children: 54.9 [4-8 years] and adults: 57.4 [31-50 years])</description>

          <title>Diet Quality</title>
          <description>Three dietary recalls occurred per study arm, and each recall was scored for quality. The quality scores were averaged per arm and then compared between study arms for each subject/group using the Healthy Eating Index-2010.The Healthy Eating Index assesses diet quality based on 12 components, when summed has maximum points of 100 (HEI scale 0-100).
High component scores indicate intakes close to the recommended ranges or amounts; low component scores indicate less compliance with the recommended ranges or amounts.
National averages total score: children: 54.9 [4-8 years] and adults: 57.4 [31-50 years])</description>
          <population>29 Parents and 29 children were analyzed separately for almonds and no almond consumption; one parent-child pair withdrew prior to no almond consumption control.</population>
