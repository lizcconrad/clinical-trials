      Introduction: Chronic kidney disease is characterized by a progressive deterioration of renal
      function. At the end of the progression, when complications occur (overhydration, electrolyte
      imbalances or retention of uremic toxins), a percentage of patients requiring renal
      replacement therapy (haemodialysis). When starting the haemodialysis, the patient holds the
      residual renal function (RRF) which is lost over time. To preserve the RRF, the patient is
      treated with diuretics loops and / or thiazide diuretics. The effect of this treatment is
      lost when renal function worsens. In this context, there are few studies that explore the use
      and effectiveness of diuretics in patients on haemodialysis 2. Objectives and Hypothesis:

      Hypothesis: The treatment with furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide in haemodialysis patients
      with RRF could:

        -  To decrease in weight gain between haemodialysis sessions.

        -  To increase urine volume.

        -  To decrease the ultrafiltration in haemodialysis sessions ( the long interdialytic
           interval)

      Main Objective:To asses the effect of combined hydrochlorothiazide-furosemide therapy on gain
      weight between haemodialysis sessions in patients with RRF

      Secondary Objective: To asses the effect of combined hydrochlorothiazide-furosemide therapy
      on dialytic, clinical and analytical variables and use of the antihypertensive treatment

      3. Methodology: Randomized open clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of the
      administration of diuretics in haemodialysis patients with residual renal function in single
      centre.

      The population of study are patients with chronic renal disease in haemodialysis therapy that
      they preserve residual renal function ( more 200ml daily of urine). It will be a simple
      randomization, to asses the effect of combined hydrochlorothiazide-furosemide therapy

      After a of 15 days washout without diuretic treatment, patients will be randomized to receive
      or not receive combined diuretic treatment for 1 month. After a 1 month washout , the
      patients will be receive or not the treatment according to cross over trial.
