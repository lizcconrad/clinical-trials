  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic stroke patients exhibit gait pattern alterations which are mainly due to spasticity
      and treated with repetitive multifocal botulinum toxin injection(BTI). Several studies
      demonstrated that single BTI-session in a single muscle of paretic lower limb(LL) improved
      kinematic gait parameters(GP) but surprisingly none of them assessed the effects of
      repetitive multifocal BTI on patient's gait pattern and their duration.

      The aim was to evaluate the impact of repetitive multifocal BTI-sessions on GP of chronic
      stroke patients. To that end, gait of patients has been compared using 3D-gait analysis after
      at least 2 consecutive BTI sessions.

    <textblock>
      All the patients will be tretaed with BTI . these injections will be performed under
      electrical stimulation control (~5mA). The dose, the number of site of injection per muscle
      is at the discretion of the physician according to patients' needs and physicians' routine
      clinical practice. The dilution the most commonly used will depend on the type of BoNT-A
      (BOTOX®, XEOMIN® or DYSPORT®) and was 100 U for 2.5ml (BOTOX® and XEOMIN®) or 500 U for 2.5
      ml (Dysport®).
