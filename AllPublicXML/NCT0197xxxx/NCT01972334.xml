  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of C. difficile infection (CDI) has alarmingly increased over the past several
      years and the affected population has expanded to include those previously at low risk, such
      as children. The annual US financial burden associated with this infection is great and
      estimated to exceed $1.8 billion. C. difficile infection arises when the gut microbial
      ecology is disrupted during interventions notorious for perturbing the delicate microbial
      balance. A well known and common example is the use of antibiotics. Fecal microbiota
      transplant (FMT) has been introduced several decades ago in an attempt to restore the gut
      microbial balance. To this date there have been a great number of reports of success in
      eliminating recurrent C. difficile infections and restoring the gut microbial profile to
      resemble that of the healthy donor. While over 300 cases have been described in the
      literature, there has been no pediatric controlled studies performed to compare its efficacy
      to placebo. Therefore, there is a strong need to determine their safety and efficacy in
      pediatric randomized controlled studies. The investigators hypothesize that children with
      recurrent C. difficile infection will respond to fecal transplant therapy which will modify
      their gut microbial profile. The investigators propose a randomized, placebo controlled,
      pilot study of fecal microbial transplant in children with recurrent C. difficile infection
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fecal microbial transplant in children in preventing
      recurrent C. difficile infection. The investigators anticipate that fecal microbial
      transplant in children with recurrent C. difficile infection will be safe and efficacious and
      will provide these children with a great alternative to a disease that is difficult to treat.
      Results of this study will establish the major role of the gut microbiome in this disease and
      demonstrate the viability of gut microbial transplant in recipients.

      Forty six children with recurrent C. difficle infection will be randomized 1:1 to receive
      either fecal microbial transplant or placebo. The safety and efficacy of this intervention
      will be monitored for one year.
