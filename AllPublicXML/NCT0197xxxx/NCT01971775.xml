  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery is the first standard treatment for stomach cancer, but it still has negative factors
      such as bleeding, leakage, closure, surgery part infection and cardiovascular and lung
      complication by general anesthesia.

      electric cautery is used extensively in surgery room due to the utility of simultaneous
      severance and hemostasis. In some case, the electric current from vitality electrode may
      unexpectedly stimulate or damage nearby muscles and nerves. Ultrasonically activated shears
      (UAS) is a device to transform the protein of organ for organ incision or hemostasis. General
      advantages possibly include shortened operating time, decrease of operative blood loss, and
      relatively less damages to the normal organ. UAS is commonly used in the operation room,
      which is now considered as a secure and useful medical device for for tissue dissection and
      coagulation. Also, it is expected to lower the risk of surgery by reducing operating time and
      blood loss.

      However, clinical evidence is not sufficient for this device until now. Therefore, in this
      study,

        1. Evaluate the utility, efficacy, and safety of energy based device, in the case of open
           gastrectomy

        2. Would like to compare the following two kinds of energy based devices. A. For
           conventional monopolar electrosurgery group : dissection and sealing will be conducted
           by conventional monopolar electrocautery device B. For UAS group : dissection and
           sealing will be conducted by UAS
