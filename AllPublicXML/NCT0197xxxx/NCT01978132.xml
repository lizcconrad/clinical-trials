  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism experience more cardiovascular events compared to
      patients with primary hypertension, independent of the blood pressure level.

      In this research we hypothesize that patients with primary hyperaldosteronism are more
      susceptible to ischemia-reperfusion injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with PHA have an increased risk of cardiovascular events, independent of blood
      pressure level. Also in patients suffering a myocardial infarction, circulating aldosterone
      levels are associated with increased mortality. In animal models of myocardial infarction,
      the administration of exogenous aldosterone increased infarct size, although other studies
      did not report this effect. In similar models, antagonists of the mineralocorticoid receptor
      (MR) reduced infarct size, which was completely abolished in ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73, the
      enzyme that catalyses extracellular formation of the endogenous nucleoside adenosine) and
      adenosine receptor knock-out mice. Therefore, we hypothesize that patients with PHA have an
      increased susceptibility for ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-injury due to down-regulation of the
      enzyme CD73. We will use the reduction in brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) by forearm IR
      as a well-validated endpoint for (endothelial) IR-injury.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Just before the FMD experiment, blood will be drawn for aldosterone and renin levels. These levels will not be determined, unless the brachial artery FMD after ischemia and reperfusion is significantly reduced in patients with primary hyperaldosteronism. We will store the plasma and serum at -20 C. If applicable, the aldosterone and aldosterone-to-renin ratio will be determined to correlate the primary outcome measure to the aldosterone and ARR levels.</description>
