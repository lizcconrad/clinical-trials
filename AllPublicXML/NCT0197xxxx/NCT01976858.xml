  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polyethylene Glycol Loxenatide (PEX168) is a new human glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)
      analogue that created on the basis of the Exenatide and modified by polyethylene glycol
      (PEG).

      This study aims to evaluate the PK, PD and safety by 8-week continuous treatment of PEX168.
