  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to describe the effect of two
      osteopathic techniques - &quot;high velocity, low amplitude&quot; (HVLA) and muscle energy (ME) - on
      thickness, activation, strength, pressure pain threshold (PPT) of the paravertebral muscles
      at the lumbar spine, as well as the peak plantar pressures immediately and after a two-day
      follow-up.

      The muscle thickness of the paravertebral muscles at the lumbar spine, namely internal
      oblique, external oblique and transversus abdominis can be altered after the application of
      'high-velocity low-amplitude'(HVLA)and 'muscle energy' (ME)techniques immediately and after a
      two-day follow-up.

    <description>With the subject lying on his/her side, the therapist will rotate the patient's trunk, flex his/her hip and knee of the upper leg. The therapist positions his caudad forearm over the hip, while the cephalad forearm lies over the patient's shoulder. The therapist's hands will be positioned over the lumbar spine's spinous process to be manipulated.</description>
