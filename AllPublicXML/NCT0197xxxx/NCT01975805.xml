  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there are no published studies comparing the efficacy of Chloraprep and
      povidone-iodine in decreasing postoperative- wound infection in cesarean sections. However,
      there have been studies involving other types of surgery that have compared the efficacy of
      different types of preoperative cleansing agents in preventing postoperative wound infection.
      These studies have shown that controversy exists over which antiseptic skin preparation is
      the most effective for preventing postoperative surgical wound infections. The standard of
      care at Los Angeles County Hospital for preoperative skin antiseptic in cesarean sections is
      povidone- iodine 10% (betadine), however many other hospitals have made the transition to
      using Chloraprep. In an attempt to improve on the current standard of care, we propose a
      quality improvement prospective randomized study to compare the difference in postoperative
      wound complications with the use of povidone- iodine and Chloraprep as a preoperative
      antiseptic in cesarean sections. We hypothesize that Chloraprep will be better than Betadine
      at reducing the incidence of positive bacterial cultures following cesarean sections.
