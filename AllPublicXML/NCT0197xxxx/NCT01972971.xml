  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Warfarin, the major oral anticoagulant currently available in Taiwan, is used for the
      prevention and treatment of a variety of thromboembolic disorders. Under dosing of warfarin
      may cause treatment failure and over dosing may cause bleeding because of its narrow
      therapeutic index. Therefore, it is important to monitor prothrombin time (PT) and
      international normalize ratio (INR) periodically in order to evaluate the appropriateness of
      warfarin dosing.

      Lots of factors influencing warfarin anticoagulation effects include polymorphisms of
      Cytochrome P450 2C9(CYP2C9)and Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1(VKORC1)genes,
      age, weight, diet and concurrent medications. Taking into consideration of physicians' work
      load, pharmacist-managed anticoagulation clinics were set up to help strengthen patient care
      in US to ensure patient medication safety. In addition, differences in genetic polymorphisms
      between Chinese and Caucasian have great impacts on warfarin dosage, and there is still no
      consensus on warfarin utilization guideline in Taiwan. Pharmacist-managed anticoagulation
      clinics provide individualized care, consistent monitoring and patient education. Through
      this service, physicians can get the latest integrated information about their patients,
      patients themselves are more familiar with their medication, and adherence can be improved.
      Therefore, those who take warfarin will get better INR control, less adverse drug-related
      events and treatment failure.

      This is the first prototype of pharmacist clinic for a specific medication in our hospital.
      The adverse drug events and coagulation function data collected through this program can be
      used for the implementation of warfarin treatment guideline in Taiwan in the future. The
      impact of pharmacist clinic can be evaluated by questionnaire of satisfaction and knowledge
      survey. It can be used as a model for implementing other pharmacist-managed clinics and
      improving patient medication safety.

    <description>The INR value collected during the 3 months before enrollment and within 3 months after enrollment, which was proceeded by the one month wash-out period. The bleeding or thromboembolic events during this period were also collected. The outcome was assessed by the percentage of patient time with INR within the target range (1.8-2.4) and incidence of complications.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>patient's warfarin knowledge improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's warfarin-related knowledge would be assessed by questionnaire. The validity of the questionnaire were assessed by experts. This questionnaire contained 9 aspects. the pre-test of warfarin-related knowledge questionnaire was conducted before patient education, and the post-test was conducted 2 months after enrollment in the pharmacist clinic. The correct percentage between pre-test and post-test would be compared.</description>

The per-test was conducted before the patient enrolled to pharmacist clinic, and the post-test was conducted 2 months after enrollment.
