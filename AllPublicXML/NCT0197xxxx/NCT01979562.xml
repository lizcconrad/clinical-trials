  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the skeleton of the legs and the running style in
      order to predict a possible overuse injury.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The running style and the training composition and the body composition are thought to have
      major effect on the development of overuse injuries.

      To define a prevention strategy, one must have the knowledge about risk factors and
      causation. The training composition is very relevant clinically but the underlying factors
      have not been studied yet. For the present there is no scientifical evidence of a possible
      relation between the body composition such as the mutual length and width of femur and tibia
      and the development of overuse injuries.

      Thus, the aim of this study is to achieve evidence-based knowledge of these factors in order
      to advice runners about the precautions and to avoid that people get a sedentary lifestyle.
