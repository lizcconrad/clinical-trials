  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implantation failure remains one of the major factors limiting success in IVF treatment. It
      was postulated that the local injury to endometrium induces secretions of cytokines and
      growth factors such as leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin-11, and heparin-binding
      EGF-like growth factor which enhance decidualisation and facilitate implantation. It may also
      up-regulate the gene expressions related to endometrial receptivity and optimize the
      endometrial development. In stimulated cycles, local injury to the proliferative endometrium
      has been postulated to delay endometrial development thereby inducing synchronicity between
      endometrium and embryo stage and facilitate implantation (Zhou et al, 2008; Almog et al,
      2010; Gnainsky et al, 2010) The aim of the study is to determine whether endometrial injury
      by endometrial biopsy in mid-secretory phase of the preceding cycle would improve the
      on-going pregnancy rate in subfertile women undergoing IVF treatment.

      Consecutive women attending subfertility clinic at Queen Mary Hospital, University of Hong
      Kong who are scheduled for IVF treatment will be recruited. Women who have normal uterine
      cavity will be randomized into study and control groups in 1 to 1 ratio according to a
      computer-generated randomization list. Patients will be stratified according to the first or
      repeated cycle.

      For patients in the study group, in the cycle immediately preceding the scheduled IVF
      treatment, LH surge will be determined by daily serum LH level starting from 18 days before
      the next expected period. LH surge is defined as an elevation of LH to 2 times the level of
      the average of the previous 3 days and the absolute level of the LH should be more than or
      equal to 20 IU/L. Women randomized into the study group will have endometrial biopsy
      performed by pipelle 7 days after the LH surge (LH+7) and they will be instructed to use
      non-hormonal means of contraception during that cycle. All patients will then proceed to IVF
      treatment in the next cycle as scheduled. They will receive standard ovarian stimulation
      according to the departmental protocol and have a maximum of two embryos replaced 2 days
      after the oocyte retrieval. On-going pregnancy rates between the two groups will be compared.
