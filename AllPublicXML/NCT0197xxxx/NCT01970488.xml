    <measure>Percent Improvement From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI measures the average redness (erythema), thickness (induration), and scaliness (each graded on a 0 to 4 scale) of psoriasis lesions, weighted by the area of involvement in the four main body areas (i.e., head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities). PASI scores can range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores indicating greater severity and/or more extensive psoriasis.
Percent improvement from baseline was calculated as (value at baseline - value at post-baseline visit) × 100 / (value at baseline).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Body Surface Area (BSA) Involved With Psoriasis at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>A measurement of psoriasis involvement, given as the physician's assessment of the percentage of the participant's total body surface area (BSA) involved with psoriasis. The percent of BSA affected was estimated by assuming that the subject's palm, excluding the fingers and thumb, represented roughly 1% of the body's surface.
Change from baseline is calculated as (value at post-baseline visit - value at baseline).
A decrease from baseline (negative value) indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug until 28 days after the last dose. Treatment was for 16 weeks in Part 1 and 32 weeks in Part 2.</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigator assessed whether each adverse event (AE) was possibly related to the investigational product. AEs were graded for severity according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.
A serious AE is defined as an AE that meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria:
fatal
life threatening
requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
congenital anomaly/birth defect
other medically important serious event. Results are reported from Day 1 to week 16 for the Part 1 ABP 501 and Adalimumab groups, and from post week 16 to the end of study (week 52) for the Part 2 ABP 501/ABP 501, Adalimumab/Adalimumab and Adalimumab/ABP 501 groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Developing Antibodies to ABP 501 or Adalimumab</measure>
    <time_frame>For 16 weeks in Part 1 and for 52 weeks for participants who were re-randomized in Part 2.</time_frame>
    <description>Two validated assays were used to detect the presence of anti-drug antibodies. Samples were first tested in an electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based bridging immunoassay to detect anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against ABP 501 and adalimumab (Binding Antibody Assay). Samples confirmed to be positive for binding antibodies were subsequently tested in a non-cell based bioassay to determine neutralizing activity against ABP 501 or adalimumab (Neutralizing Antibody Assay).
Developing antibody incidence is defined as a negative or no antibody result at baseline and a positive antibody result at a post-baseline time point.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at 49 centers in 6 countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, and Poland).
Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive ABP 501 or adalimumab.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Randomization was stratified based on prior biologic use for psoriasis and geographic region. At week 16 participants with a PASI 50 response (≥ 50% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score) continued on study; those initially randomized to adalimumab were re-randomized to receive either ABP 501 or adalimumab.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percent Improvement From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) at Week 16</title>
        <description>The PASI measures the average redness (erythema), thickness (induration), and scaliness (each graded on a 0 to 4 scale) of psoriasis lesions, weighted by the area of involvement in the four main body areas (i.e., head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities). PASI scores can range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores indicating greater severity and/or more extensive psoriasis.
Percent improvement from baseline was calculated as (value at baseline – value at post-baseline visit) × 100 / (value at baseline).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a PASI 75 Response at Week 32</title>
        <description>A PASI 75 response is a 75% or greater improvement (reduction) from baseline in PASI score.
The PASI measures the average redness (erythema), thickness (induration), and scaliness (each graded on a 0 to 4 scale) of psoriasis lesions, weighted by the area of involvement in the four main body areas (i.e., head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities). PASI scores can range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores indicating greater severity and/or more extensive psoriasis.</description>

        <description>A measurement of psoriasis involvement, given as the physician’s assessment of the percentage of the participant’s total body surface area (BSA) involved with psoriasis. The percent of BSA affected was estimated by assuming that the subject’s palm, excluding the fingers and thumb, represented roughly 1% of the body’s surface.
Change from baseline is calculated as (value at post-baseline visit - value at baseline).
A decrease from baseline (negative value) indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Developing Antibodies to ABP 501 or Adalimumab</title>
        <description>Two validated assays were used to detect the presence of anti-drug antibodies. Samples were first tested in an electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based bridging immunoassay to detect anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against ABP 501 and adalimumab (Binding Antibody Assay). Samples confirmed to be positive for binding antibodies were subsequently tested in a non-cell based bioassay to determine neutralizing activity against ABP 501 or adalimumab (Neutralizing Antibody Assay).
Developing antibody incidence is defined as a negative or no antibody result at baseline and a positive antibody result at a post-baseline time point.</description>

        <description>A PASI 90 response is a 90% or greater improvement (reduction) from baseline in PASI score. The PASI measures the average redness (erythema), thickness (induration), and scaliness (each graded on a 0 to 4 scale) of psoriasis lesions, weighted by the area of involvement in the four main body areas (i.e., head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities). PASI scores can range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores indicating greater severity and/or more extensive psoriasis.</description>

          <description>A PASI 90 response is a 90% or greater improvement (reduction) from baseline in PASI score.
The PASI measures the average redness (erythema), thickness (induration), and scaliness (each graded on a 0 to 4 scale) of psoriasis lesions, weighted by the area of involvement in the four main body areas (i.e., head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities). PASI scores can range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores indicating greater severity and/or more extensive psoriasis.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
