  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the outcomes of three currently available regenerative treatments
      (FloGraft, autologous stem cell therapy, platelet rich plasma therapy) for painful
      degenerative conditions of the joints. Patients receiving one these treatments will be
      assessed before the treatment procedure and followed up at four points over the six months
      after their procedure. Patients' pain, quality of life, and pain medication use at follow up
      will be compared to baseline levels. The investigators hypothesize that all three treatments
      will be effective in reducing pain, improving quality of life, and reducing pain medication
      usage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized study assessing the efficacy of three potentially
      regenerative treatments for degenerative conditions of the joints of the lower back (facet,
      sacroiliac), upper extremities (e.g., shoulder), and lower extremities (e.g., hip, knee).
      These treatments are:

        1. A single injection of Applied Biologics' FloGraftTM.

        2. A single injection of autologous bone marrow derived stem cells.

        3. A single injection of platelet rich plasma.

      Subjects will be assessed prior to treatment for their level of pain, quality of life, and
      pain medication usage. Subjects will be followed up at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24
      weeks after treatment. At each of these follow up visits, pain, quality of life, and pain
      medication usage will be assessed.

      The investigators hypothesize that all three treatment groups will experience reduced pain,
      improved quality of life, and reduced pain medication usage at follow up.
