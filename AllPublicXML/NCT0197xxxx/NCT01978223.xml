  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to estimate the effectiveness of Rotarix™ vaccine against Rotavirus severe
      gastroenteritis (RV SGE) among hospitalised children aged between 12 weeks and &lt; 5 years, in
      Venezuela and to assess the current disease burden after introduction of the vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The data generated in this study will be useful for public health officers and policy makers
      in confirming the country-wide public health benefit of Rotarix™.

      No vaccine will be administered during this study.

  <overall_status>Withdrawn</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    As vaccine coverage rates have drastically improved in Venezuela, the study lost its objective
    to show positive impact of the vaccine to stimulate higher usage
