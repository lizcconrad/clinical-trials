  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal diabetes in pregnancy can negatively impact fetal well-being and contribute to
      adverse pregnancy outcomes. Much of the morbidity associated with diabetes in pregnancy can
      be minimized with tight glucose control. A number of studies in non-pregnant populations have
      highlighted the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of text messaging interventions for
      improving diabetic compliance and control. This study will investigate whether a text
      messaging intervention is feasible and effective in an urban, diabetic, obstetric clinic and
      whether this intervention can improve compliance with diabetes care, glucose control and
      pregnancy outcomes. The study will also assess satisfaction with the intervention itself.
