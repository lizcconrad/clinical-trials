    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory failure may occur early in the postoperative course, requiring endotracheal
      intubation and mechanical ventilation in selected patients, thus increasing morbidity and
      mortality and prolonging intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay.We will perform a
      multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial to compare the efficacy of non invasive
      ventilation (NIV) which associated pressure support ventilation (PSV: 5 to 15 cmH2O) and
      positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP: 5 to 10 cmH2O) with standard oxygen therapy in the
      treatment of postoperative acute respiratory failure. We also set out to examine the
      hypothesis that early application of NIV may prevent intubation and mechanical ventilation in
      patients who develop acute respiratory failure after abdominal surgery.

      The Non-Invasive Ventilation After Surgery (NIVAS) is an investigator-initiated,
      multi-center, stratified, two-arm parallel-group trial with a computer-generated allocation
      sequence and electronic system based randomization. The study protocol and statistical
      analysis plan were approved for all centers by a central Ethics Committee (France) according
      to French law.The NIVAS study is conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and
      was registered on August 2013.All centers have a long experience with NIV (more than 10 years
      of NIV use for ARF, and more than 5 years of NIV use for ARF following abdominal surgery).
      Randomization will stratified by department, age (less or more 60 years), site of surgery
      (upper or lower abdominal) and according to the presence or absence of postoperative epidural
      analgesia as this may influence outcomes. Treatment assignments will concealed from patients,
      research staff, the statistician, and the data monitoring and safety committee.
