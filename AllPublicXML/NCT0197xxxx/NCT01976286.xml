      The purpose of this study is to find out the safety and effectiveness of Glycolic Acid
      Chemical Peels compared to Salicylic Acid Chemical Peels for the treatment of melasma.

      Participants in this study will be patients who are clinically diagnosed with at least a 2 x
      2 cm patch of melasma on each side of their face (forehead or cheek). One half of the
      subject's face will be randomly selected to receive 4 treatments of 30% glycolic acid peels
      and the other half of the face will receive 4 treatments of 30% salicylic acid peels/ weeks
      0, 4, 8, and 12. Follow up visit will be at week 16. This study is a pilot study designed to
      determine feasibility of these procedures.

    <description>The primary outcome was a blinded rating of the treatment area (Salicylic Acid Peels Versus Glycolic Acid Peels) with the best overall cosmetic appearance. A dermatologist will blindly evaluate the treated areas of each side from live subjects at baseline and on the final follow up visit (week 16).</description>
