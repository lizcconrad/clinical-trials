      This study is for the development and validation of functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) parameters as biomarkers for analyzing extent of disease and quantifying response to
      treatment in patients with myelofibrosis. Quantitative MRI parameters for diffusion of water
      and/or fat content in bone marrow will determine extent of disease in patients with
      myelofibrosis, and changes in these parameters will predict response to therapy. To
      investigate this hypothesis, the researchers will perform this pilot clinical study of
      diffusion and fat content (T1 weighted imaging) in patients before and during treatment for
      myelofibrosis. The researchers expect to identify MRI parameters that determine the extent
      and severity of bone marrow disease in these patients and determine response to therapy at
      earlier time points than currently used clinical parameters. This research will lay the
      foundation for larger clinical trials using MRI to assess and predict effects of existing and
      new therapeutic agents for patients with myelofibrosis.

      This study proposes that more advanced MRI techniques currently used in clinical medicine can
      be applied to enable response to therapy to be determined earlier than currently is possible
      for patients with myelofibrosis. In particular, this study is designed to determine to what
      extent abnormalities in diffusion of water molecules (diffusion MRI) and/or fat content in
      bone marrow (T1-weighted imaging) define extent of initial disease and serve as early
      predictors of response to therapy.

    <description>Enrolled subjects will have an MRI scan performed at baseline (within 1 month before beginning therapy), at the time of a scheduled bone marrow biopsy or end of treatment cycle (6 months), and after 12 months.
Please note: Patients in this study will be treated with chemotherapy as determined by the hematologist or the treatment protocol for an independent clinical trial for therapy of myelofibrosis. Treatment and monitoring will be performed under the usual standard of care that includes physical examinations, laboratory testing, and other indicated imaging examinations.</description>
