             the vaccines, including gelatin or neomycin.

          -  Major congenital defects or serious chronic illnesses.

          -  History of any neurologic disorders or seizures. A single, simple febrile seizure is
             allowed.

          -  Subjects with history of intussusceptions or uncorrected congenital malformation of
             the gastrointestinal tract that would predispose for intussusceptions.
