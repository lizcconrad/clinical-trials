      This study investigates if using a very low carbohydrate diet during combined chemotherapy
      and radiation therapy is safe and if it can be tolerated by patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard treatment for head &amp; neck cancer often includes chemotherapy concurrent with
      radiation therapy (chemoradiation).

      This study is a phase I trial to determine the safety of dietary manipulation during
      chemoradiation for head &amp; neck cancer. Specifically, pre-clinical data from mouse studies
      indicates a ketogenic diet increases tumor cell killing.

      Participants will:

        -  Utilize a specialized ketogenic diet designed by bionutritional services of the clinical
           research unit. This diet begins 2 days before chemoradiation and continues through at
           least 5 weeks of chemoradiation.

        -  Have blood drawn for research purposes weekly to determine measurements of oxidative
           stress

        -  Have urine collected sporadically through the study to determine measurements of
           oxidative stress

        -  Keep a diary of concomitant medications, side effects, and blood sugars

        -  Have follow-up to monitor for outcomes and overall survival

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically documented squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx,
             larynx or hypopharynx. HPV status will not be assessed for eligibility; while HPV
             status may affect response to therapy, efficacy is not an outcome measure for this
             phase I study.

          -  Candidate for primary chemoradiation as decided by an interdisciplinary team including
             otolaryngology, medical oncology, and radiation oncology.
