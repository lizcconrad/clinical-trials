    <textblock>
      This study evaluated Brain 101: The Concussion Play book, an intervention that provides
      education and resources on concussion management for high schools. The study hypotheses were
      that athletes and parents who viewed the Brain 101 program would demonstrate increased
      knowledge and self efficacy in concussion management, and that use of the intervention would
      positively affect school concussion management practices.

    <description>Brain 101: The Concussion Play book is a web-based, stand-alone guide for school leaders on effective policies and practices in concussion management. The website offers a school-wide approach to preventing and managing sports concussion, including a) training for educators, athletics staff, students, and parents; b) guidelines for creating a concussion management team; and c) information on strategies for supporting students in the classroom following concussion.</description>

    <description>Brain 101: The Concussion Play book is a web-based, stand-alone guide for school leaders on effective policies and practices in concussion management. Consistent with the literature on effective school-based change efforts, the website offers a comprehensive, school-wide approach to preventing and managing sports concussion, including training for educators, athletics staff, students, and parents. The website presents guidelines for creating a concussion management team (CMT) that meets regularly to support students as they return to academics, extra-curricular activities, and athletics. It also includes information on strategies for supporting students in the classroom following concussion (e.g., designing reduced school schedules, monitoring school performance following concussion).</description>
