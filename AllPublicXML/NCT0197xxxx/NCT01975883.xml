      Analyzing peri operative changes in blood glucose levels from non-diabetic patients
      undergoing spine surgery

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Blood glucose (BG) dysregulation is a well-known situation in medical or surgical
      severe circumstances. However BG levels following spine surgery have never been described
      before. Our primary purpose is to measure postoperative changes in BG levels of non-diabetic
      patients undergoing spine surgery.

      Methods: Non-diabetic consecutive adult patients undergoing spine surgery are going to be
      prospectively included during a 6 months period. BG capillary measures are collected from the
      preoperative fasting period to the end of postoperative day 3, six times a day. Three main
      glycemic parameters are calculated: Delta Day 0 (DD0), Day 2 mean (D2), and Hyperglycemic
      Index (HGI). In the peri operative period, no change in oral intake nor in intravenous fluids
      is prescribed. Patients are followed-up for three months postoperatively for any early
      adverse event, requiring or not surgical revision.

    <time_frame>6 times a day, for 3 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Blood glucose levels are measured at the following times: before being lead to the operating room, fasting ; 2 hours after post anesthesia care unit admission ; 30 min before and 2 hours after breakfast, lunch and dinner on the first postoperative day. The same schedule was repeated on the second and the third day after surgery</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>postoperative local or general, surgical or medical, complication</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks after surgery for each patient</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are followed on consultation by the medical team six weeks after surgery to determine the occurrence of either surgical revision (due to surgical site infection defined by the criteria of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mechanical or neurological complication), or any other early local or general complication such as wound healing impairment, deep venous thromboembolic or cardiovascular event.</description>

    <description>Sequential patients scheduled for spine surgery, including degenerative, deformative, tumoral and traumatologic indications are eligible to participate. Exclusion criteria are the following : infection or history of infection of surgical site, past medical history of diabetes mellitus, defined as chronic glucose intolerance either insulin-dependent or non insulin-dependent at the time of operation, and patients with preoperative random BG levels greater than 126 mg/dl considering they could also represent undiagnosed diabetes</description>
