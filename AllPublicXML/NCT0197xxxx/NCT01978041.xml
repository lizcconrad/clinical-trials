  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The importance of fluoridated water to control caries is well recognized. Although the mode
      of action of fluoridated water is known (related to a slight increase in fluoride
      concentration in saliva/dental biofilm in individuals living in fluoridated areas), the
      kinetics of fluoride concentration in saliva after ingestion of food prepared with
      fluoridated water, either from fluoride remaining in the oral cavity after mastication, or
      from fluoride returning from salivary secretion is not known in details. Therefore, the aim
      of this study is to assess fluoride bioavailability after ingestion of food prepared with
      fluoridated water. The study will be in vivo, crossover and double blind, in which 12 adult
      volunteers will participate. In 4 experimental phases, volunteers will ingest: a. a typical
      Brazilian meal cooked with non-fluoridated water (&lt;0.1 ppm F); b. a typical Brazilian meal
      cooked with fluoridated water (1 ppm F); c. non fluoridated water (&lt;0.1 ppm F) and d.
      fluoridated water (1 ppm F). Immediately before and 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180 minutes
      after the ingestion, a blood sample will be collected by digital puncture, and a sample of
      unstimulated saliva will be collected. Fluoride concentration in the samples will be
      determined by an ion specific electrode adapted for microanalysis. Results will be analyzed
      by ANOVA, with significance limit of 5%.
