      The aim of the present study is to investigate the changes in body composition and the degree
      of compensation to exercise induced energy expenditure after 1 year of physical activity with
      either moderate or vigorous intensity in overweight and class 1 obese men and women. The
      present study is a sub study to main study &quot;Active Commuting To Improve Well-being and Health
      in Everyday Life&quot; (NCT 01962259)
