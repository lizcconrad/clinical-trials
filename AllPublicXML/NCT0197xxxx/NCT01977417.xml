  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prediabetes, characterized by elevated fasting blood sugar or exaggerated blood sugar
      response to sugar ingestion, effects over 79 million adult Americans and is a precursor to
      the development of Type 2 diabetes. Importantly, approximately 42% of Iowans (950,000) have
      diabetes and 32% (670,000) have prediabetes with the majority of those with prediabetes going
      undiagnosed. Adults with prediabetes demonstrate early signs of cardiovascular and nervous
      system abnormalities and are at high risk for developing overt diabetes unless aggressive
      lifestyle (weight loss, exercise) or pharmacological interventions are employed.
      Interestingly, data in recent years has linked obesity and diabetes to chronic inflammation
      of the blood vessels and brain areas that regulate blood pressure. Therefore, the current
      study will test whether a commonly used aspirin-like anti-inflammatory drug called salsalate,
      will improve blood vessel health and nervous system dysfunction in adults with prediabetes.
      Eligible subjects will have measurements of blood pressure, blood vessel function in the arms
      and eyes, assessments of nerve activity, and blood samples taken before and after 4 weeks of
      ingesting an FDA approved aspirin-like drug called salsalate. The study is important because
      it will identify a potentially new pharmacological strategy to treat vascular and nervous
      system abnormalities in overweight and obese adults with early stage type 2 diabetes using an
      inexpensive, generically available drug with an excellent safety record that has been used
      for decades to treat chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. If proven
      effective, this will provide preliminary support for the concept of targeting inflammation as
      a new clinical approach to treating early diabetes related complications. Furthermore, the
      current pilot study will provide support for developing a larger clinical trial using
      salsalate that could potentially then be extended to patients with type 2 diabetes and
      cardiovascular disease, as well as lead to the development of new anti-inflammatory agents
      with greater specificity for selective inflammatory pathways.
