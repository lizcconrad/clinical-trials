      Primary: To observe how hemodynamic parameters are affected by age during rest and exercise
      in healthy humans. Furthermore, how an acute fluid challenge changes hemodynamic parameters.

      Secondary: To thoroughly examine this population with regard to cardiac performance and
      function, anthropometrics, metabolic status, exercise capability, constitution, pulmonary
      status, and humoral markers of organ functions. This population will serve as a healthy
      control group, to which different populations can be compared, hence the need for a
      comprehensive characterization.

      Hypotheses:

      Diastolic function and parameters associated with diastolic function gradually deteriorate
      with increasing age. The gradual deterioration is unmasked at an earlier age during exercise
      and fluid challenge, compared to measurements made at rest.
