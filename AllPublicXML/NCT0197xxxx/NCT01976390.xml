  <brief_title>Comparing Everolimus and Sirolimus in Renal Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Prospective, Randomized, Single Center Pilot Study Comparing Patient and Graft Survival, Adverse Events and Tolerability of Zortress® (Everolimus) Versus Rapamune® (Sirolimus) in Combination With Low Dose Neoral® (Cyclosporine) Dosed by C2 Monitoring, in Deceased and Living Donor Renal Transplant Recipients Under a Thymoglobulin® (Antithymocyte Globulin) and Rapid Steroid Induction Protocol.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to compare the effectiveness and safety of two different kidney
      transplant immunosuppression drugs, Zortress (the study drug) and Rapamune (which is used in
      the current standard immunosuppression regimen).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Zortress is FDA approved, is used as standard of care at some other institutions, and may
      also be given as standard of care if it is believed to be the best immunosuppression regimen
      for a particular kidney transplant recipient. The rationale for testing Zortress vs. Rapamune
      is to determine which of these drugs is more effective in preventing chronic rejection of the
      transplanted kidney. Because these two drugs are related to each other there is no current
      literature addressing the replacement of Rapamune with Zortress in an immunosuppression
      regimen, therefore the goal of this study is to compare these two immunosuppression drugs.

    <description>The primary objective of this pilot study will be to determine equivalency of Zortress® as compared to Rapamune® when used in our de novo immunosuppression regimen following renal transplantation. The primary endpoint will be a composite endpoint of graft survival (non-death censored) and biopsy proven acute rejection at 1 year. The primary outcome of immunosuppressive protection would be studied in our Thymoglobulin and rapid steroid discontinuation protocol, with &quot;half-dose&quot; Neoral as described above.</description>
