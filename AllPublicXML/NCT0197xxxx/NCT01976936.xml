    <textblock>
      This trial will be a phase 2 randomized safety study in which ischemic stroke patients will
      be randomly assigned within 24 hours of symptom onset to placebo or standard dose lovastatin
      versus short-term high-dose lovastatin 640 mg per day for 3 days. The primary outcome of this
      Phase 2 study will be musculoskeletal and hepatic toxicity, defined by clinical and
      laboratory criteria, with a 3-month follow-up period (Â± 1 week). Secondary outcomes will
      include neurological outcome (National Institute of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale), functional
      outcomes (Barthel Index), and handicap (modified Rankin scores). Effects on inflammatory
      markers and lipid levels will also be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 randomized, blinded and controlled safety study in patients with ischemic
      stroke. The time window for enrollment will be within 0-24 hours of symptom onset. For
      patients who are found with the stroke on awakening, it will be assumed that the stroke
      occurred the last time that the patient was known to be normal. All patients will be
      identified by the stroke acute care team in the emergency room of the participating centers,
      or in some cases, on the floor services of the hospital (i.e., for patients with stroke
      occurring in hospital). If preliminary data indicate that the patient meets eligibility
      criteria the patient (or legally authorized representative) will be approached about
      participation in the study, and consent obtained. Surrogate consent will be allowed at
      centers at which this is permitted according to regulations. Patients who are consented
      through a surrogate and subsequently regain capacity, will be approached and reconsented to
      continue in the study.

      The intervention chosen for this trial is either (1) placebo for patients not taking a statin
      at the time of admission OR lovastatin 80 mg in place of their regular statin for patients
      taking a statin (atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin,
      lovastatin) at time of enrolment VERSUS (2) oral lovastatin at dosage of 640 mg daily for 3
      days. The time of first dose will be considered time 0. Patients will be administered the
      total daily dose in four daily divided doses (i.e., QID schedule). After the initial 3 days
      of acute dosage, all patients will receive statin therapy at the discretion of their treating
      physician.

The primary safety outcome will be defined as:
Liver toxicity: LFT increase at any time point &gt; 3X upper limit of normal or development of jaundice, otherwise unexplained coagulopathy, or other clinical evidence of hepatitis or liver failure;
or
Muscle toxicity: An increase in CK (Creatine Kinase) at any time point &gt; 10 X upper limit of normal, or clinical evidence of muscle pain or weakness not related to the stroke and associated with CK &gt; 5 X upper limit of normal.</description>
