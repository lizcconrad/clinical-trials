      There is no convincing evidence for the efficacy of moxibustion for primary dysmenorrhea, due
      to low methodologic quality and small sample size. The investigators designed the random
      clinical trial to investigates the effectiveness of moxibustion in treating primary
      dysmenorrhea, the purpose of this study is to provide the research base of moxibustion
      efficacy. The investigators also examined the acceptability and any adverse effects
      associated with the use of moxibustion.
