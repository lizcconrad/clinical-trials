    <textblock>
      The objective of this post-market clinical study is to compare one to three year post
      treatment results, range of motion, strength, patient related functional outcomes and patient
      satisfaction, of internal fixation using the Sonoma Orthopedic Products CRx™ as compared to
      nonoperative management (e.g. sling) of similar displaced midshaft clavicle fractures.
