  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately two thirds of the adult population in developed countries is categorized as
      over-weight or obese (BMI&gt;30). In spite of worldwide increasing awareness, obesity is a major
      health concern. In the presence of numerous diets, medical therapies, and robust research,
      bariatric surgery remains the most effective means of weight reduction in morbidly obese
      patients (BMI&gt;40, or BMI&gt;35 with co-morbidities). However, bariatric surgery harbors a
      relatively high risk for postoperative complications; of them, venous thromboembolic events
      (VTE) are not common, but potentially lethal. Taken together with the propensity of morbidly
      obese patients to develop VTE, perioperative thromboprophylaxis is mandatory.

      To date, low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are most commonly used for VTE prophylaxis in
      the aforementioned population. Due to the pharmacologic properties of LMWH and the
      characteristics of surgically treated obese patients, the optimal dose that is to be utilized
      for VTE prophylaxis in this population remains unclear. Assessment of anti-FXa levels in the
      patients' plasma can be used in order to monitor LMWH activity. Levels of 0.2-0.5 U/ml have
      been proposed by some authors for VTE prophylaxis.

      Few studies have compared different dosing regimens of enoxaparin (between 30mg-60mg q/12h)
      for VTE prophylaxis in the population undergoing bariatric surgery; nevertheless, these were
      small non- randomized trials, containing numerous methodological weaknesses. Hence, the
      optimal regimen of enoxaparin to be used for the prevention of VTE in the discussed
      population remains unclear.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate plasma levels of anti-FXa activity, comparing two
      most commonly used enoxaparin prophylactic regimens (40mg vs 60mg q/24h) in a large and
      homogenous cohort of sleeve gastrectomy patients. Although universally used by bariatric
      surgeons, the pharmacologic efficacy of these regimens has not been evaluated in patients
      undergoing bariatric surgery.

      The following steps shall be performed in the process of recruiting a patient for the study:

      Preoperatively:

        -  A baseline blood sample for Anti-FXa levels shall be obtained.

        -  Randomization of the patient to one of the two treatment groups

      Postoperatively:

        -  All patients will be treated with Sequential Compression Devices, massive I.V hydration
           and encouraged to ambulate early.

        -  Patients will receive three injections of enoxaparin, according to the treatment group
           they were assigned to, The first injection given on the morning after surgery. Four
           hours after the third injection of enoxaparin a blood sample will be taken from the
           patients and assessed for anti-FXa levels.

      A control group of 5 patients, randomly elected, will be recruited. This group will not be
      treated with enoxaparin. These patients will be treated with sequential compression devices
      and massive I.V hydration, an accepted treatment, proven effective for the studied
      population. The goal is to assess the anti-FXa levels in these patients, representing the
      baseline levels in patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.

      Furthermore, the preoperative, operative and postoperative management of these patients will
      be identical to that of the treatment groups and on the third day post-operation a blood
      sample from these patients will be retrieved and assessed for anti-FXa levels.
