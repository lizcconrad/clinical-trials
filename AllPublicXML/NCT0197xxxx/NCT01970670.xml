      The primary objective is to determine how accurately one can estimate the size of the index
      tumor on preoperative imaging in patients with known breast cancer, using pathology as a
      reference standard. The primary endpoint, which will be measured on CEDM,and CE-MRI, is the
      maximum diameter (mm) of the index tumor.

        Identify exclusion criteria

          1. Unwilling or unable to undergo informed consent

          2. Planned to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy

          3. Breast implants

          4. Pregnant (NOTE: If subject is unsure of pregnancy status, a pregnancy test will be
