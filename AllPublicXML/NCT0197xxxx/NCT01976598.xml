      To explore the optimal stimulation parameters and locations for sub-perception programming in
      patients with previously implanted spinal cord stimulation systems for the treatment of
      chronic back and/or leg pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain remains a serious public health problem, resulting in approximately 100 million
      chronic pain patients in the U.S. alone [1]. While numerous treatments exist, none completely
      addresses this issue. In particular, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has become an established
      technique for treating patients with chronic neuropathic pain [2]. The conventional paradigm
      for SCS treatment is to attempt to mask the pain by substituting the pain sensation with
      paresthesias [3]; however, newer studies have shown that it is possible to gain excellent
      pain relief without concomitant paresthesias (&quot;sub-threshold stimulation&quot;) using different
      stimulation parameters [4] [5]. Because these paresthesia-free programming paradigms are
      still new, the best to place the stimulation and the best programming parameters to use is
      still unclear, making it difficult to place the leads during surgical implantation and to
      program the patient afterwards. Additionally, sub-threshold stimulation does not provide
      immediate pain relief, but may take several hours or even days to feel relief, making a
      simple programming session of a few hours insufficient to determine the optimal stimulation
      placement. While these differences from conventional SCS make programming more difficult
      initially, studying this new stimulation paradigm, especially differences in optimal
      stimulation location and the time course of pain relief, may also provide insight into the
      mechanism of action of sub-threshold stimulation. This protocol aims to study the optimal
      stimulation parameters and locations with SCS using sub-threshold stimulation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary pain complaint of persistent or recurrent low back and/or leg pain, with or
             without leg pain, for at least 180 days prior to Baseline.

          -  Received a Boston Scientific SCS System with active contacts located between superior
             endplate of T7 and the inferior endplate of T10 with a minimum of three active
             contacts within this anatomical area.

          -  No back surgery within 180 days prior to Baseline.

          -  Has had stimulator &quot;on&quot; (activated or operational) for at least 36 hours prior to
             Baseline evaluation.

          -  Average low back and/or leg pain intensity, during the position/activity which
             routinely causes worst pain, of 5 or greater on a 0-10 numerical rating scale without
             neurostimulation.

          -  If taking prescription opioids for primary chronic pain complaint (low back and/or leg
             pain), must have been on a stable prescription (same drug(s) and dose(s)) for 30 days
             prior to Baseline

          -  Consumed an average total daily morphine equivalent of â‰¤300 mg during the 30 days
             prior to Baseline

          -  Willing and able to comply with all protocol-required procedures and
             assessments/evaluations (e.g. willing to comply with opioid prescription lock
             throughout the study, changes to the stimulation parameters, complete twice-daily
             diary)

          -  22 years of age or older when written informed consent is obtained
