  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An international, multi-center, prospective, blinded, randomized, controlled trial. The
      objective is to demonstrate that catheter-based renal denervation is an effective and safe
      treatment for uncontrolled hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the 6 month follow-up required testing has been completed, control group subjects would
      be unblinded to their randomization group and would have an option, at the discretion of the
      Investigator and with written concurrence of the medical monitor, to be treated with renal
      denervation procedure. However, after enrollment closure, subjects previously randomized were
      no longer allowed to cross-over.
