    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the study is to evaluate if the ad libitum use of the Tobacco Heating
      System 2.2 (THS 2.2) for 5 consecutive days by adult Japanese healthy smokers affects the
      levels of biomarkers of exposure for selected harmful and potentially harmful constituents
      (HPHCs) compared to smoking conventional cigarettes (CC) and smoking abstinence (SA).
