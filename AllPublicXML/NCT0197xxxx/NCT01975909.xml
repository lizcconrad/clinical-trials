  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA) refers to a family of genetic diseases that cause progressive
      problems with gait and balance, as well as other debilitating symptoms. This is a randomized
      controlled pilot study to test a novel therapeutic intervention that uses noninvasive
      magnetic brain stimulation to improve functional outcomes in patients with SCA. The study
      will include quantitative evaluations of gait, balance, and brain physiology to examine
      possible objective end-points for a future, larger multi-site clinical trial. The
      investigators anticipate that patients receiving the real intervention will show a functional
      gain.

    <textblock>
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA) refers to a family of genetic diseases that cause progressive
      problems with gait and balance, as well as other debilitating symptoms. There is no cure for
      SCA and a lack of an effective symptomatic treatment.

      Investigators will recruit 20 patients with genetically-confirmed SCA to use a novel approach
      - noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) - to improve balance, gait, and posture
      in patients with SCA. Half will be randomly assigned to a real intervention, and half to a
      sham (control) intervention. The TMS intervention will consist of 20 stimulation sessions
      over a four week period. At baseline and follow-up, patients will undergo comprehensive
      assessments including several SCA rating scales, along with sophisticated tests of balance
      (ie. walking, standing, and muscle coordination). Patients will also complete a series of
      neurophysiologic tests to evaluate the function of the cerebellum and its connections before
      and after the intervention.

      Investigators anticipate patients receiving real TMS will show better balance, fewer falls,
      and improved mobility, while those undergoing sham stimulation will show no benefits. If our
      prediction is correct, this study will provide evidence-based support for a new treatment to
      improve the lives of patients with SCA.

    <description>Assess 8 items: gait, stance, sitting, speech, dysmetria, kinetic tremor, pro- and supinations of the hand, and the heel-shin slide. Each item is scored by the physician on a 4 to 8 numerical scale based upon the amount of dysfunction observed while performing the task. The maximum possible score for the total scale is 40. Lower scores of SARA represents better task performance.</description>

    <description>Mobility and turning is assessed by the timed up-and-go test (Podsiadlo &amp; Richardson, 1991). The participant will be seated in an armed chair. On the word &quot;go,&quot; the subject will stand up using the arm rests if needed, walk (with assistive device if needed) around a cone placed three meters in front of the chair, return and sit down as quickly as possible.</description>

        <description>Assess 8 items: gait, stance, sitting, speech, dysmetria, kinetic tremor, pro- and supinations of the hand, and the heel-shin slide. Each item is scored by the physician on a 4 to 8 numerical scale based upon the amount of dysfunction observed while performing the task. The maximum possible score for the total scale is 40. Lower scores of SARA represents better task performance.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline to Post Treatment on Mobility and Turning</title>
        <description>Mobility and turning is assessed by the timed up-and-go test (Podsiadlo &amp; Richardson, 1991). The participant will be seated in an armed chair. On the word &quot;go,&quot; the subject will stand up using the arm rests if needed, walk (with assistive device if needed) around a cone placed three meters in front of the chair, return and sit down as quickly as possible.</description>

            <description>A Magstim 200 (Magstim, UK) and 14cm circular coil positioned tangential to the head will be used to deliver stimuli at 100% of maximum stimulator output. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation will be applied to three regions: 1) 4cm lateral to the right of the inion, 2) centered on the inion, 3) 4cm lateral to the left of the inion. Five pulses separated by 6 seconds will be delivered with a counter-clockwise current, followed by the same five pulses delivered with a clockwise current, for a total of 10 pulses per region, and 30 pulses per session.
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: 0.2 Hz (5 pulses every six seconds in a counter-clockwise current, followed by the same five pulses in a clockwise current); 10 pulses per region, 30 pulses per session; 5 days a week for 4 weeks.</description>

            <description>A sham condition of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation will be used and follow the same protocol as the active stimulation; however no magnetic pulses will be delivered through the scalp.
