  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1b dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and
      PK of vantictumab when combined with paclitaxel.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) has been determined,
      up to 10 patients may be enrolled in the cohort-expansion phase to better characterize the
      safety, tolerability and PK of vantictumab combined with paclitaxel. Up to approximately 34
      patients may be enrolled into the study.
