  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was developed in response to the July, 2013 FDA draft guidance regarding FMT for
      CDI. The weight of the evidence in the literature suggests that FMT is the most effective
      treatment for ambulatory outpatients affected by recurrent CDI who fail conventional therapy.

      The anticipated benefits to research patients enrolled in this study include resolution of
      chronic diarrhea, return of bowel habits and nutritional status to normal, and resolution of
      chronic recurrent CDI.

      FMT involves the endoscopic instillation of freshly obtained stool with millions of live
      bacteria into the recipient's colon by endoscopic lavage. With any endoscopic procedure,
      there is a risk of perforated viscous. This is very rare, but the risk is increased with
      severe CDI. The risk of acquisition of communicable enteric or blood borne pathogen appears
      to be negligible.

    <description>Our study will include ambulatory outpatients as well as hospitalized, debillitated patients. FMT has demonstrated effectiveness (both systematic reviews and RCT) for treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection in ambulatory outpatient populations. A secondary outcome of our study is to evaluate stratify our patient population and examine FMT success rates for out two primary outcome measures in outpatients vs. inpatients.</description>

    <description>An additional secondary outcome measure will be to examine the percent of patients who undergo 2nd or third FMT. and the success rate (in terms of primary outcome measures) for each subsequent FMT.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients &gt; 18 years of age

          2. The patient has been treated with appropriate antimicrobial therapy for CDI.

          3. The patient has documented relapse/recurrence of infection as demonstrated by positive
             stool culture, or cytotoxin assay, or PCR toxin assay.

          4. Since this study does not involve treatments that have potential teratogenicity, and
             in general avoidance of antimicrobial treatment during pregnancy is advised
             (metronidazole is pregnancy category C), women of child-bearing age may be included in
             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Patients will be excluded from study participation if one of the following categories of
        exclusion criteria applies:

          1. Patient is &lt; 18 years of age

          2. Patient has an absolute neutrophil count &lt; 750 cells/mm3.

        Stool donors must:

          1. be &gt; 18 years of age

          2. Complete a screening questionnaire:

             a. One-time donors: Table 1 b. Designated, pre-screened donors: Table 2

          3. Be tested for communicable blood-borne and enteric pathogens:

               1. One-time donors: Table 3
