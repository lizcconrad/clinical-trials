      Novel asthma biomarkers to predict the response to inhaled corticosteroid Brief description:
      This will be a single center study of asthmatic subjects and healthy controls which will
      investigate mechanisms underlying different response to inhaled corticosteroid, the mainstay
      of asthma therapy. Only about half of the asthmatic patients have improved lung function
      after treatment of inhaled corticosteroid. The investigators hypothesize that there are
      biomarkers such as epithelial cytokines (IL-25, IL-33, TSLP) in airway tissues or plasma of
      asthmatic patients which could predict the response of asthmatic patients to inhaled
      corticosteroid. Finding novel asthma biomarker will help the clinicians to choose the optimal
      treatment for individual asthmatic patient.
