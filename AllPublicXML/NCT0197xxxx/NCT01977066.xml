      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of two specific exercise interventions
      and one standard care control arm on physical functioning.The investigators expect that
      supervised training is most beneficial to the patients. However, they also expect some
      benefit for patients in the home-based training.

    <textblock>
      The randomized-controlled balanced-parallel-group trial included 65 adult pancreatic cancer
      patients (stage I-IV) from the University Surgery Clinic in Heidelberg. The study compared
      two specific exercise interventions and one standard care control arm. The intervention
      programs were (1) a 6-month supervised moderate-to-high-intensity, progressive resistance
      training, and (2) a 6-month home-based exercise training. Thus, the two interventions
      differed primarily by the intensity and mode-of-administration of the intervention. Both
      interventions started at the earliest 8 weeks after surgery to allow for wound healing until
      Maximum 12 months after the surgery. The supervised progressive training started with only
      moderate-intensity training during the first 4 weeks. Only patients without comorbidities
      that preclude participation in the intervention arms (e.g. severe pain, heart insufficiency,
      reduced standing or walking ability) were eligible.

      The primary objective is to compare the effects of the different interventions on physical
      functioning, measured as change from baseline to 6 months. Additional endpoints are overall
      quality of life, fatigue, endurance, and strength performance, adherence to the
      interventions, discontinuation of adjuvant therapy, body weight and composition, disease
      progression, overall and progression-free survival. All outcomes has been assessed every 3
      months for a minimum follow-up period of 12 months.
