      This study explores the routines of registration of surgical site infections (SSI) at
      different surgical centers in Sweden. It explores the sensitivity and specificity of the
      registration routines of SSI are at Halmstad County Hospital, Sweden.

    <description>Aiming to validate the SSI surveillance at Halmstad County Hospital. Patients who underwent elective colorectal resection between 2007-2008 were identified for inclusion in the study. A total of 66 patient were included. They were followed prospectively for four weeks and were controlled daily regarded SSI as a part of the study. After these four weeks the patients also filled a form regarding SSI. This group where then used as a control group. The results from the SSI registration routine at Halmstad County Hospital were then compared with the control group regarded SSI.</description>
