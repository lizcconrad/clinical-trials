      Phase I multicenter, open-label, clinical and pharmacokinetic study of PM01183 in combination
      with gemcitabine in non-heavily pretreated patients with selected advanced solid tumors to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose (RD) of PM01183 in
      combination with gemcitabine, to characterize the safety profile and feasibility of this
      combination in patients with selected advanced solid tumors, to characterize the
      pharmacokinetics (PK), to obtain preliminary information on the clinical antitumor activity
      in non-heavily pretreated selected solid tumor patients and to evaluate the pharmacogenomics
      (PGx) in tumor samples of patients exposed, in order to assess potential markers of response
      and/or resistance.
