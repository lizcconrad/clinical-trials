             (Snellen 20/25 or 6/7.5). In case of a monocular surgery the eye which should not be
             treated must have a best corrected distance visual acuity of at least 0.8 (Snellen
             20/25 or 6/7.5).

          -  Mesopic pupil size measured with the Zywave II WaveFront Aberrometer must be &lt; 7.0 mm
             and photopic pupil size measured with the Orbscan II/ IIz must be &gt; 2.9 mm.

        Additional Inclusion Criteria for Proscan Treatments

          -  For Proscan myopic subjects require a sphere between -0.5 D up to -10.0 D and cylinder
             between -0.5 D up to -4.0 D (not corneal astigmatism) and SE up to -12.0 D

          -  For Proscan hyperopic subjects require a sphere between +0.5 D up to +4.0 D and
             cylinder between +0.5 D up to +4.0 D (not corneal astigmatism) and SE up to +6.0 D.

        Additional Inclusion Criteria for Zyoptix Treatments

        For Zyoptix myopic subjects require a sphere between -0.5 D up to -10.0 D and cylinder
        between -0.5 D up to -4.0 D (not corneal astigmatism) and SE up to -12.0 D

          -  For Zyoptix hyperopic subjects require a sphere between +0.5 D up to +4.0 D and
             cylinder between +0.5 D up to +4.0 D (not corneal astigmatism) and SE up to +6.0 D.

          -  For all treatments with the Zyoptix algorithm, the high-order-aberration must be at
             least 0.35µm.

        Additional Inclusion Criteria for Supracor Treatments

          -  For treatments with the SUPRACOR presbyopic algorithm, subjects have to be at least 45
             years old and no more than 85 years

          -  Myopic subjects must have up to -7.0 diopters (D) of absolute spherical myopia (not
             spherical equivalent), with up to -4.0 D of refractive astigmatism (NOT corneal
             astigmatism) by manifest subjective refraction. The spherical equivalent and must be
             no more than -9.0 D.

          -  Hyperopic subjects must have up to +4 diopters (D) of absolute spherical hyperopia
             (not spherical equivalent), with up to +2.5 D of refractive astigmatism (NOT corneal
             astigmatism) by manifest subjective refraction in both eyes. The spherical equivalent
             must be no more than +5.25 D.

          -  Subjects must have presbyopia as determined by an age-related need for optical aid(&gt;
             +1.50 D) for reading with their best distance correction and been screened
             success-fully for acceptance of the SUPRACOR simulation.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Subjects for whom the combination of their baseline corneal thickness and the planned
             operative parameters for the LASIK procedure would result in less than 250 microns of
             remaining posterior corneal thickness below the flap postoperatively.

          -  Hyperopic eyes for which the baseline manifest subjective refraction exhibits a
             difference of greater than ± 0.75 D in sphere power, or a difference of greater than ±
             0.50 D in cylinder power, or a difference in cylinder axis of more than 15 degrees
             compared to the baseline cycloplegic subjective refraction. For manifest cylinder of
             less than ±0.75 D, the differ-ence in cylinder axis would not be taken into
             consideration.

          -  Subjects with anterior segment pathology, including dry eye syndrome and cataracts,
             which in the Investigator's opinion would interfere with best spectacle-corrected
             visual acuity or a successful treatment.

          -  Subjects with evidence of retinal vascular disease. Subjects with any residual,
             recurrent, or active ocular disease, or corneal abnormality that in the Investigator's
             opinion would interfere with BSCVA or a successful treatment.

          -  Subjects with signs of keratoconus or Subjects with unstable central keratometry
             readings with irregular mires.

          -  Subjects who had previous intraocular or corneal surgery of any kind, including any
             type of Excimer laser surgery for either refractive or therapeutic purposes.

          -  Subjects who have a history of Herpes simplex or Herpes zoster keratitis or history of
             glaucoma or glaucoma suspect, corneal edema, or increased IOP &gt; 22mmHg or risk for
             angle closure.

          -  Subjects immunocompromised or carrying diagnosis of connective tissue disease,
             clinically significant atopic disease, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other acute
             or chronic illnesses that will increase the risk to the subject or confound the
             outcomes of this study.

          -  Subject taking systemic medications likely to affect wound healing such as
             corticosteroids or antimetabolites.

          -  Subjects who are known to be pregnant, lactating, or who plans to become pregnant over
             the course of the study.

          -  Subjects with an ocular muscle disorder including a strabismus or nystagmus, or other
             disorders affecting fixation.

          -  Subjects with cognitive impairments or other vulnerable persons.
