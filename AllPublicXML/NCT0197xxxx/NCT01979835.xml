  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The GyneFix-Viz is a frameless copper intrauterine device (IUD) used for contraception. The
      GyneFix IUD has been marketed in Europe and Asia for about 10 years. The new anchor in the
      GyneFix IUD was designed to be more visible on ultrasound and this could improve safety by
      reducing failed insertions and perforations. We now need to know how easy it is for doctors
      to see and measure the distance of the anchor to the outside of the uterus. The purpose of
      this open, prospective, observational study is to assess the feasibility of measuring the
      distance from the serosa of the uterus to the anchor following insertion of the GyneFix-Viz
      and at follow-up 6-8 weeks later. Secondary objectives are to assess the ease and pain of
      insertion, the acceptability of the device to Canadian women and any complications. We will
      also compare expulsion rates in post-abortion and other women.
