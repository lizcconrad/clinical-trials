      As a traditional Chinese medicine compound, SaiLuoTong capsule is proven to have beneficial
      effects on learning and memory ability in animal models of vascular dementia (VaD). The study
      hypothesis is that SaiLuoTong capsule will be effective in the treatment of patients with VaD
      and will be well tolerated. The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy and safety
      of SaiLuoTong capsule on patients with mild to moderate VaD. The outcome measures include
      general cognitive function, executive function, daily living skills, and mental behavior
      changes of symptoms in VaD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vascular dementia (VaD) is a clinical syndrome of acquired intellectual and functional
      impairment that results from cerebrovascular diseases. SaiLuoTong capsule is a traditional
      Chinese medicine compound; it is composed of ginseng extract (the main composition: ginseng
      total saponins), ginkgo biloba extract (the main composition: YinXingTong ester) and
      safflower extract (the main composition: the west safflower total glycosides). The function
      of SaiLuoTong capsule is Yiqi Huoxue and Huayu Tongluo in Chinese traditional medicine
      theory. Pharmacodynamics studies showed that SaiLuoTong capsule can significantly improve
      neurological symptoms caused by focal cerebral ischemia in animals, and learning and memory
      ability in animal models of VaD. Based on these previous evidences, we conduct this study to
      assess the efficacy and safety of SaiLuoTong capsule in patients with mild to moderate VaD.
      This study is a phase 2 clinical trial of SaiLuoTong capsule for treatment of vascular
      dementia. The initial study is a 26-week, multicentre, randomized, double -blind,
      placebo-controlled study. Patients who complete the initial 26-week trial will be eligible to
      continue in a 26-week open-label extension study.

      The primary and secondary objectives of this study are as following:

      Primary Objectives:

        1. To assess the efficacy of SaiLuoTong capsule on cognitive and global functioning in
           patients with mild-to-moderate VaD;

        2. To assess the safety and tolerability of SaiLuoTong capsule in patients with
           mild-to-moderate VaD.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To assess the efficacy of SaiLuoTong capsule in improving the ability to do activities
           of daily living, executive function, and neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with
           mild-to-moderate VaD;

        2. To assess the efficacy of different dosage regimens of SaiLuoTong in patients with
           mild-to-moderate VaD;

        3. To assess the efficacy of SaiLuoTong treatment of different duration in patients with
           mild-to-moderate VaD;

        4. To assess the efficacy of SaiLuoTong capsule on different etiological subtypes of VaD,
           including large-vessel VaD, small-vessel VaD, and VaD of mixed large-vessel and
           small-vessel origin;

        5. To assess the efficacy of SaiLuoTong capsule in mild VaD patients and moderate VaD
           patients separately;

        6. To assess to effect of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 allele on trial outcomes.

      The study will assess the changes in cognitive function, daily living skills, executive
      functions, behavioral and psychological symptoms. The primary measures of effectiveness
      include the change from baseline in the vascular dementia assessment scale cognitive subscale
      (V-ADAS-cog) and Alzheimer's disease cooperative study-clinical global impression of change
      (ADCS-CGIC). Secondary measures of effectiveness include the change from baseline in the
      Alzheimer's disease cooperative study-activities of daily living inventory (ADCS-ADL),
      mini-mental state examination (MMSE), clinical dementia rating scale (CDR), sum of boxes of
      CDR(CDR-sb), clock drawing task (CLOX), Chinese version of executive interview 25 (C-EXIT25)
      and neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI). Safety measures include physical examinations, vital
      signs, electrocardiography, laboratory tests, and adverse events records.
