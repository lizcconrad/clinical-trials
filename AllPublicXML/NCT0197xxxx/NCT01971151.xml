      RATIONALE: Exposure in vivo therapy aims to reduce pain-related fear - a key maintaining
      factor of chronic low back pain- while increasing level of daily functioning, despite the
      pain. This is done by exposing patients to their most feared activities/movements, while
      behavioral experiments are performed that serve to correct catastrophic (erroneous) beliefs
      about pain. Yet, performing exposure exercises might be very threatening for patients and
      might encourage them to build in subtle safety-seeking behavior. Whether safety-seeking
      behavior should be allowed or not during therapy is heavily debated. Whereas some argue that
      it will only interfere with therapeutic progress because it prevents the disconfirming
      experience exposure tries to offer, other argue that it will facilitate therapeutic progress
      because it enhances one's sense of control, if used judiciously. So far
      (clinical-)experimental studies have provided mixed evidence nor have they lead to any
      clinical recommendation. Hence, in a replicated single-case experiment, we will compare
      exposure therapy with versus exposure without safety-seeking behavior versus exposure only.

      STUDY POPULATION: Participants are chronic low back pain patients seeking treatment, who
      fulfill all inclusion and exclusion criteria and participate voluntarily.

      INTERVENTION: All participants receive exposure therapy at the rehabilitation department of
      the academic hospital in Maastricht, but with different recommendations for the use of
      safety-seeking behavior.

      We will assess: 1) daily measures of fear, pain intensity and self-reported achievement of
      goals and 2) non-daily measures of pain disability, pain-related fear, pain catastrophizing,
      pain solutions, need to control and safety-seeking behavior. To measure to the influence of
      safety-seeking behavior on actual level of functioning, two behavioral performance tasks will
      also be presented, ie. a bag carrying task and a personalized task.

      BURDEN AND RISKS: There are no risks associated with participation to this study that are not
      otherwise related to rehabilitation and movement in general and participation is completely
      voluntary. Participants are requested to fill out questionnaires on a daily basis at home
      (computerized if possible), as well as on different time points during the study and at
      follow up and perform two behavioral performance tasks. This study could help to further
      improve the beneficial long-term effects of exposure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Suffer from chronic low back pain not caused by serious spinal injury, for at least 3
             to 6 months

          -  Report a sufficient level of disability (this is in itself already a criterion to
             start treatment at the Rehabilitation department) and

          -  Moderate to high levels of pain-related fear (TSK &gt; 37 or at least 4 items with a
             score of 3 or &gt;3)

          -  Have a partner willing to participate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Specific medical disorder or cardiovascular disease preventing participation in
             physical exercise

          -  Serious psychopathologic co-morbidity. This is checked during anamnesis in the intake
             session with the rehabilitation physician and during the screening (standard care, see
             session 1 and session 2). When psychopathologic co-morbidity is detected, patients
             cannot participate in the study and may not be suitable candidates for exposure
             therapy entirely. Any decision regarding treatment recommendation is made with the
             entire treatment team. Furthermore, the researcher performing the therapy has a
             Master's degree in Clinical Psychology, which adds to the treatment team's expertise
             on psychopathology.

          -  Alcohol or drug abuse, i.e., at least one out of the four following criteria needs to
             be fulfilled: continued use despite social or interpersonal problems; repeated use
             resulting in failure to fulfill obligations at work, school, or home; repeated use
             resulting in physically hazardous situations; use resulting in legal problems
             (according to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental disorders, 4th ed.). This is
             assessed by the rehabilitation physician during the first session.

          -  Illiteracy

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Involvement in litigation concerning the patient's ability to work or disability
             income

          -  Non-Dutch speaking
