      To assess the long term clinical benefit of Silver Graft in an unselected patient population
      with Peripheral Artery Occlusive Disease (PAOD) fulfilling one of the the following criteria:

        1. Any suitable patient in need of an infrarenal vascular reconstruction with Fontaine
           class IIb or indicated vascular reconstruction aneurysm repair.

           or

        2. Any suitable patient with an increased risk for early graft failure except those
           mentioned under (3). These may include

             -  diabetics

             -  Fontaine class&gt; IIb

             -  patients of advanced age (≥75 y)

             -  patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine ≥ 1.50 mg/dl or ≥130 µmol/l)

             -  patients with COPD or documented coronary artery disease (prior PCI, prior CABG,
                documented myocardial ischemia)

             -  patients with major amputation

             -  immunosuppressed patients

             -  patients with autoimmune disease, malignancy

           or

        3. Any suitable patient with graft infection or present infection in the anatomical
           position of indicated vascular reconstruction.

    <description>In contrast to silver acetate impregnated vascular graft, Silver Graft can be immersed in an antibiotic containing solution prior to implantation. This practice should always be followed according to each participant's hospital guidelines and experience. The long term efficacy of the metallic silver coating will not be reduced.
Common practice antibiotic co-medication before, during and after surgery needs to be documented but is at the discretion of each participating institution.
Due to the registry character of this assessment, i.e. routine use of the investigational product, local antibiotics, e.g. dipping of the vascular graft into a rifampin solution is permissible.</description>
