  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label flexible-dose pilot study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and
      tolerability of Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) in outpatient subjects diagnosed with Generalized
      Anxiety Disorder (GAD) with or without comorbidities that are secondary to the GAD. Primary
      trial objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) SNRI treatment 50 to
      100 mg once daily in the treatment of GAD with or without comorbidities. Secondary trial
      objective is to determine whether or not treatment outcome in GAD is related to changes in
      cortical prefrontal activity of norepinephrine.

    <description>At the screening visit those who are eligible will enter a randomized trial with Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) 50 to 100 mg. The study will begin with a single week of Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) 50mg. Subsequently, tablets will be administered in a flexible dose fashion and patients will be followed up weekly (biweekly after week 8) and at the investigators discretion. After the first week the patients' dosage will be increased up to a maximum of 100 mg daily. This dose will remain fixed after 8 weeks of treatment until week 16.</description>

             patient is, in the investigator's opinion, in a suitable condition.

          -  Willing and able to attend study appointments in the correct time windows.

          -  Patients, who have been on an antidepressant or other anxiolytic prior to the study,
             will have discontinued it more than two weeks prior to entry into the study. Those who
             have been on fluoxetine, will have been off of it for at least 5 weeks.

             prior to entering the study.

          -  Scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) &gt; 15, at screening visit 1

          -  Serious illness: Liver or renal insufficiency, cardiac, vascular, pulmonary,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurological, infectious, neoplastic or metabolic

          -  The patient is, in the opinion of the investigator, unlikely to comply with the
             clinical trial protocol or is unsuitable for any reason.
