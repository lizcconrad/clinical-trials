      This clinical investigation addresses the performance of a re-designed (updated) speaking
      valve with Heat and Moisture Exchangers (HME) for tracheotomized patients (project
      development name 'TW', commercial name 'DualCare'). Study participants trial the new device
      for 2 weeks after which they can choose to discontinue using the device or continue in the 3
      month follow-up part of the study. Clinical feasibility is assessed using structured
      questionnaires addressing voice and speech, quality of life, breathing, swallowing,
      olfaction, sleeping, and respiratory symptoms. This is an exploratory, observational study
      and no specific hypotheses have been formulated.

    <measure>Evaluate Patient Experiences Associated With Exposure to the Speaking Valve With a Heat- and Moisture Exchanger (TW) for Tracheotomized Patients Based on Results From Questionnaires.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks including Baseline, week 1, 2 (old device) and week 3 (updated device).</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked to use either the old TW15 and the TW22 HME device for a week, data combined for the two devices (the device used was recorded). After each week, patients completed a device specific questionnaire (Borg Scale).
After the re-design (ie Updated speaking valve), patients were asked to use the new Speaking Valve for a week and then to complete relevant sections of the same questionnaire. Both at baseline and in the follow-up, patients were asked about their breathing using a Borg scale at a particular moment. This scale has a range from 0-6 where a score close to &quot;0&quot; indicates less breathing problems.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years or older

          -  has a tracheostomy

          -  is spontaneously breathing

          -  has a cuffless tracheostomy tube

          -  has a tracheostomy tube with inner and outer cannula

          -  currently uses an HME and/or speaking valve

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patient unable to handle or remove the device him/herself when needed, e.g. has
             decreased level of cognition or reduced mobility of the arms and/or hands

          -  is mechanically ventilated in any way

          -  has a tidal volume of less than 100 ml

          -  is suffering from severe aspiration

          -  is laryngectomized: the device will block the possibility to exhale if speaking mode
             is unintentionally activated

          -  has severe upper airway obstruction, this may cause air trapping

          -  has thick and copious secretions which might block the device

          <description>At baseline, participants were asked to complete a baseline questionnaire. After that, patients were asked to use both the current (old) TW15 or the TW22 for a week. After each week, patients completed a device specific questionnaire. At the end of the two week period, patients also completed a structured and comparative questionnaire.
Patients were then asked to use the new updated Speaking Valve for a week and then to complete relevant sections of the same questionnaire that was also used for the previous (old) device. Patients could decide again whether they wanted to participate in the long term part of the study, which will follow the same structure with the same questionnaires as in Stage 0.</description>
