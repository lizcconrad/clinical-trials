      We plan to investigate whether the Isolated Orthosis for Thumb Actuation (IOTA) can
      effectively facilitate the ability of participants to perform a specific set of clinically
      relevant tasks conducted in a clinic setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many Activities of Daily Living involve precision grasp and fine motor manipulation, such as
      putting toothpaste on a toothbrush or feeding oneself. However, children afflicted by stroke,
      cerebral palsy, or traumatic brain injury may lose the ability to actively (and accurately)
      control the thumb, and specifically abduct/adduct the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint and
      flex/extend the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. We are testing the Isolated Orthosis for
      Thumb Actuation (IOTA), a device developed at the Wyss Institute at Harvard University in
      collaboration with Children's Hospital Boston, for assisting opposable thumb grasping tasks.
      The IOTA contains an adjustable brace fitted to the thumb and dorsum of the hand that is easy
      to put on and facilitates grasping motions through flexible cable-driven actuators that
      assist with CMC joint abduction and MCP joint extension.

      In this pilot study, we plan to investigate whether the IOTA can effectively facilitate the
      ability of participants to perform a specific set of clinically relevant tasks conducted in a
      clinic setting.

      The hypothesis for this work is that the IOTA will significantly improve the participant's
      performance on clinically relevant tasks.

    <description>We will examine this aim by evaluating participant performance on a Box and Block Task. This task is clinically relevant to the participant population. This task will be evaluated with no device worn at first, and then with the IOTA device worn in four different modes (manual mode, cycle &amp; repeat mode, wrist mode, and moon mode).</description>
