  <brief_summary>

      Hypothesis: A commercial e-nose (Cyranose 320) is able to detect specific breathprints from
      patients with COPD and bacterial infection

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty to 50% of COPD patients have airway colonization with potentially pathogenic bacteria.
      This is associated with worse prognosis. Currently, diagnosis of bacterial colonization
      relies mainly upon quantitative sputum culture. However, this method lacks good sensitivity.
      The electronic nose is a novel device made up of nanosensors capable of detecting specific
      volatile organic compounds (VOCs). OBJECTIVES: Main 1) To assess the usefulness of the
      electronic nose in the diagnosis of bacterial colonization in COPD. Secondary 1) To define
      the VOCs pattern associated with bacterial colonization. 2) To study the pattern of pulmonary
      and systemic inflammation associated with bacterial colonization as well its relationship
      with the aforementioned VOCs patterns.
