  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was well known that the mirror therapy could decrease pain of upper-limb amputated
      patients.

      The mirror therapy is known to make a plastic change some parts of the brain perceiving the
      painful body part and modulating its signal by feedback of visual information mirrored with
      the corresponding contra-lateral normal parts.

      In this study, post-operative analgesic efficiency of the virtual reality using a mirror
      therapy after total knee arthroplasty will be evaluated.

      This clinical trial will be performed in the form of prospective, single-blind (i.e.
      assessor-blind), parallel group, randomized (allocation ratio 1:1), single cohort.

    <description>Patients are required to look at the images of both lower extremities ranged from the perineal area to the foot. Virtual reality system records in real-time method both lower extremities. Following the validity assessement mirrored image of the surgeried lower extremity is re-formed using the virtusal reality system flipping the image of lower extremity not-surgeried and being calibration for the symmetricity.</description>
