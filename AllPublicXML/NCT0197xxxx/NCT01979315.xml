    <textblock>
      Diagnostic and prognostic value of pain hypersensitivity in low back pain (LBP) is not fully
      understood.Increased pain sensitivity in the primary area of pain (local pain) is considered
      a sign of predominantly peripheral pain sensitization,value of pain hypersensitivity in low
      back pain (LBP)is not fully understood whereas pain sensitivity in distal and remote areas is
      considered to present a more central phenomenon. It is suggested that pat ents with enhanced
      pain sensitivity report high level of disability. Despite fact that pain and disability are
      associated in chronic LBP the exact mechanisms of sensitivity contribution in LBP disability
      is unknown. It has also been suggested that muscle function changes may be driven by pain.
      The possible role and contribution of trunk muscles function to pain and disability phenomena
      remain unknown.

      This study was aimed to estimate prevalence and possible correlation among pain
      hypersensitivity and functional and electromyography parameters of trunk muscles in patients
      reporting early phase of chronic LBP.
