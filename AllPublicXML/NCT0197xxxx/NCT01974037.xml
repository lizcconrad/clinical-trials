  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excess dietary salt intake is closely associated with the development of hypertension and
      cardiocerebral vascular diseases. Preference of high salt diet might involve salty gustatory
      cortices change. This study focuses on examining the neuroimaging changes of salty gustatory
      cortices under different concentration of NaCl solution with or without capsaicin
      intervention through brain PET/CT scan.

      Hypertension and its related complications are common health problems that can lead to
      multiple organ damage and death. Excessive salt intake plays an important role in the
      development of hypertension.

      The experimental design is a randomized, double-blind, interventional study to investigate
      the neuroimaging changes of salty gustatory cortices under different concentration of NaCl
      solution with or without capsaicin intervention through brain PET/CT scan.
