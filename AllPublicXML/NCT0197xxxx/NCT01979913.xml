  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) has been identified as the most important risk factor
      for the development and the progression of glaucoma. Data from large interventional studies
      have shown that a decrease of IOP is associated with a reduced risk of progression of the
      disease. This underlines the importance of a potent and save IOP lowering therapy. The
      introduction of preservative free tafluprost offers a new treatment possibility using a
      potent topical prostaglandin analogue without the disadvantages of a co-administered
      preservative. The current study seeks to investigate the effect of an 8 week therapy with
      preservative free tafluprost on intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or
      primary open angle glaucoma having an IOP of 30 mmHg or more.
