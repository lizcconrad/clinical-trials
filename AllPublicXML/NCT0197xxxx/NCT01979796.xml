  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well established in studies across several countries that tobacco smoking is more
      prevalent among schizophrenic patients than the general population. Electronic cigarettes
      (e-cigarettes) are becoming increasingly popular with smokers worldwide. To date there are no
      large randomised trials of e-cigarettes in schizophrenic smokers. A well-designed trial is
      needed to compare efficacy and safety of these products in this special population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have designed a randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy and
      safety of electronic cigarette. The trial will take the form of a prospective 12-month
      randomized clinical study to evaluate smoking reduction, smoking abstinence and adverse
      events in schizophrenic smokers not intending to quit. The investigators will also monitor
      quality of life, neurocognitive functioning and measure participants' perception and
      satisfaction of the product.

      The main strengths of the SCARIS study are the following: it's the first large RCT on
      schizophrenic patient, involving in and outpatient, evaluating the effect of a three-arm
      study design, and a long term of follow-up (52-weeks).

    <description>Abstinence from smoking, defined as complete self-reported abstinence from tobacco smoking - not even a puff (together with an eCO concentration of ≤7 ppm), will be calculated at each study visit (&quot;quitters&quot;).</description>

    <description>A ≥50% reduction in the number of cig/day from baseline, defined as self-reported reduction in the number of cig/day (≥50%) compared to baseline (together with an eCO levels reduction, to objectively document a reduction from baseline), will be calculated at each study visit (&quot;reducers&quot;).
Smokers who will not satisfy the criteria of &quot;reducers&quot; and &quot;quitters&quot; will be defined &quot;non responders&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of neurocognitive functioning</measure>

    <description>Quality of life, Neurocognitive Functioning and Psychopathological status will be assessed at each study visit by Quality of Life Scale (QLS), Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) and Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale(PANSS), respectively
Participants' perception and liking of the product will be assessed by asking to rate their level of satisfaction with the products compared to their own cigarettes using a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 10 points (0 = being 'completely unsatisfied', 10 being = 'fully satisfied'); using the same scale, they will also rate how much they miss their own brand (0 = being 'did not miss it at all', 10 being = 'missed too much') and whether they would recommend it to a friend/relative (0 = being 'not recommended at all', 10 being = 'absolutely recommended').</description>
