  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common disorder among older women that greatly affects quality
      of life. Emerging evidence from observational studies links vitamin D insufficiency with UI.
      Prior to a larger intervention trial of vitamin D among older women with low serum vitamin D
      levels and urgency UI, we propose a pilot study in 100 older women comparing weekly, oral
      vitamin D3 50,000 IU to placebo. We hypothesize that adequate vitamin D supplementation will
      improve UI symptoms in older women with vitamin D deficiency. Changes in UI-episodes will be
      assessed by a 7-day bladder diary and other validated symptom measures administered at
      baseline and after 12-weeks of intervention. Serum calcium and 25(OH)D levels will be
      monitored. The expected outcomes will provide new knowledge regarding the impact of vitamin D
      supplementation on UI symptom improvement and inform a larger, randomized controlled clinical
      trial involving vitamin D supplementation.

        (1) Post-menopausal women (age â‰¥50 years of age); (2)Urine leakage for 3 or more months;
        (3) at least 3 urinary urgency incontinence episodes on a 7-day bladder diary; and (4)
        serum 25(OH)D level (vitamin D) is &lt;30 ng/mL. Women who currently take a bladder
        medications (anticholinergic) for UI symptom control may enroll into the study if they
        agree to (1) cease taking these medications at least two weeks before the pre-intervention
        assessment and (2) not take these medications during the study's treatment and assessment
        period.

        (1) neurologic diseases known to affect UI; (2) Diseases known to affect vitamin D
        absorption and metabolism; (3) Prior pelvic floor radiation; (4) Obstructive causes of
        UI;(6)Current use of medications known to affect vitamin D levels; (7) Uncontrolled
        diabetes (Hemoglobin A1C&gt;9%); (8) albumin corrected serum Calcium &gt; 11.0 mg/dL; (9)history
        of hyperparathyroidism; (10) currently untreated kidney stones; (11) post void residual
