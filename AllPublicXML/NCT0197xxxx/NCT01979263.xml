  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to study the feasibility and efficacy of attention bias
      modification treatment (ABMT) in a randomized-controlled sample of anxious youth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not ABMT computer-based interventions
      can be used successfully to help reduce anxiety disorder symptoms in children ages 7 to 17.
      ABMT is different from most other treatments for anxiety because it is not medication or talk
      therapy. ABMT is a computerized attention training program designed to change how we direct
      our attention. The purpose of ABMT is to set in place attentional patterns that do not lead
      to excessive anxiety. Research has shown that it may be highly effective in reducing anxiety.
      The Intervention will be composed of your child engaging in 6 brief weekly ABMT sessions. The
      sessions seem like a repetitive computer game.

      This study is appropriate for children who may have symptoms of an anxiety disorder, like
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Separation anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Specific
      Phobia, or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.&quot; Children who appear eligible for the study may
      attend a diagnostic evaluation and assessment if they meet study criteria.

      If a child is eligible for the study, he or she will be randomly assigned to either get an
      &quot;active&quot; form of the computer program or a &quot;placebo&quot; or inactive form of the computer
      program. The child will come to six weekly appointments at our clinic that are quite brief,
      about a half hour. Then the child will have an evaluation after the last of the six
      appointments to see if the computer intervention was helpful in reducing his or her anxiety.
      We'd then wait a month and then have a final evaluation to see if the child's anxiety has
      changed over that period of time.
