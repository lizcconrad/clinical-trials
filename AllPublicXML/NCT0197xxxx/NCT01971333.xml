      The arterial system compliance is compromised in liver cirrhotic patients. Dynamic preload
      variables are either pressure-based (e.g.pulse pressure variation; PPV), flow-based (e.g.
      stroke volume variation; SVV), or volume-based (plethysmographic variability index; PVI). It
      is not yet clear that dynamic preload parameters based on which mechanism will be accurate to
      predict fluid responsiveness in the cirrhotic patients. Therefore, this study aimed to
      claried which dynamic preload parameters would be more accurate during the liver
      transplantation.

      Fluid management is crucial during liver transplantation. Patients with cirrhosis and portal
      hypertension have an altered blood volume distribution and pooling in the splanchnic
      circulation. Excess administration of intravenous fluid may increase portal hypertension due
      to splanchnic venous congestion and may also aggravate coagulopathy by dilution. On the other
      hand, fluid restriction may risk systemic and especially renal hypoperfusion. Traditional
      static fluid parameter, such as central venous pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure,
      have been reported inaccurate to predict fluid responsiveness. In comparison, the recent
      developed dynamic fluid parameters based on heart-lung interaction were reported to be good
      preload indicators in a variety of different surgical settings. However, the validity of such
      dynamic fluid parameters is highly dependent on The arterial system compliance is compromised
      in liver cirrhotic patients. Dynamic preload variables are either pressure-based (e.g.pulse
      pressure variation; PPV), flow-based (e.g. stroke volume variation; SVV), or volume-based
      (plethysmographic variability index; PVI). It is not yet clear that dynamic preload
      parameters based on which mechanism will be accurate to predict fluid responsiveness in the
      cirrhotic patients. Therefore, this study aimed to claried which dynamic preload parameters
      would be more accurate during the liver transplantation.
