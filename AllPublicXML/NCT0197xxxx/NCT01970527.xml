  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well stereotactic body radiotherapy and ipilimumab work in
      treating patients with stage IV melanoma. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) may be able
      to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as ipilimumab, target certain cells to interfere with the ability of tumor
      cells to grow and spread. Giving SBRT with ipilimumab may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine feasibility and immune-related clinical responses associated with SBRT when
      given in conjunction with ipilimumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine late toxicity and immune pharmacodynamic changes after SBRT followed by
      ipilimumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo a total of 3 fractions of stereotactic body radiotherapy between days 1-13.
      Patients then receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 3
      weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 60 days, and then every
      effort will be made to obtain records of patients during this follow up, and permission will
      be sought for the investigators and/or study team to re-contact the patient directly with
      regard to health status and toxicity.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Immune-related clinical response, defined as proportion of patients treated at the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) who achieve either a complete or partial immune-related response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 days after last ipilimumab injection</time_frame>
    <description>Scored on a non-index lesion using immune-related response criteria according to immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. The number of immune-related responses will be tabled by stratum and SBRT fraction dose level. At the MTD, the immune-related response rate and 95% exact confidence interval will be estimated separately for previously untreated and previously treated metastatic patients.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Immune-related progression-free survival (irPFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from first day of radiotherapy to first documented immune-related progressive disease, death due to any cause or last patient contact alive and progression-free, assessed at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>irPFS will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method separately for previously untreated and previously treated metastatic patients who were treated at the MTD.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Late toxicities, graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research, the Treatment of Cancer late morbidity scoring system, and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Defined generally as an adverse event associated with the treatment which occurs beyond 30 days after last injection (i.e., adverse events which are observed months after treatment are most likely associated with SBRT). All dose-limiting toxicities and late toxicities will be graded and tabled by lesion site stratum and SBRT fraction dose level. Toxicity attribution to either SBRT or ipilimumab will be described if possible.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from first day of radiotherapy to death due to any cause or last patient contact alive, assessed at 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method separately for previously untreated and previously treated metastatic patients who were treated at the MTD.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Lymphocyte activation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 days after last ipilimumab injection</time_frame>
    <description>Outcomes will first be described using plots and descriptive statistics. Natural log transformation may be applied, as necessary, prior to statistical comparison. Within-patient differences (e.g., baseline vs. post-treatment) will be examined by student's t test for paired data or nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test.</description>

    <description>The number of immune responses (&gt; 2 fold pre/post increase) will be tabled by fraction dose level.
