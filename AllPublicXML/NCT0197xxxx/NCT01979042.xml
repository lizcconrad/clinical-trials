  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal colic is usually caused from an obstructing stone along the ureter. Some of the
      patients present with a high level of creatinin in the blood, even though there is a normal
      functioning contralateral kidney. Furthermore creatinin is not an ideal marker for renal
      function during acute changes.

      Several works have shown that modern urinary markers such as NGAL (neutrophil
      gelatinase-associated lipocalin), KIM-1 (Kidney Injury Molecule-1) and others rise earlier
      and are much more sensitive for kidney insult. There is a lack of research on their role in
      acute kidney obstruction

      The study population will include 100 men and women that will be recruited during the
      upcoming year, with a follow up of up to 3 months.

      The study population will be divided into 2 groups:

        1. The stone group: about 80 patients, aged 18-65, with normal creatinine for the past year
           that presented in our ER because of renal colic, and their imaging shows a ureteral
           stone.

        2. The non-stone group: about 20 patients that present in our department for elective
           surgery not related to stones or bladder outlet obstruction.

      The stone group:

      ---------------- In the ER the patients will be examined, undergo blood and urine workup and
      imaging as usual. If they are applicable according to our inclusion and exclusion criteria
      and admitted and they will be included in our stone group. After signing an informed consent,
      either as patients with a ureteral stone and normal creatinine or as patients with a ureteral
      stone and an abnormal creatinine, Their urine sample will be sent for the urinary markers:
      NGAL, KIM-1, ENdothelin and Cystatin C.

      At this point it will be decided to admit or discharge them according to their clinical
      imaging and laboratory findings, as acceptable. The admitted patients will be followed for 48
      with additional blood and urine tests.

      The admitted patients that will undergo renal drainage will be a specific subgroup in which a
      selective urine test will be taken from the drained kidney

      The non stone group:

      -------------------- These are our control group from which we will take a single blood and
      urine test before their elective surgery.
