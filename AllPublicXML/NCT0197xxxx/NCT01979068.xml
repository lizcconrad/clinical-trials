      -  Vascular Inflammation is a key factor in both the pathogenesis and outcome of
           atherosclerosis. 18FDG-PET is a promising novel tool for identifying and quantifying
           vascular inflammation within atherosclerotic plaque

        -  Recently, unique subsets of obese individuals, such as metabolically obese but normal
           weight (MONW) and metabolically healthy obese (MHO), have been getting an attention

        -  Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship of vascular
           inflammation,measured by FDG-PET, with various body sized phenotypes
