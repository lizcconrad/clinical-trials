  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators assessed the effect of avastin in combination with
      chemotherapy in the treatment of unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be eligible for inclusion if their primary tumors have been resected and if the
      patients have histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma with synchronous
      liver-confined metastases deemed non-resectable. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned
      to chemotherapy plus avastin (arm A) or chemotherapy alone (arm B). Treatment will be planned
      to commence between 2 and 4 weeks after the primary surgery. Treatment will continue until
      tumor response indicates suitability for surgery for liver metastases or until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The primary endpoint is the conversion rate to
      radical resection for liver metastases，which will be assessed by local multidisciplinary team
      (includes more than three liver surgeons and one radiologist) with the use of
      contrast-enhanced CT or MRI after 4 cycles and then every other 2 cycles up to 12 cycles. To
      provide an objective assessment of changes in resectability, radiological images will be
      presented by a radiologist to more than 3 liver surgeons, who are blinded to the clinical
      data. Patients will be considered resectable if 50% or more of surgeons vote for radical
      resection of LM. For patients whose liver-metastases are assessed resectable, resection
      should be scheduled to be performed within 2~3 weeks of the last treatment cycle. Following
      resection, patients will be advised to continue the same therapeutic regimen until the
      treatments reach a sum of 12 cycles.
