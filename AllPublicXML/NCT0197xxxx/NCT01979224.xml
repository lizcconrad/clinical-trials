    <textblock>
      Introduction. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways, identified by airflow
      obstruction. Unfortunately only 2.4% of American asthmatics meet internationally recommended
      criteria for control. The lack of knowledge in parents of asthmatic children has been a
      direct result of minimum or no control at all, so the educational programs need to be
      assessed in terms of improvement of the control. Target. To determine whether an educational
      intervention aimed at parents of asthmatic children 4 to 11 years improved clinical control
      measured by Test Childhood Asthma Control. Material and Methods. Randomized controlled
      clinical trial in 42 patients randomly divided into two groups that were evaluated in the
      same time knowledge and control of asthma, a measurement was performed at baseline and
      monthly for nine months. The experimental group attended an educational intervention for
      individual reinforcements through this period, the control group was only monitored

      -  Recruitment of patients that attended hospital's emergency gate due to asthma issues,
           and phone calls to regular physicians patients.

        -  Once recruited all parents of patients were asked to participate in the study where
           their children will be evaluated on an asthma control and asked informed consent

        -  The clinical history, spirometry and / or basal peak flow Diagnostic concordance

        -  With the collected data was performed a database clinical history, ACT score, FEV1 and
           PEF, results of each patient and personal data for future location, the base was used
           for the concordance of diagnosis.

        -  Once the sample that met the selection criteria were formed experimental and control
           groups at random using &quot;R Project Statistical Computing&quot; 2.12.2 version performed by the
           statistical

        -  The experimental group was invited to participate in educational sessions two hours at
           week in just one month and monthly individual reinforcements through the evaluation
           period.

        -  Educational sessions were based on the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), Guía
           Española para el Manejo del Asma (GEMA) And Concenso Mexicano de Asma.

        -  Those measurements were performed by an external partner or educators or the attending
           physician performed to avoid biased results.

      The monthly ACT and peak flow of the attending physician were blinded

      variables:

        -  educational intervention, with and without intervention

        -  asthma control: measured by infant ACT

        -  time: 0 to 9 months

        -  sex: female or male

        -  Age: 4 to 11 years
