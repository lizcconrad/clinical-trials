  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oropharyngeal dysphagia induces aspirations which could be responsible of aspiration
      pneumonia and denutrition. It could be present in the majority of central neurological
      disease (degenerative or vascular disease), which explains that it is the first case of
      mortality in stroke. Two pilot studies realised by our research group aimed to demonstrate
      that sensitive transcutaneous electrical stimulation could improve swallowing coordination
      and reduce aspirations. This technique could be used at home.

      The aim of this study is to demonstrate that sensitive electrical stimulation could improve
      oropharyngeal dysphagia in hemispheric stroke patients. 118 patients should be included in
      seven centers. Sensitive electrical stimulation will be applied either as active stimulation,
      either as a placebo. Active electrical stimulation will be realised at 80 hz during 30
      minutes, under motor threshold and above sensitive threshold. It will be administrated via
      surface electrodes over the hyoid bone. Patients will be separated by randomisation.

      Patients will be evaluated before and after 6 weeks of use. Methods will evaluation
      questionnaire, clinical examination and videofluoroscopy. The time of use will also be
      collected.

      We wish to demonstrate that transcutaneous electrical stimulation is able to improve
      oropharyngeal dysphagia in stroke.
