  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To improve radiation therapy of prostate cancer, the investigators must be able to accurately
      identify the tumour. By using advanced functional imaging techniques available on
      state-of-the-art MRI scanners to clearly show the specific location of the tumour inside the
      prostate, the investigators can use advanced radiation therapy techniques to specifically
      target the tumor and control it with as few radiotherapy clinic visits as possible. This is
      different than current techniques which treat the whole prostate gland to the same dose,
      delivered over 7-8 weeks of daily radiotherapy visits. By increasing the radiation dose to
      the active tumor while still maintaining adequate radiation dose to the rest of the prostate,
      the investigators hope to better control prostate cancer and reduce complications to nearby
      normal tissues.

      This project combines advances in functional imaging of prostate cancer and hypofractionation
      through stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), with an aim to improve tumour control and
      reduce or maintain normal tissue complications. The strategy will make use of the combined
      effectiveness of several functional imaging approaches to identify the dominant lesion(s)
      within the prostate. An SBRT treatment plan will be designed which utilizes 5 fractions to
      treat the entire prostate gland with an additional boost to the dominant lesion. The lower
      dose to the entire prostate should reduce normal tissue complications but still be effective
      in treating prostate cancer while the increased dose to the dominant lesion should improve
      tumour control. The use of only 5 fractions will reduce the number of patient visits, thus
      reducing overall treatment costs.
