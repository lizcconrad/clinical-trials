  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, open-label, parallel group, partly randomized dose escalation trial to
      assess the safety and efficacy of a low dose, an intermediate dose, and high dose MSB0010445
      given by intravenous infusion to subjects with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma
      in combination with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).

    <measure>Number of Subjects With at Least 1 Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>DLT was defined as any Grade&gt;= 3 toxicity related to drug, occurring during 21 days post first dose of drug except Grade 3 infusion-related adverse reaction resolving within 6 hours and Transient (&lt;=6 hours) Grade 3 flu-like symptoms/fever controlled with medical management; Transient (&lt;= 24 hours) Grade 3 fatigue, local reactions, headache, nausea, emesis that resolved to &lt;= Grade 1; Grade 3 skin toxicity ,Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 8 x upper limit of normal (ULN)/total bilirubin &lt; 5 x ULN resolving to &lt;= Grade 1 in &lt;7 days after medical management; Grade 3 diarrhea controlled with maximal medical management within 72 hours; Grade 4 lymphopenia that resolves to &lt;= Grade 1 within 7 days &amp; with no clinical manifestations; Grade 3 lab abnormality with no clinical correlation and resolves to &lt;= Grade 1 within 7 days with adequate medical management Tumor flare defined as local pain, irritation or rash localized at sites of known/suspected tumor.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Best Overall Response (BOR) According to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening up to 28 days after last dose of drug; assessed up to maximum of 1.41 years</time_frame>
    <description>BOR was defined as a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) during second-line treatment. For target lesions (TLs), CR was defined as the disappearance of all TLs, and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the SLD of the TLs, taking as a reference the baseline SLD. For non-target lesions (NTLs), CR was defined as the disappearance of all NTLs and normalization of tumor marker levels.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening up to 28 days after last dose of drug; assessed up to maximum of 1.41 years</time_frame>
    <description>TEAE was defined as an AE that started on or after the first administration of SBRT. An SAE was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/ significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

          <description>MSB0010445 was administered at a single dose of 0.3 mg/kg as IV infusion over approximately 1 hour q3w for the first 12 Weeks as a part of induction phase followed by maintenance dose of 0.3 mg/kg drug every three weeks until significant clinical progression, occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The first administration of MSB0010445 was performed 3 days after the last dose of SBRT to the targeted reference lesion. SBRT was administered using a dose and schedule recommended based upon the data showing the best abscopal effect using multiple fractions. If one site was targeted subject received 3 fractions (1 per day) of 8 Gy each (total: 24 Gy). If the target lesion was located in the thorax, the maximum total dose administered was 18 Gy (3 x 6 Gy).</description>
