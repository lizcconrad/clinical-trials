      In cigarette smokers that are HIV+, one of the most common HIV-associated non-AIDS conditions
      is the accelerated development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a disorder
      associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Based on the knowledge that COPD in
      smokers starts in the small airway epithelium, this study is focused on examining the
      hypothesis that the accelerated development of COPD associated with HIV infection results, in
      part, from an interaction of HIV directly on the small airway epithelium or through infection
      of cellular components of the immune system, with mediators released by these immune cells
      evoking premature biologic aging of the small airway epithelium. By identifying the early
      events in the pathogenesis of the HIV-associated accelerated COPD in smokers, we aim to
      identify biologic targets to which pharmacologic therapies could be addressed.

      While the epidemiologic data linking HIV infection to an increased risk for COPD is clear,
      the pathogenesis of the accelerated development of COPD in HIV infected smokers is not
      understood. We have focused on the SAE as the central target for the accelerated development
      of COPD in HIV infected smokers, as there is extensive data pointing to the SAE as the
      initial site of lung pathology in cigarette smokers and the small airways are the major site
      of airflow obstruction in COPD. Further, the emphysema associated with COPD begins in alveoli
      surrounding the SAE, and prior to the development of clinical evidence of lung disease, the
      SAE of smokers exhibit marked disordered biology, including changes in DNA methylation and
      gene expression, and disordered differentiation. Importantly, we have observed that HIV
      infection &quot;ages&quot; the SAE, with exaggerated shortening of SAE telomeres in individuals
      infected with HIV compared to HIV â€¾ smokers.

      We propose that the early events in the pathogenesis of the accelerated development of COPD
      in smokers with HIV infection results from the premature biologic aging of the small airway
      epithelium (SAE) mediated by the effects of direct HIV infection of the SAE and/or through
      the interaction of HIV-infected T cells and/or alveolar macrophages (AM) with the SAE,
      resulting in the disordered biology of the SAE that is central to the pathogenesis of COPD.
