  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stargardt disease is currently an incurable and untreatable macular dystrophy that causes
      severe visual loss in children and young adults, thereby causing enormous morbidity with
      economic, psychological, emotional, and social implications. There are no FDA approved
      therapeutic treatments for this disease. Therefore, the objective of this study is to collect
      natural history data from a large population of children and adults in order to evaluate
      possible efficacy measures for planned clinical trials.

      Participants will be recruited from each Investigator's own patient population as the study
      requires the availability of both multiyear retrospective data, as well as ongoing
      prospectively collected data. A concurrent ancillary study (SMART study) is also being
      conducted with a subset of the prospective study patients during their regular ProgSTAR study
      visits to expand the collection of retinal images to include microperimetry measurements
      gathered under scotopic (low light) conditions.

        The study population shall consist of up to 250 Stargardt disease patients (minimum of 150
        patients) recruited at up to 14 clinical centers across the US and Europe. Must be at least
        6 years old, able to cooperate in performing the examinations and be willing to attend
        regular 6 month follow-up visits for up to 24 months. Must present with atrophic lesions
        secondary to STGD and previously genotyped (at least 2 confirmed pathogenic mutations in
        the ABCA4 gene). If only 1 ABCA4 allele contains a pathogenic mutation, then the patient
        needs typical phenotype, i.e. at least one eye must have flecks at the level of the retinal
        pigment epithelium typical for STGD. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) must be 20 ETDRS
        letters (20/400 Snellen equivalent) or better.

          -  Current or previous participation in an interventional study to treat STGD such as
             gene therapy or stem cell therapy. Current participation in a drug trial or previous
             participation in a drug trial within six months before enrollment. The use of oral
             supplements of vitamins and minerals are permitted although the current use of Vitamin
             A supplementation shall be documented.

          -  The site Principal Investigator may declare any patient at their site ineligible to
             participate in the study for a sound medical reason prior to the patient's enrollment
             into the study.

          -  Any systemic disease with a limited survival prognosis (e.g. cancer, severe/unstable
             cardiovascular disease).

          -  Any condition that would interfere with the patient attending their regular follow-up
