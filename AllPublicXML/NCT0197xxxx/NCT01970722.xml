      This clinical trial studies the side effects and how well surgery and heated chemotherapy
      with or without non-heated chemotherapy after surgery works in treating patients with
      ovarian, fallopian tube, uterine, or peritoneal cancer. Giving a dose of heated chemotherapy
      into the abdomen during surgery that is done to remove ovarian, fallopian tube, uterine, or
      peritoneal cancer may help lower the risk of the cancer coming back. Giving unheated
      chemotherapy drugs directly into the abdomen after surgery may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy
      (HIPEC) followed by postoperative normothermic intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy is feasible
      and safe to administer, as measured by toxicities occurring during treatment or follow-up.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine quality of life (QoL) and compare the outcomes to a historical control of IP
      chemotherapy (no HIPEC) for women with ovarian cancer.

      II. To determine whether cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC alone is feasible and safe to
      administer, as measured by toxicities occurring during treatment or follow-up.

      III. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS).

      IV. To collect biospecimens and perform correlative translational studies focused on
      understanding the mechanisms of action of HIPEC on ovarian cancer and micro ribonucleic acid
      (RNA) profiling of ovarian cancer and ex vivo evaluation of oncolytic virus replication.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo surgery and receive hyperthermic cisplatin intraperitoneally (IP)
      over 60 minutes. Beginning at least 3 weeks after surgery, patients may receive carboplatin,
      paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, or gemcitabine hydrochloride IP or
      intravenously (IV) at the discretion of the medical and gynecologic oncologists.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-6, 6-9, 9-12, and 12-15
      months; every 3 months for 1 year; and then every 4 months for 1 year.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>QoL assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian (FACT-O) QoL questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-O has four subscales: physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being. Answers are on a scale of 0 'not at all' to 4 'very much'. To estimate effect sizes over time, generalized linear models will be used to estimate the correlations between potential prognostic factors. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) have utility in modeling longitudinal effects across time in prospective cohorts, and the models will include time-dependent covariate structures for continuous outcomes. QoL will be compared to a historical control of IP chemotherapy for women with ovarian cancer.</description>

    <measure>PFS</measure>
    <time_frame>Time-of-study entry to time-of-detection of new lesions on CT imaging that is triggered by cancer antigen 125 (CA125) progression as defined by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup Criteria (GCIG) or clinical symptoms or deterioration, assessed up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS will be estimated in both groups. The survival curve will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and graphically displayed along with the corresponding 95% confidence curves. The Cox proportional hazards model will be used to derive an estimate of the hazard ratio and its corresponding 95% confidence limits.</description>
