  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-group feasibility pilot trial of a peer-based, social media intervention to
      prevent obesity in infants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This novel intervention, delivered to mothers primarily through private Facebook groups, will
      promote behavior change through peer and self-modeling photo/video activities.

      In this study, we will implement an abbreviated 2-month version of the intervention with a
      single peer group of up to 10 mothers. We will assess the feasibility and acceptability of
      both the intervention and our intended outcome measures, in preparation for a randomized
      pilot trial of the full intervention.
