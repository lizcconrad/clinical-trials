  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-arm randomised clinical enabling study, with no investigational product. Keloid
      patients who are scheduled for surgical excision of one or more keloid scars (up to nine)
      will be recruited to the study. The aim is to investigate how collagen synthesis within
      keloid scars is affected by the current approved steroid treatment for keloids, triamcinolone
      acetonide (TAC). The primary endpoint will be fractional collagen synthesis in keloids which
      have received intra-lesional injections of TAC, placebo or no treatment prior to their
      removal. Fractional collagen synthesis will be determined using an established isotope/mass
      spectrometric technique which measures levels of deuterium incorporation into collagen
      following administration of heavy water to the subject. In addition; keloid tissue samples
      will be evaluated post surgery to identify further biomarkers of extracellular matrix
      synthesis and degradation for application in future clinical studies. Subjects will complete
      a screening visit and will then be randomised to receive three intra-lesional injections of
      TAC or placebo, or no treatment, at an interval of 2-3 weeks. Subjects will be randomised to
      different treatment sequences depending on the number of keloids they have scheduled for
      surgery, in such a way that subjects with multiple keloids will receive different arms of
      study treatment in their different keloids. Planned surgery for removal of their keloid(s)
      will be performed at week 6-8. All subjects will receive daily heavy water (Deuterium oxide)
      administration (twice daily or thrice daily as directed), with the first dose being taken at
      the Week 2 clinic visit and the final dose being taken on the day prior to surgery. A
      follow-up visit will be conducted at 1-4 weeks post-surgery.

    <description>Post surgical excision of keloids, tissue samples will be obtained by snap frozen biopsies. Fractional synthesis of collagen (that is, the fraction of the collagen that is newly synthesised during the labelling period) will be determined using mass spectrometry which measures the levels of deuterium incorporation into hydroxyproline or alanine in the collagen from the excised tissue samples, following administration of heavy water (Deuterium oxide) to the subject</description>
