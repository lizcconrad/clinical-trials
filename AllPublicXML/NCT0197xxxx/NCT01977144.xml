  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of Comprehensive Chromosome Screening(CCS)
      on patients with low ovarian reserve in an effort to improve success during in vitro
      fertilization and decrease the time to successful pregnancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will undergo a stimulated IVF cycle culminating with an ultrasound guided egg
      retrieval procedure and either a fresh or frozen embryo transfer as clinically appropriate
      and without regard to study. All embryology laboratory procedures will be conducted per
      routine. Once the embryo(s) have reached the blastocyst stage of development patients will be
      randomized into either the study group or the control group. The SOLAIRE Trial is &quot;blinded&quot;
      which means neither patients nor the RMANJ study doctor/staff will know to which group the
      embryos were randomized. The study group will have their embryo(s) biopsied for CCS on day 5,
      if appropriate, for a fresh day 6 embryo transfer. The control group will not have CCS
      testing performed on their embryo(s) and may proceed with a fresh or frozen embryo transfer
      as clinically appropriate. The maximum amount of embryos that can be transferred is two per
      RMANJ protocol. All post-transfer care and pregnancy monitoring will be identical and per
      routine protocol regardless of study participation.
