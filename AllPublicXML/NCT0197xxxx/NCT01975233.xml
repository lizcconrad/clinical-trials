      An observational post-market, open label, multicenter Observatory. The decision to use a WEB
      device to treat the patients has been made before and independently of the decision to
      include the patient in the French Observatory.

      Subjects will be screened for Observatory eligibility after giving informed consent. The
      embolization procedure will be performed in the digital angiographic suite using standard
      angiographic techniques.

      Initial analysis of Observatory data will be performed at completion of 12 month follow-up
      for the first thirty-five (35) subjects.

      Subjects will be followed per Institution's standard of care.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The decision to use a WEB device to treat the patients has been made before and
             independently of the decision to include the patient in the French Observatory

          2. Subject must be ≥ 18 years of age;

          3. Subject must have an intracranial aneurysm requiring treatment according to a
             multidisciplinary decision. If the subject has an additional aneurysm requiring
             treatment, the additional aneurysm must not require treatment within 30 days of the
             index procedure;

          4. Aneurysm to be treated must have the following characteristics:

             i. Morphology - saccular ii. Location:

               -  Basilar apex (BA), or

               -  Anterior cerebral Artery (ACA) iii. Diameter and width of the aneurysm is
                  appropriate size for treatment with the WEB Aneurysm Embolization System per
                  device Instructions for Use iv. Dome-to-Neck (DN) ratio ≥ 1.0

          5. Subject must be considered by the physician to be available for subsequent visits;

          6. Subject must be able to comply with all aspects of the screening, evaluation,
             treatment, and the post-procedure follow-up schedule;

             schedule; 11. Subject has known hypersensitivity to any component of the clinical
             evaluation device, procedural materials, or medications commonly used during the
             procedure; 12. Subject has received any investigational device for treatment of the
             target intracranial aneurysm prior to entry into this trial; 13. Subject has an acute
             life-threatening illness other than the neurological disease to be treated in this
             trial; 14. Subject has a life expectancy of less than 2 years due to other illness or
             condition (in addition to an intracranial aneurysm);

        Additional Exclusion Criteria for unruptured aneurysms:

        15. Subject has Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) evidence of

        neurovascular, or cardiovascular medical conditions that have resulted in neurological
        symptoms;

        Additional Exclusion Criteria for ruptured aneurysms:

        17. Subject has a ruptured aneurysm and Hunt &amp; Hess Score of IV or V;

        Additional Imaging Exclusion Criteria:

        18. Subject has CT or MRI evidence of intracranial tumor (except small meningioma) or any
        other intracranial vascular malformations on presentation; 19. Subject has angiographic
        evidence of vasculitis; 20. Microcatheter could not reach Subject's aneurysm to allow
        necessary access to treat with clinical evaluation device
