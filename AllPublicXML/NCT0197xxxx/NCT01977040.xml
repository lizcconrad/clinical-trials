    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter retrospective observational study of women diagnosed with a vasa previa
      during pregnancy or at delivery who delivered between 2000 and 2012. The study hopes to be
      able to describe techniques utilized to screen for and diagnose vasa previa as well as to
      describe the maternal characteristics and identify potential underlying risk factors that may
      provide a basis for future screening recommendations for vasa previa and treatment protocols.

      This is a multicenter retrospective study of women identified as having a vasa previa during
      pregnancy or at the time of delivery who delivered between January 1, 2000 and December 31,
      2012 at participating centers. The primary objective of the study is to describe techniques
      utilized to screen for and diagnose vasa previa.

        -  In those cases that were diagnosed antenatally, to describe the different management
           protocols utilized, correlate these management protocols with neonatal outcomes and
           support the management protocol that offers optimal outcomes for both mother and
           neonate.

        -  In those cases that were not diagnosed antenatally, to describe the clinical scenario
           surrounding delivery and the neonatal outcomes. Review the ultrasound reports and
           maternal characteristics to identify any potential risk factors for vasa previa that
           could have been identified antenatally in attempt to improve neonatal outcomes in the
           future.

        -  In all cases of diagnosed vasa previa (those diagnosed antepartum, intrapartum, and
           postpartum), to describe the maternal characteristics and identify potential underlying
           risk factors that may provide a basis for future screening recommendations and
           protocols. Due to the rarity of this diagnosis, the study hopes to include 100-250
           participants.

In cases diagnosed during pregnancy, to describe and correlate management protocols with neonatal outcomes
In cases diagnosed during pregnancy, to describe the clinical scenario surrounding delivery and neonatal outcome that might ultimately leading to improved neonatal outcome.
In all cases of diagnosed vasa previa, to describe the maternal characteristics and identify potential underlying risk factors that may provide a basis for future screening recommendations and protocols.</description>
