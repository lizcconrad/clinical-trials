      Multidisciplinary, multicentric, cross-sectional study on men in infertile couples who
      conduct their sperm test through their diagnosis of infertility

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Assessment of sperm parameters and metabolic syndrome relations in men attending a
      Reproductive Biomedicine centre for an infertility of their couple.

      Secondary objectives are to study relationship between sperm parameters and:

        -  adiposity and insulin resistance

        -  inflammation

        -  oxydative stress in blood and semen

        -  hormonal status Innovative parameters will also be assessed to determine the quality of
           semen (length of fingers, wrist circumference and epigenetics studies)

      Blood and sperm samples will be collected from all patients BLOOD :Whole blood was collected
      on dry, heparin or EDTA tubes. After several soft turnings, tubes were centrifuged at 1900g
      for 10min.Then plasma, serum, buffy coat or red blood cells were taken in microtubes and
      frozen at -80°C.

      SPERM: After liquefaction, total sperm was centrifuged at 600g for 10min. Seminal plasma was
      collected directly on microtubes and stored at -80°C. After trypsinisation, spermatozoa were
      fixed in Carnoy solution and stored at -20°C.

      DNA was separated from buffy coat using DNA extract kit
