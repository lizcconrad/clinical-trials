  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to compare the single dose pharmacokinetics of
      alisporivir in subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis to those of
      matched healthy subjects. The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of a single dose of alisporivir when administered to subjects with ESRD.
