    <textblock>
      Bimatoprost 0.03% preservative free monodose eye drops solution (BUDPF) is a new product
      composed of a synthetic prostamide, bimatoprost 0.3% in a preservative free formulation. This
      new product is used as a once-daily topical ocular therapy for the reduction of elevated
      intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma, or ocular hypertension, and
      that are sensitive to preservatives. The individual active component of BUDPF, bimatoprost is
      an established therapeutic agent with well documented IOP efficacy (1). Prostamides, such as
      bimatoprost, are believed to lower IOP mainly by increasing uveoscleral outflow. The
      comparator, Preservative Free Latanoprost 0.005% Unit Dose (LUDPF, eg. Monoprost®), was
      recently launched in a number of countries in Europe and contains latanoprost in a new
      preservative free formulation.

      It is clinically important to compare these newly entered preservative free products with
      respect to tolerability and efficacy. A better tolerability combined with maximum efficacy
      will reduce the burden of daily glaucoma therapy and provide a clear therapeutic benefit to
      the glaucoma patient by providing enhanced compliance and real-world IOP-lowering efficacy.

      The hypothesis of the study is that monodose bimatoprost is more effective than monodose
      latanoprost by at least 1 mmHg.
