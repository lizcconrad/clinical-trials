  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the acute response to meditation during a week-long meditation
      retreat at the Chopra Center as measured by the continuous, simultaneous monitoring of
      numerous biometric parameters in selected cohorts of experienced and novice meditators during
      periods of meditation and specific breathing techniques. Comparisons between cohorts as well
      as over time will allow for the identification of meditation and/or breathing-related
      changes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The biometric responses to meditation and breathing techniques will be compared between
      novice and experienced meditators, as well as initial versus final biometric responses in all
      participants stratified by cohort. Investigators hypothesize that novice meditators will
      experience a measurable change in response to mediation over the week-long retreat, whereas
      experienced meditators will demonstrate a more robust response than novice meditators on the
      first day of the retreat with less change over the retreat.
