    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part study in patients with metastatic CRPC. Part A is an open-label safety
      run-in study to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of olaparib when
      given in addition to abiraterone 1000 mg once daily. Part B is a randomised, double-blind,
      placebo controlled comparison of the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the dose of
      olaparib selected from Part A when given in addition to abiraterone, versus placebo given in
      addition to abiraterone. Abiraterone is indicated in combination with prednisone or
      prednisolone for the treatment of patients with metastatic CRPC. Prednisone or prednisolone 5
      mg twice daily (bid) will be administered with the abiraterone in this study.

      This is a 2-part study in patients with metastatic CRPC. Part A is an open-label safety
      run-in study to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of olaparib when given in addition to
      abiraterone 1000 mg once daily. Part B is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      comparison of the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the dose of olaparib selected from
      Part A when given in addition to abiraterone, versus placebo in addition to abiraterone.

      Abiraterone is indicated in combination with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of
      patients with metastatic CRPC. Prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg bid will be administered with
      the abiraterone in this study, but throughout this protocol the treatment will be referred to
      simply as abiraterone.

      For Part A of the study, 15 to 18 evaluable patients (Cohorts 1 and 2) are planned to be
      enrolled from approximately 4 sites in approximately 1 or 2 countries, and a further 12
      patients may be recruited into a 3rd cohort if necessary.

      For Part B of the study, approximately 140 patients who have received prior chemotherapy
      containing docetaxel will be randomised from approximately 40 sites in North America and
      Europe. Patients who have been dosed in Part A of the study may not participate in Part B.
