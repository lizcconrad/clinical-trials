  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was evaluate the effects of the oral probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri
      Prodentis upon the peri-implant health of edentulous patients with dental implants and
      peri-implant mucositis, establishing comparisons versus implants without peri-implant
      disease. The hypothesis of the study is that using these probiotics are going to improve the
      periimplant health.

    <textblock>
      A double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective cross-over study was made. All the patients
      were edentulous and were divided into two groups: A) with no peri-implant disease; B) with
      peri-implant mucositis affecting one or more implants. Patients with peri-implantitis were
      excluded. All patients in both groups initially received the oral probiotic Lactobacillus
      reuteri Prodentis, followed by placebo. Only the supervisor of the study knew this
      information; clinical examiner and patients were blind. Were studied: crevicular fluid
      volume, modified plaque index, probing depth, modified gingival index, and concentrations of
      interleukin 1β, interleukin 6 and interleukin 8, and Bacterial load.
