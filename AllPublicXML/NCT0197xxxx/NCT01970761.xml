    <textblock>
      Traumatic wounds inflict small- and large-fiber sensory nerve damage, causing neuropathic
      pain in scar tissue. Autologous fat grafting has been clinically shown to improve scar
      quality, but scantly study has explored its effects on pain. The aim of the study was to
      survey its effect on pain.

      Methods: From February 2008 and June 2013, a total of 36 patients received autologous fat
      grafting in scar areas. Patients who Douleur Neuropathique 4 Questions (scores &gt;4/10) were
      enrolled this study. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory
      (NPSI) were used to evaluate pain preoperatively and postoperatively after 1 week, 4 weeks,
      and 24 weeks. The mechanism of trauma, duration of allodynia, fat graft volume, and total
      follow-up time were recorded.
