    <textblock>
      In order to evaluate the late outcome in patients curatively treated for breast cancer, a
      special outpatient clinic will be developed.

      There are two main purposes of the outpatient clinic. The first purpose is evaluating the
      results of the radiation treatment by mapping A) late toxicity and B) tumour control and
      survival.

      The second purpose is that this outpatient clinic for late outcome will also function as a
      pilot for a new CAT (Computer Assisted Theragnostics, abbreviated CAT project) in which
      multiple late outcome variables will be recorded. In this pilot we want to investigate
      whether physical presence of the patient on the outpatient clinic, allowing physical
      examination, has any added value to the questionnaires filled in by the patient at home.

      The ultimate aim of this new CAT project is to use these multicentric data to develop models
      for predicting both oncological outcome and late side effects. Insight in the beneficial and
      adverse effects of a certain treatment using these predictive models, will be required choose
      the optimal treatment for the individual patient using a shared decision making process.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary endpoint is the incidence and severity of locoregional late toxicity at 10 years after radiotherapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>One assessment approximately 10 years after radiotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>As primary endpoint, for each patients the STAT score will be determined, summarizing locoregional late toxicity, e.g. fibrosis, cosmetic outcome, shoulder dysfunction, lymphedema arm, pain [Barnett et al, 2012].</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary endpoint is 10 year survival rate and the incidence and severity of other than locoregional late toxicity.</measure>
    <time_frame>One assessment approximately 10 years after radiotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoint is 10 year survival rate, and late toxicity, other than locoregional late toxicity, e.g. fatigue, neuropathy, menopausal symptoms, cardiac and pulmonary symptoms, and secondary tumors. Survival will be divided in overall survival, locoregional recurrence free survival and distant metastases free survival. For each patient other toxicity at 10 year will be scored according to CTC-AE 4.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>In addition, we will record potential risk factors for the several outcome parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>one consultation by physician (assistant) ten years after radiotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>The following the potential risk factors are recorded:
Patient related risk factors:
Age at time of diagnosis
Genetic and protein profile blood samples (optional with informed consent of participant)
Smoking
Treatment related factors:
Type of surgery
Excision volume
Post-operative complications
Resection margins Free
Scar visibility
Axillary surgery
Radiotherapy
Fractionation scheme
Target volumes

    <description>All patients treated for breast cancer with curative intent in MAASTRO clinic in 2002-2003 who are still alive, who respond to our invitation letter and are willing to participate to visit the outpatient clinic. These patients will be sent a questionnaire with both basic and more detailed questions on their disease-status and on quality of life related outcome. In addition they will be asked to come to MAASTRO clinic for a more detailed evaluation of late side effects of the treatment. Patients are seen by a physician or a physician assistant at the outpatient clinic.</description>

    <description>The participants are seen at the outpatient clinic by a physician or a physician assistant. To analyse fibrosis clinical examination of the breast will be performed. To analyse shoulder function anteversion / retroversion, abduction / adduction and internal / external rotation will be measured. To analyse edema the arm circumference will be measured 15 cm above and below the medial epicondyle (both sides). Also, a photograph of the breast will be made for cosmetic analysis using standardized procedures. Finally a blood sample or saliva will be obtained, if the patient has given written informed consent to participate in the Biobank.</description>

      As part of the study a blood sample or saliva will be obtained, if the patient has given
      written informed consent to participate in the Biobank. The purpose to determine, by means of
      DNA and protein analysis, the relationship between DNA and protein profiles and a number of
      endpoints, which are important for the patient such as overall survival and side effects.

        Participants are all patients who have been treated for breast cancer with curative intent
        in MAASTRO clinic in 2002-2003. They will be retrieved from the appointment -IT system. For
        all these patients will be checked whether they are alive using the MBA (municipal base
        administration).
