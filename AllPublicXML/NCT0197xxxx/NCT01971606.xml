      Periprocedural treatment with high-dose statins is known to have cardioprotective and
      pleiotropic effects, such as anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory actions.

      -Objective: to determine whether preoperative rosuvastatin loading is independently
      associated with reduced myocardial ischemia and clinical outcomes in patients with stable
      angina undergoing isolated off-pump coronary bypass (OPCAB) in patients with acute coronary
      syndrome.

      Study design

        -  Prospective, double-blinded, single-center study of each 117 subjects enrolled

        -  Subjects with acute coronary syndrome who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will
           be enrolled preoperatively.

        -  Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to A) High-dose rosuvastatin (n=117) vs. B)
           Placebo (n=117).

        -  The amount of preoperative administration of high-dose rosuvastatin will be 60mg of a
           total

        -  All subjects will undergo OPCAB procedure. - The primary and secondary endpoints will be
           compared at 30 days and 2 years postoperatively between two groups
