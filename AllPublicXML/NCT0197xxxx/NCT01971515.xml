    <description>Part 1: MSC2363318A will be administered orally once daily for repeated 21-day cycles until intolerable toxicity or disease progression. Additional dose escalations will continue until Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is reached, the food effect will be investigated in a separate group.
Part 2 (Cohort 1): MSC2363318A will be administered orally once daily for repeated 21-day cycles until intolerable toxicity or disease progression in subjects with PAM pathway alterations.
Dose reductions or treatment interruptions will be made at the discretion of the Investigator. If treatment interruption is required due to an acute or less severe but intolerable MSC2363318A-related event, at least a 1-week break is recommended. If, at retreatment, the dose reduction is not required, then the &quot;continuous daily dosing regimen&quot; may be replaced with an &quot;intermittent dose regimen&quot; of 2 weeks on, 1 week off (i.e. daily dosing from Day 1 to Day 15 followed by no dosing on Day 16 to Day 21 of the cycle).</description>
