  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Taiwan has launched a successful nationwide neonatal hepatitis B immunization since July 1,
      1984. It successfully decreased the incidence of hepatitis B virus infection, the hepatitis B
      carrier rate as well as liver diseases among children and adolescents. The sexual
      transmission route is another important way of hepatitis B infection aside from the mother
      and child vertical infection, especially for youth and adults. Hepatitis B vaccination cohort
      refers to those who were born after 1986 and received hepatitis B vaccine immunization during
      newborn period. They are gradually entering into young adults and adolescent age. Among them,
      there is no empirical evidence to show the actual infection rate and to help implement
      hepatitis B vaccine booster policy for those who had three seronegative viral markers of
      hepatitis B. Therefore, the study design is to collect three consecutive years graduate
      school students school entry health examination data and undergo three hepatitis B viral
      markers checkup and blood types. The data linkage includes their health checkup data in the
      freshmen period, Taiwan CDC databank for neonatal hepatitis B immunization records, pregnancy
      and birth record registry, Taiwan cancer registry and Taiwan death record registry.

      This study is aimed to delineate the hepatitis B seroepidemiology among young adults with or
      without neonatal hepatitis B immunization, among young adults with hepatitis B booster in the
      university period, among the mothers of hepatitis B vaccination cohort. The results of this
      study will provide important information to help government implement hepatitis B vaccine
      booster policy in the adolescents and young adults.
