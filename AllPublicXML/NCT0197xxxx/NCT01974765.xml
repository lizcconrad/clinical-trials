  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study. The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or
      bad enzalutamide has on the patient and the cancer. All patients who enter the study will be
      closely monitored for side-effects. If multiple patients develop significant side effects
      from enzalutamide, the study may be stopped early.

      Enzalutamide is an androgen-receptor inhibitor, which means that it blocks the activity of
      the hormone testosterone. In ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers that
      express the androgen receptor, blocking the androgen-receptor may possibly slow or stop tumor
      growth. Enzalutamide has been studied in women with breast cancer, but this is the first
      study using enzalutamide for the treatment of patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or
      fallopian tube cancer.

    <description>After signing a screening consent, patients archival tissue will be evaluated for degree of AR positivity by AR staining. Patients with no archival tissue available will undergo a biopsy (using the modality deemed most appropriate by the patient's physician) for collection of tumor tissue for AR positivity by IHC. Only AR+ patients, defined as ≥5 % positivity by IHC, will be included. All IHC testing will be performed in the MSKCC Clinical CLIA approved laboratory.
All enrolled patients will be treated with enzalutamide 160 mg by mouth QD until progression of disease (POD), unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal from study. All treatments will be administered in the outpatient setting.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

             pathology report

          -  AR expression ≥5% by IHC. In cases where multiple blocks are available staining will
             be performed on unstained slides from 3 separate blocks. If ≥ 5% AR tumor staining is
             seen on ≥ 1 slide the tumor will be considered to be AR+.

          -  Patients with the following histologic cell types are eligible: serous adenocarcinoma,
             endometrioid adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma,

             carcinoma, malignant Brenner's tumor, or adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified

          -  Measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1. Measurable disease is defined as at least
             one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension. Each lesion must
             be ≥10mm when measured by CT, MRI or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or ≥ 20mm
             when measured by chest x-ray. Lymph nodes must be ≥ 15mm in short axis when measured
