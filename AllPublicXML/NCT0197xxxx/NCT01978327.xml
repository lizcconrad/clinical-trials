  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2647544 is an orally available, selective inhibitor of Lp PLA2 that is being developed for
      the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The current study is a single-blind, randomised,
      placebo-controlled, 4-cohort study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of repeat doses of GSK2647544. Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 will evaluate escalating
      doses of GSK2647544 in young healthy volunteers for 7 days, 7 days, and 14 days,
      respectively. Cohort 4 will evaluate repeat doses of GSK2647544 in healthy elderly volunteers
      for 14 days. Additionally, Cohorts 1 and 3 will include an assessment of potential drug-drug
      interaction with simvastatin to examine CYP3A4 inhibition by GSK2647544.

  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Given the strength of CYP3A4 inhibition observed in Cohort 1, there is no rationale to
    investigate higher doses of GSK2647544 in the following two cohorts
