  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the role of occupational therapy within Head Start
      programs. Representatives within Head Start will be asked to participate in a nationwide
      internet based survey identifying the amount and type of services provided within this area.
      The Model of Human Occupation (MOHO) will also be included in the study by identifying
      current use of the model and how it can be utilized in the future. In order to complete this
      study to the fullest extent, we must begin by defining the Model of Human Occupation as well
      as understanding the mission of the National Head Start Association. The vision of MOHO is to
      support practice that is focused on occupation, client centered, holistic, evidence-based,
      and complementary to other occupational therapy models. The mission of the National Head
      Start Association is to coalesce, inspire and support the Head Start field as a leader in
      early childhood development and education. This has lead researchers to perform the following
      study: An examination of occupational therapy in the context of Head Start.

      Participants will be informed of the intent of the study in the initial e-mail introduction
      and invitation of participation. Participants will be given the opportunity to ask questions
      about the study by asking the research assistants, whose names and email addresses will be
      given. Within the initial email introduction/invitation of participation, participants will
      be given the name and contact information of the research assistants and will be instructed
      to direct all questions regarding the survey to them. All data received from the survey
      participants will be returned de-identified. None of the data collected will be traceable to
      the survey participants. Participants will be provided the research assistants' email
      addresses and can contact them should they be interested in receiving any results from the
      study. The benefits of the study are to advance the overall role of Occupational Therapy
      services within head start facilities. This study could further understandings of how and /
      or why certain concepts should / shouldn't be used, could assist administrators in developing
      quality programming, and contribute to the body of knowledge in Occupational Therapy in Head
      Start programs. The research assistants' e-mail addresses will be provided in the consent
      forms with a statement saying that they will be able to contact her via e-mail should they be
      interested in receiving any results from the study.Informed consent will be obtained through
      the initial email introduction and formal request for participation. Participants will be
      provided study information on the first page of the survey and will indicate their consent by
      clicking &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; before beginning the survey.

        Individuals within Head Start programs nationwide will be contacted to participate in an
        online survey about the use/role of occupational therapy in Head Start. Particapants will
        be recruited to participate in the study based upon their association with Head Start
        organizations across the United States. An initial e-mail will be sent to each individual
        informing them of the purpose of the study, and inviting them to participate in the survey.
        A link to the survey along with specific instructions in how to complete it will be
        included in the email. See attached email recruitment script. The age range is from 18 and
        up because a variety of disciplines may be selected to respond to the survey. Participants
        under the age of 18 are typically still in school and therefore may lack the exposure and
        understanding of occupational therapy services and the role of the occupational therapist
        within the Head Start program.
