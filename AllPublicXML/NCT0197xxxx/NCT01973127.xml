  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on the
      right side of the head will make craving towards alcohol less severe in recently detoxified
      alcohol addicted patients.

      Although there are successful treatment option to detoxify patients form their alcohol use,
      many patients tend to relapse. This relapse is mainly caused by a high level of
      (uncontrollable) craving towards alcohol. This aspect of addiction is with the existing
      options hard to treat, there is a great need of new successful treatment modalities. rTMS is
      a FDA approved treatment method for depression. Recently some small scale studies have shown
      promising results on rTMS in the treatment of addiction. In this study the investigators
      focus on alcohol addiction since it is the addiction with the highest morbidity and mortality
      in the Netherlands.

      In this study the investigators focus on three levels of interest: the biological level, the
      functional level and the clinical level. The investigators will measure the effect of rTMS
      directly on brain activity through EEG recording. The investigators investigate its effects
      on cognitive performance through the use of neuropsychological computer tasks. The
      investigators will address clinical behavior (craving and alcohol use) with questionnaires.

    <description>rTMS on the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. TMS procedure: The resting motor threshold (RMT) will be defined in each subject as the minimal stimulation intensity evoking an MEP of ≥ 0.05 mV in 50% of the trials in the muscle of the right thumb (M. abductor pollicis brevis). TMS will be conducted in the form of 'conventional rTMS', whereby 30 trains of 10 Hz pulses with a duration of 5 seconds and an inter-train interval of 25 seconds are applied to the righ dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (50 pulses per train, 6000 pulses per session). Used equipment: Magstim Rapid 2 device.</description>
