    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of pioglitazone 30 mg on glycemic
      control as when used in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus
      treated with fixed combinations of metformin and sulfonylurea.

      The drug being tested in this study is called pioglitazone. Pioglitazone is being tested to
      treat glycemic control in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. This
      study will look at glycemic control in people who take triple oral therapy of metformin,
      sulfonylurea, and pioglitazone 15 mg.

      The study will enroll approximately 114 patients. All participants will be asked to take one
      pioglitazone tablet at the same time each day throughout the study as well as continuing
      their previous dose of metformin and sulfonylurea..

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Korea. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 25 weeks. Participants will make 4 visits to the hospital or endocrinologist's
      office, and will be contacted by telephone 7 days after last dose of study drug for a
      follow-up assessment.

             defined by the ADA criteria 2012

          3. Male or female between 18 and 80 years of age

          4. Patients with stable triple oral therapy of metformin + sulfonylurea + pioglitazone
             (ACTOS) 15 mg or ACTOSMET(Pioglitazone 15mg/Metformin 850mg) and sulfonylurea for at
             least 12 weeks at the screening visit

          5. Patients with HbA1c ≥7.0% at the screening visit

          6. Patients with C-peptide ≥1.0 ng/mL at the screening visit

             contraception, and can neither be pregnant nor lactating from screening throughout the
             duration of the study, up to 30 days after the last dose of the study medication

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from enrollment:

          1. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or secondary forms of diabetes

          2. Patients who have been treated with insulin for ≥7 days within 3 months prior to the
