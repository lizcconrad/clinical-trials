  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will pilot the use of IGF-1 as a novel treatment for core symptoms of
      autism. We will use a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial design in five
      children with autism to evaluate the impact of IGF-1 treatment on autism-specific impairments
      in socialization, language, and repetitive behaviors. We expect to provide evidence for the
      safety and feasibility of IGF-1 in ameliorating social withdrawal in children with Autistic
      Disorder. Further, we expect to demonstrate that IGF-1 is associated with improvement on
      secondary outcomes of social impairment, language delay, and repetitive behavior, as well as
      on functional outcomes of global severity.

      IGF-1 is an FDA approved, commercially available compound that crosses the blood-brain
      barrier and has beneficial effects on synaptic development by promoting neuronal cell
      survival, synaptic maturation, and synaptic plasticity. IGF-1 is effective in reversing mouse
      and neuronal models of Rett syndrome and Phelan McDermid syndrome, both single gene causes of
      ASD and may therefore be effective in treating autism spectrum disorders (ASD) more broadly.

    <description>Randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover format with 12 weeks in each treatment arm (IGF-1 and placebo), separated by a four-week wash-out phase.
Dose titration will be initiated at 0.04 mg/kg twice daily by subcutaneous injection, and increased, as tolerated, every week by 0.04 mg/kg per dose to a maximum of 0.12 mg/kg twice daily. Doses may be decreased according to tolerability by 0.04 mg/kg per dose. Medication will be administered twice daily with meals, and preprandial glucose monitoring will be performed by parents at treatment initiation, prior to each injection, and until a well tolerated dose is established.</description>
