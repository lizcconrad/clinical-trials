      This research study will examine if a targeted computerized cognitive remediation (CCR)
      training program is better for treating geriatric depression than general computer activity.
      We will also examine whether this intervention is related to improvement in cognitive and
      depressive symptoms. Elderly patients with depression, who have, and who have not been
      treated with antidepressant medication for their illness, will be recruited to participate in
      either a 30 hour cognitive remediation program or general computer activity designed to be
      both challenging and interesting. They will be asked to complete between 1 and 3 hours of
      remediation per day over 4 weeks. While undergoing the cognitive remediation participants
      will be asked questions to assess their symptoms of, as well as the severity of, their
      depression weekly. This will inform researchers about whether or not the CCR is helping to
      improve depressive symptoms. At the end of the CCR study, participants will be given a
      battery of cognitive tests design to tell investigators whether or not the CCR improved their
      thinking in a variety of different ways including improving attention, memory, and
      organization. Investigators will also determine whether changes in participants' thinking are
      related to changes in their mood or other depressive symptoms. It is hoped that information
      gained from this study will help investigators to better understand the brain processes
      associated with depression, recovery from depression, and will help inform the development of
      future alternative treatments for this illness.
