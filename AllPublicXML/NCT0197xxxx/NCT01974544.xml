    <textblock>
      The obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are among the most threatening health crisis
      for the 21st century. Currently, it is estimated that there are 205 million people with T2DM
      worldwide. Chile has a similar magnitude of problem with the prevalence of diabetes
      increasing from 6.3% in 2003 to 9.4% in 2010. T2DM is a complex disease characterized by
      hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and a relative β-cell failure. Well-known studies for the
      treatment of T2DM (ADVANCE trial) showed that intensive medical treatment significantly
      reduces the complication of diabetes. On the other hand, less than 40% of patients with T2DM
      achieve a metabolic control of diabetes, despite medical treatment. Recently, bariatric
      surgery has emerged as an effective treatment for T2DM. Data from different sources has shown
      that Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) can place T2DM into remission. More recently, Sleeve
      Gastrectomy (SG) has been shown to also impact metabolically and hence also emerged as an
      attractive T2DM-controlling bariatric procedure with fewer complications than RYGB. Recently,
      the International Federation for Diabetes has supported the use gastrointestinal surgery
      initially developed for morbid obesity as an option to treat patients with diabetes. In the
      current proposal the investigators aim to address several issues concerning metabolic surgery
      and the ability of the most common bariatric procedures performed to control diabetes. The
      investigators are proposing a prospective randomized trial comparing RYGB, SG and the best
      medical treatment availed for the T2DM in poorly control patients with the primary endpoint
      being 36 month glycemic control (patients achieving HbA1C &lt; 6.5%, normal glucose levels not
      requiring medication). The main working hypothesis is that RYGB and SG achieves better
      glycemic control than the best treatment availed for the T2DM based on more effective
      mechanisms to enhance insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism and blood
      pressure control. The goals are, 1) Is gastric bypass surgery and sleeve gastrectomy safe for
      the microvascular complications of T2DM?; 2) Can gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy surgery
      and intensive non surgical treatment reverse or reduce the progression of microvascular
      complications of T2DM?; and 3) Can gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy realize a return on
      investment within 2 years in patients with type 2 diabetes who are at risk of developing or
      deteriorating microvascular complications?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently 205 million patients in the world suffer with Type 2 diabetes and severe and
      complex obesity. The obesity is defined as a body mass index above 30 kg/m2 with life or limb
      threatening co‐morbidities.

      The bariatric surgery increase in worldwide, but their effects on the microvascular
      complications of T2DM have never been the focus of a randomised controlled clinical trial.

      To address this research question a three arms on randomised controlled clinical trial
      comparing gastric bypass surgery, sleeve gastrectomy and modern best medical care is required
      to investigate differences in long term glycaemia and microvascular complications of T2DM.

      This is a prospective intervention study on patients with T2DM and obesity undergoing gastric
      bypass surgery, sleeve gastrectomy or non surgical best medical care. Patients will have T2DM
      for more than 2 years and have or be at high risk of developing kidney damage. Patients will
      be recruited from specialist medical and surgical clinics.

      We expect to screen approximately 300 patients to allow 75 to be randomized. Twenty five
      subjects with kidney damage or high risk of kidney damage secondary to T2DM will undergo
      gastric bypass surgery. Another 25 sleeve gastrectomy and the final 25 will be treated using
      the American Diabetes Association protocol. Patients with HbA1c ≥9.0% will undergo
      individualised optimisation of glycaemia as this should improve surgical outcomes. Particular
      attention will be given to the avoidance of hypoglycaemia. Patients' other risk factors
      (including hypertension and dyslipidaemia) will be optimised based on the International
      Diabetes Federation guidelines.

      The clinical endpoints that will be assessed are: renal function, peripheral and autonomic
      nervous system function, the retina, of direct healthcare cost, glycaemic control, blood
      pressure, lipids, quality of life, postprandial responses, treatment complications.

    <description>If patients are unable to maintain their haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values below 6.5% on diet alone, treatment with metformin 1g twice daily will be started. If HbA1c remains above 7.0% then liraglutide 0.6 mg once daily (with a subsequent increases to 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg once daily). If liraglutide is not tolerated then a Dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor (sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin) or pioglitazone will be considered. If HbA1c remains above 7.5% long acting insulin analogues such as detemir o glargine will be added. If insulin is started liraglutide can be stopped. The insulin dose will be adjusted according to the morning fasting blood glucose concentration. Finally, Fast-acting meal time insulin (lispro, aspart or glulisine) will be added if glycemic goal is not achieved. Repaglinide can be considered in patients with significant renal impairment and in patients who refused insulin treatment.</description>

Also, a nutritionist will be design an individual dietitian plan, this plan should be formulated as a collaborative therapeutic alliance among the patient and family, physician, and other members of the health care team.</description>
