    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study that will assess the effect of NKTR- 102 on cardiac ventricular
      repolarization, as characterized by QTcF (QT interval with Fridericia correction) interval
      values, in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors following administration of a
      single dose of NKTR-102.
