  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, first-in-man investigational study, to assess the
      safety and technical feasibility, deployment and withdrawal characteristics of the NovaCross™
      micro-catheter during an interventional coronary angioplasty procedure and evaluating the CTO
      penetration rate.

      Each study subject/patient will have a total of one (1) procedure performed for this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult aged 25-80

          2. Patient understands and has signed the study informed consent form.

          3. Patient has an angiographic documented Chronic Total Occlusion (i.e. &gt;3 months
             occlusion duration) showing distal TIMI flow 0.

          4. Suitable candidate for non-emergent, coronary angioplasty

          5. Documented coronary angiography preceding the PCI reveals at least one CTO lesion
             situated in a non-infarct related coronary artery or its side branches with the
             following characteristics:

               1. Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 0 flow for at least 90 days;

               2. Satisfactory distal vessel visualization

               3. CTO should be amenable to percutaneous treatment and must be located in a
                  coronary vessel with a reference diameter of at least 2 millimeters.

               4. CTO refractory to a minimum of 10 minutes of conventional guide wire attempt.

          7. Left ventricle ejection fraction &gt; 25%

        For the purpose of this trial, a CTO is defined as a 100% luminal narrowing without
        antegrade flow or with antegrade or retrograde filling through collateral vessels.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Patient unable to give informed consent. 2. Current participation in another study

             CTO location (Ostial bifurcation origins may be considered), SVG CTO and in-stent
             CTOs.

             5. Intolerance to aspirin or Clopidogrel or Prasugrel or Ticagrelor medications 6.
             Appearance of a fresh thrombus or intraluminal filling defects. 7. Recent major

             of &gt; 2.3mg/dl) 10. Active gastrointestinal bleeding 11. Active infection or fever that
             may be due to infection 12. Life expectancy &lt; 2 years due to other illnesses 13.

             to comply with any protocol requirements 22. Pregnant or nursing 23. Extensive prior
             dissection from a coronary guidewire use 24. Drug abuse or alcoholism. 25. Patients
             under custodial care. 26. Bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder; 27. Kawasaki's
