  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive problems are a primary concern for people with multiple sclerosis. In many cases,
      people with MS report these issues to be more debilitating than the motor symptoms that are
      targeted by most treatment strategies. For people with MS, impaired memory and thinking
      skills can interfere with the ability to function efficiently in multiple professional and
      personal roles. Finding ways to decrease, slow, or reverse declines in memory and thinking
      skills is a vitally important research priority. We now know that engaging in intellectually
      enriching activities helps protect against the negative impact of MS disease-related declines
      in memory and thinking. Such activities contribute to something called 'cognitive reserve,'
      which serves as a protection against disease-related declines in memory and thinking. Thus
      far, no one has created a treatment that aims to provide a concentrated 'dose' of
      intellectual enrichment to build cognitive reserve. The present intervention aims to do
      precisely this. Here, we have developed a program of enriching activities that are delivered
      via a personal iPad. This allows for a 12-week 'treatment' that is entirely home-based, while
      also providing close personal contact between participants and our study personnel, who will
      communicate daily via emails. Week by week, participants choose from a menu of intellectually
      enriching activities such that their treatment is dynamic and customizable to fit their
      interests. The intervention is designed to be fun, as we hope the activities will be
      incorporated into people's lives beyond the period of the study itself. Given what we already
      know about the striking benefits of cognitive reserve to protect against disease-related
      declines in cognitive functioning, we expect to show that treatment with a daily, intense,
      intellectually enriching schedule of activities results in improved thinking and memory for
      people with MS. We will also investigate the positive impact of our treatment on the brains
      of people with MS through brain scans. We expect to see evidence for a shift toward more
      efficient processing in the brain, changes that translate to improved memory and thinking
      skills.
