    <description>The clinical pharmacist will provide a structured 30-minute intervention for enhancing their medication adherence.
The recommendations include: discussion on hypertension and/or diabetes, risk of complications, prescribed drug therapy, correct use of medications and proper dosage, possible adverse effects, route of administration, schedule of administration and correct storage. The pharmacist will also emphasize the importance of lifestyle modifications. Printed educational material, with information on hypertension and/ or diabetes medications, including suggested lifestyle interventions was prepared to assist in the intervention and will be handed to patients in the end of the session.</description>
