  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients now commonly live well into adulthood, this means they are
      progressively accumulating damage to the insulin-secreting cells inside their pancreas. This
      explains why most adult patients have some degree of abnormal sugar regulation &amp; rates of
      diabetes rise significantly with age. CF related diabetes is categorically different from
      other types of diabetes &amp; its development is serious as it heralds a faster decline in lung
      function &amp; a reduced life expectancy.

      The hallmark of abnormal sugar handling in CF is high glucose levels after meals as the
      damaged pancreas responds abnormally slowly. Over 70% of the initial response of a healthy
      pancreas is induced, not by glucose alone, but by hormones released from the bowel known as
      incretins. We want to establish whether incretins are important in blood sugar handling in CF
      as specific drugs that enhance their effect are now available.

      The study hypothesis is that the incretin system will function normally in patients with
      Cystic Fibrosis. To show this we will measure how much insulin secretion is dependant on
      incretin hormones in CF patients by comparing levels after a sugary drink test and then an
      intravenous glucose drip test (run at a rate that mimics the blood sugar levels obtained
      during the first test to make it a fair comparison ) - as incretins will only be produced in
      the first test when the sugar passes through the bowel any extra insulin produced will be due
      to these hormones. To detect resistance to the incretin hormones we will separately measure
      responses to direct infusions of the hormones themselves. We will explore which components of
      meals cause incretin hormone release from the bowel wall by measuring blood levels after
      different types of meals are consumed. Finally we will measure levels of the enzyme that
      breaks down the incretin hormones (DPP-4) to know if they are deactivated more quickly in
      people with CF. By describing the incretin system in CF we will considerably improve our
      understanding of this important condition as well as potentially highlighting new ways to
      treat it.

    <measure>Area Under Curve (AUC) of Insulin &amp; C-peptide secretion during a matched isoglycemic clamp</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Differences in Insulin &amp; C-peptide secretion will be measured over a 4-hour period following an oral glucose tolerance test and then separately over the same period during a matched isoglycemic glucose infusion (which will recreate the glucose values obtained during the oral glucose tolerance test). The difference in these values can be wholly attributed to the effect of incretin hormones.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Volume of intravenous glucose required to maintain a hyperglycemic clamp at 180-216mg/dL</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>A hyperglycemic clamp uses an intravenous glucose infusion to fix blood sugar at a certain level. We will use such a technique to fix blood sugar levels at 180-216mg/dL (10-12 mmol/l) for one hour then infuse either an incretin hormone (GLP-1/GIP) or placebo (sodium chloride) for a further two hours. The excess volume of intravenous glucose required during the last two hours of the test (compared to the first) will allow us to calculate what if any effect the incretin hormones have on the pancreas in patients with Cystic Fibrosis</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum DPP-4 levels</measure>
    <time_frame>0 mins</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure serum DPP-4 levels on 2 separate occasions in both CF and control groups to establish if there are any differences in how rapidly the incretin hormones are deactivated between the groups</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>AUC incretin hormone levels (GLP-1/GIP)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Incretin hormone levels (GLP-1/GIP) will be measured in response to an oral glucose tolerance test, an intravenous isoglycemic glucose infusion as well as in response to standardised meals of different composition (fat-rich, carbohydrate rich &amp; mixed).</description>

    <description>Continuous glucose monitoring entails wearing a small portable device, usually on the upper arm, for a period of three days. The device uses a small plastic tube to record the glucose level from interstitial fluid &amp; every minute wirelessly transmits this information to a base unit to enable a very accurate estimate of average blood sugar control to be defined.</description>
