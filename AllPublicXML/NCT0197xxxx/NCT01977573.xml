  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in approximately 228 subjects with anemia associated with CKD
      who are not on dialysis. Two groups of subjects will be enrolled into the study: Group 1:
      recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) naive subjects; Group 2: rhEPO users, who are
      currently receiving rhEPO. Subjects who are rhEPO naive will be randomized to receive either
      GSK1278863 once daily (QD) or rhEPO in a 3:1 fashion; subjects who are receiving an rhEPO
      before enrolling (rhEPO users) will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to GSK1278863 QD or to the
      control arm. For those randomized to the control arm, the decision around whether the subject
      requires rhEPO, the selection of the type of rhEPO (if needed) and the choice of rhEPO dose
      to achieve and maintain Hgb concentrations within the target range should be based on
      Investigator clinical judgment, with the historical rhEPO dose and the current Hgb value
      being considered. The study consists of a screening phase of at least 4 weeks, a 24-week
      treatment phase and a follow-up visit that will occur approximately 4 weeks after completing
      treatment. It is anticipated that the data generated will enable selection of the starting
      dose(s) and optimize dose adjustment regimen(s) for Phase 3 clinical trials.

    <measure>Summary of Hemoglobin (Hgb) Concentration at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The original Hgb Criteria for Group 1- rhEPO naive participants with a stable baseline Hgb of 8.0-10.0 g/dL (8.0-10.0 g/dL USA site only) and for Group 2- rhEPO users with a stable baseline Hgb of 9.0-10.5 g/dL (9.0-10.5 g/dL USA site only); the Hgb target range was 9.0 to 10.5 g/dL (9.0-10.5 g/dL USA site only). The study amended Hgb Criteria for Group 1- rhEPO naive participants with a stable baseline Hgb of 8.0-11.0 g/dL and Group 2- rhEPO users with a stable baseline Hgb of 9.0-11.5 g/dL; Hgb target range - 10.0 to 11.5 g/dL. Data are presented for those participants following the original criteria (&quot;Original&quot;) and those following the amended (&quot;Amended&quot;) criteria. The primary objective was to characterize the ability of GSK1278863 to achieve mean Hgb response within the target range.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Reaching Pre-defined Hgb Stopping Criteria</measure>

    <description>The Hgb stopping criteria was a value of &lt;7.5 mg/dL obtained on-site via a validated point-of-care Hgb measurement device, which necessitated permanent discontinuation of the study medication. None of the participants met the stopping criteria therefore there is no data to present for this outcome measure.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Two groups of participants(par.) were enrolled in this study. Group 1 consisted of recombinant human erythropoietin(rhEPO)-naive par. whereas Group 2 consisted of rhEPO users.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Post screening, eligible par. were randomized to receive either GSK1278863 once a day (QD) or to the Control arm in a 3:1 fashion in Group 1 and 1:1 fashion in Group 2.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>RhEPO-naive participants were randomly assigned to receive GSK1278863 QD for 24 weeks. Participants were blinded to the dose-level they received throughout the study.

        <description>The original Hgb Criteria for Group 1- rhEPO naive participants with a stable baseline Hgb of 8.0-10.0 g/dL (8.0-10.0 g/dL USA site only) and for Group 2- rhEPO users with a stable baseline Hgb of 9.0-10.5 g/dL (9.0-10.5 g/dL USA site only); the Hgb target range was 9.0 to 10.5 g/dL (9.0-10.5 g/dL USA site only). The study amended Hgb Criteria for Group 1- rhEPO naive participants with a stable baseline Hgb of 8.0-11.0 g/dL and Group 2- rhEPO users with a stable baseline Hgb of 9.0-11.5 g/dL; Hgb target range - 10.0 to 11.5 g/dL. Data are presented for those participants following the original criteria (&quot;Original&quot;) and those following the amended (&quot;Amended&quot;) criteria. The primary objective was to characterize the ability of GSK1278863 to achieve mean Hgb response within the target range.</description>

          <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Hepcidin Concentration at Week 24</title>
          <description>Baseline is the last pre-dose hepcidin value. Percent change was calculated as 100 multiplied by (exponential of mean change on log scale minus 1). Change was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the Week 24 value.</description>
          <population>Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population consisted all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study drug, had a Baseline and at least one corresponding on-treatment assessment. Only participants with available hepcidin values at Baseline and Week 24 were analyzed.</population>

        <description>Blood samples for control arm were collected pre-dose for EPO measurement. Blood samples for GSK1278863 arms were collected on Day 1 (pre-dose ), Week 4 (6-12 hours post-dose ), Week 4 (7-13, 8-14, 9-15, hours post-dose ), Week 8 (pre -dose ), Week 12 (pre -dose ), Week 16 (pre -dose ), Week 20 (pre -dose , 3 hour post-dose ) Week 24 (pre -dose ), and Week 28 (pre -dose ) for EPO measurement. The maximum observed change from baseline in EPO was recorded for each arm. Baseline value for EPO is the pre-dose value on Day 1. Change from Baseline in EPO was calculated as the individual post-baseline values minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Transferrin Saturation at Week 24</title>
        <description>Transferrin saturation is measured as a percentage; it is a ratio of serum iron and total iron-binding capacity. Baseline is the last pre-dose transferrin saturation value. Percent change was calculated as 100 multiplied by (exponential of mean change on log scale minus 1). Change was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-dose value.</description>

        <description>Reticulocytes are slightly immature red blood cells. Reticulocyte Hgb content is used to differentiate iron deficiency from other causes of anemia. Baseline is the last pre-dose CHr value. Change from Baseline in reticulocyte Hgb was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-dose value.</description>

            <description>RhEPO users were randomly assigned to receive GSK1278863 QD for 24 weeks. Participants were blinded to the dose-level they received throughout the study. At Week 24, participants stopped taking GSK1278863 and did not re-start rhEPO or other ESAs until after the follow-up visit at Week 28 (except in cases where there was a compelling clinical reason [based on Investigator’s opinion] to start rhEPO therapy).</description>

          <title>Timing of Dose Adjustments at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20</title>
          <description>After 4 Weeks, the need to adjust the dose of GSK1278863 was evaluated at every scheduled visit, to maintain hemoglobin within the target range. Target range was defined as: Original Hgb Criteria of 9.0 to 10.5 g/dL, and Amended Hgb Criteria of 10.0 to 11.5 g/dL. Sites in the USA used 9.0 to 10.5 g/dL. Dose adjustments were assigned automatically via the interactive voice/web response system. The number of participants with an adjustment are presented at the timings at which adjustments were done.</description>
