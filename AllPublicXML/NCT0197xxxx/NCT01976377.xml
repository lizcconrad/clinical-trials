  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma(HNSCC) is the fourth common malignancy in Taiwan. It
      accounts for 5.8% of all cancers and causes 2,463 deaths per year. Aberrant glycosylation is
      the hallmark of most human cancers, including HNSCC, and affects many cellular properties.
      This study is aimed at exploring the role of mucin glycosylating enzymes in HNSCC.

    <textblock>
      Glycosylation is the most common post-translational modification of proteins. Aberrant
      glycosylation is the hallmark of most human cancers and affect many cellular properties,
      including cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, transformation, migration and
      immune response.

      Though widely explored in various human cancers, the role of mucin glycosylating enzymes in
      HNSCC has not been elucidated. Our aims is to analyze the expression patterns of mucin
      glycosylating enzymes in HNSCC tissues. Furthermore, we will correlate the expression levels
      of mucin glycosylating enzymes with clinical characteristics of HNSCC patients.
