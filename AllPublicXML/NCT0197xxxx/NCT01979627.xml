  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The transradial approach for coronary angiography and angioplasty is now widely used in
      catheterization laboratories worldwide, which had been shown as advantages over the
      conventional femoral and brachial approaches due to the lower incidence of bleeding and other
      cardiovascular complications. However, the transradial approach does not seem suitable for
      5-15% of patients undergoing coronary angiography and angioplasty. The ulnar artery which is
      one of the two terminal branches of the brachial artery is usually larger than radial artery
      and it may be as a potential approach for cardiac catheterization. Recently, some reports
      have demonstrated that the transulnar approach may be both feasible and safe for coronary
      angiography and angioplasty in selective patients.we performed this study to evaluate the
      safety and feasibility of transulnar approach coronary catheterization in real world
      non-selective patients.
