  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV)
      administration of FDA approved regular human insulin and subcutaneous (SC) administration of
      humalog, a rapid-acting insulin analog (a synthetic insulin), for correction of hyperglycemia
      (high blood sugar) during the immediate preoperative period in patients with diabetes having
      outpatient surgery at the Emory Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC).

      In this randomized controlled clinical trial patients with diabetes will be administered
      corrective doses of IV regular insulin or SC humalog for preoperative hyperglycemia to
      determine whether SC humalog results in improved intra and post-operative blood sugar
      control.The most common current practice at Emory University in the ambulatory surgical
      setting is IV administration of regular insulin for treatment of pre-operative hyperglycemia.
      Subjects will not be paid for their participation and will be assured of treatment for their
      hyperglycemia regardless of study participation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators plan to randomize a total of 200 male and female subjects with type 1 and type
      2 diabetes,having an out patient surgical procedure, meeting inclusion criteria to receive
      corrective doses of IV regular insulin (Group I) or SC humalog insulin (Group II). The dosing
      formula is per Emory University Outpatient Surgical Center protocol for treating
      hyperglycemia and is the same for both groups. All patients with diabetes will undergo a
      blood sugar measurement upon arrival to the ASC using the Accuchek blood glucose meter. An
      admission blood sugar of &gt;180 in a patient with diabetes qualifies the patient for study
      screening. Subjects will be approached after confirmation of eligibility for the study.
      Randomization, then treatment, will occur immediately following written informed consent.
      Demographic data will be recorded.A medical history with detailed history of diabetes will be
      obtained and surgical and anesthesia details and length of stay recorded. Blood sugar levels
      will be checked hourly until the patient is ready for discharge. Subsequent treatment will
      follow the hyperglycemia protocol. All blood sugar results and doses of insulin will be
      recorded. The subject's participation will end at the time of discharge from the Ambulatory
      Surgical Center.
