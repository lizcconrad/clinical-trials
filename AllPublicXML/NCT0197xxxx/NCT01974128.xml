  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions: 1) Is the proposed treatment
      safe? and 2) Is treatment effective in improving cardiac function and clinical outcomes?

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate in patients recovering from acute
      myocardial infarction (&lt; 8 days after the index infarction) both the safety profile of
      intramyocardial ASCs and the preliminary efficacy of ASCs therapy.

      This will be an open-label, non-randomized patient sponsored multi-center study of ASC
      implantation using a catheter delivery system. ASCs will be derived from the patient's
      adipose-derived tissue. Liposuction will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen
      for subsequent processing to isolate the stem cells. The injection catheter will be used for
      delivery of the ASCs therapy.

    <description>Autologous ASCs therapy will be considered effective for post-myocardial infarction patients if there is an improvement in:
Absolute LVEF
Changes in LVEF from baseline to 6 months
MI size
Regional wall thickness and thickening in all segments
LV-end systolic volume (LV-ESV)
LV-end diastolic volume (LV-EDV)
Change in perfusion defect after revascularization to six months as measured by:
Echocardiography
Scintigraphy</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and Females between Age 18 and 80 years.

          -  Defined acute myocardial infarction &lt;8 days from screening

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction at screening of ≤ 50%, with 2 or more contiguous
             areas of severe wall motion abnormality on resting echocardiography.

          -  Patients must have a minimum myocardial wall thickness of 5mm

          -  Need or feasibility for re-vascularization has been ruled out by coronary angiogram or
             noninvasive stress testing.

          -  Up to date on all age and gender appropriate cancer screening per American Cancer
             Society

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant or nursing or females of childbearing potential who are
             unwilling to maintain contraceptive therapy for the duration of the study

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 6 months due to concomitant illnesses.

          -  NYHA CHF Class 4

          -  Severe valvular or other non-ischemic myocardial disease.

          -  Mechanical complications of the index acute myocardial infarction including but not
             limited to rupture of the mitral valve with resultant development of mitral
             regurgitation, rupture of the left ventricular free wall and rupture of the
             interventricular septum.

          -  Active infectious disease and/or known to have tested positive for HIV, HTLV, HBV,
             HCV, CMV (IgM &gt; IgG) and/or syphilis. If the panel includes antibodies to the HBV-cAg
             and HBV-sAg, then an expert will be consulted as to patient eligibility based on the
             patient's infectious status

          -  Any illness which, in the Investigator's judgment, will interfere with the patient's
             ability to comply with the protocol, compromise patient safety, or interfere with the
             interpretation of the study results

          -  Patients on chronic immunosuppressive transplant therapy

          -  Systolic blood pressure (supine) ≤90 mmHg;

          -  Resting heart rate &gt; 100 bpm;

          -  Active clinical infection within one week of enrollment.

          -  Cerebrovascular accident within 6 months prior to study entry

          -  Known drug or alcohol dependence or any other factors which will interfere with the
             study conduct or interpretation of the results or who in the opinion of the
             investigator are not suitable to participate.

          -  History of cancer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer or in-situ cervical cancer) in
             the last five years.
