      The purpose of the study is to investigate the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of 14C
      JNJ-38518168 in healthy adult male participants after a single oral dose of 30 mg 14C
      JNJ-38518168.

      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center,
      single-arm (single group), and single-dose study. This study will include a screening period
      of 21 days prior to study medication administration. Six men will be enrolled and admitted to
      the clinical study unit on the morning of Day -1. On Day 1, participants will receive a
      single oral solution dose containing 30 mg of 14C JNJ-38518168 given as an oral solution. The
      participants will be confined to the clinical study unit for at least 360 hours after dosing
      ie, Day -1 through Day 14 and they will be discharged on Day 15; however, participants who,
      by Day 15, do not meet the discharge criteria will extend their residency in the study unit
      for up to Day 21. They will return to the study center 7 to 10 days after discharge for the
      final safety follow-up. The study will include the following safety evaluations: adverse
      event, vital sign, 12-lead electrocardiography, physical examination, and clinical laboratory
      test. For each participant the total duration in the study is approximately 6 weeks
      (including screening and safety follow-up) or 7 weeks for participants who extend the
      residence up to Day 21.
