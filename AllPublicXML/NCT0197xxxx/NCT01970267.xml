  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitreous floaters are tiny, cloudy, clumps of cells that appear in the otherwise clear fluid
      (vitreous) that fills the back 3/4 of the eye. Floaters are commonly caused by eye conditions
      such as posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), vitreous syneresis and asteroid hyalosis. While
      these symptoms are considered physiological in nature, they can be of considerable
      inconvenience to many patients which affect essential activities. The investigators wish to
      assess the safety and efficacy of floater treatment in patients with highly symptomatic
      floaters using an FDA approved nanosecond infrared yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) lasers.

    <description>Laser will direct the laser at vitreous opacities. The power of the laser will be adjusted from 0.3-12 millijoules (mJ) with the end point being laser induced optical breakdown and the production of a small gas bubble 50% of the time. The treatment will attempt to reduced or eliminate symptomatic floaters in the visual axis. Each treatment session will be limited to 300 laser applications. Participants will be retreated based on continued symptoms for up to 5 sessions</description>

    <description>Laser will be set at 0.3 millijoules (mJ). There will be a 100% absorptive filter (black spot) of about 1cm placed centrally on the lens. All laser aiming beams will be placed within the 1cm filter. Laser will be applied at 0.3 mJ at the absorptive black spot (100% density filter) in order to create a realistic treatment therapy procedure.</description>
