  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to measure how many of the dopamine receptors
      lurasidone occupies throughout the brain of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
      disorder and over what time period the occupancy occurs. This is research because lurasidone
      is an investigational medication that has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA). Dopamine receptors have key roles in many processes, including the
      control of motivation, learning, and fine motor movement. The degree of occupancy and the
      transience of occupancy D2 receptor occupancy for optimal clinical response and to prevent
      relapses is a controversial area that this study will address.

      In this study Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning will be performed with D2/D3 ligand
      18F-fallypride (a radioactive, injectable substance) to help the researchers measure the use
      of these receptors. Researchers hope that quantifying the amount of receptors being occupied
      by the medication will help them to determine the best dose of study medication in terms of
      improvement and least side effects related to body size and gender as well as in preventing
      relapse that may be related to hypersensitivity. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) will also
      be performed. MRI is a scanning method which makes pictures of parts of the brain using a
      large magnetic field. This study will use a particular kind of MRI called fMRI, or functional
      MRI. fMRI takes pictures of the brain while the person is thinking or doing a simple task.
      fMRI will allow the researchers to investigate patients regional brain activation during
      cognitive (mental) and emotional tasks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects are eligible to participate in this study if they:

          -  are 18 to 60 years of age at the day of first dosing.

          -  are diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

          -  are female, subject must be using an acceptable method of birth control or be
             surgically sterile or postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as no period for at
             least 12 months. Acceptable methods of birth control include oral, injectable or
             implanted contraceptives, and barrier methods such as condoms, diaphrams, and
             spermicides.

          -  are able to provide written informed consent.

          -  can safety have an MRI (no metal in the body, not claustrophobic).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects are not eligible to participate in this study if they:

          -  are treatment resisitant or intolerant to lurasidone.

          -  have had extensive radiation exposure (the study doctor will discuss this with the
             subject).

          -  if they have tremors or shaking of the limbs.

          -  are pregnant or trying to become pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  are colorblind.

          -  have a current or past history of a major medical illness or have abnormal lab values
             which the study doctor feels is significant (any abnormal lab values will be discussed
             with the subject).

          -  are taking certain medications. The study doctor will discuss these medicines with the
             subject.

             study.
