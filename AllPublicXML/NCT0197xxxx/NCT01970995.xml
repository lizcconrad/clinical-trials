    <textblock>
      The main goal of the study is to evaluate if the ad libitum use of the THS 2.2 Menthol (mTHS
      2.2) for 5 days in confinement and after 85 days of product use in an ambulatory setting, by
      Japanese adult healthy smokers results in a reduction in the levels of biomarkers of exposure
      for selected harmful and potentially harmful smoke constituents (HPHCs) compared to smokers
      continuing smoking their own preferred brand of menthol conventional cigarette (mCC) and
      smoking abstinence (SA). Smokers who remained abstinent from SA were used as a benchmark to
      provide context to the exposure reduction.

      <recruitment_details>Study initiated (first subject screened): 01 August 2013
At admission (Day -2), all the subjects performed a product trial of the THS 2.2 Menthol. During the baseline period, they continued smoking their single preferred brand of mCC. Then, on Day 0, they were randomized to one of the 3 study arms (mTHS 2.2, mCC or SA) in a 2:1:1 ratio.</recruitment_details>
