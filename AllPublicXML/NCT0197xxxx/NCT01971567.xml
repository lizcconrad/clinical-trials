  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of High-resolution,
      relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring (HIRREM) to usual care will improve
      insomnia symptoms based on changes in the Insomnia Severity Index at two months following
      completion of the intervention, compared to placebo plus usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is the most prevalent sleep disorder and is associated with significant psychosocial
      and somatic pathology. Effective noninvasive interventions for insomnia are lacking.
      High-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring (HIRREM), is a
      noninvasive, brain feedback technology to facilitate relaxation and auto-calibration of
      neural oscillations by using auditory tones to reflect brain frequencies in near real time.
      An open label, randomized, crossover pilot trial showed that HIRREM was safe and effective,
      with significant benefits for individuals with moderate to severe insomnia, based on
      differential change with symptoms of insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index, ISI). This study will
      extend those results in a larger cohort using a single blind, placebo controlled study
      design.

    <measure>Change in RestRefresh and SleepQual</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected from the enrollment visit through completion of the primary data collection visit, 8-10 weeks after completion of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This will be an online daily sleep diary to evaluate the amount and quality of sleep. This allows evaluation of the timing and trajectory of any improvements in sleep, including appreciation of the presence and duration of placebo effects. Participants were asked to report a self-rating on how well they felt rested and refreshed (RestRefresh) and to rate the quality of sleep they had (SleepQual). Both questions were rated on a 0 to 4 scale and higher scores denotes better outcomes for each.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Heart Rate Variability (HRV)</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected from the enrollment visit through completion of the primary data collection visit, 8-10 weeks after completion of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure and heart rate are acquired from 10 minute recordings of noninvasive finger arterial pressure measurements and ECG with participants lying quietly, supine. Systolic BP and beat to beat, RR intervals files generated via the data acquisition system (BIOPAC acquisition system and Acknowledge 4.2 software, Santa Barbara, CA), at 1000 Hz, are analyzed using Nevrokard BRS software (Nevrokard BRS, Medistar, Ljubljana, Slovenia). Analysis is conducted on the first complete 5-minute epoch that is considered to be acceptable for analysis. Heart rate variability is measured in the time domain as standard deviation of beat-to-beat interval (SDNN, milliseconds)and the root mean square of successive beat-to-beat differences in R-R interval duration (rMSSD milliseconds). For calculation of SDNN, the R-R intervals are visually inspected, and data considered as artifact is manually removed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baroflex Sensitivity (BRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8-10 weeks after completion of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure and heart rate are acquired from 10 minute recordings of noninvasive finger arterial pressure measurements and ECG with participants lying quietly, supine. Systolic BP and beat to beat, RR intervals files generated via the data acquisition system at 1000 Hz, are analyzed using Nevrokard BRS software. Analysis is conducted on the first complete 5-minute epoch. Power spectral densities of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and R-R interval (RRI) oscillations are computed by 512 points Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and integrated over specified frequency ranges (HF: 0.15-0.4 Hz). The square-root of the ratio of RRI's and SBP powers is computed to calculate HF alpha indices, which reflect BRS. The software scans the RRI and SBP records, identifies sequences, and calculates linear correlation between RRI and SBP for each sequence. The mean of all individual regression coefficients (slopes), a measure of sequence BRS, is then calculated for Sequence UP, DOWN and TOTAL (seq ALL).</description>

        <title>Change in Heart Rate Variability (HRV)</title>
        <description>Blood pressure and heart rate are acquired from 10 minute recordings of noninvasive finger arterial pressure measurements and ECG with participants lying quietly, supine. Systolic BP and beat to beat, RR intervals files generated via the data acquisition system (BIOPAC acquisition system and Acknowledge 4.2 software, Santa Barbara, CA), at 1000 Hz, are analyzed using Nevrokard BRS software (Nevrokard BRS, Medistar, Ljubljana, Slovenia). Analysis is conducted on the first complete 5-minute epoch that is considered to be acceptable for analysis. Heart rate variability is measured in the time domain as standard deviation of beat-to-beat interval (SDNN, milliseconds)and the root mean square of successive beat-to-beat differences in R-R interval duration (rMSSD milliseconds). For calculation of SDNN, the R-R intervals are visually inspected, and data considered as artifact is manually removed.</description>

Systolic BP and beat to beat, RR intervals files generated via the data acquisition system at 1000 Hz, are analyzed using Nevrokard BRS software. Analysis is conducted on the first complete 5-minute epoch. Power spectral densities of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and R-R interval (RRI) oscillations are computed by 512 points Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and integrated over specified frequency ranges (HF: 0.15-0.4 Hz). The square-root of the ratio of RRI’s and SBP powers is computed to calculate HF alpha indices, which reflect BRS. The software scans the RRI and SBP records, identifies sequences, and calculates linear correlation between RRI and SBP for each sequence. The mean of all individual regression coefficients (slopes), a measure of sequence BRS, is then calculated for Sequence UP, DOWN and TOTAL (seq ALL).</description>
