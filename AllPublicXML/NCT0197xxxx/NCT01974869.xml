      Background: The immunologic response to stress is regulated by the cytokines. Anti-Tumor
      Necrosis Factor-α agents are antibodies directed against a key cytokine in the process
      angiogenesis and collagen synthesis. It is not known whether they intervene with surgical
      stress response increasing the rate of postoperative complications.

      Method: Un-blinded prospective, non-interventional cohort single centre study including all
      the patients with Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis undergoing abdominal surgery.
      Immunological and endocrinological parameters will measured in blood samples taken from these
      patients before and after surgery. Power calculations showed that 17 patients in each arm are
      needed.

      The baseline patient characteristics will be evaluated based on pilot tested data extraction
      sheets. The assessment will include demographics, clinical data as well as laboratory work
      up. The Charlson morbidity index, will be used to assess co-morbidity, the Nutritional risk
      score (NRS) to assess nutrition status and the Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI) to evaluate the
      activity of Crohn's disease. The duration of surgical procedure, along with the amount of
      blood transfused, will be recorded in all patients.

      Laboratory variables

      The following variables will be assessed based on previous evidence about their role in
      surgical stress response:

        1. Immunological parameters: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1, interleukin-6,
           interleukin-10, C reactive protein, and white blood cell counts.

        2. Endocrinological parameters: plasma cortisol, growth hormone , adrenocorticotropic
           hormone, epinephrin and norepinephrine
