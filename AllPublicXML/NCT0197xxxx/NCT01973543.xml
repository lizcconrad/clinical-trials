      Safety study of AADC gene transfer (VY-AADC01) in subjects with Parkinson's disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder involving loss of neurons that release
      dopamine in the striatum. To compensate for the loss of dopamine, patients are typically
      prescribed levodopa medication which is converted to dopamine by the enzyme Aromatic L-Amino
      Acid Decarboxylase (AADC). As Parkinson's disease progresses, levodopa therapy becomes less
      effective and is associated with motor fluctuations, involuntary movements and other
      complications.

      This study will primarily investigate the safety of increasing AADC levels in the striatum
      via AADC gene delivery. The hAADC gene is packaged into a gene transfer vector derived from a
      common, non-pathogenic virus (AAV2) to which &gt;90% of humans have been exposed. This
      investigational drug, termed VY-AADC01, will be injected directly into the striatum during a
      neurosurgical procedure that is performed with real-time MRI imaging to monitor delivery.

      Subjects will continue to take Parkinson's disease medications, including levodopa.

      The safety and potential clinical responses to VY-AADC01 will be assessed by repeated
      clinical evaluations of Parkinson's disease, cognitive tests, laboratory blood tests and
      neuroimaging. Clinical evaluations will be performed over a 3 year follow-up period. A test
      to specifically assess the clinical response to levodopa will be performed once before AADC
      gene delivery and approximately 6 months after.
