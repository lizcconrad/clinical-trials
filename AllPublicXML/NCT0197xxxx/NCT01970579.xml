      The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the paclitaxelreleasing balloon
      catheter SeQuent® Please P to treat de novo and restenotic lesions in the superficial femoral
      artery and the proximal two segments of the popliteal artery with reference diameters ≥ 4mm &amp;
      ≤ 7mm and lesion lengths ≥ 4 cm &amp; ≤ 27 cm. It is the intention of this trial to treat
      suitable target lesions with DCB only.

    <description>Treatment of target lesion with study balloon (coated). Diameter of treatment balloon = RVD
Each study balloon must only be used once (except postdilatation is necessary which may be done with the same balloon used for the initial dilatation)
Treatment balloon must be 20 mm longer than lesion length (to assure balloon overlap of 10 mm proximal and distal to lesion)
If two treatment balloons are necessary overlap between the balloon must be 10 mm
Inflation pressure 7-10 atm
Intraluminal defects or haziness should be treated with additional inflations and/or aggressive anti-platelet agents or bailout stenting</description>

          -  Patients must agree to undergo the 1 and 2 year clinical follow-up

          -  Patient is able to verbally acknowledge an understanding of the associated risks,
             benefits, and treatment alternatives to therapeutic options of this trial. The
             patients, by providing their informed consent, agree to these risks and benefits as
             stated in the patient informed consent document.

          -  Peripheral lesions in the native SFA or popliteal artery with reference vessel
