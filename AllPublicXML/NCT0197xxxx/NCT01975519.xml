    <textblock>
      The purpose of the phase 1b portion is to evaluate safety and tolerability and determine a
      recommended phase 2 dose for TRC105 when added to standard dose pazopanib in patients with
      advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Up to 18 patients will be treated.

      The purpose of the phase 2 portion is to estimate the PFS of patients with advanced soft
      tissue sarcoma by RECIST 1.1 and estimate ORR in a separate cohort of patients with
      angiosarcoma by RECIST 1.1. Up to 76 patients will be treated in phase 2, including a cohort
      of up to 13 patients with angiosarcoma.

    <textblock>
      Pazopanib is an oral inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 at therapeutic plasma
      concentrations. These receptors are implicated in pathologic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and
      cancer progression. Pazopanib is approved for the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma,
      following progression on one prior systemic therapy, based on improved progression free
      survival. TRC105 is an antibody to CD105, an important angiogenic target on vascular
      endothelial cells that is distinct from VEGFR. TRC105 inhibits angiogenesis, tumor growth and
      metastases in preclinical models and complements the activity of bevacizumab and multi-kinase
      inhibitors that target the VEGFR. In a phase 1 study of advanced solid tumors, TRC105 therapy
      caused a global reduction in angiogenic biomarkers and reduced tumor burden at doses that
      were well-tolerated. In a phase 1b study, the combination of TRC105 and bevacizumab produced
      radiographic reductions in tumor volume in bevacizumab-refractory patients, and was well
      tolerated. TRC105 potentiates bevacizumab and VEGFR tyrosine kinases (VEGFR TKI) in
      preclinical models. By targeting a non-VEGF pathway that is upregulated following VEGF
      inhibition, TRC105 has the potential to complement VEGFR TKIs and could represent a major
      advance in cancer therapy. Together, the use of TRC105 with pazopanib may result in more
      effective angiogenesis inhibition and improved clinical efficacy over that seen with
      pazopanib alone.
