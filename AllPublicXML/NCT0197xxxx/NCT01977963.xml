    <textblock>
      Thionamides, the antithyroid drugs, have been widely used to treat hyperthyroidism1. Side
      effects are found in 1% - 5% of the patients1. One of the most serious side effect is
      agranulocytosis, which occurs in 0.1% - 0.3 % of the patients1. This might lead to severe
      infection and sometimes mortality. The underlying mechanism is unclear. An immune phenomenon
      may be involved because the antigranulocyte antibodies or lymphocyte sensitized to
      antithyroid drugs are found in these patients6,7. The recognition of major histocompatibility
      complex class II peptide complexes by T lymphocytes is central to the development of immune
      response. According to a report in 1996, the HLA DRB1*08032 allele is strongly associated
      with susceptibility to methimazole-induced agranulocytosis20.

      Recently, there are new techniques for genetics study. We aimed to identify the associated
      genetic change of the agranulocytosis side effect of antithyroid drugs. First, we will look
      at the classical human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) loci, such as HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, -DQ and -DP.
      If no significant change is found in the above genes, we will consider whole exon sequencing
      with next-generation sequencing, Statistic analysis will include appropriate linkage
      analysis, association study, variation data analysis, pathway analysis. If we can identify
      the genetic change and perform genetic examinations before prescription, we can avoid the
      happening of severe side effects.
