      The MAGNetic QRS-Fragmentation in Patients with Myocardial InfarcTion and Moderately RedUceD
      Ejection Fraction (MAGNITUDE) study will assess in MI survivors with moderately reduced left
      ventricular function, whether non-invasive MFI QRS Fragmentation alone or in combination with
      parameters derived from a Holter recording can be used to identify a group of patients at
      high risk for SCD/life threatening ventricular arrhythmia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac disease is the most common cause of natural death in the Western hemisphere. Half of
      cardiac deaths are sudden, arrhythmic. Myocardial infarction (MI) survivors have a four to
      five-fold higher risk of SCD compared to persons without a history of MI. Current risk
      assessment approaches fail to identify the majority of patients at risk of sudden, arrhythmic
      death. Given these facts, this patient population represents a relevant proportion of the
      total population at risk of developing sudden death and is currently not indicated for
      preventive therapy. The post-MI population with moderate LV function, specifically with a
      Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) between 35% and 50%, is therefore an appropriate
      group in which to assess SCD prevention strategies. It has been shown that an increased QRS
      fragmentation assessed by Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) correlates with a higher incidence of
      arrhythmic deaths. MAGNITUDE is a prospective, multicenter, non-interventional, observational
      cohort study, which will provide detailed information about event rates and MFI threshold for
      the prediction of SCD/life threatening cardiac arrhythmic events. Target enrollment is 1000
      patients, but enrollment may be extended until minimally 24 events are accrued (with a
      maximum of 1500 patients). All patients will be followed until at least 12 months after
      enrollment closure, but follow-up duration may be extended until minimally 40 events are
      accrued. Interim analysis will be performed after 10, 20 and 30 events, and also after 40
      events if this milestone is reached 6 months or more before end of follow-up. Final analysis
      will be done at end of follow-up.
