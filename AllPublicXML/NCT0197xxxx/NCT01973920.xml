  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease of carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism
      caused by an absolute or relative deficiency of insulin, an anabolic hormone. The current
      methods of insulin therapy for diabetic patients are multiple daily injection therapy and
      continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with an external pump. This rout of administration
      may lead to hyperinsulinemia as insulin is administered in a non physiological way, targeting
      mainly extra hepatic tissues (muscle, fat). A method of providing insulin without the need
      for injections has been a goal in drug delivery.

      Oshadi Drug Administration Ltd. has developed oral carrier for proteins based on biochemistry
      and quantum theory of biochemical reactions. The carrier enables the absorption of proteins
      from the gastrointestinal tract in their full structure. Oshadi has also developed the Oshadi
      Icp - insulin, proinsulin and C-peptide in Oshadi carrier, administrated orally. This study
      was design in order to evaluate the safety and feasibility of multiple administrations of
      Oshadi Icp for home use. The study will be a multiple-dose, open-label non-randomized study
      in patients with Type 1 diabetes, with periodic dose adjustments. The study will include 4
      weeks of multiple-dose administration of Oshadi oral insulin (Oshadi Icp) at home and in
      study center for the determination of the efficacy, safety and pharmacodynamic effects of
      Oshadi Icp.
