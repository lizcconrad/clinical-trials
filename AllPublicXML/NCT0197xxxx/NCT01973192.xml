  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that early viral infections alter the
      bacterial flora and inflammatory profile in the airway and accelerate progression of
      pulmonary disease in infants with cystic fibrosis.

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed study is a unique international collaboration between three large CF research
      centers. This proposal will determine the impact of early respiratory viral infections on
      bacterial flora and inflammatory profiles in the CF airway as well as the impact of these
      pathogens on clinical, physiologic and structural markers of disease.The proposed study is
      designed to follow infants diagnosed with CF through newborn screening to determine the
      effect of viral infections on the lower airway microbiome, clinical symptoms, pulmonary
      function and structural changes during the first year of life. The proposed study will
      measure lower airway inflammation and infection using BAL, oral swabs, and nasal swabs;
      outcomes will be assessed through infant lung function testing, computerized tomography scans
      of the chest, and pulmonary exacerbation rate.

             respiratory rate with onset 14 days before iPFT-bronchoscopy visit.

          2. Measured hemoglobin oxygen saturation less than 95% during the iPFT-bronchoscopy
             visit.
