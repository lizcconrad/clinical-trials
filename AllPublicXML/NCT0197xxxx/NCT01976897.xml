  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between the angle of knee
      flexion in a supine position with joint relaxation (DDPD) and the maximum interface pressure
      at the heel area (PtAl).

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      A. To evaluate the relationship between the angle of flexion of the knee in DDPD and the
      average pressure throughout the heel area (Pmean).

      B. To evaluate the relationship between the angle of flexion of the knee in DDPD and the
      contact surface of the heel area (Stal) where the pressure is greater than 60 mm Hg.

      C. To evaluate the inter-operator concordance for the knee flexion angle measurement in DDPD
      via photos.

      D. To evaluate the inter-operator concordance for skin marks used to measure knee flexion
      angles in DDPD via photos (only one knee for 30 patients).

      E. To evaluate the inta-operator concordance (measures on 2 consecutive days) for skin marks
      used to measure knee flexion angles in DDPD via photos (for 30 patients).

    <description>The pressure analysis system used is the X Sensor X3 model (Xsensor Technology Corporation, Calgary, Canada). The sensor mat is made up of transducer cells, each measuring 1.6 cm^2. The digital signal is transmitted to a PC via a USB port at a sampling frequency of 10Hz. Before each measurement, the sensor mat is calibrated from 10 to 220 mm Hg, according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
The sheet of pressure sensors is disposed on the dedicated bed. The patient is then asked to take his/her usual position in the supine position and a latency of 5 minutes is observed. The recording time pressure is then performed for 90 seconds in the optical observing time to adapt to changes in media.</description>
