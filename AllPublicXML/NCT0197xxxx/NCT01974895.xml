        <title>Number of Seroconverted Subjects for Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Antibodies Against Each of the Four Vaccine Influenza Strains of FluLaval® Quadrivalent Vaccine.</title>
        <description>A seroconverted subject was defined as a vaccinated subject with either a pre-vaccination titer less than (&lt;) 1:10 and a post-vaccination titer greater than or equal to (≥) 1:40, or a pre-vaccination titer ≥ 1:10 and at least a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination titer.
The vaccine strains assessed were Flu A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), Flu A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2), Flu B/Massachusetts/2/2012 (Yamagata), Flu B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria). This outcome concerns solely subjects in the FluLaval Quadrivalent Group.
Vaccine primed subjects are subjects who had received a total of 2 or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine since 01 July 2010.
Vaccine unprimed subjects are subjects who had never received any seasonal influenza vaccine or had received only one dose of seasonal influenza vaccine since 01 July 2010.</description>
        <time_frame>28 days after the last vaccine dose (at Day 28 for primed subjects and at Day 56 for unprimed subjects)</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was performed on the According-to-Protocol (ATP) cohort for immunogenicity which included all evaluable subjects for whom data concerning immunogenicity outcome measures were available and subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component after vaccination.</population>

          <title>Number of Seroconverted Subjects for HI Antibodies Against Each of the Four Vaccine Influenza Strains.</title>
          <description>A seroconverted subject was defined as a vaccinated subject with either a pre-vaccination titer less than (&lt;) 1:10 and a post-vaccination titer greater than or equal to (≥) 1:40, or a pre-vaccination titer ≥ 1:10 and at least a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination titer.
The vaccine strains assessed were Flu A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), Flu A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2), Flu B/Massachusetts/2/2012 (Yamagata), Flu B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria). This outcome concerns solely subjects in the Fluzone Group.
Vaccine primed subjects are subjects who had received a total of 2 or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine since 01 July 2010.
Vaccine unprimed subjects are subjects who had never received any seasonal influenza vaccine or had received only one dose of seasonal influenza vaccine since 01 July 2010.</description>
          <population>Analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity which included all evaluable subjects for whom data concerning immunogenicity outcome measures were available and subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component after vaccination.</population>

        <title>Mean Geometric Increase (MGI) for HI Antibody Titer Against Each of the Four Vaccine Influenza Strains.</title>
        <description>MGI was defined as the fold increase in serum haemagglutination inhibition (HI) GMTs post-vaccination compared to pre-vaccination (Day 0). The vaccine strains assessed were Flu A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), Flu A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2), Flu B/Massachusetts/2/2012 (Yamagata), Flu B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria).
Vaccine primed subjects are subjects who had received a total of 2 or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine since 01 July 2010.
Vaccine unprimed subjects are subjects who had never received any seasonal influenza vaccine or had received only one dose of seasonal influenza vaccine since 01 July 2010.</description>

        <population>Analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity which included all evaluable subjects for whom data concerning immunogenicity outcome measures were available and subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component after vaccination.</population>

        <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed were drowsiness, irritability/fussiness and loss of appetite. Any was defined as any solicited general symptom reported irrespective of intensity and relationship to vaccination. Related was defined as symptoms assessed by the investigator to have a causal relationship to vaccination. Grade 3 irritability/fussiness was defined as crying that could not be comforted/prevented normal activity. Grade 3 loss of appetite was defined as not eating at all. Grade 3 drowsiness was defined as drowsiness that prevented normal activity.Grade 3 fever was defined as axillary temperature above 39.0°C.
Vaccine primed subjects are subjects who had received a total of 2 or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine since 01 July 2010.

        <description>Any fever was defined as any fever ≥38.0 degrees Celsius (°C) irrespective of intensity and relationship to vaccination. Related was defined as symptoms assessed by the investigator to have a causal relationship to vaccination. Grade 3 fever was defined as fever ≥39.0 °C.
Vaccine primed subjects are subjects who had received a total of 2 or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine since 01 July 2010.
Vaccine unprimed subjects are subjects who had never received any seasonal influenza vaccine or had received only one dose of seasonal influenza vaccine since 01 July 2010.</description>

Vaccine primed subjects are subjects who had received a total of 2 or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine since 01 July 2010.
