  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To improve rectal cancer management, there is a need for better visualization of drug targets
      in rectal cancer to identify patients who might benefit from specific targeted treatments.
      Molecular imaging of rectal cancer associated targets is a promising technique to accommodate
      this need. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which is differentially expressed in
      normal versus malignant colon tissue, has proven to be a valid target for molecular imaging.
      Fluorescent labeling of bevacizumab (a VEGF targeting humanized monoclonal antibody currently
      used in anti-cancer therapy) using IRDye800CW (a fluorescent dye) has potential advantages in
      view of safety, infrastructure, costs, stability and imaging resolution. Therefore, the
      fluorescent tracer bevacizumab-IRDye800CW has been developed at the University Medical Center
      Groningen (UMCG) and was recently approved to be administered to patients in a tracer dose.
      To detect this tracer in vivo in patients with colorectal cancer, a newly developed flexible
      near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence endoscope and optoacoustic endoscope have been developed
      which can be used in clinical studies. Optical fluorescence imaging may support response
      evaluation following chemoradiotherapy and give insight which patient might benefit from
      anti-VEGF targeted therapy in future studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this non-randomized, non-blinded, prospective, single center feasibility study, patients
      with locally advanced rectal cancer who are included in the RAPIDO study (NL36315.042.11)
      will undergo two times epi-illumination endoscopy (in other words flexible NIR fluorescence
      endoscopy).

      The study consists of a total of five study procedure related visits:

        -  Visit 1: During a screening visit, eligibility will be evaluated and patient
           characteristics will be collected.

        -  Visit 2: During the second visit 4.5 mg of bevacizumab-IRDye800CW will be administered
           intravenously. The patient will then be observed for 1 hour post administration.

        -  Visit 3: First endoscopy will be performed at baseline (two days after tracer
           administration); before the start of chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Visit 4: After chemoradiotherapy patients will receive a second dose of 4.5 mg of
           bevacizumab-IRDye800CW (second tracer administration)

        -  Visit 5: A second flexible NIR fluorescence endoscopy procedure will be performed
           (two-three days after the second tracer injection), preferably right before surgery.

      Optionally and when available, we will ask patients if they would like to undergo
      optoacoustic endoscopy. This is a form of endoscopic ultrasound which is able to detect
      bevacizumab-IRDye800CW up to 2 cm in depth. The procedure is comparable with NIR fluorescence
      endoscopy. If patients agree, after removal of the NIR fluorescence endoscope the
      optoacoustic endoscope will be introduced in the rectum of the patient for detection of
      bevacizumab-IRDye800CW in deeper areas of the tumor.

Research aim to assess primary objectives by evaluation of biopsy specimen:
To assess accumulation of bevacizumab-IRDye800CW in rectal cancer tissue and surrounding tissue at baseline and following radiochemotherapy of patients included in the RAPIDO trial.
Evaluation of tumor areas with high fluorescence and low fluorescence signal.
