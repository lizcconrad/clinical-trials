  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to use music and movement (MWM) to reduce anxiety and behavioral symptoms
      of people with early dementia (PWD) and their family carers in the community. It also aims to
      examine whether MWM can enhance the sleep quality of PWD and their family caregivers and
      promote their well-being.

      This is a mixed methods study with the quantitative paradigm being the main research
      approached used. The quantitative arm will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The
      qualitative arm will adopt a naturalistic approach through interviewing for data collection.
      Recruited subjects from the community centres of non-government organizations (NGOs) will be
      randomly allocated to the intervention and control group.

      The outcome measures of the PWD will include Rating Anxiety in Dementia (RAID), Geriatric
      Depression Scale (GDS), Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Index (PQSI), Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD), Mini-Mental State
      Examination (MMSE), Revised Life Event Scale (RLES), Modified Brathel Index (MBI) and
      Non-pharmacological Therapy Experience Scale (NPTES), whereas the outcome measures of the
      family caregivers will be Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety
      Disorder 7 (GAD-7), Zarit Burden Scale (ZBD), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Reverse
      Life event Scale (RLES), and World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF).

      To address the research questions, data will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately
      post-intervention at 8-weeks (T1), and 8 post-intervention (T2). The qualitative arm of this
      study will contribute to the understanding of issues and effects of MWM as an intervention.
      Its finding will complement the results obtained from the RCT.
