    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot research project is to look at the effect of the inactivated
      influenza vaccine (seasonal flu shot) on early signs of immune or germ-fighting response
      known as cytokines or signal molecules. The investigators also want to see if the timing of
      vaccine administration has any effect on women's reproductive hormones. The investigators
      hypothesis is that influenza vaccine given right before ovulation may change the hormone
      levels usually seen after ovulation. Thi

      This study is an open-label, longitudinal study of healthy young women of reproductive age,
      not on hormonal contraception who receive seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). The
      women will be followed for one menstrual cycle to measure luteinizing hormone surge,
      estradiol, and progesterone, and then vaccinated with the seasonal inactivated influenza
      vaccine prior to ovulation during a second month. At the investigator's discretion, or if
      there is active circulation of influenza virus in Baltimore, the investigators will vaccinate
      during the first menstrual cycle (prior to ovulation) and then follow for a second menstrual
      cycle for comparison. After vaccination, they will be followed for cytokine and chemokine
      responses as well as changes in the concentrations of steroid hormones. This study will
      evaluate the effect of IIV on inflammatory cytokines and hormonal responses before and after
      ovulation. Each woman will have 13 visits in addition to a screening visit, and will be
      followed for 2 complete menstrual cycles.
