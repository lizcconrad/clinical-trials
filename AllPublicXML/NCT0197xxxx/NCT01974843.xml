  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caudal block is the regional anesthetic technique that is used most frequently in pediatric
      surgery. Opioid drugs have been added to local anesthetic solutions to prolong duration of
      analgesia but ideal combination were not found that has minimal adverse effect. The aim of
      this study was to compare the postoperative analgesic efficacy of equal concentrations of
      bupivacaine plus tramadol or levobupivacaine plus tramadol in pediatric patients undergoing
      minor urological surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty-eight children aged 2 to 7 years who were undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy or
      orchidopexy received bupivacaine 0.25% plus tramadol 2 mg/kg (BT group) or levobupivacaine
      0.25% plus tramadol 2 mg/kg (LT group) by the caudal route after laryngeal mask anesthesia.
      The primary outcome of the study was to compare the duration and quality of postoperative
      analgesia. The postoperative pain relief was evaluated by the Children and Infants
      Postoperative Pain Scale (CHIPPS) at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h postoperatively. In addition, the
      time of first analgesic requirement was noted.
