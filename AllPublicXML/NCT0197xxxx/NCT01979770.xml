  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the relationship of the various exposures during infancy and
      childhood on later health and development of adolescents. Various exposures to be assessed
      include, but not limit to, nutritional status, body composition, energy expenditure, dietary
      intake, micronutrient status, breastfeeding, lifestyle, and other environment exposures.

      The study will specifically aim to respond these research questions:

      1.1 What are the factors associated with overweight, obesity, and stunted in adolescents? 1.2
      What are the factors associated with increased risk of NCDs during adolescence? 1.3 What are
      the factors associated with cognitive functioning during adolescence? Since numerous
      variables were collected, additional research questions can be possibly studied or other
      interested variables can be included in the future.

      A longitudinal data were collected in children in the northeast of Thailand beginning at 4-6
      months of age and every 2 months through 10-12 months of age while children had been given
      iron and/or zinc supplementation. Biochemical, anthropometric, socio-demographic, feeding
      practices, and maternal characteristics data were collected. Children were followed up at 9
      years of age to assess the long-term consequences of supplementation and early life nutrition
      on cognitive functioning and growth. There is a need to continue the follow-up of this study
      in order to address the association between early nutritional exposures and risks of
      cardio-metabolic dysfunction and cognitive and behavioral development later in childhood,
      adolescence and adulthood. Thus, we propose to follow-up these children during adolescence to
      assess the relationship of early life nutrition and exposures during infancy and childhood
      and outcomes including nutritional status, cognitive functioning, and risk for
      non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Findings from this study could provide awareness and
      information in developing policies and timely interventions to maintain optimal nutritional
      status throughout vulnerable life stages and reduce risks of NCDs and disabilities later in
      life.
