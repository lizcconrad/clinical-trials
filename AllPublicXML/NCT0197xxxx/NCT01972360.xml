  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SPECT is currently the dominant clinical test for diagnostic and prognostic purposes as well
      as therapeutic decision-making. Given the shortage of nuclear reactor-produced Tc, advancing
      the use of non-isotope based imaging modalities has the potential to change the standard of
      care for patients with CAD as each one of these technics (CMR, CT, Stress echocardiography)
      has its own distinct potential advantages over SPECT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obtain a better understanding of the clinical utility of advanced non-isotope-based imaging
      modalities to detect relevant CAD as potential alternatives to SPECT. Approximately 450
      subjects will be enrolled in total. Three groups of about 150 patients per group. Each group
      will undergo imaging with 2 modalities; Group 1: 99mTcSPECT plus CMR, Group 2: 99mTcSPECT
      plus CT, Group 3:99mTcSPECT plus stress echocardiography. All 450 patients will undergo
      standard invasive coronary angiography following completion of non-invasive imaging, except
      for patients in whom both nuclear and non-nuclear imaging modalities reveal a normal result
      confirming the absence of significant coronary artery disease (i.e invasive angiography would
      not be clinically indicated and FFR would be considered to be above 0.8). Thrombolysis in
      Myocardial Infraction (TIMI) flow will be measured in all patients undergoing angiography,
      and fractional flow reserve (FFR) will be measured in all patients except those with TIMI
      flow =0, 1 and 2. All imaging procedures must be completed within 6 weeks. All patients will
      have a follow-up visit at 6 months after enrollment. During the 6 month follow-up visit major
      adverse cardiovascular events will be collected and adjudicated by a clinical endpoint
      committee (CEC).
