  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational safety follow-up study enrolled subjects from the 802-247-09-032 study
      with the investigational product HP802-247 for venous leg ulcers, who received at least one
      application of HP802-247 or Vehicle (Placebo). This study is being done for the following
      purposes:

        1. to identify new adverse events,

        2. to examine ongoing adverse events not resolved in subjects who participated in the
           802-247-09-032 trial,

        3. to record wound status, and

        4. to determine if there are differences in Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)
           associated with the treatment assignment from the 802-247-09-032 Trial.

      About 440 subjects were to participate depending upon subject enrollment from the previous
      study, 802-247-09-032. The study was conducted in approximately 50 sites in Europe.

    <textblock>
      Subjects transitioned to this observational study immediately upon exit from the
      802-247-09-032 trial. This ensured a total of 12 months of safety observations and wound
      status data were obtained from the time of the first application of HP802-247. This study
      provided consecutive visits at intervals of 8 weeks until a total of 12 months of safety
      follow-up had been achieved, based on the initial application of Investigational Medicinal
      Product in the prior study. Specifically, this study examines all new and unresolved ongoing
      adverse events.

      The treatment assignment codes and randomization schedule for the prior trial will be
      maintained for this observational study. The treatment assignments will not be made known to
      the Investigators until the present follow-up study has been completed by all consenting
      subjects thus keeping treating physician and subjects blind to treatment.
