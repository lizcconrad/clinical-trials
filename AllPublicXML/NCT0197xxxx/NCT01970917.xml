  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a common ocular disease, especially in the elderly population.
      Despite many treatment approaches, instillation of topical lubricants remains the mainstay of
      therapy. However, most of the topical lubricants available are not very well characterized
      and data about efficacy is sparse.

      The aim of the present project is to investigate the effect of topically administered Olixia
      pure速 eye drops on tear film thickness in healthy subjects.

      Tear film thickness will be determined using ultra high-resolution optical coherence
      tomography (OCT). Measurements will be performed before instillation of the eye drops and
      every 10 minutes after instillation for one hour. One eye will receive Olixia pure速 eye
      drops, the fellow eye will receive physiologic saline solution as placebo control. The study
      eye will be chosen randomly.
