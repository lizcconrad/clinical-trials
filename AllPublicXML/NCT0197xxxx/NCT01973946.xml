      The purpose of this prospective trial is to test a daily telephone based automated symptom
      monitoring and response system to track and further treat unrelieved symptoms for patients
      living at home during chemotherapy treatment as compared with usual care which consists of
      patients calling their oncology provider for symptom concerns.

      The purpose of this prospective trial is to test a daily telephone based automated symptom
      monitoring and response system to track and further treat unrelieved symptoms for patients
      living at home during chemotherapy treatment as compared with usual care which consists of
      patients calling their oncology provider for symptom concerns. For the intervention group,
      the monitoring system is paired with automated delivery of self-care suggestions tailored to
      the specific symptom profile the patient reported and also automatically 'alerts' the study
      oncology nurse practitioner about unrelieved symptoms. The nurse practitioner, utilizing
      national evidence based symptom guidelines for symptoms at moderate to severe levels calls
      the patient and further assesses and intensifies symptom treatment. The usual care group
      called the system daily and reported similar data but did not receive self-care coaching or
      notification of unrelieved symptoms to the study nurse practitioner. On every call, the usual
      care group was told to follow the standard procedure of calling their oncology providers for
      symptom concerns. The specific aims of the study are to test whether the symptom monitoring
      intervention reduces presence, severity and distress of 11 symptoms. The symptoms monitored
      in the project were nausea/vomiting, pain, sore mouth, numbness &amp; tingling, diarrhea, trouble
      thinking, trouble sleeping, changes in appearance, depressed mood, anxiety, and fatigue.
      Secondary outcomes tested whether the intervention improved functional performance and
      decreased interference with activity when compared with the usual care attentional control
      group. Other aims compare self care strategies utilized and their perceived effectiveness and
      document patient satisfaction with the monitoring system.

    <description>Each week patients reported during their daily phone calls whether or not they had been in contact with a health care provider, were seen in an emergency department or urgent care facility, or had an unscheduled hospitalization. If they reported they did have a medical encounter, the research staff would call and conduct a short telephone interview to collect data about the nature of the medical encounter including whether the medical encounter was related to the symptoms being monitored.</description>

    <description>An End of Study Telephone Interview was conducted at the end of a patient's participation in the project to obtain data on patient satisfaction with the symptom monitoring system and to obtain suggestions for improvement of the system.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of automated and other self care strategies used and their effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly for an entire new course of chemotherapy or 6 months whichever occurred first.</time_frame>
    <description>The symptom monitoring system tracked when an intervention participant heard a self care strategy during the course of the week. Each week patients would report on how helpful (1-10 scale) the automated self care measures were for the specific symptoms.</description>

    <description>Patients in the usual care group called the automated monitoring system daily to report presence, severity, and distress for 11 common symptoms. The attentional control group received equivalent contact time with the automated system including identical voice and assessment questions. Patients did not hear self-care messages during the call and the data were not available for clinical action by the study nurse practitioner. Patients were told on every phone call to call their oncology providers if they had concerns about their symptoms which is usual care for symptom follow up in oncology.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Symptom Alert and Coaching</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in the Symptom Alert and Coaching arm called the automated monitoring system daily to report presence, severity, and distress on 11 symptoms. The system provided automated self care coaching based on the symptoms reported and automatically generated alerts to the study NP if symptoms exceeded preset thresholds. Two thresholds were set: a simple alert when severity or distress was 4 or greater on a 10 point scale and trend alerts based on a pattern of moderate severity over several days.
The alerts went into a case management site. The study NP logged into the system daily and responded to the alerts within 24 hours by calling patients to further assess the symptoms and to intensify symptom treatment using evidence based guidelines.</description>
