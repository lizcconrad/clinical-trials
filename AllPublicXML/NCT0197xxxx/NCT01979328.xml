      The primary objective of this study is to examine the flow characteristics of deep venous
      flow in the leg veins using Doppler ultrasound imaging and how this flow is modified by the
      application of a plaster and with a geko™ device in healthy volunteers

             (30) days preceding the study, and agrees not to use any medications during the course
             of the study without informing the Research Team.

         14. A pulse rate of less than 50 beats/minute, a sitting systolic blood pressure &gt;160 or
             &lt;80 mmHg and/or a sitting diastolic pressure of &gt;90 or &lt;60 mmHg.

         15. Any significant illness during the four (4) weeks preceding the screening period of
             the study.

         16. Any contraindication to blood sampling.

         17. Donation of blood during the eight (8) weeks preceding the screening period of the
