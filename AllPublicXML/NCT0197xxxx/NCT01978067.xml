    <description>Expose, grasp and traction the cervix. An incision was made at the anterior cervicovaginal junction, and the bladder was dissected away until the anterior peritoneal reflection was identified. The anterior drawing hook was inserted.into the vaginal incision to retract the bladder upwards. The PCSD was identified as a'fornix' located in the anterior part of the lower uterine segment. A transverse incision was made to remove the scar deficiency, and the edges of the incision were trimmed with scissors, and the myometrial and vaginal defects were closed.</description>
