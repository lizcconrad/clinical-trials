    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The probability of the first event being a CNS progression, a non-CNS progression, or death was evaluated with a competing risk approach by estimating cumulative incidence functions (range: 0-1) relative to the analysis set. The time to first event being a Competing Event (either &quot;CNS progression&quot; or &quot;non CNS progression&quot; or &quot;Death&quot;) was defined as time from first dose until the date of that specific event. Participants not known to have any of the Competing Events were censored on the date they were last assessed for disease status for PFS. Participants who presented one type of event were counted as a competing cause of failure for the analysis of other type of events. For each type of event, the cumulative incidence function corresponding to the nearest time point preceding 1 year is presented. The results are based on independent central review.</description>

    <description>European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionaires (EORTC QLQ)-C30 (version 3.0) consists of 30 questions assessing 5 functional domains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), global quality of life (QoL), disease/treatment related symptoms (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation and diarrhoea), and the perceived financial impact of disease. Each scale was transformed to a range of 0 to 100 using standard EORTC algorithm. For global QoL and functional scales, higher score indicate better performance, and improvement was defined as an increase of at least 10 points, worsening was defined as a decrease of at least 10 points. For symptom scales, higher score indicates worse symptoms, and improvement was defined as a decrease of at least 10 points, worsening was defined as an increase of at least 10 points. All scales which had not improved nor worsened were considered stable.</description>

    <description>EORTC QLQ-LC13 is the lung cancer module of EORTC QLQ-C30 and includes questions specific to the disease associated symptoms (dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and site specific pain), treatment-related symptoms (sore mouth, dysphagia, neuropathy and alopecia), and analgesic use of lung cancer patients. The scale was transformed to a range of 0 to 100 using standard EORTC algorithm. Higher score indicates worse symptoms, and improvement was defined as a decrease of at least 10 points, worsening was defined as an increase of at least 10 points. All scales which had not improved nor worsened were considered stable.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 of each cycle, and end of treatment (up to 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>In Phase 1, the MMSE was collected to assess mental status. The MMSE is a 30 item questionnaire that tests 5 areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall and language. The maximum score is 30. A score of 23 or lower is indicative of cognitive impairment. The MMSE was removed under Amendment 6 of the study protocol, and not required for Phase 2, as the tool was not considered meaningful for assessment of cognitive function.</description>

    <description>The Detection Test is a measure of psychomotor function and uses a well validated simple reaction time paradigm with playing card stimuli. In this test, the on-screen instructions ask: &quot;Has the card turned over?&quot;. A playing card is presented face down in the center of the screen. The card flips over so it is face up. As soon as the card flips over the participant must press &quot;Yes&quot;. The participant is encouraged to work as quickly as they can and be as accurate as possible. The speed and accuracy of each response are recorded and mean of the log10 transformed reaction times for correct responses is calculated. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle.</description>

    <description>The Identification Test is a measure of visual attention and uses a well validated choice reaction time paradigm with playing card stimuli. In this task, the playing cards are all red or black jokers. The on-screen instructions ask: &quot;Is the card red?&quot;. A playing card is presented face down in the center of the screen. The card flips over so it is face up. As soon as it flips over the participant must decide whether the card is red or not. If it is red the participant should press &quot;Yes&quot;, and if it is not red the participant should press &quot;No&quot;. The participant is encouraged to work as quickly and accurately as possible. The speed and accuracy of each response are recorded and mean of the log10 transformed reaction times for correct responses is calculated.

    <description>The One Back Test is a measure of working memory and uses a well validated n back paradigm with playing cards. In this task, the on-screen instructions ask: &quot;Is the previous card the same?&quot;. A playing card is presented in the center of the screen. The participant must decide whether the card is the same as the previous card. If it is the same the participant should press &quot;Yes&quot;, and if not press &quot;No&quot;. The participant is encouraged to work as quickly and accurately as possible. The speed and accuracy of each response are recorded, mean of the log10 transformed reaction times for correct responses is used to demonstrate speed of performance, and the arcsine transformation of the square root of the proportion of correct responses is used to demonstrate accuracy. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle.</description>

    <description>The International Shopping List task is a measure of verbal learning and uses a well validated list learning paradigm administered using a computer. High frequencies, high imagery, concrete nouns (items from a shopping list) were read to the participant at the rate of one word every 2 seconds. Once all 12 words had been read, the participant was asked to recall as many of the words as quickly as possible. The words recalled by the participant were marked on the computer screen. When the participant could recall no more words, the same list was read again. The words recalled by the participant were recorded. This was then repeated a third time. Total number of correct responses on 3 consecutive trials at a single assessment was recorded. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle.</description>

    <description>This test was performed in the same way as the International Shopping List Test, with the exception that, the delayed recall condition required the participant to recall the words from the list 15 30 minutes later without having the list read again. During the recognition condition, the qualified personnel read a shopping list item that may or may not have been on the original list and the participant had to respond either affirmatively (if the item was on the original list) or negatively (if it was not). Total number of correct responses made in remembering the word list after a delay was recorded. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle.</description>

             available and collected prior to enrollment.

          -  Disease Status Requirements:

        Phase 1: ALK-positive NSCLC and ROS1-positive patients must either be treatment naïve in
        the advanced setting or have had disease progression after at least 1 previous ALK/ROS1

             metastatic disease setting.

          -  Disease progression after crizotinib and 1 or 2 prior regimens of chemotherapy in the
             metastatic disease setting.

          -  Disease progression after 1 prior ALK inhibitor therapy other than crizotinib.
             Patients may have had any number of prior chemotherapy regimens in any disease
             setting.

          -  Disease progression after 2 prior ALK inhibitor therapies. Patients may have had any
             number of prior chemotherapy regimens in any disease setting.

          -  Disease progression after 3 prior ALK inhibitor therapies. Patients may have had any
             number of prior chemotherapy regimens in any disease setting.

        ROS1-positive NSCLC patients may be:

          -  Treatment naïve (ie, no prior chemotherapy in the metastatic disease setting and no
             prior ROS inhibitor therapy).

          -  Any number of prior therapies (ie, chemotherapy and/or ROS inhibitor therapies).

               -  Tumor Requirements:

        All Patients must have at least one measurable target extracranial lesion according to

        <title>Probability of First Event Being a Central Nervous System (CNS) Progression, Non CNS Progression, or Death (Phase 1)</title>
        <description>The probability of the first event being a CNS progression, a non-CNS progression, or death was evaluated with a competing risk approach by estimating cumulative incidence functions (range: 0-1) relative to the analysis set. The time to first event being a Competing Event (either “CNS progression” or “non CNS progression” or “Death”) was defined as time from first dose until the date of that specific event. Participants not known to have any of the Competing Events were censored on the date they were last assessed for disease status for PFS. Participants who presented one type of event were counted as a competing cause of failure for the analysis of other type of events. For each type of event, the cumulative incidence function corresponding to the nearest time point preceding 1 year is presented. The results are based on independent central review.</description>

          <title>Probability of First Event Being a Central Nervous System (CNS) Progression, Non CNS Progression, or Death (Phase 1)</title>
          <description>The probability of the first event being a CNS progression, a non-CNS progression, or death was evaluated with a competing risk approach by estimating cumulative incidence functions (range: 0-1) relative to the analysis set. The time to first event being a Competing Event (either “CNS progression” or “non CNS progression” or “Death”) was defined as time from first dose until the date of that specific event. Participants not known to have any of the Competing Events were censored on the date they were last assessed for disease status for PFS. Participants who presented one type of event were counted as a competing cause of failure for the analysis of other type of events. For each type of event, the cumulative incidence function corresponding to the nearest time point preceding 1 year is presented. The results are based on independent central review.</description>

          <title>Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F) of Midazolam (Phase 1)</title>
          <description>Vz/F was defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug, and calculated as dose/(AUCinf*kel), where AUCinf was the area under the plasma concentration-time profile from time 0 extrapolated to infinite time, kel was the rate constant for terminal phase. Only participants in 25 mg and 150 mg QD groups were given midazolam. Day -7 data reflect the PK assessment before administration of PF-06463922, and Cycle 1 Day 15 data reflect the PK assessment after multiple doses of PF-06463922 were administered.</description>
          <population>PK parameter analysis set for midazolam included all participants who received at least 1 dose of midazolam and for which at least 1 midazolam PK parameter of interest was available.</population>

        <description>European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionaires (EORTC QLQ)-C30 (version 3.0) consists of 30 questions assessing 5 functional domains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), global quality of life (QoL), disease/treatment related symptoms (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation and diarrhoea), and the perceived financial impact of disease. Each scale was transformed to a range of 0 to 100 using standard EORTC algorithm. For global QoL and functional scales, higher score indicate better performance, and improvement was defined as an increase of at least 10 points, worsening was defined as a decrease of at least 10 points. For symptom scales, higher score indicates worse symptoms, and improvement was defined as a decrease of at least 10 points, worsening was defined as an increase of at least 10 points. All scales which had not improved nor worsened were considered stable.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Improved, Worsened or Remained Stable in EORTC QLQ-LC13 (Phase 1)</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-LC13 is the lung cancer module of EORTC QLQ-C30 and includes questions specific to the disease associated symptoms (dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and site specific pain), treatment-related symptoms (sore mouth, dysphagia, neuropathy and alopecia), and analgesic use of lung cancer patients. The scale was transformed to a range of 0 to 100 using standard EORTC algorithm. Higher score indicates worse symptoms, and improvement was defined as a decrease of at least 10 points, worsening was defined as an increase of at least 10 points. All scales which had not improved nor worsened were considered stable.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score (Phase 1)</title>
        <description>In Phase 1, the MMSE was collected to assess mental status. The MMSE is a 30 item questionnaire that tests 5 areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall and language. The maximum score is 30. A score of 23 or lower is indicative of cognitive impairment. The MMSE was removed under Amendment 6 of the study protocol, and not required for Phase 2, as the tool was not considered meaningful for assessment of cognitive function.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 of each cycle, and end of treatment (up to 3 years)</time_frame>
        <population>MMSE assessment evaluable analysis set included all participants in the safety analysis set (all participants who received at least 1 dose of PF-06463922) who completed a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline assessment.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score (Phase 1)</title>
          <description>In Phase 1, the MMSE was collected to assess mental status. The MMSE is a 30 item questionnaire that tests 5 areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall and language. The maximum score is 30. A score of 23 or lower is indicative of cognitive impairment. The MMSE was removed under Amendment 6 of the study protocol, and not required for Phase 2, as the tool was not considered meaningful for assessment of cognitive function.</description>
          <population>MMSE assessment evaluable analysis set included all participants in the safety analysis set (all participants who received at least 1 dose of PF-06463922) who completed a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline assessment.</population>

        <title>Time to Tumor Response (TTR) and Intracranial TTR (Phase 2)</title>
        <description>Time to tumor response (TTR) was defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR). For participants whose objective response proceeded from PR to CR, the onset of PR was taken as the onset of response. TTR was only calculated for the subgroup of participants with a confirmed objective tumor response. Intracranial TTR was only calculated for participants with confirmed intracranial objective response. Results presented here were based on independent central review.</description>
        <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
        <population>TTR analysis set included all ITT participants who had confirmed objective response; intracranial TTR analysis set included all ITT participants who had CNS metastases and achieved confirmed intracranial objective response.</population>

        <description>The probability of the first event being a CNS progression, a non-CNS progression, or death was evaluated with a competing risk approach by estimating cumulative incidence functions (range: 0-1) relative to the analysis set. The time to first event being a Competing Event (either “CNS progression” or “non CNS progression” or “Death”) was defined as time from first dose until the date of that specific event. Participants not known to have any of the Competing Events were censored on the date they were last assessed for disease status for PFS. Participants who presented one type of event were counted as a competing cause of failure for the analysis of other type of events. For each type of event, the cumulative incidence function corresponding to the nearest time point preceding 1 year is presented. The results are based on independent central review.</description>

        <description>European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionaires (EORTC QLQ)-C30 (version 3.0) consists of 30 questions assessing 5 functional domains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), global quality of life (QoL), disease/treatment related symptoms (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation and diarrhoea), and the perceived financial impact of disease. Each scale was transformed to a range of 0 to 100 using standard EORTC algorithm. For global QoL and functional scales, higher score indicate better performance, and improvement was defined as an increase of at least 10 points, worsening was defined as a decrease of at least 10 points. For symptom scales, higher score indicates worse symptoms, and improvement was defined as a decrease of at least 10 points, worsening was defined as an increase of at least 10 points. All scales which had not improved nor worsened were considered stable.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants Who Improved, Worsened or Remained Stable in EORTC QLQ-C30 (Phase 2)</title>
          <description>European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionaires (EORTC QLQ)-C30 (version 3.0) consists of 30 questions assessing 5 functional domains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), global quality of life (QoL), disease/treatment related symptoms (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation and diarrhoea), and the perceived financial impact of disease. Each scale was transformed to a range of 0 to 100 using standard EORTC algorithm. For global QoL and functional scales, higher score indicate better performance, and improvement was defined as an increase of at least 10 points, worsening was defined as a decrease of at least 10 points. For symptom scales, higher score indicates worse symptoms, and improvement was defined as a decrease of at least 10 points, worsening was defined as an increase of at least 10 points. All scales which had not improved nor worsened were considered stable.</description>
          <population>Patient reported outcome (PRO) evaluable analysis set included all enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of PF-06463922 and completed a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline PRO assessment.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Improved, Worsened or Remained Stable in EORTC QLQ-LC13 (Phase 2)</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-LC13 is the lung cancer module of EORTC QLQ-C30 and includes questions specific to the disease associated symptoms (dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and site specific pain), treatment-related symptoms (sore mouth, dysphagia, neuropathy and alopecia), and analgesic use of lung cancer patients. The scale was transformed to a range of 0 to 100 using standard EORTC algorithm. Higher score indicates worse symptoms, and improvement was defined as a decrease of at least 10 points, worsening was defined as an increase of at least 10 points. All scales which had not improved nor worsened were considered stable.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Phase 1 and Phase 2)</title>
        <description>AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device, regardless of the causal relationship to study treatment. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined as AEs which occurred for the first time during the effective duration of treatment or AEs that increased in severity during treatment. Serious AEs (SAEs) were defined as any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life-threatening (immediate risk of death); required inpatient hospitalization or caused prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduction normal life functions). AEs included SAEs and non-serious AEs. Causality to study treatment was determined by the investigator. Severity was graded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.</description>

          <description>AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device, regardless of the causal relationship to study treatment. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined as AEs which occurred for the first time during the effective duration of treatment or AEs that increased in severity during treatment. Serious AEs (SAEs) were defined as any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life-threatening (immediate risk of death); required inpatient hospitalization or caused prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduction normal life functions). AEs included SAEs and non-serious AEs. Causality to study treatment was determined by the investigator. Severity was graded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior (Phase 2)</title>
        <description>The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was used to analyze participants' suicidal ideation and behavior, and it is a unique, simple and short method of assessing both behavior and ideation that tracks all suicidal events and provides a summary of suicidality. It assesses the lethality of attempts and other features of ideation (frequency, duration, controllability, reasons for ideation and deterrents), all of which are significantly predictive of completed suicide.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Scores for Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-II (Mood Assessment) (Phase 2)</title>
        <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-II is a 21-item self-report scale, with each item rated by participants on a 4-point scale (ranging from 0-3). The scale includes items capturing mood, (loss of pleasure, sadness, and irritability), suicidal ideation, and cognitive signs (punitive thoughts, self-criticism, self-dislike, pessimism, and poor concentration) as well as somatic signs (appetite, sleep, fatigue and libido). Scores were obtained by adding up the total points from the series of answers. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. The standardized cutoffs are as follows: 0-13: minimal depression; 14-19: mild depression; 20-28: moderate depression; 29-63: severe depression.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Scores for Detection Test (Cognitive Function Assessment) (Phase 2)</title>
        <description>The Detection Test is a measure of psychomotor function and uses a well validated simple reaction time paradigm with playing card stimuli. In this test, the on-screen instructions ask: “Has the card turned over?”. A playing card is presented face down in the center of the screen. The card flips over so it is face up. As soon as the card flips over the participant must press “Yes”. The participant is encouraged to work as quickly as they can and be as accurate as possible. The speed and accuracy of each response are recorded and mean of the log10 transformed reaction times for correct responses is calculated. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Scores for Identification Test (Cognitive Function Assessment) (Phase 2)</title>
        <description>The Identification Test is a measure of visual attention and uses a well validated choice reaction time paradigm with playing card stimuli. In this task, the playing cards are all red or black jokers. The on-screen instructions ask: “Is the card red?”. A playing card is presented face down in the center of the screen. The card flips over so it is face up. As soon as it flips over the participant must decide whether the card is red or not. If it is red the participant should press “Yes”, and if it is not red the participant should press “No”. The participant is encouraged to work as quickly and accurately as possible. The speed and accuracy of each response are recorded and mean of the log10 transformed reaction times for correct responses is calculated. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Scores for One Back Test (Cognitive Function Assessment) (Phase 2)</title>
        <description>The One Back Test is a measure of working memory and uses a well validated n back paradigm with playing cards. In this task, the on-screen instructions ask: “Is the previous card the same?”. A playing card is presented in the center of the screen. The participant must decide whether the card is the same as the previous card. If it is the same the participant should press “Yes”, and if not press “No”. The participant is encouraged to work as quickly and accurately as possible. The speed and accuracy of each response are recorded, mean of the log10 transformed reaction times for correct responses is used to demonstrate speed of performance, and the arcsine transformation of the square root of the proportion of correct responses is used to demonstrate accuracy. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Scores for International Shopping List Test (Cognitive Function Assessment) (Phase 2)</title>
        <description>The International Shopping List task is a measure of verbal learning and uses a well validated list learning paradigm administered using a computer. High frequencies, high imagery, concrete nouns (items from a shopping list) were read to the participant at the rate of one word every 2 seconds. Once all 12 words had been read, the participant was asked to recall as many of the words as quickly as possible. The words recalled by the participant were marked on the computer screen. When the participant could recall no more words, the same list was read again. The words recalled by the participant were recorded. This was then repeated a third time. Total number of correct responses on 3 consecutive trials at a single assessment was recorded. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Scores for International Shopping List Test-Delayed Recall (Cognitive Function Assessment) (Phase 2)</title>
        <description>This test was performed in the same way as the International Shopping List Test, with the exception that, the delayed recall condition required the participant to recall the words from the list 15 30 minutes later without having the list read again. During the recognition condition, the qualified personnel read a shopping list item that may or may not have been on the original list and the participant had to respond either affirmatively (if the item was on the original list) or negatively (if it was not). Total number of correct responses made in remembering the word list after a delay was recorded. Lower values of least square mean change from baseline indicate performance decline. Upper limit of 95% confidence interval of -0.00 or lower indicate statistically significant decline of performance over baseline at that cycle.</description>
