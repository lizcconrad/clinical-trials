  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to see if a Motivational Interviewing Case Management (MICM)
      intervention will improve outcomes for respondents who are on probation or parole, at risk
      for HIV and have recently entered a Sober Living House. The MICM will help respondents access
      needed services, adapt to their new living environment, find and maintain work, address HIV
      risk and treatment, and manage setbacks. The risk for HIV infection among criminal justice
      offenders is significant, as is the need for stable, drug free housing in this population.
      Our aim is to see if the MICM intervention in the context of drug free housing will improve
      health outcomes, reduce recidivism, and increase service utilization for this population.

      This application is based on the premise that probationers and parolees must have access to
      stable, drug free housing to reduce HIV risk, access needed services and avoid rearrests and
      reincarceration. Drug free housing at the Sober Living Network (SLN) in California will be
      studied as a way to provide a positive living environment for probationers and parolees. The
      houses use a sober living house (SLH) model of recovery that includes a communal recovery
      environment, abstinence from drugs and alcohol, peer support, and encouragement to attend
      self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Preliminary data based on a sample of 300
      individuals entering 20 SLHs in California showed resident improvement in a variety of areas,
      including drug and alcohol use, employment, psychiatric symptoms, and arrests (Polcin et al.,
      2010). Although residents referred from parole and probation systems had substance use
      reductions that were comparable to voluntary residents, they had had far more problems
      maintaining employment, higher rates of arrest and incarceration, and lower attendance at
      self- help groups (Polcin, et al., 2010). Thirty seven percent had been rearrested at 6 month
      follow-up and 0ne reason may be that probationers and parolees received only 35% of the
      services that they felt they needed to succeed. Although over half met DSM IV criteria for
      methamphetamine dependence during the last year, a very high risk group for HIV, we did not
      assess HIV outcomes.

      The proposed study will improve SLHs for offenders by adding a Motivational Interviewing Case
      Management (MICM) intervention specifically targeted to the problems presented by each
      offender. The list of potential problems that MICM can address is extensive: 1) adapting to
      the SLH environment, 2) complying with parole and probation, 3) finding and maintain work, 4)
      successfully accessing and maintaining retention in services, 5) addressing HIV risk, testing
      and treatment, 6) mobilizing personal and informal resources, and 7) managing setbacks (e.g.,
      relapse, loss of housing, loss of work).

      Men and women offenders (N=330) entering SLHs will be assigned to a condition consisting of
      drug free housing and provision of a resources manual where residents can seek help for a
      variety of problems (a control group) or drug free housing plus the MICM (intervention).

      Aim 1: To assess HIV testing rates, HIV risk behaviors, and utilization for HIV services at
      baseline, 6, and 12 months.

      H1.1 Residents receiving MICM in addition to drug free housing will have higher rates of HIV
      testing, higher utilization of HIV services, and fewer HIV risk behaviors than the drug free
      housing and resources condition.

      Aim 2: To compare baseline substance use within each study condition with 6- and 12-month
      substance use.

      H2.1 Residents in each study condition will show significant reductions in drug and alcohol
      use between baseline and follow-up time points as measured by the Time Line Follow Back
      (TLFB).

      H2.2 Residents in each study condition will show significant reductions in drug and alcohol
      problems between baseline and follow-up time points on the Addiction Severity Index alcohol
      and drug scales.

      Aim 3: To compare outcomes between the two study conditions at baseline, 6, and 12 months.

      H3.1 Residents receiving MICM in addition to drug free housing will have less substance use
      (TLFB) and lower ASI alcohol and drug severity than the drug free housing and resources
      condition.

      H3.2 Residents receiving MICM in addition to drug free housing will have fewer arrests, fewer
      days incarcerated and lower ASI legal severity than the drug free housing and resources
      condition.

      H3.3 Residents receiving MICM in addition to drug free housing will have fewer work problems
      (ASI Employment scale) and more days worked than the drug free housing and resources
      condition.

      Aim 4: To assess mediators and moderators of the MICM. H4.1 Service utilization (Hser et al.,
      1999) will mediate the relationship between drug free housing plus MICM and outcome (TLFB,
      ASI Alcohol and Drug scales and criminal justice recidivism).

      Exploratory Aims: 1) To explore additional outcomes (e.g., ASI Family, Medical, and
      Psychiatric scales, long-term housing status) and covariates (e.g., social support,
      supportive confrontation, motivation). (2) To conduct 30 qualitative interviews (15 per
      condition) to identify general and intervention specific factors affecting outcome.
