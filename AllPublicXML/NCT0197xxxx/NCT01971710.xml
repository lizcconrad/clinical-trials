    <textblock>
      The goal of the ACCLAIM (Advancing Community-Level Action for Improving MCH/PMTCT) project is
      to increase community demand for, uptake of, and retention in Maternal and Child Health (MCH)
      and/Prevention of Mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) services to improve country
      progress toward elimination of pediatric HIV/AIDS.

      This study will undertake a three-arm randomized trial in Swaziland, Uganda and Zimbabwe.
      Districts/regions (n=9) with 45 PMTCT-implementing health facilities and their catchment
      areas (populations 7300-27500), will be randomly allocated to three intervention arms: 1)
      community leader engagement, 2) community leader engagement with community days, or 3)
      community leader engagement with community days and male and female community peer groups.
      The primary study outcome is HIV exposed infants (HEI) returning to the health facility
      within two months for early infant diagnosis (EID) of HIV. Secondary study outcomes include:
      gestational age of women attending for first antenatal care, male partners tested for HIV,
      and HEI receiving nevirapine prophylaxis at birth. Changes in community knowledge, attitudes,
      practices and beliefs on MCH/PMTCT will be assessed through household surveys.

    <description>The general objective for the study is to assess the efficacy of the three study arm activities on the uptake of, and retention of HIV positive pregnant/postpartum women in MCH/PMTCT services as measured by the proportion of infants returning to the health facility at 6-8 weeks of age for the early infant diagnosis (EID) of HIV.</description>
