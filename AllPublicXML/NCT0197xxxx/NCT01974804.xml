  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic study that makes pictures of organs of the
      body using magnetic field and radio frequency pulses that can not be felt. The purpose of
      this study is to determine if new imaging methods can help tumor evaluation in the brain. The
      extra images will be obtained using diffusion and perfusion MRI techniques to assess early
      treatment response in patients with brain metastasis, and will be compared to methods
      currently being used.

    <description>This is a technology assessment protocol for response to treatment. The study is designed to assess the utility of the technology using a limited number of participants. We will assess whether the MR parameters are predictive markers of early response.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo a 20 minute pretreatment MRI scan and a 30 minute post treatment MRI scan with contrast agent administration. Ten patients with brain metastasis will be recruited in the study. All the patients will be undergoing SRS (Stereotactic Radiosurgery). Patients will have 1 pretreatment evaluation and 2 post treatment evaluations [1-72 hours post treatment and 8 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) post treatment] for early response. Patients are to be administered contrast prior to obtaining MRI scans. These research scans are estimated to take 20 minutes of scan time (+/- 10 minutes), which includes patient set up and conducting the research sequences..</description>
