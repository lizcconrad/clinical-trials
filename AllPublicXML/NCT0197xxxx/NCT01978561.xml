      subjects who maintain ongoing clinical pregnancies through Week 10 of gestation in NT-03.

    <textblock>
      NT-04 is a follow-up study that will include subjects who received at least one dose of study
      drug and maintain ongoing clinical pregnancies through Week 10 of gestation during NT-03.
      NT-04 does not involve the administration of study drug treatment.

      In NT-03, subjects who achieve an ongoing clinical pregnancy at Week 8 of gestation will
      undergo a repeat transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) at Week 10 of gestation (4 weeks after last
      dose of study drug). Subjects who are pregnant at Week 10 of gestation will be enrolled in
      NT-04.

      Subjects in NT-04 will be contacted by telephone every 6 to 8 weeks until Week 38 of
      gestation, at which time subjects will be contacted every two weeks until confirmation of
      delivery. Information about pregnancy status and use of prescription medications will be
      collected at these telephone interviews.

      Between Weeks 18 and 22 of gestation, an obstetrical ultrasound will be performed.

      Following delivery, additional information will be obtained, including pregnancy outcome,
      gestational age at delivery, etc. Standardized photographs will be taken as part of a newborn
      assessment.
