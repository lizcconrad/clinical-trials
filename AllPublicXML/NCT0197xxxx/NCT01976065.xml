  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center exploratory clinical trial is a randomized trial designed to test whether a
      regenerative endodontic procedure using tissue engineering principles (REGENDO), or a
      revascularization (REVASC) endodontic procedure, in comparison to standard apexification
      treatment using a mineral trioxide aggregate barrier (apexification; APEX), produces a
      significantly better composite clinical outcome for the treatment of immature permanent teeth
      with pulpal necrosis.

      This is a multi-center randomized clinical trial designed to test whether a regenerative
      endodontic procedure using tissue engineering principles (REGENDO), or a revascularization
      (REVASC) endodontic procedure, when compared to the standard apexification treatment using
      mineral trioxide aggregate barrier-MTA apexification (APEX), produces a significantly better
      composite clinical outcome for the treatment of immature permanent teeth with pulpal
      necrosis. This study will use an antibiotic mixture called Triple Antibiotic Paste (TAP),
      consisting of ciprofloxacin, metronidazole and minocycline, in the tooth for disinfection of
      the root canal in study arms REGENDO and REVASC. The FDA has issued an Investigational New
      Drug (IND) number allowing use of the triple antibiotic mixture in this trial. Other dental
      materials used in this study have already been FDA approved for use in humans to provide a
      matrix for the promotion of tissue growth in the root canal space. The study will also
      attempt to identify the type of bacteria within the root canal space and surrounding tissues
      by analyzing a small sample collected on a cotton-tip applicator. This clinical trial hopes
      to determine which of the three treatment methods helps the tooth to grow stronger and
      survive for at least two years after treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 6-20

          -  Participant has a permanent tooth with a necrotic pulp (as defined by lack of
             responsiveness to both electrical pulp tests and cold [EndoIce] tests). If the tooth
             was traumatized, then pulpal necrosis is defined as either: 1) no response to both
             electrical pulp test and cold [EndoIce] test by three months after trauma, or 2)
             presence of a periapical lesion, or 3) radiographic evidence of root resorption, or 4)
             discoloration of the crown.

          -  Tooth in question is restorable (as defined by Class A or Class B using Samet and
             Jotkowitz classification) without the need of a stainless steel crown.

          -  Incomplete (i.e., immature) root development defined by apical foramen â‰¥1.0mm (each
             foramina &gt;1.0mm for multi-rooted teeth).

          -  At least 5 mm of root development (CEJ to radiographic apex).
