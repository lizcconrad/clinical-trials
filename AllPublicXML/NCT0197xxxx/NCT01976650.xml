      This study is a Post-Market Surveillance study in Korea to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of dexamethasone 700 ㎍ (OZURDEX®) intravitreal implant used to treat Branch Retinal Vein
      Occlusion, Central Retinal Vein Occlusion, or non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior
      segment of the eye in clinical practice.

    <time_frame>4 Years</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event is considered any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. An Adverse Drug Reaction is a harmful and unintended reaction that is incurred during routine administration or use of the drug, whose causal relationship with the drug cannot be excluded.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With 15 or More Letter Improvement in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) in the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Years</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters). The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly means that vision has improved and was considered 'effective'. The percentage of patients with at least a 15 or more letter improvement in BCVA in the study eye are presented.</description>
