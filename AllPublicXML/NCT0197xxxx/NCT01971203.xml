  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether quetiapine extended-release in
      combination with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is more effective than CBT plus placebo
      in treating depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with both major depression and
      generalized anxiety disorder. Approximately 64 individuals (adults 18-65) will be randomly
      assigned to treatment group for 16 weeks. Weekly CBT sessions will be conducted lasting about
      45 minutes and weekly visits with the study psychiatrist lasting about 20 minutes in which
      medication will be discussed. Both clinician administered and self-report measures will be
      used to compare groups before and after 16 weeks.

      This study will evaluate the efficacy of quetiapine extended-release as adjunctive therapy to
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) compared to CBT plus placebo in the treatment of patients
      with comorbid major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. We will also evaluate the
      quality of life in patients with comorbid MDD/GAD, the response and remission rates by
      treatment group, changes in sleep quality, and tolerability of adjunctive quetiapine to CBT.
