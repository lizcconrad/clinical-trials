  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The thymus gland is a specialized organ in the chest that plays a central role in the
      adaptive immune system throughout development until puberty. In response to stress, the fetal
      thymus gland may shrink, or involute. The investigators propose a prospective cohort study
      that will enroll pregnant women admitted to labor and delivery for the management of preterm
      labor and/or preterm premature rupture of membranes from 28-36 weeks gestation. Based on
      sonographic thymus measurements, the investigators will develop a clinical prediction tool to
      identify babies who are at increased risk for adverse neonatal outcomes. A reliable
      non-invasive predictor of adverse neonatal outcome using thymic ultrasound measurements has
      the potential to affect clinical management, improve outcomes for premature babies, and
      direct further research efforts.
