    <measure>The Change From Baseline in the Mean of the 3 Single Symptom Scores (Blocked Nose, Sneezing and Running Nose) at the Closing/Final Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to day 11</time_frame>
    <description>Patients scored the symptoms (blocked nose, sneezing and running nose) on a 4-point rating scale with 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. The range of the mean score thus could be between 0 and 3. The change in the mean of the 3 single scores was calculated by the score at the final visit minus the score at baseline. Therefore, a negative change represents an improvement of the mean score.</description>

    <measure>The Mean of the 2 Single Quality of Life Improvement Scores at the Closing/Final Visit for Daytime Activities and Quality of Sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>up to day 11</time_frame>
    <description>The mean score of the following two &quot;quality of life improvement&quot; questions at the final/closing visit was calculated: &quot;How did Rhinospray plus improve the quality of your daytime activities?&quot; and &quot;How did Rhinospray Plus improve the quality of your sleep?&quot;. The scores range from 1=strongly to 4=no improvement. Thus also the range of the mean score is from 1 to 4.</description>

    <description>Patients scored the single symptoms (blocked nose, sneezing and running nose) at the end of each treatment day on a 4-point rating scale with 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. The changes in the 3 single scores were calculated by the single score at the final visit minus the single score at baseline. Therefore, a negative change represents an improvement of the single scores.</description>

        <title>The Change From Baseline in the Single Symptoms Scores ( Blocked Nose, Sneezing and Running Nose) at the Closing/Final Visit</title>
        <description>Patients scored the single symptoms (blocked nose, sneezing and running nose) at the end of each treatment day on a 4-point rating scale with 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. The changes in the 3 single scores were calculated by the single score at the final visit minus the single score at baseline. Therefore, a negative change represents an improvement of the single scores.</description>
