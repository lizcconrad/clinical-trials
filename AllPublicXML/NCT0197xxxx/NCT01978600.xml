    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate intraocular pressure (IOP) over a 24-hour period
      using Simbrinza™ topical ophthalmic suspension.

      This study consisted of two phases, a Screening/Eligibility Phase and a Treatment Phase. Both
      phases required the patient to complete an overnight stay.

    <measure>Mean Nocturnal IOP at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4: 10PM, 12AM, 2AM, 4AM, 6AM</time_frame>
    <description>Nocturnal IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) is the mean of the nocturnal time points assessed (10 PM to 6 AM). IOP was measured with a calibrated applanation tonometer in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). One eye from each subject was chosen as the study eye and only data for the study eye were used for the efficacy analysis. A higher IOP can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of either open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension in both eyes.

          -  Willing and able to attend all study-related visits and be housed overnight at
             clinical site for the study assessments.

          -  Must sign an Informed Consent form.

          -  Other protocol-specified inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of childbearing potential if pregnant, breastfeeding, or not using adequate
             birth control.

          -  Severe central visual field loss in either eye.

          -  Ocular infection or ocular inflammation within the past 3 months.

          -  Clinically significant or progressive retinal disease.

          -  Other ocular pathology, including severe dry eye, that may in the opinion of the
             investigator preclude the administration of study medication.

          -  Any other conditions including severe illness which would make the patient, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable for the study.

          -  Any medical condition that would preclude the safe administration of a topical
             beta-blocker.

          -  Cannot safely discontinue all glucocorticoids administered by any route.

          <title>Mean Diurnal IOP at Week 4</title>
          <description>Diurnal IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) is the mean of the diurnal time points assessed (8 AM to 8 PM). IOP was measured with a calibrated applanation tonometer in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). One eye from each subject was chosen as the study eye and only data for the study eye were used for the efficacy analysis. A higher IOP can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage).</description>
