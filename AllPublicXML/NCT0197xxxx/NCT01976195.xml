  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in China. In order to
      report the efficacy and safety of thalidomide combining with high-dose dexamethasone for the
      treatment of adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), compared to conventional
      high-dose dexamethasone mono-therapy.

    <textblock>
      The investigators are undertaking a multicenter, randomized controlled trial of 200 primary
      ITP adult patients from 5 medical centers in China. One part of the participants are randomly
      selected to receive Thalidomide (given at a dose of 150mg for 15 consecutive days), combining
      with dexamethasone (given intravenously at a dose of 40 mg per day for 4 days, the others are
      selected to receive high-dose of dexamethasone treatment (given intravenously at a dose of 40
      mg daily for 4 days).

      Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment.
      Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study. In order to report the efficacy and
      safety of thalidomide combining with high-dose dexamethasone therapy compared to high-dose
      dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with ITP.
