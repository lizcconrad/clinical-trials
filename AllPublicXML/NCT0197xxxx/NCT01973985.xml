  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pleural effusion is an extremely common problem with multiple causes; its subsequent
      investigation with thoracocentesis and treatment with drainage represent two of the most
      frequently performed diagnostic and therapeutic medical procedures. The role of thoracic
      ultrasonography in the management of pleural effusion is a modern and rapidly expanding one,
      having become effectively mandatory and part of the &quot;gold standard&quot; over the past decade due
      to its diagnostic and patient safety benefits. By contrast, the measurement of intra-pleural
      pressure using sequential manometry has failed to convincingly demonstrate its clinical value
      beyond physiological studies despite its availability for over a century. Previous work has
      shown a potential role for pleural manometry in predicting the presence of un-expandable lung
      and success of talc pleurodesis but these studies have not been replicated or clinically
      validated.

      We intend to combine the old and new in an observational study comparing findings on thoracic
      ultrasonography and pleural manometry during thoracocentesis with patient-reported symptoms
      and the key clinical outcomes of presence of un-expandable lung and success of talc
      pleurodesis. The investigators hypothesise that the previously described variations in
      pleural elastance can be correlated with appearances and anatomical changes visualised on
      thoracic ultrasonography; and in combination can be reliably utilised to predict clinical
      outcome. The study may allow the proposal of a treatment algorithm that allows patients with
      pleural effusion to be managed in a more expeditious and efficient manner.

      Study-specific interventions will be the monitoring of intrapleural pressure using an
      electronic pleural manometer (Mirador Biomedical CompassTM Thoracentesis Assist Device) and
      thoracic ultrasonography. Both of these are considered non-invasive and low-risk to the study
      participants.

      As part of their standard usual clinical care, participants will undergo a diagnostic and/or
      therapeutic pleural intervention in the form of thoracocentesis or pleural aspiration;
      intercostal chest drain insertion; and/or talc pleurodesis. All of these procedures are
      invasive and associated with potential complications that participants will be informed about
      as part of standard informed consent procedures. These interventions will however be
      clinically indicated and carried out whether or not an individual chooses to participate in
      this study. For those individuals who do participate in the study, any complications of these
      standard clinical care procedures will be recorded as part of the data collection process for
      the study.

        aspiration or drainage for a symptomatic pleural effusion. (Large-volume aspiration or
        drainage will be defined as an expectation by the clinician responsible for assessing the
        patient that more than 500mL of pleural fluid is to be drained on this particular
        occasion).
