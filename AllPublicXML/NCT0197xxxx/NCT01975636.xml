      This is an open-label, single dose study in healthy male subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A baseline (predose) fecal sample and a baseline (predose) urine sample will be obtained at
      the clinic prior to dosing on Day 1.

      On Day 1, subjects will begin the Treatment Phase. Subjects will be released from the clinic
      after at least 10 days since dosing and as soon as the following conditions are met:

        -  greater than 90% of the administered radioactivity has been recovered, and

        -  less than 1% of the administered radioactive dose is recovered in two consecutive
           24-hour samples each of urine and feces

        Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects must meet criteria to be included in this study, including but not limited to the
        following:

          1. Healthy male 18 - 55 years, inclusive, at the time of informed consent

          2. Body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 32 kg/m2 at Screening

          3. Subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and
             their female partners not be of childbearing potential or must be practicing highly
             effective contraception throughout the study period and for 30 days after study drug
             discontinuation. Sperm donation is not allowed during the study period and for 30 days
             after study drug discontinuation.

          4. Provide written informed consent

          5. Willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from this study:

          1. Have participated in a 14C-research study within the 6 months prior to Day -2. The
             total exposure from this and any previous study must be within the recommended levels
             considered safe.

          2. Exposure to clinically significant radiation within 12 months prior to Day -2.

          3. Any laboratory abnormalities considered clinically significant by the investigator,
             which may require further investigations or treatment

          4. Clinically significant illness which required medical treatment within 8 weeks or a
             clinically significant infection within 4 weeks of dosing

          5. Any history of gastrointestinal surgery (e.g., hepatectomy, nephrotomy, digestive
             organ resection) that may affect PK profiles of study drugs

          6. Hypersensitivity to the study drugs or any of their excipients

          7. Known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive

        Restrictions will apply on prior and concomitant medications, food and beverages
