  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although effective treatments for psychosocial symptoms and disorders are available, patients
      frequently do not receive the most appropriate and effective treatment for their symptoms
      because of inappropriate and unstructured diagnostics of psychosocial symptoms in general
      practice. The hypothesis is that by using the intervention SGE-PsyScan the clinical symptoms
      of patients can be assessed more uniformly and earlier as opposed to the GPs' assessment in
      usual care. As a result, patients are supposed to start earlier with a treatment that fits
      the type and severity of their symptoms better.

      The patients will be randomly assigned to either receive the SGE-PsyScan or usual care.

Based on the 4DSQ patients and GPs receive advices for possible treatments.</description>
