  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the clinical safety and effectiveness of the ARO Spinal System and to assess
      preliminary cost/benefit analysis in patients undergoing decompression surgery for
      symptomatic lumbar disc herniations.

      The general hypothesis is that the ARO significantly improves outcomes in patients undergoing
      decompression surgery for symptomatic lumbar disc herniations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Radicular pain and evidence of nerve-root irritation lasting 6 weeks or more as
             evidenced by both:

               1. Radicular pain - below the knee,

               2. Nerve root irritation

             i. positive nerve root tension sign - straight leg raise positive between 30 and 70
             degrees, or ii. positive femoral tension sign, or iii. neurologic deficit -
             asymmetrical depressed reflex or decreased sensation in a dermatomal distribution or
             weakness in a myotomal distribution.

          2. Primary one-level posterolateral herniation in the lower lumbar spine (L4-L5 or L5-S1
             only) as shown by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (protrusion, extrusion or
             sequestered fragment) consistent with the clinical symptoms (both level and side).

          3. The investigator confirms that the patient is a surgical candidate for discectomy,

          4. The patient has been scheduled for their surgical procedure no more than two months
             from time of consent,

          5. 18 years to 55 years of age at time of consent,

             personnel to access medical records,

          7. Able to understand oral and written Danish.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous lumbar surgery

          2. Cauda equine syndrome

          3. Scoliosis greater than 15 degrees

          4. Osteoporosis

          5. Segmental instability (&gt; 10 degrees angular motion or &gt;4mm translation)

          6. Vertebral fractures

          7. Spinal Infections

          8. Spinal tumors

          9. Inflammatory spondyloarthropathy

         10. Pregnancy or the intent to become pregnant in the following year

         11. Comorbid conditions contraindicating surgery

         12. Multiple herniations

         13. Known allergy to titanium, aluminum or vanadium

         14. Female patients of childbearing age, who are not willing to use adequate contraception
             specified as: intrauterine devices, hormonal contraceptives (contraceptive pills,
             implants, transdermal patches, hormonal vaginal devices or injections with prolonged
             release). It is accepted in certain cases to include subjects having a sterilized
             permanent partner or subjects using double barrier contraceptive methods which is a
             condom combined with a diaphragm.
