      Coordinated project whose objectives are: a) to test the effectiveness of a promotion of
      physical activity intervention (MOVI-KIDS) on preventing obesity; and b) to improve the
      academic performance in both children with and without attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD)

      The prevalence of overweight in Spanish children in the puberty age is among the highest in
      the world and increasing quickly. Our group has done so far two interventions based on
      after-school program of recreational physical activity to control obesity and other
      cardiovascular risk factors in primary school children (8-to-11 years) in Cuenca.

      This intervention, in its first edition showed moderate effect in reducing adiposity and
      improving the lipid profile, but did not significantly improve overall cardiometabolic risk
      by not reduce blood insulin. In a second edition (MOVI-2), increased duration and intensity
      of the sessions and worked over the development of muscle strength. Preliminary analysis also
      show a decrease in body fat, a reduction of global cardiometabolic because of decreasing
      insulin levels.

      Our project integrates a multidimensional intervention to promote physical activity, with a
      mixed design (cross-over randomized trial, and a qualitative study) and two sub-projects
      share the same study population, &quot;Effectiveness of an intervention of physical activity
      promotion in schoolchildren on preventing obesity during the adiposity rebound period: a
      cross-over randomized cluster trial&quot; and &quot;Effectiveness of physical activity intervention to
      prevent obesity and improve academic performance in children with and without ADHD risk&quot;.

      The two interventions are based on cross-over randomized trial to test the effectiveness of
      an intervention to promote physical activity in the school environment (MOVI-KIDS), two-year
      in 22 schools (20 public and two private schools) in the provinces of Cuenca and Ciudad Real,
      Spain.

      This subproject (subproject-2) will assess the effectiveness of the intervention of the
      MOVI-KIDS Program in improving attention and cognition in students at risk for ADHD.
      Furthermore, this project will evaluate the effectiveness of MOVI-KIDS Program in improving
      motor skills and academic achievement in the overall sample, and the impact that changes in
      the year have on the amount of physical activity that the students in the sample performed
      during recess.

      The hypotheses of this third edition are that a multidimensional intervention promoting
      physical activity in children at the adiposity rebound period (4-7 years),in the school
      environment (MOVI-KIDS), lasting two-years, will to:

        1. Reduce body fat percentage in the intervention group versus the control group in 2% in
           children adiposity rebound age (4-7 years),

        2. Improve academic performance and motor skills in children with and without attention
           deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),

        3. Reduce adiposity and sedentary time, improve academic performance, quality of life and
           the duration and quality of sleep in children with and without ADHD.

    <description>Reduce body fat percentage in the intervention group versus the control group in 2% in children adiposity rebound age (4-7 years).
Body fat percentage is estimated with an eight-electrode BC-418 MA bioimpedance analysis system (Tanita Corp. Tokyo, Japan) using the mean of two readings made under controlled temperature and humidity conditions.</description>

    <measure>Academic achievement</measure>
    <time_frame>One year (interim analysis)</time_frame>
    <description>It will assess the different basic psychological processes involved in learning (intelligence, cognition, memory, attention, and perception) by using the Differential Aptitude Battery-BADyG-I General scale for children aged 3-6 years (Yuste C, 2008) and the E1 BADY scale for children 6-to-8 years old (Yuste C, 2008). Both scales include a) global academic predictors (eg general intelligence), b) non-verbal tests (eg reasoning and logical puzzle figures), c) verbal tests (eg numerical quantitative concepts), and d) additional tests (eg auditory perception).</description>

    <time_frame>One year (interim analysis)</time_frame>
    <description>Motor Skills will be assessed by the Movement Assessment Battery for Children - Second Edition [Movement Assessment Battery for Children 2 (M-ABC 2)]. This battery has been validated to identify and describe deficiencies in motor performance in children and adolescents aged 3-to-16 years old. It consists of eight tests for each age group (3-6, 7-10, and 11-16) measuring three dimensions: manual skills, throws and catches and equilibrium (static and dynamic). Children can score between 0 and 5 in each of the tests. The total score is obtained as the sum of the scores of all tests (range 0-40). A lower score indicates better motor performance. It allows classifying: children with motor problems, children with motor risk and children with normal motor development</description>

    <description>Quality of life related to health: Kiddy-KINDL, this questionnaire has been validated in Castilian version for children ages 4-7 and parents (Rajmil L, 2004). The KINDL is a generic HRQOL instrument for children and adolescents developed in Germany for use both in clinical practice and in healthy children. Kiddy-KINDL questionnaire contains 12 questions (with 3 response options; range of 1-3, where 1 = never, 2 = sometimes and 3 = many times) in six dimensions: physical, emotional, self-esteem, family, friends and school. The children's version will be administered by interview, and parents will be self-administered version.</description>

    <time_frame>One year (interim analysis)</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed by using the Spanish version of the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire ( CSHQ ) ( Owens JA . 2000 ) completed by parents. The CSHQ is focused on common sleep disorders for children 4-to-10 years old. The questionnaire allows parents indicate on each item if they consider sleep habits are a problem for their child. It will also four questions about the time to go to bed, wake up, get up , and total number of hours of sleep. Finally, latency, amount, duration of sleep and number of awakenings will also be measured by accelerometer in the subsample of 200 schoolchildren. During a week, children will completed a sleep diary.</description>
