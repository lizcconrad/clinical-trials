      CC-292 is an oral agent that is under clinical development for the treatment of rheumatoid
      arthritis an autoimmune inflammatory disorder.

      This study will test the clinical effectiveness and safety of an orally (PO) administered
      dose of CC-292 compared to placebo in US female patients currently on background Methotrexate
      (MTX) with active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      proof-of-concept study to determine the efficacy and safety of CC-292 (375 mg PO daily) on a
      stable background of MTX therapy in female subjects with active RA.

      Approximately 80 female subjects with active RA will be randomized 1:1 into two dose groups:
      active CC-292 (375 mg PO daily) or identically-appearing placebo capsules for 4 weeks

An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values (as specified by the criteria below), regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE.</description>

          -  Male subjects

          -  Any condition that could affect CC-292 absorption, including gastric restrictions,

             with decreased intragastric acid production such as acid pernicious anemia.

          -  Currently using treatment with DMARDs (other than sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine or
             chloroquine and MTX), including biologics. Previous use is only allowed after adequate
             washout (4 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) prior to randomization.

          -  Previous treatment with any cell depleting therapies, including investigational agents
             (eg, CAMPATH, anti-CD4, anti-CD5, anti-CD3, anti-CD19 and anti-CD20) within 6 months
             of screening.
