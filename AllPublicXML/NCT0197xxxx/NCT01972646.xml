    <textblock>
      Introduction: Despite several expert panel recommendations and cellulitis treatment
      guidelines, there are currently no clinical decision rules to assist clinicians in deciding
      which emergency department (ED) patients should be treated with oral antibiotics and which
      patients require intravenous therapy at first presentation of uncomplicated cellulitis. The
      objective of this prospective study is to determine potential patient risk factors associated
      with adult patients (&gt;17years) presenting to the ED with a concern about a skin or soft
      tissue infection who fail initial antibiotic therapy for the treatment of standard cellulitis
      and require a change of antibiotics or admission to hospital.

      Methods: This study will be a prospective study conducted in two tertiary care EDs. Patients
      will be excluded if they have been treated with antibiotics for the current bout of
      cellulitis prior to presenting to the ED, patients admitted to hospital and those patients
      with abscesses only. Hired research assistants (RAs) will administer a questionnaire at the
      initial ED visit with telephone follow-up 2 weeks later. Treatment failure will be defined as
      patients requiring subsequent hospitalization, initiation of intravenous antibiotics (if oral
      antibiotics were prescribed initially), or a change of oral antibiotics for the original
      cellulitis.

      Results: This study will provide a detailed profile of patient risk factors associated with
      treatment failure of cellulitis. The results will be analyzed and used in formulating a
      clinical decision rule for effective treatment of cellulitis presenting to the ED. Each of
      the predictor variables associated (p ≤ 0.1) with failed treatment in the univariate analysis
      will be considered in a multivariate logistic regression model. Additionally, treatment
      variability among clinicians in regard to cellulitis will be evaluated and compared to
      treatment failures, thus providing data on successful treatment regimens.

      Conclusions: Results from this research may be used to generate a clinical prediction rule to
      assist clinicians in effectively treating patients presenting to emergency departments with
      cellulitis. Understanding which patient risk factors for treatment failure will assist
      clinicians in determining which patients will benefit from intravenous versus oral
      antibiotics.

        skin or soft tissue infection (key words included cellulitis, abscess, infection, insect
        bite, ulcer, or rash) were screened for eligibility by ED staff or trained research
