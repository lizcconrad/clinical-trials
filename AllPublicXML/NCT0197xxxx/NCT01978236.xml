  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a global, multi-centre, open-label, study of GSK2118436 conducted in up to 30
      evaluable subjects with resectable, BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive metastatic melanoma
      to the brain. All subjects in this study are required to have accessible extracranial
      metastases and are agreeable to undergo repetitive biopsies. The first cohort of 15 subjects
      will receive dabrafenib orally 150mg twice daily (BID) for 7 to 14 days prior to surgery
      (Cohort A); the second cohort of 15 subjects will receive the combination of dabrafenib 150
      mg BID and trametinib 2 mg once daily for 7 to 14 days prior to surgery (Cohort B). The
      primary purpose of this study is to determine levels and distribution of dabrafenib, its
      metabolites, and trametinib (Cohort B only) in parenchymal brain metastases, extracranial
      metastases, and peripheral blood (plasma) within two cohorts of subjects with BRAF V600E/K
      mutation-positive melanoma that has metastasized to the brain. All subjects will be followed
      for survival and new anti-cancer therapy for a total of two years or until death or the
      subject wishes to withdraw from further follow-up.
