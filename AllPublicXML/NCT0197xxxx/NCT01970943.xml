  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The placebo effect is a phenomenon that has experienced major advances of its understanding
      in the last decade. However, mechanisms of placebo analgesia in chronic pain patients have
      yet to be compared to healthy subjects. The investigators study aims to investigate the
      magnitude of placebo response and related opioid release in patients that suffer from
      episodic migraines as compared to healthy controls. In particular, the investigators are
      looking to map brain activity during placebo analgesia using modern brain imaging techniques
      such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET).
      The investigators hypothesis is that placebo response and the availability of opioid
      receptors is reduced in chronic migraine patients.
