  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of recombinant humanized anti-IgE
      monoclonal antibody injection in patients with allergic asthma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Omalizumab will be given as add-on treatment to budesonide inhaled powder in patients with
      moderate or severe allergic asthma(IgE&gt;=60IU/ml), who demonstrate inadequate asthma symptom
      control. Response to Omalizumab will be assessed by the overall improvement in control of
      asthma.

      Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to human
      immunoglobulin E(IgE). The antibody has a molecular weight of approximately 150 kilodaltons
      and produced by Chinese Hamster Ovary cell.

      Omalizumab inhibits the binding of IgE to the high-affinity IgE receptor on the surface of
      mast cells and basophils. Reduction in surface-bound IgE on cells limits the degree of
      release of mediators of the allergic response.

    <description>During the 4~6-week Run-in phase, the dosage of budesonide inhaled powder(BUD) was prescribed and optimized to maintain asthma control according to Global Initiative for Asthma(GINA, 2008) guidelines. During the following treatment phase, patients continued to receive optimized BUD and Omalizumab for 28 weeks, administered by subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks or 4 weeks. The dosage of Omalizumab received was based on body weight and serum IgE.</description>
