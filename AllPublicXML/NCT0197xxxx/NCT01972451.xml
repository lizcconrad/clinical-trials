  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Bowel Cancer Screening program was implemented to address the important issue of
      prevention and early detection of bowel cancer. Results from the first few years of screening
      and previous smaller studies show that while in its current form it will save many lives,
      there continue to be polyps and cancers in the upper large bowel (right side) that may be
      difficult to detect. There is some evidence that these types of polyps (serrated polyps) may
      be at least partly responsible for cancers missed at the initial colonoscopy and have a
      faster rate of growth to cancer compared to conventional polyps (adenomas). We propose to
      examine participants undergoing screening colonoscopy with the addition of a contrast dye ( a
      safe food colouring agent base already used in various bowel camera procedures in standard
      clinical practice). This has been shown to improve detection of conventional polyps
      significantly even though it is considered by some to be more time consuming (possibly taking
      a few minutes longer) and requiring specific training to undertake. We hope to study the
      feasibility of undertaking these procedures to improve detection and removal of these polyps
      within the bowel screening program and potentially inform further studies to assess the
      impact of improved detection and consequent potentially reduced incidence of interval or
      missed bowel cancers in longer term follow up. Thus the main aims of this feasibility study
      are to assess if this type of procedure would be feasible to implement and acceptable to
      participants, colonoscopists and the screening program and also assess any additional time or
      costs involved to inform the question of if a larger study should then be undertaken to
      conclusively prove or disprove the merits of this approach in terms of health economics,
      cancer detection and survival.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All participants testing positive on Faecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) in the screening
             program who are eligible and appropriate for an index screening colonoscopy will be
             offered participation in the study.

          -  All participants attending for a one year surveillance colonoscopy if they have
             undergone an index screening colonoscopy as part of the study as per current
             guidelines for surveillance will also be offered inclusion

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any participants not deemed fit for colonoscopy on the screening program or undergoing
             alternative investigation such as CT Pneumocolon or minimal prep CT scan as their
             index procedure instead.

          -  Participants who have undergone previous colorectal surgery will be excluded from the
             study though their standard management in the screening program will continue
             unchanged.
