  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and short-term safety and
      effectiveness of the NanoKnife™ System when used to ablate localized prostate cancer in low
      risk subjects with organ-confined prostate cancer and a low risk of recurrence. This study
      will evaluate the feasibility of the NanoKnife™ System as a focal therapy.

      This study is designed to be a prospective, non-randomized pilot study in 6 subjects treated
      at up to three (3) clinical sites. This study will involve six (6) subjects who meet the low
      risk prostate cancer criteria defined by this protocol. The subjects' prostate cancer foci,
      the location of which will be determined by ultrasound guided transperineal 3-Dimensional
      Prostate Mapping Biopsy (3D-PMB), will be targeted for treatment with the NanoKnife System.
      The primary objective of this portion of the study will be to evaluate procedural and
      short-term post treatment safety of the NanoKnife treatment via incidence of adverse events
      and evaluation of effect on urologic (urinary and erectile) function. The secondary objective
      of this study is to evaluate the short term efficacy of the NanoKnife treatment. Local
      efficacy in the area of treatment will be assessed via histological evaluation of 3D-PMB
      cores obtained throughout the half of the prostate where treatment was targeted at three (3)
      months post NanoKnife treatment, to evaluate the ablation zone created by the NanoKnife
      treatment. Following the 3 month biopsy assessment the data from these 6 subjects will be
      submitted to FDA for confirmation of short term safety and efficacy.

      This group of subjects will continue to be followed for safety and efficacy for 2 years.
      Safety will be assessed via incidence of adverse events and evaluation of effect on urologic
      function and quality of life. Local efficacy will be characterized via MR imaging and
      evaluated via post treatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics including time to PSA
      nadir and post-nadir PSA stability.
