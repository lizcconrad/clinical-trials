    <description>Subjects complete three separate 60 minute long &quot;binge&quot; cocaine self administration sessions (low dose 8mg/70kg, medium dose 16mg/70kg, and large dose 32mg/70kg). Mean inter-infusion intervals (time between cocaine boluses) are then averaged by adding all intervals within each session and dividing by 60. Intervals during which pump access is withheld (due to increase in vital signs) will be excluded. Data on cocaine self-administration (total number of responses, infusions, and III), subjective effects, and vital signs will be checked for normality prior to analysis using Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics and normal probability plots. The significance level for all statistical tests will be set at p&lt;.05.</description>

    <description>The Dependent measures pertinent to the effects of an acute/chronic exposure to stimulants (methylphenidate/cocaine) on measures of impulsivity will be analyzed using a mixed design ANOVA. This design will have a within subjects variable to study the effects of an acute exposure to stimulants (methylphenidate vs. placebo) and a between subjects variable to study the effects of a chronic exposure to stimulants (cocaine dependent subjects vs. healthy controls).</description>

          4. DSM-IV criteria for Cocaine Abuse (305.60) or Cocaine Dependence (304.20)

          5. recent street cocaine use in excess of amounts to be administered in the current
             study,

          6. intravenous and/or smoked (crack/ freebase) use,

          7. positive urine toxicology screen for cocaine,

          8. for females, non-lactating, no longer of child-bearing potential (or agree to practice
             effective contraception during the study), and a negative serum pregnancy (β-HCG)
             test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Other drug dependence (except nicotine) as determined by urine toxicology or interview

          2. &lt; 1 year of cocaine dependence,

          3. a primary major DSM-IV psychiatric diagnosis (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, etc.),

          4. a history of significant medical (cardiovascular) or neurological illness, ie prior
             myocardial infarction, current active symptoms of cardiovascular disease / angina,
             evidence of cocaine-related cardiovascular symptoms, prior arrhythmias or need for
             cardiovascular resuscitation, neurovascular events such as transient ischemic attacks,
             stroke, and/or seizures Parameters re: elevations in vital signs are now explicitly
             specified under &quot;Safety features built into our one-day self-administration paradigm).

          5. current use of psychotropic and/or potentially psychoactive prescription medication,

          6. seeking treatment for drug abuse/dependence (for experimental cocaine component),

          8. current use of any medication (prescription or over-the-counter) determined to cause
             potential drug interactions by the study physicians.
