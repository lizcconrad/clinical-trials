  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation consists of two parallel groups of participants who will follow the same
      protocol. The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of using Functional Electrical
      Stimulation/Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO) or splint as an assistive mobility device over a 12
      week period in people with MS who experience foot drop. Patients who are clinically
      prescribed FES will be invited to participate in the FES arm of the study. Patients who are
      clinically prescribed an AFO will be invited to participate in the AFO arm. Participants will
      be asked to make four visits to the gait laboratory at Queen Margaret University. Four weeks
      before the start of device use (Baseline - 4 weeks), start of device use (Baseline), after 6
      weeks and 12 weeks of device use. Participants' walking will assessed using computerised
      three dimensional motion analysis, which will provide a detailed description of the movements
      (kinematics) of the lower limbs. Participants will also be asked to carry out a 10 metre walk
      and a two minute walk. Both gait analysis and the walking performance tests will be carried
      out with and without an assistive deviceÍ¾ apart from their first session where participants
      will only be assessed without their assistive device.

      Participants will be asked to wear an activity monitor for 7 days after each assessment. In
      addition participants will be asked to complete four short standardised questionnaires (MS
      walking scale, MS impact scale (MSIS-29), Fatigue severity score and the Leeds MS Quality of
      life score) at each assessment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in time taken for 10 meter walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline in 10m walk test at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In the 10 meter walk test, the time taken by the participant to walk 10 meters is recorded. The test is repeated and the average is taken for analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in ankle dorsiflexion angle at initial contact</measure>
    <time_frame>The change from baseline of the ankle dorsiflexion angle at initial contact from at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ankle dorsiflexion angle is derived from gait analysis. The angle of the ankle at the time the foot contacts the floor during a step is derived. This is repeated for at least 5 different walks, and the average of those 5 walks is calculated for further analysis.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>change in distance covered in two minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>The change from baseline in the the 2 minute walk test at 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>During the 2 minute walk test the participant walks around an oval shaped track for 2 minutes. The distance covered in two minutes is taken for analysis.</description>
