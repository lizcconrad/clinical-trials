    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies a nanoemulsion formulation of curcumin in
      reducing inflammatory changes in breast tissue in obese women at high risk for breast cancer.
      Curcumin may reduce inflammation in breast tissue and fat. This may affect the risk of
      developing breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      i.) To determine whether nanoemulsion curcumnin modulates pro-inflammatory biomarkers in
      plasma and breast adipose tissue.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES include:

      ii.) To determine the adherence, tolerability and safety of two doses of nanoemulsion
      curcumin (NEC) in women at high risk for developing breast cancer;

      iii.) Evaluate possible correlations between physical factors such as body mass index (BMI),
      dietary intake and pro-inflammatory effects in plasma and breast adipose tissue.

      iv.) Explore additional biomarkers as surrogate endpoints to measure effects of NEC.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive lower dose of nanoemulsion curcumin orally (PO) twice daily (BID)
      for 3 months.

      ARM II: Participants receive 100 mg of nanoemulsion curcumin PO BID for 3 months.

    <description>Participants receive 50 mg dose curcumin PO BID for 3 months. Biomarker analyses of breast adipose tissue and plasma samples will be obtained at baseline and 3 months. Breast adipose tissue samples will be obtained via fine needle aspiration. Plasma samples from the baseline blood draw will be assessed for curcumin and also stored at -80°C for biomarker analysis. Assessment of dietary intake by food frequency questionnaires and 24 hour dietary recalls will be used to assess usual dietary habits. All participants will complete a daily log on the date and time of NEC administration, potential adverse events, and medications.</description>
