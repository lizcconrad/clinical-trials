    <textblock>
      This is a 2 by 2 cross-over study to evaluate pharmacokinetics of telmisartan and
      rosuvastatin FDC compared to reference telmisartan and rosuvastatin coadministered in two
      groups enrolling healthy adult male and female subjects under fasting conditions.

      Subjects will be admitted to the clinic in the evening before Day 1. All subjects will
      receive a single oral dose of telmisartan/rosuvastatin FDC or telmisartan and rosuvastatin
      co-administered in the morning on Day 1. All the subjects will remain in the clinical unit
      until completion of all assessments on Day 2 including collection post-dose PK sample.
      Subjects will return to the clinic for pharmacokinetic samples at scheduled time.

      The two treatment periods will be separated by a washout period.

          2. Sitting blood pressure meeting the following criteria at screening: 150 ≥ systolic
             blood pressure ≤100 (mmHg) and 100 ≥ diastolic blood pressure ≤ 65 (mmHg) amd 100 ≥
             Heart rate ≤ 40

          3. A history of drug abuse or the presence of positive reactions to drugs that have abuse
