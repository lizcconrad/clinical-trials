      Question: Does manual diaphragm release change kinematics and respiratory function of elderly
      subjects? Design: Randomized controlled trial with concealed allocation and double-blinding.

      Participants: 17 volunteers over 60 years old randomized into two groups: 09 in the Control
      Group (CG) and 08 in the Intervention Group (IG).

      Intervention: The manual diaphragm release technique was used on the IG, in two sets of ten
      deep breaths, with a one minute interval between them. The CG underwent a sham protocol
      (light touch), with same sets and time of interval.

      Outcome measures: The groups were evaluated using spirometry, manovacuometry and
      optoelectronic plethysmography (OEP), in that order, before and immediately after the
      intervention.

    <measure>Compartmental chest wall distribution</measure>
    <time_frame>before first session</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis of the regional distribution of respiratory volumes was done with Optoelectronic plethysmography (BTS Bioengineering, Italy), in which 89 reflective markers were adhered to the skin of volunteers using hypoallergenic adhesives, on particular anatomical points of the chest wall and abdomen (Aliverti and Pedotti 2003). The device emitted an infrared light on the reflective markers which was captured by eight cameras around the room, allowing the spatial determination of each marker. Thus, changes in lung volumes were calculated at each of the three compartments of the rib cage: pulmonary or upper ribcage (Rc, p), abdominal or lower ribcage (Rc, a) and abdomen (Ab). After the first OEP evaluation, a nontoxic, hypoallergenic pen was used to mark the placement of the dorsal reflective markers allowing the patient to lay in supine for the manual technique or the sham. The markers were then placed at the exact same anatomical points for reevaluation.</description>

    <measure>Maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures</measure>
    <time_frame>Before first session</time_frame>
    <description>The maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures (MIP, MEP) were obtained from the residual volume and total lung capacity, respectively, according to the criteria of the ATS/ERS (ATS/ERS, 2002) and measured using a portable digital manometer, model MVD 300 (® MDI Ltd., Brazil).</description>

    <measure>Pulmonary Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Before first session</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the participant's lung function, a portable Micro Loop 8 (Micromedical, England) spirometer was used to evaluate the forced maneuver (Miller et al 2005). The study followed the criteria of acceptability in accordance with the ATS/ERS (2005). Values of FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC), peak expiratory flow (PEF) and FEV1/FVC were obtained.</description>

    <description>To perform the technique the volunteer was placed in supine position with limbs relaxed. Positioned behind the head of the volunteer, the therapist performed manual contact (pisiform, ulnar edge and the last three fingers) with the underside of the costal cartilage of the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th rib, and guiding forearms toward the shoulders of the corresponding side. In the inspiratory phase, the therapist gently pulled the points of contact with both hands, in the direction of the head, yet slightly lateral, accompanying the elevation movement of the ribs. During exhalation, the therapist deepened contact toward the inner costal, maintaining resistance throughout the inspiratory phase. In the breaths following, the therapist sought to gain traction and smooth increase in the deepening of contacts. This maneuver was performed in two sets of ten deep breaths, with a one minute interval between them.</description>
