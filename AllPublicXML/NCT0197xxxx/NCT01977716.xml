  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to analyze peritonitis rate and peritonitis bacteriology as risk
      factors for loss of residual renal function, technique failure and mortality in chronic
      kidney disease patients.

      Secondary objectives are: To know the current rate of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis
      population and to understand the bacteriological profile of peritonitis.

      To know the rate and risk factors other than peritonitis involved in the loss of residual
      renal function.

      To analyze the utility of alternative diagnostic tests, such as reagent strips, for early
      detection of peritonitis when traditional tests are not available.

      To analyze the simultaneous measurement of serum creatinine and cystatin-C as alternative
      measurements of peritoneal clearance and residual renal function.

        All patients starting PD as the first dialysis treatment will be considered. Recruitment
        will take place over a six-months period in hospitals belonging to the Instituto Mexicano
        de Seguro Social. Inclusion criteria include: adult patients with signed informed consent
        given; there should not be selection for age, gender, primary cause of renal disease.
        Patients will not be included if they were previously in hemodialysis or received renal
        transplant. Patients will also be excluded if they are on immunosuppressive therapy, have
        diagnosis of cancer, or are seropositive for HIV or hepatitis.
