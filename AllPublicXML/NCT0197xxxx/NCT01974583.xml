      Split-thickness skin grafting remains fundamental treatment of patients with deep burns and
      other traumatic injuries. However, the split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor site dressing
      has been controversial until now. Our study here aimed to assess patient comfort and
      wound-healing efficacy with the application of thin split-thickness grafting on STSG donor
      sites.

      Background：Split-thickness skin grafting remains fundamental treatment of patients with deep
      burns and other traumatic injuries. However, the split-thickness skin graft (STSG) donor site
      dressing has been controversial until now. Our study here aimed to assess patient comfort and
      wound-healing efficacy with the application of thin split-thickness grafting on STSG donor
      sites.

      Methods: 192 consecutive patients undergoing split-thickness skin grafting were included in
      the study and the participants were randomly divided into three groups: Group A was regrafted
      with thin STSG, while, Group B and Group C were covered with the occlusive hydrocellular
      dressing and paraffin gauze, respectively. The three groups were compared regarding to the
      time of epithelialization, pain sensed by the patients and the scar formation.
