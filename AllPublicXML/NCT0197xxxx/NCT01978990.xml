      Modern medicine provides many solutions that are intended to help control the patient's blood
      glucose level: insulin and other medications to lower it, glucose tablets or glucagone to
      raise it when it gets dangerously low, glucometers to quickly measure the blood glucose
      level, pumps and pens to inject insulin or other injectable medicine, etc.The objective of
      this trial is proving the concept and the feasibility of using a medical informatics system
      comprised of computer hardware, software and a smartphone application to achieve better
      outcomes.
