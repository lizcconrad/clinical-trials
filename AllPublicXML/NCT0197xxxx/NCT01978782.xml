  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is the most common mental health disorder among HIV-patients. Recognizing and
      treating depression is important in order to improve quality of life and health outcomes in
      those living with HIV. In clinical practice selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
      are used most frequently in HIV patients with depressive symptoms. A complicating factor in
      the concomitant use of antiretroviral agents and antidepressant therapy is the occurrence of
      drug-drug interactions. Citalopram can be seen as one of the preferred SSRIs in HIV-infected
      patients because citalopram has a relatively favourable drug interaction profile compared to
      other SSRIs. Raltegravir is an HIV-1 integrase inhibitor and is frequently being used as
      antiretroviral agent in combination with tenofovir/emtricitabine in HIV-patients. Raltegravir
      has shown sustained antiretroviral activity, is generally well tolerated and has little
      propensity to interact with other drugs because it does not inhibit or induce CYP450 enzymes.
      Theoretically, no clinically relevant drug interaction is expected between raltegravir and
      citalopram as raltegravir is not a CYP2D6 substrate and thus will not be affected by the
      possible inhibition of CYP2D6 by citalopram. Raltegravir is metabolized by UGT but citalopram
      is not known to influence UGT. A possible interaction may occur through inhibition of P-gp
      mediated transport of raltegravir by citalopram. However, even when no drug interaction is
      expected theoretically, it may be recommended to collect sufficient clinical evidence to
      support this hypothesis because unexpected interactions with raltegravir have been observed
      in the past. In order to be able to recommend raltegravir and citalopram concomitant use, a
      pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers is proposed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is at least 18 and not older than 55 years at screening.

          2. Subject does not smoke more than 10 cigarettes, 2 cigars, or 2 pipes per day for at
             least 3 months prior to Day 1.

          3. Subject has a Quetelet Index (Body Mass Index) of 18 to 30 kg/m2, extremes included.

             laboratory results are not within the reference ranges, the subject is included on
             condition that the Investigator judges that the deviations are not clinically
             relevant. This should be clearly recorded.

             disorders, gastro-intestinal disorders, renal and hepatic disorders, hormonal
             disorders (especially diabetes mellitus), coagulation disorders.

          7. Relevant history or presence of QT syndrome, prolonged QTc time, bradycardia,
             hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated
