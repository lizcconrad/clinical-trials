  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of topical tacrolimus
      0.05% twice a day in the treatment of ocular graft versus host disease (GVHD).

      The objective of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of topical tacrolimus 0.05%
      drops compared with topical methylprednisolone sodium succinate 0.5% drops in patients with
      ocular GVHD. 40 patients with ocular GVHD who meet the inclusion criteria of the study as
      determined by a screening visit will be divided into two equal groups. In addition to their
      current medication, one group will receive the topical tacrolimus 0.05% drops and the other
      group will receive the topical methylprednisolone sodium succinate 0.5% drops. The
      participants will then have two follow-up visits at the week 5 and week 10 markers after
      their screening visit.

      To evaluate the purpose of the study as well as the patient's safety, the following
      procedures will be performed at each visit: a comprehensive eye examination, tear break-up
      time (TBUT), Schirmer's test, intraocular pressure (IOP), fundoscopy and grading scores of
      lid margin and corneal fluorescein staining. The following questionnaires will be
      administered at each visit: Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Symptom Assessment in Dry
      Eye (SANDE). Impression cytology specimens will be taken only at the screening visit and at
      the week 10 visit.

    <measure>Ocular Burning Sensation, Ocular Discharge, Ocular Redness, Ocular Itching, Foreign Body Sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular burning sensation, ocular discharge, ocular redness, ocular Itching, and foreign body sensation were measured to evaluate the safety and tolerability of topical tacrolimus 0.05% twice a day in the treatment of patients with ocular GVHD. Safety and tolerability of topical tacrolimus 0.05% twice a day will be monitored by the occurrence of systemic and ocular adverse events in addition to symptoms directly related to the instillation or use of the investigational medication. Subjects will be monitored at each study visit for the occurrence of any adverse events found through examination or patient reports. Tolerability will be evaluated at every visit with a self-response questionnaire that assessed burning sensation, discharge, redness, itchiness, and foreign body sensation on a scale from 0 to 4 (none = 0, trace = 1, mild = 2, moderate = 3, and severe = 4). Where a higher value represents more symptoms (less tolerability).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The OSDI questionnaire is a 12-question survey used to measure the symptoms of dry eye disease. Each of the 12 individual questions rate each of the dry eye symptoms on a 0-4 scale, with 4 meaning that the symptom is present all of the time and 0 meaning the symptom is present none of the time. The overall ODSI score is calculated by adding all of the values from the 12 questions, multiplying that value by 25, and dividing the resulting value by the number of questions answered. This results in an overall scale that ranges from 0-100, with 100 being severe dry eye symptoms and 0 being no dry eye symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal Epitheliopathy (Corneal Fluorescein Staining Using the NEI Grading Scheme)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal fluorescein staining is used to assess the level of corneal epitheliopathy that is related to dry eye disease. The corneal fluorescein staining scale ranges from 0 to 15, with 0 representing the minimum level of corneal epitheliopathy and 15 representing the maximum level of epitheliopathy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Schirmer Tear Test (mm)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Schirmer tear test measures the amount of tear secretion produced by a patient in millimeters (mm). Generally, the greater amounts of tear secretion is better than smaller amounts of tear secretion. The minimum value of this scale is 0 mm of tear secretion and there is no maximum value to this scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tear Film Break-Up Time</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tear Film Break-Up Time measures the amount of time, in seconds, that the tear film completely coats the ocular surface after each blink. The longer the amount of time the tear film completely coats the ocular surface is considered to be better than a shorter amount of time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual acuity is measured by asking subjects to read letters on a chart that consists of different rows of letters. Each row of letters corresponds to different levels of visual acuity. The Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) scale generally ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 corresponding to 20/20 vision and 1 corresponding to 20/200 vision. The range from 0-1 is not absolute, however, as patients who have vision better than 20/20 or vision worse than 20/200 will score out side of the 0 to 1 range.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intraocular Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Intraocular pressure is the measure of the fluid pressure within the eye as measured by tonometry. Intraocular pressure is normally measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The normal range for intraocular pressure is 12-20 mmHg, there is no better or worse measurement.</description>

        <description>Ocular burning sensation, ocular discharge, ocular redness, ocular Itching, and foreign body sensation were measured to evaluate the safety and tolerability of topical tacrolimus 0.05% twice a day in the treatment of patients with ocular GVHD. Safety and tolerability of topical tacrolimus 0.05% twice a day will be monitored by the occurrence of systemic and ocular adverse events in addition to symptoms directly related to the instillation or use of the investigational medication. Subjects will be monitored at each study visit for the occurrence of any adverse events found through examination or patient reports. Tolerability will be evaluated at every visit with a self-response questionnaire that assessed burning sensation, discharge, redness, itchiness, and foreign body sensation on a scale from 0 to 4 (none = 0, trace = 1, mild = 2, moderate = 3, and severe = 4).

        <description>The OSDI questionnaire is a 12-question survey used to measure the symptoms of dry eye disease. Each of the 12 individual questions rate each of the dry eye symptoms on a 0-4 scale, with 4 meaning that the symptom is present all of the time and 0 meaning the symptom is present none of the time. The overall ODSI score is calculated by adding all of the values from the 12 questions, multiplying that value by 25, and dividing the resulting value by the number of questions answered. This results in an overall scale that ranges from 0-100, with 100 being severe dry eye symptoms and 0 being no dry eye symptoms.</description>

        <title>Tear Film Break-Up Time</title>
        <description>Tear Film Break-Up Time measures the amount of time, in seconds, that the tear film completely coats the ocular surface after each blink. The longer the amount of time the tear film completely coats the ocular surface is considered to be better than a shorter amount of time.</description>

        <title>Visual Acuity</title>
        <description>Visual acuity is measured by asking subjects to read letters on a chart that consists of different rows of letters. Each row of letters corresponds to different levels of visual acuity. The Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) scale generally ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 corresponding to 20/20 vision and 1 corresponding to 20/200 vision. The range from 0-1 is not absolute, however, as patients who have vision better than 20/20 or vision worse than 20/200 will score out side of the 0 to 1 range.</description>
