  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present trial will be performed according to an open design to determine the maximum
      tolerable dose (MTD) by evaluation of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of volasertib in
      paediatric leukaemia and solid tumours in the age group 2 to less than 12 and 12 to less than
      18 years. A further objective is to collect data on safety, tolerability, toxicity, efficacy
      (preliminary activity), pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of volasertib in paediatric
      cancer patients
