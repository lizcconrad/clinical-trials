      At baseline visit, subjects who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled.
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive Zeltiq treatment to either their right or left
      flank The contralateral flank will receive Liposonix treatment. A total of three identical
      treatments will be completed monthly for 3 consecutive months. Subjects will return 4 weeks
      following the last treatment for follow up photography, measurements, and assessments. This
      study is a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of these procedures.

    <description>The primary outcome was a blinded rating of the treatment area (Noninvasive Cryolipolysis Device vs. a High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Device) with the best cosmetic appearance. A dermatologist will blindly evaluate the treated areas of each side from live subjects at baseline and on the final follow up visit (week 12).</description>
