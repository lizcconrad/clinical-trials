  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if adults and children with residual low-pitch
      hearing in the severe hearing loss range can develop improved speech perception by combining
      their residual acoustic hearing with electrical stimulation through a short cochlear implant.
      The low-pitches would be amplified with a hearing aid and the high-pitch sounds would be
      stimulated electrically.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if individuals with residual low-frequency hearing
      in the severe range can develop improved speech perception by combining their residual
      acoustic hearing with electrical processing through a cochlear implant designed to stimulate
      the high-frequency basal and middle turn of the cochlea while preserving useful low-frequency
      acoustic hearing. To accomplish this, we propose to implant individuals with severe hearing
      with a Cochlear® Nucleus™ Hybrid L24 Implant or a Cochlear® Nucleus™ Hybrid S12 in the poorer
      ear. We believe these devices will do less damage to the Organ of Corti structures, than
      longer, more invasive standard cochlear implant electrodes.

      Two different populations will be studied under this IDE.

      Population 1: 15 Adults who have a severe sensorineural hearing loss with a pure-tone average
      (PTA) between 60-90 decibels (dB) hearing level (HL) between 125-1500 Hz and profound loss at
      higher frequencies will be implanted with the Cochlear® Nucleus™ Hybrid L24 Implant. The
      potential subject will present with Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant (CNC) monosyllabic word
      scores between 0-35% in the ear to be implanted and up to 60% understanding in the
      contralateral ear in the best-aided condition.

      Population 2: 30 Children (ages 5-12 years) and adolescents (ages 13-15 years) who have a
      sensorineural hearing loss with a pure-tone average (PTA) between 60-90 dB HL between
      125-1500 Hz and profound loss at higher frequencies will be implanted with the Cochlear®
      Nucleus™ Hybrid L24 Implant or the Cochlear® Nucleus™ Hybrid S12 Implant. Those that have
      hearing thresholds between 60-90 dB HL at 1500 Hz would be implanted with the less invasive
      shorter 10 mm Hybrid S12 in attempt to better preserve the middle frequency range. Those with
      hearing thresholds &gt;90 dB HL at 1500 Hz would receive the longer 16 mm Hybrid L24 electrode.
      The potential subject will present with Phonetically Balanced Kindergarten (PB-K)
      monosyllabic word scores between 0-50% in the ear to be implanted and up to 60% understanding
      in the contralateral ear in the best-aided condition.

      Through the preserved acoustic hearing, we believe the subject will experience better signal
      to noise ratios for speech perception in noise, better localization of sound and an
      improvement music perception. Histological evidence from patients implanted with standard
      arrays and our experience with a short electrode array for implantation of individuals with
      significant residual hearing both support this assumption (Nadol, Shiao, Burgess, Ketten,
      Eddington et al., 2001). The duration of this study will be 2 years (24 months) for adults
      and for 5 years (60 months) in children and adolescents.

    <description>The PPVT is a standardized, norm-referenced measure of receptive vocabulary skills. The test is a multiple-choice measure consisting of sets of four black and white line drawings. The examiner names one of the pictures and the test recipient is expected to indicate which picture has been labeled, either verbally or through pointing.

    <description>The GFTA-2 is a standardized, norm-based articulation measure that samples spontaneous sound production. Children are asked to respond to picture plates and verbal cues from the examiner with single words that test consonant accuracy in initial, medial, and final positions. This measure has norms based on the performance of normal-hearing children from age 2 years to 21 years</description>

    <description>These tests are standardized from kindergarten through high school. The Word Identification and Word Attack subtests from the WRMT-R will be used to assess children's word recognition abilities. These subtests measure accuracy of sight word recognition and phonetic decoding of pronounceable non-words. Reading comprehension abilities will be assessed by the Passage Comprehension subtest of the WRMT-R. The WRMT-R uses a cloze procedure in which the participants are asked to read a short passage and orally provide a missing word. It is appropriate for children and adults from 5 years, 0 months to 20 years, 0 months of age.</description>

Pre-operatively with bilateral hearing aids
Combined stimulation
This test assesses the participants' ability to recognize and identify simple melodies in closed set provided in 4 different formats: sung with video, sung without video, melody with rhythm, and isochronous (melody without rhythm) in random order. Previous research with children and adults who use CIs has shown that while adults with traditional long-electrode cochlear implants are able to perform successfully in three of the four formats (performing poorly on the isochronous condition), adults with short-electrode cochlear implants are able to perform successfully on all formats. Conversely, children with long-electrode devices are only able to perform well on those that include lyrics and perform at or below change on the other two conditions.</description>

    <description>The Nucleus Hybrid L24 cochlear implant incorporates an electrode array designed to preserve residual hearing. This has been accomplished by employing a thin, straight, intracochlear electrode array attached to a Nucleus cochlear implant receiver/stimulator. The Nucleus Hybrid L24 array has 22 electrodes spread over 16 mm and an anticipated insertion depth of 16 mm. It is slim, with its dimensions ranging from 0.35 x 0.25 mm (at the tip) to 0.55 x 0.4 mm, and designed to minimize lateral wall forces with a stiffened basal section to prevent buckling. The resultant insertion angle is about 280-300° in the scala tympani for the Hybrid L24, as confirmed in temporal bone trials at the Medical University Hannover and the University of Melbourne.</description>

    <description>The Nucleus Hybrid S12 cochlear implant incorporates an electrode array designed to stimulate the high-frequency, basal region of the cochlea while maintaining useful acoustic hearing in the low-frequency, apical region. This has been accomplished by employing a short, thin, straight intracochlear electrode array attached to a Nucleus cochlear implant receiver/stimulator. The electrode array incorporates a collar to prevent over-insertion, or further migration, into the cochlea beyond the point where the basal turn curves into the ascending segment. Thus, the electrode array is placed within the straight segment of the basal turn of the scala tympani via a cochleostomy.</description>
