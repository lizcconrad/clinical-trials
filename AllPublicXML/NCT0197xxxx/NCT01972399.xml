      The primary objective of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of using Er: YAG
      laser along with bone graft and barrier membrane to conventional mechanical debridement also
      with bone graft and barrier membrane in the treatment of peri-implantitis infections.

          -  Patients having a minimum of 1 dental implant with peri-implantitis.

          -  The dental implant with peri-implantitis has ≥ 3 threads exposed or pocket probing
