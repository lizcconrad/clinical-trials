    <textblock>
      Infectious disease is the single biggest cause of death worldwide. New infectious agents,such
      as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and new strains of influenza continually
      emerge and require new investigations to understand pathogen biology and pathogenesis in the
      host. Witness the Influenza A pandemic. Concerns about new viruses and their impact on health
      and the economy are also increasing. Current alerts sent out by the Ministry of Health (about
      the novel coronavirus and the Avian influenza A virus) are but cases in point. These likely
      reflect advances in science, which have allowed novel pathogens to be identified.

      Because of its geography, Singapore is vulnerable to new pathogens through importation or the
      global travel of its citizens. Hence we must be ever ready to meet unexpected challenges
      anytime.

      On the administrative front, Singapore General Hospital has a Disease Outbreak Task-force
      which has in place many plans that can be activated should there be a large-scale epidemic.

      What is missing thus far is a program that will enable us to perform scientific studies in
      the setting of an epidemic. Hence in this study, we will, in collaboration with the Program
      in Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) in Duke-National University of Singapore Postgraduate
      Medical School, attempt to (i) detect novel, previously undescribed pathogens; (ii)
      characterize viruses (not necessarily novel but emerging and re-emerging) that are raising
      concern or causing clusters or epidemics in the hospital and/or country; (iii) characterize
      immune responses to such viruses in healthcare workers as well as patients (those affected by
      these viruses and those exposed to the affected). The techniques that will be used will be
      those not routinely available in a hospital's service labs.

      Some patients will remain undiagnosable with the best available technology. Since new
      laboratory tools that can detect previously undiagnosed pathogens may become available in the
      future, the study also aims to archive specimens from patients whose illnesses remain
      undiagnosed.

      This study has the following aims:

        1. To detect novel, previously undescribed pathogens.

        2. To characterize viruses (not necessarily novel but emerging and re-emerging) that are
           raising concern or causing clusters or epidemics in the hospital and/or country;

        3. To characterize immune responses to such viruses in patients.

        4. To archive specimens with no identifiable infectious etiological agents for future
           testing.

      A recent global analysis documented that emerging infectious disease events have increased
      significantly over time. Singapore has not been spared with the list of pathogens since the
      late 1990s, including Nipahn virus, SARS coronavirus, dengue, chikungunya, and 2009 H1N1. As
      is widely known, the novel coronavirus may potentially impact Singapore as Haj pilgrims from
      Singapore travel to Saudi Arabia and are potentially exposed to this virus.

      Novel pathogens continue to be discovered. An example of this is the Severe Fever with
      Thrombocytopenia Syndrome bunyavirus in Henan, China. Appropriately a commentary accompanying
      the report identified China as a country with the largest potential for emerging or
      re-emerging infectious disease, due to the close proximity of animals and human populations.
      Similarly, Southeast Asia was identified as a potential hotspot, citing the avian influenza
      pandemic and Nipahn virus outbreak. As such, it is obvious that there is a need to better
      define undiagnosed infective syndromes in Singapore, and subsequently characterize emerging
      pathogens.

      In Singapore, there is currently a lack of research focus on discovery of novel pathogens.
      Our current protocol is an attempt to fill this gap. This proposal brings together experts in
      clinical infectious diseases in SGH, world renowned scientists in laboratory diagnostics of
      infectious diseases and public health epidemiology experts in Duke-NUS Postgraduate Medical
      School. We hope by employing state of the art technologies, we will be at the frontier of new
      pathogen discovery.

    <description>Clinical data collection through case records, and interview of patients or next-of-kin or friend in the event information is unavailable or incompletely documented in the case records.
Sample collection will be performed according to the following frequency:
First day of enrolment: blood draw (by weight) not more than 20ml, nasal (and/or nasopharyngeal ) and/or throat swab, stool and urine sample.
On days 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14 and 28: blood (by weight) not more than 10 ml, nasal (and/or nasopharyngeal l) and/or throat swab, stool and urine sample. On D28, blood (by weight) not more than 20ml, will be drawn as most immune response changes manifest by then.
If available, urine and stool sample will be collected. If the subject is intubated, endotracheal aspirate will replace nasal and throat swab. Sample collection for research will be done at the same time as samples for clinical testing as far as possible, to minimize patient discomfort.</description>
