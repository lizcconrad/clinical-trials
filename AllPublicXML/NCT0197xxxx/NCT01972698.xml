  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a self-directed and simulation-based lung
      ultrasound (LUS) and focused cardiac ultrasound (FCU) curriculum is efficacious on anesthesia
      trainees' image acquisition skills and diagnostic acumen. The investigators hypothesize that
      a self-directed and ultrasound-assisted LUS and FCU curriculum that includes video lectures,
      online teaching modules, an ultrasound simulator, and self-directed hands-on sessions on
      critically ill mechanically ventilated patients is effective in training novice
      ultrasonographers to obtain good quality images, to correctly interpret them, and to support
      clinical decision-making in critically ill patients.

      Trainees will be randomized to fully supervised FCU hands-on sessions on healthy models and
      critically ill mechanically ventilated patients (control group - traditional apprenticeship
      model) or to a completely self-directed and simulation-based approach (intervention group).

      To assess if this new self-directed and simulation-based ultrasound curriculum leads to
      adequate acquisition of competences (adequate image acquisition and interpretation) in novice
      ultrasonographers, trainees will have to perform a focused lung and cardiac assessment on a
      critically ill mechanically ventilated patient.

    <description>All participants will attend an ultrasound introductory course (lectures and illustrative interactive cases).
Participants randomized to the intervention group will undergo a completely self-directed lung and focused cardiac ultrasound curriculum.
A set of video-lectures on how to perform US on a critically ill patient (video-tutorials on image acquisition, troubleshooting, and pitfalls) will be provided.
Participant will have access to an ultrasound simulator.
Finally, participants in the intervention group will be asked to perform self-directed lung and focused cardiac ultrasound examinations on critically ill patients.
An investigator will supervise the sessions but will not interfere with the self-learning process.
- To support their learning, trainees will have access to on-line virtual FCU and LUS modules created by the Toronto General Hospital Department of Anesthesia Perioperative Interactive Education (http://pie.med.utoronto.ca/TTE/index.htm).</description>

    <description>All participants will attend an half-day ultrasound introductory course.
Participants randomized to the conventional group will initially attend 2-hour hands-on session on healthy volunteers, fully supervised by an expert critical care ultrasonographer (acquisition of basic knowledge with US machine settings and probe positioning and orientation, normal view acquisition, and identification of normal anatomical structures and landmarks).
Subsequently, participants will attend a 3-hours hands-on session on critically ill patients, fully supervised by an expert critical care ultrasonographer.</description>
