      The purpose of this research is to use an approved drug(Visudyne) for neovascular age-related
      macular degeneration, which is essentially choroidal neovascularization for permeability and
      vascular proliferation for the retinal circulation, to treat another permeable abnormality -
      retinal capillary abnormalities - located eccentric to the central portion of the macula or
      in the foveal region.

      The study will include 30 patients who were diagnosed with retinal capillary abnormalities
      and include 2 follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months post-procedure to determine if the
      treatment has been effective in treating their disorder. It is anticipated that approximately
      half of the patients will require an additional treatment. Patients will be enrolled from our
      patient population and be 50 years of age and older, male or female. Pregnant women or women
      of normal child bearing age will be excluded since there are no adequate and well-controlled
      studies on the use of photodynamic therapy in pregnant women. Any retinal vascular
      abnormality that has a standard of care method of treatment will also be excluded from the
      study population.

    <description>The drug, approved for are-related macular degeneration should also prove effective for other permeable conditions, such as retinal capillary/vascular abnormalities that lead to macular edemas such as macular telangiectasia type I and type II, retinal arteriolar macroanurysms, and retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP), which is a variant of neovascular age-related macular degeneration. These diseases currently have no available approved alternative treatment.</description>
