      To evaluate the influence to the blood supply of the anastomosis and the harvest of the No.
      253 lymph nodes in different surgical methods--- preserving the left colic artery (LCA) and
      resect the No. 253 lymph node specifically in the radical resection of rectal carcinoma or
      dividing at the root of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) in the radical resection of
      rectal carcinoma.

      Methods: The patients who got rectal carcinoma are divided into two groups. Both groups will
      receive the radical resection of rectal carcinoma. We preserve the left colic artery and
      resect the No. 253 lymph node specifically in Group A and divide at the root of the inferior
      mesenteric artery in Group B, We insert a trocar into the arterial arcade at the proximal
      site of the anastomosis and measure the blood pressure of the arterial arcade in the
      operation, which can reflect the blood supply of the anastomosis. Besides, We will measure
      the length of the colon from the anastomosis to the level of the root of the IMA. Expecting
      Results：The blood pressure of the arterial arcade in Group A will be higher than that in
      Group B. And the patients in Group A will have less chance to get anastomotic fistula.
      Expecting Conclusions: Preserving the LCA and resecting the No. 253 lymph node specifically
      in the radical resection of rectal carcinoma can improve the blood supply of the anastomosis
      and decrease the incidence of anastomotic fistula, and won't affect the harvest of the No.
      253 lymph node.

    <description>The root of the inferior mesenteric artery(IMA) was carefully dissected and the artery wall was exposed all the way to the bifurcation of the left colic artery(LCA) and the superior rectal artery (SRA), exposing the LCA from its root until the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) was recognized. Subsequently, dissection was continued along the IMV up to the level of the root of the IMA. Then the sigmoid mesentery was transected from the root of the IMA to the IMV, and the IMV and the root of the SRA were ligated. Finally, the adipose tissue with the lymph nodes in the area surrounded by the IMA, IMV, and LCA was dissected, with preservation of the LCA .</description>

            <description>We preserve the left colic artery and resect the No. 253 lymph node during the rectal surgery.
preserving the left colic artery: The root of the inferior mesenteric artery(IMA) was carefully dissected and the artery wall was exposed all the way to the bifurcation of the left colic artery(LCA) and the superior rectal artery (SRA), exposing the LCA from its root until the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) was recognized. Subsequently, dissection was continued along the IMV up to the level of the root of the IMA. Then the sigmoid mesentery was transected from the root of the IMA to the IMV, and the IMV and the root of the SRA were ligated. Finally, the adipose tissue with the lymph nodes in the area surrounded by the IMA, IMV, and LCA was dissected, with preservation of the LCA .</description>
