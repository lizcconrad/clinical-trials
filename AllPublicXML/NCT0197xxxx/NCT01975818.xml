    <textblock>
      Evaluate efficacy and safety of 16 weeks of titrated dose treatment with BAY85-3934 versus
      epoetin alfa/beta as measured by hemoglobin (Hb) levels. Fixed starting doses of 25, 50,75
      and 150 mg of BAY85-3934 titrated at the scheduled dose control visits. Titration will be
      based on the subject's Hb response and tolerability of the prior dose. Planned doses include
      15, 25, 50, 75, 100,150 and 200 mg/day
