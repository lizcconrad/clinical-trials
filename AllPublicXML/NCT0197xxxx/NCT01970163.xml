      The study will compare treatment with DermACELL to conventional care in diabetic foot ulcers
      (DFU) and venous stasis ulcers (VSU).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of DermACELL in the treatment of
      chronic wounds of the lower extremities. DermACELL will be compared to conventional care in
      both subjects with diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and subjects with venous stasis ulcers (VSU).
      In addition, DermACELL will be compared to an active comparator, GraftJacket, in subjects
      with diabetic foot ulcers.

      DermACELL and GraftJacket are both made from donated human skin (dermis). These products have
      been processed so that cells are removed and bacteria and viruses are destroyed. This
      processing provided a supporting structure, an acellular dermal matrix, into which cells can
      migrate and divide during the wound healing process.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of DermACELL on the proportion of chronic wounds of the lower extremity that have healed.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the comparison of the proportion of chronic wounds treated with DermACELL and treated with conventional care that have achieved 100% re-epithelialization without dressing or drainage requirements at 12 weeks. Wound closure is defined as first observation of 100% re-epithelialization without drainage or dressing requirements and complete wound closure is defined as 100% re-epithelialization without dressing or drainage requirements confirmed at two consecutive study visits 2 weeks apart.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of wounds closed at 12 weeks and weekly thereafter for up to 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects with closed wounds at 12 weeks and weekly thereafter will be compared in subjects treated with DermACELL, GraftJacket (Diabetic foot ulcer subjects only) and conventional care wound management. A comparison of the proportion of subjects who received a second application of acellular dermal matrix will be made between the DermACELL and GraftJacket arms in those subjects with diabetic foot ulcers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AE), changes in vital signs, ankle-brachial index (ABI) and physical examination findings.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Safety of the interventions will be measured by the incidence of treatment-emergent AEs, changes in vital signs, ABI and physical examination.</description>

    <intervention_name>Conventional Care Dressings</intervention_name>
    <description>Depending on the state of the wound (dry or moist), different types of nonadherent dressings would be utilized as the primary dressing:
If the wound is dry, a nonadherent dressing, such an oil emulsion dressing, may be appropriate, as these dressings tend to donate moisture to the wound.
Hydrogels can also be used if the wound is in need of moisture.
For a wound that is more moist, a more absorptive dressing may be more appropriate to help reduce potential for maceration.
A secondary dressing may be desired to add either loft or cushion.</description>
