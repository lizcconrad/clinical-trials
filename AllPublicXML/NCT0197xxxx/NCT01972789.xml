  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate and compare two individualised ranibizumab treatment regimens, differentiated by
      the definition of disease activity which determines the treatment interval until the next
      injection. The results will be used to generate further recommendations about intensive
      versus relaxed treatment approaches and how they can be utilised within an 'inject and
      extend' approach to maximise patient outcomes, while reducing the need for potentially
      unnecessary intravitreal injections. This study will also investigate genotypic expression
      and response to intravitreal injections of ranibizumab between the two treatment arms.

      The study hypothesis is that intravitreal ranibizumab when administered to resolve IRF only
      results in visual acuity benefit that is not clinically worse than intravitreal ranibizumab
      when administered to completely resolve both IRF and SRF in patients with wet AMD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of subfoveal CNV secondary to wet AMD without restriction of lesion size,
             with visual impairment being exclusively due to an active wet AMD lesion. Active
             lesions will be characterised by any of the following: abnormal retinal thickness,
             with evidence of intraretinal, subretinal or sub-pigment epithelial fluid
             accumulation, confirmed by OCT; presence of intraretinal or subretinal haemorrhage;
             new leakage shown on a FA; CNV enlargement on FA unless solely due to dry, fibrotic
             staining; visual acuity deterioration considered likely to represent CNV.

          2. BCVA score at both Screening and Baseline must be 23 letters or more as measured by
             the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) logMAR charts (a Snellen visual
             acuity or equivalent of 20/320 or more may be used as an alternative at Screening).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any active periocular or ocular infection or inflammation (e.g., blepharitis,
             conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, uveitis, endophthalmitis) at the time of
             Screening or Baseline.

          2. Uncontrolled glaucoma (intraocular pressure [IOP] ≥30 mm Hg on medication) at the time
             of Screening or Baseline.

          3. Neovascularisation of the iris or neovascular glaucoma at the time of Screening or
             Baseline.

          4. Visually significant cataract, aphakia, severe vitreous haemorrhage, rhegmatogenous
             retinal detachment, proliferative diabetic retinopathy or CNV of any cause other than
             wet AMD at the time of screening and baseline.

          5. Structural damage within 0.5 disc diameter of the centre of the macula (e.g.,
             vitreomacular traction, epiretinal membrane, scar, laser burn, foveal atrophy) at the
             time of screening that in the investigator's opinion could preclude visual function
             improvement with treatment.

          6. Treatment with any anti-angiogenic drugs (including any anti-VEGF agents) prior to
             Baseline in study eye (allowed in fellow eye).

          7. Any intraocular procedure (including Ytrium-Aluminium- Garnet capsulotomy) within 2
             months prior to Baseline or anticipated within the next 6 months following Baseline in
             th study eye (allowed in fellow eye).

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
