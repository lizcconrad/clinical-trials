      JointADventure: A worksite activity-diet intervention for chronic knee pain is a randomized
      controlled trial evaluation of a physical activity and nutritional worksite intervention to
      decrease symptoms and disability associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA), a major public
      health problem and a leading cause of work disability and work absenteeism/presenteeism in
      the US workforce.

      The overarching goal of this project is to find an effective and sustainable intervention
      strategy that can assist large populations of persons with or at risk for knee OA to attain
      and maintain healthy dietary and physical activity behaviors. This project has to potential
      to have a tremendous impact on improving symptoms and quality of life of persons with chronic
      knee pain and decreasing the functional limitation, work absenteeism/presenteeism, and
      soaring healthcare utilization associated with knee OA.

      We will utilize a partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois (BCBSIL), a highly
      supportive wellness partner, with a strong history of investment in the health of its
      employees and subscribers. The combined Activity/Dietary (AD) intervention is administered by
      health professionals trained in motivational interviewing as healthy lifestyle coaches.

      Over the first 6 months, the coaches provide:

        -  individualized counseling based on a comprehensive assessment of baseline clinical,
           functional and behavioral factors that are barriers to healthy physical activity and
           dietary behaviors

        -  group education, the content of which is modeled after the highly successful Diabetes
           Prevention Program physical activity/dietary intervention, and customized for those with
           knee symptoms.

      Follow-up assessments continue for 6 additional months.

      Specific aims are to:

        1. assess the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial of the JointADventure
           intervention at this worksite

        2. estimate the effectiveness of the intervention to decrease body weight, improve dietary
           habits, and increase objectively-measured physical activity

        3. to improve objectively measured functional performance

        4. to improve self-reported arthritis-specific and generic health status and health utility
