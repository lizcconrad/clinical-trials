      The aim of this study is to test the program's effectiveness in a primary care setting in
      reducing stigma among medical personnel, increasing the comfort level of physicians and staff
      in providing care to those living with mental illness, and in improving client well-being and
      mental health.

      Skill-based approaches are effective in reducing stigma in health professionals.

      Overview: The Nova Scotia (NS) Department of Health and Wellness and the Mental Health
      Commission of Canada launched a demonstration project in NSâ€”Adult Mental Health Practice
      Support Program. Originating in British Columbia (BC), it uses a novel learning platform
      which supports primary healthcare providers with treatment and management of mental illness.
      We hypothesized that enhanced skills in program participants would lead to increased comfort
      on the part of practitioners, diminished social distance and stigmatization; improved
      clinical outcomes and a reduction in healthcare costs.

      This evaluation has three co-primary objectives:

        -  To determine whether the Mental Health Practice Support Program (PSP) leads to lower
           levels of stigma among physicians participating in the program.

        -  To determine whether participation in the Mental Health PSP leads to lower levels of
           stigma among medical office assistants (MOAs)

        -  To determine whether participation of physicians in the Mental Health PSP leads to
           greater improvement in depressive symptom ratings among patients they are treating for
           depression, compared to treatment as usual.

      Two secondary objectives:

        -  To determine whether participation in the PSP leads to improved occupational functioning
           compared to treatment as usual.

        -  To assess the impact of participation in the Mental Health PSP on healthcare costs.

      Four exploratory objectives:

        -  To assess physicians' confidence and comfort in the management of depression treatment

        -  To determine whether physician participation int he Mental Health PSP is associated with
           a reduced frequency of antidepressant prescribing.

        -  To determine whether the patients of physicians participating in the Mental Health PSP
           report higher levels of satisfaction with the treatment that they receive.

        -  To determine whether patients participation in the Mental Health PSP is associated with
           improved quality of life.

      Methods: Seventy seven practices with one hundred and eleven community-based family
      physicians were recruited. Each practice was assigned a practice number. Each physician
      within the practice was assigned a unique identifier number. Individual practitioner or
      practice teams were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Randomization was
      stratified on the total number of physicians per practice, as well as urban or rural setting
      to ensure equal distribution of practice clusters and urban and rural groups. STATA, version
      12 [College Station, TX, 2012] to generate the sequence for practice [cluster] randomization.
      Random numbers were generated from a binomial distribution with a probability of success of
      0.5. Intervention group participants attended 3 half-day workshops with a &quot;6- week action
      period&quot; between workshops to practice learnings. Practice support was provided through
      diagnostic assessment tools, evidence based self-management tools, and on-site practice
      support coordinator support. A stigma-assessment tool, the Opening Minds Scale for Healthcare
      Providers (OMS-HC), was administered to both groups at intervention group pre-training, and
      post-training. Providers comfort and confidence in diagnosing and managing mental illness was
      also assessed, at comparable times.

      Upon completion of the intervention group training, physicians from both groups were asked to
      identify 3 consecutive evaluable patients. Patients were enrolled and allocated to
      intervention or control groups as per their associated physician.

    <measure>Depression Severity (Change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) Score From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 2, 3, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) covers nine symptom-based Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for major depressive disorder. Scores range from 0-27, with higher scores indicating more severe depression severity. We compared between-group mean differences of PHQ-9 scores during follow-up, assessed as a group-by-time interaction. We used a multi-level mixed model analysis: physicians clustered within practices, patients clustered within their corresponding physicians, and longitudinal PHQ-9 ratings clustered within patients. The four follow-up time points were represented by indicator variables. The effect of the intervention was measured as an intervention by time interaction, and the time-by-group interaction was assessed using a likelihood ratio test.</description>

    <measure>Between Group Changes in Total Score on the Opening Minds Scale for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Opening Minds Scale for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC) is a 15 item validated scale that also captures three main dimensions of stigma; negative attitudes, health professionals' own willingness to disclose/seek help for a mental illness, and preference for greater social distance. Items are rated on a 5-point scale: from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Total scores can range from 15 to 75 for the overall total score, 6 to 30, 4-29, 5-25 for sub-scales respectively. Total scores are averaged to result in mean scores range from 1 to 5 with lower scores indicating less stigma. This scale has been widely validated and used in evaluations of anti-stigma interventions in Canada. The analysis was conducted using a multi-level mixed model in which physicians were clustered within practices and stigma ratings were clustered within physicians (one or two observations per physician). The effect of the intervention was measured in this analysis as an intervention by time interaction.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 2, 3, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Lam's Employment Absence and Productivity Scale (LEAPS) is a 7 item scale that assesses workplace impact of major depression. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale with the following response format: none of the time (0%), some of the time (25%), half the time (50%), most of the time (75%), or all the time (100%), scored as 0-4, respectively. Total scores can range from 0-28 with lower scores indicating less disruption.We compared between-group mean differences of LEAPs scores during follow-up, assessed as a group-by-time interaction. We used a multi-level mixed model analysis: physicians clustered within practices, patients clustered within their corresponding physicians, and longitudinal LEAPs ratings clustered within patients. The four follow-up time points were represented by indicator variables. The effect of the intervention was measured as an intervention by time interaction, and the time-by-group interaction was assessed using a likelihood ratio test.</description>

        <title>Depression Severity (Change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) Score From Baseline</title>
        <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) covers nine symptom-based Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for major depressive disorder. Scores range from 0-27, with higher scores indicating more severe depression severity. We compared between-group mean differences of PHQ-9 scores during follow-up, assessed as a group-by-time interaction. We used a multi-level mixed model analysis: physicians clustered within practices, patients clustered within their corresponding physicians, and longitudinal PHQ-9 ratings clustered within patients. The four follow-up time points were represented by indicator variables. The effect of the intervention was measured as an intervention by time interaction, and the time-by-group interaction was assessed using a likelihood ratio test.</description>

An intra cluster correlation of 0.05 for patient outcomes was used (Murphey et al), and an average cluster size: 3 patients/practice resulted in compensatory increase to 110 patients per arm. Under the assumption that attrition would be 33 % we needed 166 patients per arm.</groups_desc>

        <title>Between Group Changes in Total Score on the Opening Minds Scale for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC)</title>
        <description>The Opening Minds Scale for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC) is a 15 item validated scale that also captures three main dimensions of stigma; negative attitudes, health professionalsâ€™ own willingness to disclose/seek help for a mental illness, and preference for greater social distance. Items are rated on a 5-point scale: from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Total scores can range from 15 to 75 for the overall total score, 6 to 30, 4-29, 5-25 for sub-scales respectively. Total scores are averaged to result in mean scores range from 1 to 5 with lower scores indicating less stigma. This scale has been widely validated and used in evaluations of anti-stigma interventions in Canada. The analysis was conducted using a multi-level mixed model in which physicians were clustered within practices and stigma ratings were clustered within physicians (one or two observations per physician). The effect of the intervention was measured in this analysis as an intervention by time interaction.</description>

        <description>Lamâ€™s Employment Absence and Productivity Scale (LEAPS) is a 7 item scale that assesses workplace impact of major depression. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale with the following response format: none of the time (0%), some of the time (25%), half the time (50%), most of the time (75%), or all the time (100%), scored as 0-4, respectively. Total scores can range from 0-28 with lower scores indicating less disruption.We compared between-group mean differences of LEAPs scores during follow-up, assessed as a group-by-time interaction. We used a multi-level mixed model analysis: physicians clustered within practices, patients clustered within their corresponding physicians, and longitudinal LEAPs ratings clustered within patients. The four follow-up time points were represented by indicator variables. The effect of the intervention was measured as an intervention by time interaction, and the time-by-group interaction was assessed using a likelihood ratio test.</description>

        <description>A modified version of a British Columbia (BC) developed survey, Practice Support Program Preâ€“Post Learning Module Questionnaire was used. Physicians were also asked to rate their level of familiarity, confidence and comfort with a variety of non-program specific mental health tools and skills for assisting patients with mental health concerns (e.g., CBIS manual, electronic hyperlinked mental health algorithm, Bounce Back program DVD, referrals for Bounce Back telephone coaching, ASW and coaching skills, Diagnostic Assessment Interview, Problem List Action Plan, CBIS resource list, CBIS skills handout, Family Physician Guide, and medication algorithm). Physician confidence was measured on a three point scale ranging from â€˜very confidentâ€™ to â€˜not at all confident. Mean scores were averaged and can range from one to three, with lower mean scores indicating higher levels of comfort, confidence and familiarity. Cronbachâ€™s alpha was .98 at pre-test and .98 at post-test</description>

        <title>Between Goup Change in Client Satisfaction Inventory (CSI) From Baseline to 6 Months</title>
        <description>The CSI is a 25-item scale to measure the degree or magnitude of client satisfaction with care received. Responses range from 1 to 7. Total raw scores range from 0 to 175, with higher scores representing higher levels of satisfaction. Total scores were averaged reducing the overall score to a 7-point scale. We compared between-group mean differences of CSI scores during follow-up, assessed as a group-by-time interaction. We used a multi-level mixed model analysis: physicians clustered within practices, patients clustered within their corresponding physicians, and longitudinal CSI ratings clustered within patients. The four follow-up time points were represented by indicator variables. The effect of the intervention was measured as an intervention by time interaction, and the time-by-group interaction was assessed using a likelihood ratio test.</description>

        <title>Between Group Change in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)</title>
        <description>The SDS is a visual analog scale which asks respondents to rate from 0-10 the extent to which symptoms have disputed: a: work/school work; b) social life/leisure activities; c) family life/home responsibilities. Total scores can range from 0-30, with lower scores indicating less disruption. We ompared between-group mean differences of SDS scores during follow-up, assessed as a group-by-time interaction. We used a multi-level mixed model analysis: physicians clustered within practices, patients clustered within their corresponding physicians, and longitudinal SDS ratings clustered within patients. The four follow-up time points were represented by indicator variables. The effect of the intervention was measured as an intervention by time interaction, and the time-by-group interaction was assessed using a likelihood ratio test.</description>
