  <brief_title>THE GIRAFFE Study: Genomic Risk Markers for Atrial Fibrillation Following Extended Cardiac Rhythm Monitoring</brief_title>
  <acronym>GIRAFFE</acronym>
  <official_title>This Study Will Investigate the Association Between a Set of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and Atrial Fibrillation in Patients at High Risk of Developing Atrial Fibrillation. The SNPs Investigated Will Have Been Previously Shown to be Associated With the Atrial Fibrillation.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary hypothesis is that a risk score comprised of approximately 10 single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with atrial fibrillation at the Genome Wide
      Association Study (GWAS) level is associated with the development of atrial fibrillation
      among previously undiagnosed patients at high risk for atrial fibrillation. A current example
      of these SNPs is shown in Table 1. As a secondary hypothesis, we will test the association
      between atrial fibrillation diagnosed in this study with a subset of SNPs reported to be
      associated with atrial fibrillation and with fine-mapping SNPs. We will also test the
      association between atrial fibrillation of less than and greater than 30 seconds and a panel
      of approximately 10 SNPs.

    <description>SNP effect sizes and frequencies were determined from the literature and the International HapMap Project database as indicated in Table 1. Expected occurrences of atrial fibrillation in the two groups were calculated using reference to previous studies as outlined above [7, 8, 33]. We expect 80 atrial fibrillation events in a 650 high-risk patients [48, 49]. Using these event rates and an alpha error of 5%, the power to detect an association between a 10-SNPs risk score and atrial fibrillation is &gt;90%. The power to detect association between a 4-SNP risk score and atrial fibrillation is &gt;80%.</description>
