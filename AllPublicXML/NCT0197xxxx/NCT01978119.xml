  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, two way cross-over, 12 week
      non inferiority study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of FSC 250/50 mcg
      capsule-based inhaler and FSC 250/50 mcg multi-dose inhaler each administered BID in adults
      and adolescents with asthma. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that FSC
      250/50 mcg administered BID by capsule-based inhaler is non-inferior compared to FSC 250/50
      mcg administered BID by multi-dose inhaler . The study consists of six phases: Pre-screening,
      Screening/Run-in (3 weeks), Treatment Period 1 (12 weeks), Washout (minimum 3 weeks),
      Treatment Period 2 (12 weeks) and Follow-up (1 week). The total duration of the study for
      each subject will be at least 31 weeks.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Trough Morning Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Day 85</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The trough FEV1 is defined as morning prebronchodilator and predose (12 hours after the last evening dose Day 84). Trough FEV1 was measured electronically by spirometer in the morning, before using the bronchodilator and predose, at Week 12 (Day 85) of each Treatment Period. Baseline was defined as the value obtained predose (0 minutes) on day 1 in each treatment period. Change from Baseline within each period was calculated as trough FEV1 at Day 85 minus the period specific Baseline value. The change from Baseline in trough FEV1 was analysed using Mixed Model for Repeated Measures analysis, having fixed effect Participant level Baseline, Adjusted period-specific Baseline, Treatment group, Period, Visit, Visit by treatment, Visit by Participant level Baseline, Visit by Adjusted period-specific Baseline, with participant as a random effect.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Morning Trough FEV1 at Day 28 and Day 56</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 28, and Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, a measure of lung function, and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 measurements were taken electronically by spirometry at predose (Baseline), on Days 28 and 56 of each Treatment Period. Baseline was defined as the value obtained predose (0 minutes) on Day 1of each Treatment Period. Change from Baseline within each period was calculated as trough FEV1 at Day 28 and 56 minus the period specific Baseline value.The change from Baseline in trough FEV1 at Day 28 and Day 56 was analysed via the primary analysis model. Least Squares mean values for the change from Baseline in trough FEV1 at Day 28 and Day 56 were obtained from the primary analysis model (for each treatment and for the treatment difference), and displayed alongside corresponding 95% confidence intervals.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline (BL) in Morning Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) Over 12 Weeks (From Paper Diary Card) for Each Treatment Period(TP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Day 85 of each Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>The PEFR is a paricipant's(par) maximum speed of expiration, as measured with a peak flow meter(PFM). All par were issued a PFM and instructed to perform the activity in triplicate in the morning prior to taking the bronchodilator. The best among the 3 readings was selected. Efficacy measurement was recorded by the par in the paper Diary Card for morning PEFR. The total PEFR over the 12 week TP was divided by the number of days with non-missing PEFR data to obtain an average for each par. Change from BL in average morning PEFR is the difference over 12 weeks for each TP compared to BL. BL is the average of the last 4 available recorded values during the last 7 days of the Screening Period (for TP 1) and of the Washout Period (for TP 2). The change from BL in the PEFR averaged over the 12-week TP was analysed using a mixed effects ANCOVA model with participant level BL PEFR, adjusted period-specific BL PEFR, treatment group, and period as fixed effects, and par as a random effect.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline (BL) in Rescue Medication Use Over 12 Weeks (From Paper Diary Card) for Each Treatment Period (TP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Day 85 of each Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>Rescue medication usage for each 24-hour period is defined as the total numbers of puffs of Salbutamol/Albuterol within 24 hours (i.e. number taken during the day and number taken during the night). The total usage over the 12 week TP was divided by the number of days with nonmissing rescue medication data to get an average usage per participant. BL is the average of the last 4 available recorded values during the last 7 days of the Screening Period (for TP 1) and of the Washout Period (for TP 2). Change from BL in average usage of rescue medication was the difference over 12 weeks for each TP compared to BL. The change from BL in the percentage of rescue medication use averaged over the 12-week TP was analysed using mixed effects ANCOVA model, with par level BL rescue medication use, adjusted period-specific BL rescue medication use, treatment group and period as fixed effects and par as a random effect.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Day 85 of each Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>AM Sy scores were recorded nightly on PDC using the scale:0=No Sy during day,1=Sy for one short period during day,2=Sy for two or more short periods during day,3=Sy for most of day-not affecting normal daily activities,4=Sy for most of day-did affect normal daily activities,5=Sy so severe-could not go to work or perform normal daily activities. Similarly, PM Sy scores were recorded every morning using the scale:0=No Sy during night,1=Sy causing me to wake once(or early),2=Sy causing me to wake twice or more(or early),3=Sy causing me to be awake most of night,4=Sy severe-did not sleep. BL= average of last 4 available of the last 7 days of Screening Period(TP 1) and of Washout Period(TP 2). Change from BL in average of daily scores=difference over 12 wks for each TP compared to BL. AM and PM Sy Scores were separately averaged over each of the two 12-wk TP. Total value of each endpoint over 12-wk TP was divided by number of days with non-missing data to obtain an average for each subject</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Symptom-Free Days From Paper Diary Card Over 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Day 85 of each Treatment Period</time_frame>
    <description>A Symptom-Free day was defined as a 24-hour period with no symptoms recorded. Percentage of Symptom-Free Days was calculated dividing number of Symptom-Free days by the length of the Treatment Period. The baseline value of change from baseline in % of symptom free days is defined as an average of the last 7 available recorded values the Screening Period (for treatment period 1) and of the Washout Period (for treatment period 2). Change from Baseline was the difference in percentage of Symptom-Free days at week 12 compared to Baseline. The change from Baseline in the percentage of Symptom-Free days averaged over the 12-week Treatment Period was analyzed, using mixed effects ANCOVA model, with participant level Baseline percentage of Symptom-Free days, adjusted period-specific Baseline percentage of Symptom-Free days, treatment group and period as fixed effects and participant as a random effect.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female &gt;=12 and &lt;=80 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

          -  Non-childbearing potential defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal
             ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone &gt;40 milli international unit per milliliter (mIU/mL) and
             oestradiol &lt;40 picogram (pg)/mL [&lt;147 picomole per liter (pmol/L)] is confirmatory);
             Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt
             will be required to use one of the contraception methods (i.e., in accordance with the
             approved product label and the instructions of the physician for the duration of the
             study from Screening to follow-up contact) if they wish to continue their HRT during
             the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             postmenopausal status before study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4
             weeks should elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval
             depends on the type and dosage of HRT. After confirmation of their postmenopausal
             status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive
             method; child-bearing potential and is abstinent or agrees to use one of the
             contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product
             label or investigator) before the start of dosing to sufficiently minimise the risk of
             pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until at
             least 2 days post the last dose of study treatment; abstinence from penile-vaginal
             intercourse must be consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

          -  Severity of disease: A best prebronchodilator FEV1 of &gt;=40% to &lt;=85% of the predicted
             normal value at Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit). Predicted values will be based
             upon National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III. If a subject is
             recorded as having Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, then the Mexican-American equations
             will be used (irrespective of race). If a subject is recorded as being of
             African-American/African heritage race, then the African American equations will be
             used. If a subject is recorded as being of Asian race, then the Asian adjustment will
             be used. Otherwise, the Caucasian equations will be used.

          -  Reversibility of disease: Demonstrated &gt;=12% and &gt;=200 mL reversibility of FEV1 within
             10 to 40 minutes after 2 to 4 inhalations of salbutamol inhalation aerosol (or
             equivalent nebulised treatment with salbutamol solution) at Visit 1 (Screening and
             Run-in Visit).

          -  Current anti-asthma therapy: All subjects must be using an Inhaled Corticosteroid
             (ICS) with or without long-acting beta-adrenergic agonist (LABA) for at least 8 weeks
             and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit).
             Two populations are eligible for enrolment: - Subjects maintained on ICS monotherapy
             (FP 100 mcg to 250 mcg BID or equivalent) for at least 8 weeks and a stable dose for
             at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit) or Subjects maintained on
             an ICS/LABA combination product (e.g., Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 100/50 or
             250/50 mcg BID or equivalent by other combination products or by separate inhalers)
             for at least 8 weeks and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening
             and Run-in Visit). Subjects taking budesonide/formoterol or beclomethasone/formoterol
             as needed must switch to budesonide/formoterol maintenance dosing (excluding the
             highest dose) with use of a SABA for symptom relief at least 8 weeks and a stable dose
             for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit). NOTE: Subjects on
             low dose ICS monotherapy should only be enrolled, if, in the opinion of the
             investigator, after review of their medical history and clinical examination, they
             will be able to benefit from both an increase in ICS dose and the addition of LABA
             therapy arising from and ICS/LABA combination.

          -  Ability to withhold LABA therapy: Other than what is provided during the study, LABA
             therapy is not permitted on the day of Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit) and
             throughout the entire study. The last dose of LABA and LABA/ICS combinations are to be
             taken on the day before Visit 1. Sites should contact the medical monitor to discuss
             subject eligibility, for doses of commonly prescribed ICS and ICS/LABA combination
             medication; as mentioned in the study protocol.

          -  SABA: All subjects must be able to replace their current SABA treatment with rescue
             salbutamol/albuterol at Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit) for use as needed for the
             duration of the study. Subjects must be able to withhold salbutamol/albuterol for at
             least 6 hours before each study visit.

          -  Liver safety criteria: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;=2 the upper limit of normal
             (ULN), Alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5 ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5 ULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin is &lt;35%) at Visit 1
             (Screening and Run-in Visit).

          -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) safety criteria: The subject must have no ECG abnormalities
             that would, in the opinion of investigator, compromise subject safety, or
             significantly affect subject's ability to complete the trial. As such, the
             investigator will determine the clinical significance of any ECG abnormality and
             determine if a subject is precluded from entering the study. At Visit 1 (Screening and
             Run-in Visit), ECG safety criteria must be: QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc)
             or QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia formula (QTcF) &lt;450
             msec or QTc &lt;480 msec for subjects with bundle branch block; Investigators will be
             responsible for ensuring appropriate clinical interpretation of ECGs.

          -  The subject and/or the subject's legal guardian (if applicable) must be capable of
             giving informed consent/assent, which includes compliance with the study requirements
             and restrictions listed in the consent/assent form.

             treatment, such as: anticonvulsants (barbiturates, hydantoins, carbamazepine);
             polycyclic antidepressants; beta-adrenergic blocking agents; phenothiazines; and
             monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors

          -  Immunosuppressive medications: A subject must not be using or require use of
             immunosuppressive medications during the study

          -  Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors: Subjects who have received a potent CYP3A4
             inhibitor within 4 weeks of Visit 1(Screening and Run-in Visit) (e.g., ritonavir,
             ketoconazole, itraconazole)

          -  Subject is unable to refrain from the use of prescription or non-prescription drugs,
             including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's wort) within 7
             days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or five half-lives
             (whichever is longer) before the first dose of study treatment, unless in the opinion
             of the investigator and medical monitor the medication will not interfere with the
             study procedures or compromise subject safety

          -  Any subjects that have previously received or are currently receiving omalizumab

          -  Use of the excluded medications are included in the study protocol

          -  Compliance: A subject will not be eligible if he/she or his/her parent or legal
             guardian has any infirmity, disability, disease, or geographical location that seems
             likely (in the opinion of the investigator) to impair compliance with any aspect of
             this study protocol, including visit schedule and completion of the daily diaries

          -  Tobacco use: Current smoker or a smoking history of ≥10 pack-years (e.g., 20
             cigarettes/day for 10 years). A subject must not have used inhaled tobacco products
             within the past 3 months (e.g., cigarettes, cigars or pipe tobacco). One pack year is
             defined as 20 manufactured cigarettes (1 pack) smoked per day for 1 year

          -  Pregnant females as determined by urine test at Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit)
             or predosing. A confirmatory serum pregnancy test is required if the urine test is

             government or a government body, acting in accordance with powers conferred on them by
             law or regulation. The definition of a CiC can include a child cared for by foster
             parents or living in a care home or institution, provided that the arrangement falls
             within the definition above. The determination of whether a child meets the definition
             of CiC should be made with the study centre staff in consultation with the responsible
             institutional review board (IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC).

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Trough Morning Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Day 85</title>
        <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The trough FEV1 is defined as morning prebronchodilator and predose (12 hours after the last evening dose Day 84). Trough FEV1 was measured electronically by spirometer in the morning, before using the bronchodilator and predose, at Week 12 (Day 85) of each Treatment Period. Baseline was defined as the value obtained predose (0 minutes) on day 1 in each treatment period. Change from Baseline within each period was calculated as trough FEV1 at Day 85 minus the period specific Baseline value. The change from Baseline in trough FEV1 was analysed using Mixed Model for Repeated Measures analysis, having fixed effect Participant level Baseline, Adjusted period-specific Baseline, Treatment group, Period, Visit, Visit by treatment, Visit by Participant level Baseline, Visit by Adjusted period-specific Baseline, with participant as a random effect.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (BL) in Morning Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) Over 12 Weeks (From Paper Diary Card) for Each Treatment Period(TP)</title>
        <description>The PEFR is a paricipant’s(par) maximum speed of expiration, as measured with a peak flow meter(PFM). All par were issued a PFM and instructed to perform the activity in triplicate in the morning prior to taking the bronchodilator. The best among the 3 readings was selected. Efficacy measurement was recorded by the par in the paper Diary Card for morning PEFR. The total PEFR over the 12 week TP was divided by the number of days with non-missing PEFR data to obtain an average for each par. Change from BL in average morning PEFR is the difference over 12 weeks for each TP compared to BL. BL is the average of the last 4 available recorded values during the last 7 days of the Screening Period (for TP 1) and of the Washout Period (for TP 2). The change from BL in the PEFR averaged over the 12-week TP was analysed using a mixed effects ANCOVA model with participant level BL PEFR, adjusted period-specific BL PEFR, treatment group, and period as fixed effects, and par as a random effect.</description>

        <description>A Symptom-Free day was defined as a 24-hour period with no symptoms recorded. Percentage of Symptom-Free Days was calculated dividing number of Symptom-Free days by the length of the Treatment Period. The baseline value of change from baseline in % of symptom free days is defined as an average of the last 7 available recorded values the Screening Period (for treatment period 1) and of the Washout Period (for treatment period 2). Change from Baseline was the difference in percentage of Symptom-Free days at week 12 compared to Baseline. The change from Baseline in the percentage of Symptom-Free days averaged over the 12-week Treatment Period was analyzed, using mixed effects ANCOVA model, with participant level Baseline percentage of Symptom-Free days, adjusted period-specific Baseline percentage of Symptom-Free days, treatment group and period as fixed effects and participant as a random effect.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Symptom-Free Days From Paper Diary Card Over 12 Weeks</title>
          <description>A Symptom-Free day was defined as a 24-hour period with no symptoms recorded. Percentage of Symptom-Free Days was calculated dividing number of Symptom-Free days by the length of the Treatment Period. The baseline value of change from baseline in % of symptom free days is defined as an average of the last 7 available recorded values the Screening Period (for treatment period 1) and of the Washout Period (for treatment period 2). Change from Baseline was the difference in percentage of Symptom-Free days at week 12 compared to Baseline. The change from Baseline in the percentage of Symptom-Free days averaged over the 12-week Treatment Period was analyzed, using mixed effects ANCOVA model, with participant level Baseline percentage of Symptom-Free days, adjusted period-specific Baseline percentage of Symptom-Free days, treatment group and period as fixed effects and participant as a random effect.</description>

        <description>The ACT is a 5-item questionnaire with a score of 1 to 5 for each item (1=poor control and 5=good control). The scores from each question were added to give an overall score. Baseline was defined as the value obtained predose (0 minutes) on day 1 of each Treatment Period. Change from Baseline was the difference in ACT score at the timepoint compared to Baseline score. The change from Baseline in overall ACT score was analysed, using mixed effects ANCOVA model, with participant level Baseline overall ACT score, adjusted period-specific Baseline overall ACT score, treatment group and period as fixed effects and participant as a random effect.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Percentage (%) of Rescue-free Days Over 12 Weeks (From Paper Diary Card) for Each Treatment Period(TP)</title>
        <description>A rescue-free day is defined as a 24-hour period with no rescue medication usage recorded (i.e. both the day-time and night-time numbers of puffs of Salbutamol/Albuterol are zero). Percentage of Rescue-Free Days was calculated over each 12-week Treatment Period, dividing the number of rescue-free days by the length of the TP. The BL value of change from BL in % rescue free days is defined as an average of the last 7 available recorded values the Screening Period (for treatment period 1) and of the Washout Period (for treatment period 2). Change from BL was the difference over 12 weeks for each treatment period compared to BL. The change from BL in the % of rescue medication-free days averaged over the 12-week TP was analyzed, using mixed effects ANCOVA model, with par level BL % of rescue-free days, adjusted period-specific BL % of rescue-free days treatment group and period as fixed effects and par as a random effect.</description>
