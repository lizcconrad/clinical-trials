      The primary objective of the study is to assess the time to progression (TTP) in patients
      with advanced HCC treated with Icaritin .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Icaritin is a newly discovered small molecular compound which is high selective ERa36
      modulators ,the preclinical PK&amp;PD and toxicity studies showed it can inhibit the growth of
      HCC cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, combining clinical data perhaps it will be a very
      promising new drug to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by targeting this nongenomic
      pathway. Shenogen decided to further investigate the efficacy and safety of Icaritin and to
      explore potential gene targets for treating HCC.

      The results of phase I study showed Icaritin has good safety and tolerance. The biological
      availability of Icaritin after meal is high and the half-life is relatively short.

      The phase Ib study enrolled 28 subjects. Among the 18 HCC subjects, 12 subjects received
      treatment in the oral administration group with 600 mg once, twice per day, after meal 30
      minutes, 6 subjects received treatment in the oral administration group with 800 mg once,
      twice per day, after meal 30 minutes. The results showed that in the 600mg group there are 12
      HCC patients whose therapeutic efficacy is evaluable now, one case of PR (10%), 5 cases of SD
      (50%) and 4 cases of PD (40%) were observed.Safety data showed that totally 24 AEs are
      probably related to investigational drug. Among them, 19 AEs are grade I, 5 AEs are grade II,
      no grade III or above AE.

    <description>OS: This is defined as the time from the date of first study dose to the date of death, regardless of the cause of death. Patients who were alive at the time of the analysis will be censored at the date of the last follow up assessment. Patients without follow up assessment will be censored at the day of last dose and patients with no post baseline information will be censored at the time of first study dose. Overall survival is defined as the length of time from first dose of treatment until death. It will be analyzed in the same way as TTP.</description>
