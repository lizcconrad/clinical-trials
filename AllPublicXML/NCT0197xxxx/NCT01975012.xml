  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Development of tolerable and effective antiretroviral (ARV) drugs for use in children and
      adolescents remains a high priority. First-line therapy with non-nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) has proven to be effective for HIV-1-infected infants,
      children, and adolescents. This study will evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and dosing
      levels of the NNRTI rilpivirine (RPV) when given with two other ARV drugs in treatment-naive,
      HIV-1-infected children less than 12 years of age.

    <textblock>
      This study will enroll HIV-1-infected children less than 12 years of age who are naive to
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) (have never taken ARV drugs). Study participants will be
      assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts based on age. Cohort 1 will include children at least 6 years of
      age to less than 12 years of age. Cohort 2 will include children at least 2 years of age to
      less than 6 years of age. Each cohort will consist of two stages: Stage 1 and Stage 2. Stage
      1 will be the initial dose finding stage. Participants will begin treatment with daily RPV
      and 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The 2 NRTIs will be selected by
      the site investigator but will not be provided through the study. This stage of the study
      will involve intense pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      antiviral activity of RPV, which will allow for the selection of an RPV dose to use in Stage
      2 of the study. Participants in both cohorts will remain on RPV-based therapy for up to 48
      weeks.

      Study enrollment will begin with Cohort 1. Once data from Cohort 1 has been reviewed and an
      RPV dose has been approved, enrollment for Cohort 2 will begin.

      Study participation will include at least 12 study visits over 48 weeks. Participants who
      complete 48 weeks of RPV treatment and are benefiting from the drug will continue on the
      study and receive RPV as part of a long-term safety follow-up for a minimum of 4 additional
      years. Study visits in this stage of the study will occur every 24 weeks.

      At most visits, participants will give a medical history and undergo a physical exam, blood
      collection, and urine collection. At some visits, participants will also undergo an
      electrocardiogram (ECG), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test (consisting of
      blood collection and an injection of ACTH), and determination of the participant's stage of
      sexual development.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria - Stage 1, Step 1 and Stage 2

          -  A confirmed HIV-1 infection. More information on this criterion can be found in the
             protocol.

          -  Participant has never been treated with an HIV vaccine

          -  No evidence of prior ARV drug use with the exception of prior use of zidovudine (AZT)
             for up to 6 weeks to prevent mother-to-child transmission

          -  HIV-1 plasma viral load (VL) at screening greater than 500 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL but
             less than or equal to 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL (assayed by RNA polymerase chain
             reaction [PCR] standard specimen procedure) Note: Participants may be re-screened once
             only, if their baseline VL does not meet the entry criteria.

          -  In the judgment of the investigator, it is appropriate to initiate ARV therapy based
             on the participant's medical condition and taking into account guidelines for the
             treatment of HIV-1 infection in children

          -  Results from the genotypic resistance testing at screening demonstrate sensitivity to
             the selected NRTIs for the chosen background regimen

          -  Able to swallow whole tablets (Cohort 1 initial dose only)

          -  Female participants who are of childbearing potential and who are engaging in sexual
             activity that could lead to pregnancy, must use two adequate birth control methods
             while on study and for 4 weeks after stopping study drug. More information on this
             criterion can be found in the protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria - Stage 1, Step 2

          -  Participants belonging to a cohort that failed Stage 1 Step 1 initial dose that meet
             the following criteria (as determined by the study team): Are able to have an
             adjustment in study drug dose (and the new dose would not exceed 25 mg) and appear to
             have room to stay within therapeutic range on the new dose

        Exclusion Criteria - Stage 1, Step 1 and Stage 2

          -  Having documented genotypic evidence of RPV resistance. More information on this
             criterion can be found in the protocol.

          -  Documented evidence of infection during breastfeeding by a mother taking NNRTI-based
             ART. If there are no data or no history available then the participant would be
             eligible as long as all other inclusion and exclusion criteria are fulfilled.

          -  Documented evidence of maternal NNRTI use during pregnancy. If there are no data or no
             history available then the participant would be eligible as long as all other
             inclusion and exclusion criteria are fulfilled.

          -  Previously documented HIV-2 infection in participant or participant's mother. If there

             to entry or is anticipated to need chronic systemic immunosuppressive agents during
             the study. Short courses of systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone or equivalent
             up to 2 mg/kg/day for less than or equal to 7 days) are permitted, as long as the use
             was greater than 30 days prior to entry; B) participant has used both chronic inhaled
