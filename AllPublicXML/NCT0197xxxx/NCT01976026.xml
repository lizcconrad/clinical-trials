  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the DIVERT study is to provide a prudent, controlled clinical context for the
      use of flow diversion, a promising option of yet unproven benefit, in the care of patients
      with acute blood blister-like and dissecting intradural aneurysms. Hence DIVERT is a simple,
      multicenter, randomized trial integrated into daily practice. DIVERT addresses the clinical
      dilemma of whether the use of PED FD truly is a safe and effective alternative to best
      standard treatment, defined as conventional methods of treatment or in some cases,
      observation. Selection criteria are few, to facilitate the recruitment of most affected
      patients confronted with these difficult aneurysms that their physician judges suitable for
      PED FD. The trial does not obstruct clinical care, does not include extra tests or risks
      beyond what is necessary and proven beneficial. Endpoints are simple, clinical, meaningful,
      valuable and resistant to bias. Follow-up visits and tests are &quot;routine', imposing no extra
      burden on clinical transactions. Data is collected in simple case-report forms filled by
      physicians.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ruptured blood blister-like (BB) and dissecting vertebral aneurysms are infrequent but
      devastating causes of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), prone to acute rebleeding with poor
      clinical outcomes despite current surgical or endovascular treatment. Flow diversion (PED FD)
      with the Pipeline Endovascular Device (PED) is a promising treatment alternative to
      conventional management options.

      The DIVERT trial is designed to provide a prudent, controlled clinical framework for offering
      the PED FD , a promising yet unproven option in the care of patients with acute blood
      blister-like or dissecting vertebral aneurysms. DIVERT is a care trial, designed as a simple,
      pragmatic, multicenter, randomized trial integrated into daily practice with inclusive
      selection criteria.

      The investigators hypothesize that PED FD can decrease poor outcomes from 30 to 15%, compared
      to 'best standard treatment' (BST). BST is chosen prior to randomization amongst 4 options:
      observation, coiling with or without stenting, parent vessel occlusion or surgical clipping
      or wrapping. Patients are enrolled within 48 hours of SAH using standard 1:1 randomization
      between PED FD and BST after informed consent has been obtained from the patient or surrogate
      decision maker(s). Patients for whom no other option than PED FD appears feasible and safe
      will be included in a registry conducted alongside the trial.

      Blister-like aneurysms and intradural dissections presenting with SAH have a high propensity
      for rebleeding and outcomes are poor in approximately one third of the cases, despite
      treatment using surgical or endovascular techniques.

    <description>Endovascular treatment with flow diversion, including standard management of thrombo-embolic risk. The goal of the treatment procedure is (as usual) to prevent rebleeding, while keeping treatment-related risks as low as possible.
This trial permits the interventionist or surgeon to use any device, technique or drug judged important to the safety and success of the endovascular or surgical procedure, at his/her discretion at any time during the procedure. It is imperative that the allocated procedure is conducted in the safest possible manner. The interventionist or surgeon may switch to an alternative BST or cross-over to the alternative treatment group, if it is in the best interest of the patient.</description>

Choice of best option is based on the location, anatomy, and particular circumstances, before randomization for this patient's aneurysm.
