    <textblock>
      Bladder pain and discomfort, as well as urinary urgency and frequency, are bothersome
      symptoms seen frequently in the general population. Clinical diagnostic terms used to
      describe these symptoms include interstitial cystitis (IC), bladder pain syndrome (BPS),
      chronic prostatitis, and overactive bladder (OAB), but there is tremendous overlap between
      these entities, and the distinction between them is based more on eminence than evidence.

      Pain and/or sensory sensitivity has been suspected to play a role in the pathogenesis of both
      bladder pain and urinary urgency/frequency. However, no previous studies have investigated
      whether entities such as IC/BPS and OAB might merely represent different points in a
      continuum of bladder sensory sensitivity. Moreover, we know of no studies that have directly
      compared sensory sensitivity in the bladder to global (i.e. CNS-mediated) sensory
      sensitivity.

      In the study, a team of investigators with complementary expertise will perform a
      population-based study assessing bladder and overall sensory sensitivity, in a cohort of
      women representative of the population with respect to the entire continuum of bladder pain
      (from none to severe), and symptoms of urgency/frequency. These individuals will undergo
      urodynamics to measure sensory sensitivity in the bladder, as well as pressure pain and
      auditory loudness thresholds. The Specific Aims are to demonstrate: 1) sensory sensitivity in
      the bladder is related to sensory sensitivity elsewhere in the body, suggesting a CNS-driven
      mechanism, and 2) individuals in the population with greater global sensory sensitivity will
      display: a) more bladder pain, b) more urgency/frequency, and c) other symptoms of
      centrally-mediated pain states, such as pain in regions other than the bladder, fatigue, and
      insomnia.

        Group 1 will be women with a clinical diagnosis of IC/BPS or OAB, at least 18 years of age,
        who have had urodynamic testing performed within the preceding 6 months. All of these
        subjects will complete the questionnaires, mechanical sensitivity testing, and auditory
        sensitivity testing

        Group 2 will be women recruited from the community sample, at least 18 years of age. All of
        these subjects will complete the questionnaires, mechanical sensitivity testing, and
        auditory sensitivity testing. Half of the subjects (n=30) will also undergo urodynamic
        testing to measure bladder sensitivity.
