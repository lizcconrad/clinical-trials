  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this is study is to assess the efficacy of pre-operative intravitreal
      bevacizumab (IVB) (Genentech, South San Francisco CA) in improving visual acuity, reducing
      operative time, complications, intra-operative and post-operative hemorrhage following small
      gauge pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) (23-gauge, 25-gauge or 27-gauge ) compared to small gauge
      PPV (23-gauge, 25-gauge or 27-gauge) alone in eyes with tractional retinal detachment (TRD)
      secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Hypothesis: Preoperative IVB may be
      beneficial for membrane dissection in diabetic tractional retinal detachment with minimally
      invasive vitreoretinal surgery (23-gauge transconjunctival sutureless vitrectomy [TSV]). In
      addition, post-operative rebleeding may be decreased.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, randomized, active-controlled study of 374 eyes of patients with
      the diagnosis of TRD secondary to PDR. Participants will be screened for eligibility.
      Eligible patients will be examined at baseline to determine their ocular condition and
      randomized into 2 arms. Patients will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to the study arm.

        1. Control arm: PPV without pre-operative bevacizumab (Sham injection).

        2. Study arm: Pre-operative bevacizumab (3-5 days) before PPV.

      In the study arm, an intravitreal bevacizumab injection at a dose of 1.25 µg/0.05 mL will be
      scheduled 3 to 5 days before minimally invasive vitreoretinal surgery (MIVS).

      The purpose of the current study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of an
      intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg of bevacizumab as a pre-operative adjunct to PPV in eyes
      with TRD secondary to PDR.

             investigator, might affect retinal status or alter visual acuity during the course of
             the study (e.g., retinal vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease,
             glaucoma, etc.)

          4. History of treatment for diabetic macular edema or diabetic retinopathy at any time in
             the past 4 months with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs.

          9. An ocular condition is present (other than diabetes) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might affect retinal status or including hypertension, cardiovascular
             disease, and glycemic control.

        Systemic Exclusion Criteria

        A participant is not eligible if any of the following exclusion criteria are present:
