  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the extent to which the Prosigna™ Breast
      Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay affects the medical oncologist's treatment
      recommendations regarding adjuvant chemotherapy and actual treatments received for patients
      with early-stage breast cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Changes in treatment recommendations will include (1) hormonal therapy alone, (2) hormonal
      therapy plus chemotherapy, and (3) changes in types of chemotherapy if chemotherapy was
      recommended before and after the test.
