  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among all patients hospitalized for Threatened Premature Delivery (TPD), the rate of
      premature birth (PB) before 37 weeks is about 42%, which reflects the inability to accurately
      identify patients at high risk of PB. Currently, no clinical or biological marker is
      recognized as the most reliable in predicting the real risk of AP in case of MAP.

      The purpose of this study is to improve the knowledge of predictors of preterm delivery
      compared with conventional blood markers by estimating serum procalcitonin according to
      premature delivery or not in patients hospitalized for preterm labor .
