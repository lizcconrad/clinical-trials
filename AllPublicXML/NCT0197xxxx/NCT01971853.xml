  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All healthcare providers strive continually to improve the outcome of their treatment
      approaches. The investigators hypothesize that preventive analgesics administered before a
      child is sedated with a Demerol-Vistaril regimen will improve the outcome of a sedation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To increase outcomes for patients receiving dental sedation by providing significant evidence
      that the new regimen improves the quality of sedation and results in an improved post
      sedation ability to eat, drink, resume normal activities and require less additional pain
      medications.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Improved sedation effectiveness based on numerical value for effectiveness as noted in description</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes treatment started</time_frame>
    <description>A Sedation effectiveness evaluation criteria chart will be utilized to determine a numerical value for the effectiveness as follows:
1 = Effective/Excellent; 2 = Partially effective/good; 3 = Ineffective/fair; 4 = Aborted/Poor</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in heart rate as measured by numerical delta value</measure>
    <time_frame>From state of treatment (time 0) 60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A baseline heart rate will be determined at the beginning of the appointment, and a maximum heart rate will be determined during the appointment. The differences between baseline and maximum heart rates for each study arm will be compared.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Time of administration of nitrous oxide and oxygen as measured by minutes and percent of nitrous oxide administered</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment (time 0) to 60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The differences in time and concentration of nitrous oxide used during treatment will be compared for each study arm.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Complexity of procedures completed as measured by numerical value using procedure complexity scale in description</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes after start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A table will be used to determine the complexity of procedures performed by assigning a numerical value to each procedure and determining a total procedure complexity score.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Complications during treatment and recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours in clinic</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence of Complications during treatment and recovery will be evaluated. Complications are defined as vomiting, excessive crying, need for supplemental oxygen, and disorientation.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Post operative problems</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours after patient is discharged</time_frame>
    <description>Presence of Post op problems including time and whether problem is constant or intermittent will be as follows: Discomfort when eating/drinking (D), Resumption of normal activity (NA), and Need for additional pain meds (PM)</description>
