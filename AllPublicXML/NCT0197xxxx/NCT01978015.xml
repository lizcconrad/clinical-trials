  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma, a progressive optic disc neuropathy causing visual field reduction, is the second
      leading cause of world blindness. The treatment of glaucoma is mainly based in reducing
      intraocular pressure (IOP) with topical medications. Many patients required two or more
      medications to achieve a target IOP. Combinations of B-blockers and prostaglandin analogs
      (PGA) are frequently used in clinical practice because their additive effect in lowering IOP
      levels. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of fixed combinations of timolol
      maleate and PGA on the blood-aqueous barrier and evaluate the measurement of foveal thickness
      in pseudophakic patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).

      Most studies found a lower incidence of systemic and ocular adverse events with fixed
      combinations than with the unfixed combinations. Fixed combinations are better tolerated than
      their respective prostaglandin analogue. However, among the most serious side effects induced
      by PGA are the breaking down of the blood-aqueous barrier (BAB) and the development of
      cystoids macular edema (CME). Also, timolol maleate drops increase protein concentration in
      the human and benzalkonium chloride, eye drops preservative induces anterior chamber
      inflammation. This randomized, masked-observer, prospective clinical trial was approved by
      the Ethics Committee of the University of Campinas, and it adhered to the tenets of the
      Declaration Of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient.

    <description>A flare measure of a laser flare meter (FM 500; Kowa Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) was used to determine the status of the blood-aqueous barrier at all follow-up visits. According to information provided by the manufacturer, flare readings greater than 26 photon counts per millisecond (p/ms) are indicative of a disruption in the blood-aqueous barrier.</description>
