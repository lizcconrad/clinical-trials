    <textblock>
      The SMART Program at Nationwide Children's Hospital is an interdisciplinary social skills
      group that teaches children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) ages 2-12 the fundamental
      social skills necessary to build and maintain relationships. The manualized curriculum
      addresses skills such as joint attention, eye contact, play, and peer engagement. Currently
      individual goals are set for each child who participates and this is documented in the daily
      treatment note. In order to research group outcomes, the investigators will use parent
      questionnaires (an addition to current clinical practices) to measure changes in behavior
      after each 12 week session for up to one year of treatment. The investigators hypothesize
      that maladaptive behaviors will decrease and adaptive behaviors will increase in children
      with ASD after participation in the SMART program.
