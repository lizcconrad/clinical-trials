      The objective of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to determine the effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of a task sharing counseling intervention for maternal depression in South
      Africa(i.e. provided by non-specialist health workers)

      Specific Objectives:

        1. To determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of task sharing care to community
           health workers (CHWs), compared to enhanced usual care in South Africa, on both primary
           outcome measures (severity of prenatal maternal depression symptoms) and on a series of
           secondary outcome measures (functional status, health care utilization, social support
           and postnatal infant growth).

        2. To examine factors influencing the implementation of the task sharing intervention and
           future scale up, by assessing feasibility, sustainability, quality, and safety, and by
           qualitative exploration of the experience of task sharing from the perspectives of both
           CHWs and patients.
