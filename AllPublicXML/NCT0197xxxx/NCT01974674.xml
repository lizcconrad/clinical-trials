  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a multicentre, sequential, phase II clinical trial, aiming at evaluating the allogeneic
      islet transplantation for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.

      19 patients with type 1 diabetes will be included and ideally distributed evenly: patients
      with unstable diabetes without renal insufficiency (AI group for &quot;islet alone&quot; by the
      international customary determination) and patients with a functioning kidney transplant (IAK
      group for &quot;islet after kidney&quot;). The main endpoint will be defined by the restoration of
      normal glycemic control without insulin at 6 months after graft.

    <description>the restoration of normal glycemic control without insulin therapy will be evaluated by measuring
- A fasting glucose (&gt; 8 hours) less than 1.25 g/L and a 2 hours glucose after oral intake of 75g of glucose, less than 2 g/L in a patient without insulin for at least 15 consecutive days during the the first 6 months from day 0.</description>

    <time_frame>within 2 years after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>The remission of diabetes is defined by the normality of blood glucose or insulin without lHbA1c.
The normality of blood glucose is defined below 1.20 g/L and postprandial fasting glycemia less than 1.60 g/L in the book self-monitoring (including 6/7 blood glucoses during the previous 3 days evaluation visit).
Normal HbA1c is defined as less than 6.5%.</description>
