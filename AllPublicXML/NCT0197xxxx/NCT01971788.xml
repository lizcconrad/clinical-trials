  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Residual thrombosis of stent struts may occur after the end of primary angioplasty and
      determine distal embolization and further myocardial damage. Bivalirudin is considered the
      most appropriate antithrombotic drug in the setting of primary PCI, but an initial increase
      in stent thrombosis has been reported. In order to overcome this potential adverse event, a
      prolonged infusion of bivalirudin after the end of PCI has been proposed.

      This aim of this study is to test whether the use of long-term bivalirudin infusion, as
      compared to the intra-procedural only administration, reduces residual thrombosis of stent
      struts evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT) at the end of primary PCI and at 3-5
      days follow-up.

      A subgroup of patients enrolled in the MATRIX (Minimizing Adverse haemmhorragic events by
      TRansradial access site and AngioX study) study will be selected showing the following
      inclusion criteria:

        -  patients affected by STEMI undergoing primary PCI with stent implantation and randomised
           to bivalirudin treatment,

        -  patients who, in addition to the infarct related lesion, show at least one critical
           stenosis of other coronary vessels suitable for staged-PCI,

        -  patients whose anatomy is suitable for OCT evaluation.
