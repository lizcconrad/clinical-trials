  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few interventions to improve asthma management have targeted low-income minority asthmatic
      adults and even fewer have focused on the real-world practice where care is provided for
      these patients. This project tests the effectiveness of a Patient Advocate as a practical and
      sustainable method of facilitating and maintaining communication between patient and provider
      and access to chronic care for adults with moderate or severe asthma recruited from clinics
      serving low-income urban neighborhoods. We compare the use of a Patient Advocate to current
      asthma care and test the Patient Advocate's cost-effectiveness.

      This 5 year project tests the effectiveness, sustainability, and budget impact of a patient
      navigator intervention to facilitate and maintain patient-provider communication and access
      to chronic care of moderate or severe asthma in low income minority adults with other chronic
      morbidities. We will recruit from a variety of clinic practices including those of an urban
      academic health center, a VA, and a federally qualified health center and in both
      English-speaking and Spanish-speaking patients. The intervention is tailored to patients and
      their clinics, and informed by focus groups of patients and providers.

      The Patient Advocate (PA), works with patients by coaching and modeling preparation for a
      visit with the asthma doctor, attending the visit with the permission of participant and
      provider, and confirming understanding of issues discussed. The PA also facilitates
      scheduling, obtaining insurance coverage, overcoming patients' unique social and
      administrative barriers to carrying out medical advice, and exchange of information between
      providers and patients. The PAs are recent college graduates interested in health-related or
      education careers, research experience, working with patients, and generally have the same
      race/ethnicity distribution as potential subjects.

      This dissemination and implementation project refines the intervention of RC1 HL099612 for
      real-world practice by 1) conducting a randomized controlled trial that compares the Patient
      Advocate Intervention (PAI) to currently practiced guideline-based usual care; 2) carrying
      out the intervention in a variety of primary care and asthma specialty practices; 3)
      extending the observation time to a year to test its sustainability; 4) assessing
      patient-centered outcomes including asthma control, quality of life, ED visits, and
      hospitalizations; 5) assessing mediators/moderators of the PAI-asthma outcome relationship;
      and 6) evaluating its cost-effectiveness.

      We will recruit 300 adults, each to be followed for at least 1 year with moderate or severe
      persistent asthma from clinics serving low-income, urban, primarily minority patients and
      conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to: 1) assess whether 6 months of the PAI
      improves asthma control relative to baseline compared with usual care (UC) and whether such a
      difference is sustained in the 6 months following the intervention's completion, 2) Assess
      whether the PAI improves other asthma outcomes (need for prednisone bursts, ED visits,
      hospitalizations, quality of life, FEV1) relative to baseline compared with UC at 6 months
      and is sustained in the 6 months following the intervention's completion, 3) examine
      mediators and moderators of the relationship between the intervention and outcome, 4) assess
      the incremental direct and indirect costs of the PAI compared to usual care and the
      cost-effectiveness of the PAI relative to UC for the outcomes, and 5) in post-study focus
      groups of providers to explore awareness of the intervention and response to the PA
