    <measure>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve (AUC) From Time Zero to Infinity (AUCinf) for Simvastatin</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 72 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>AUCinf is the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve extrapolated from time 0 to infinity, calculated using the observed value of the last nonzero concentration. AUC can be used as a measure of drug exposure. It is derived from drug concentration and time so it gives a measure how much and how long a drug stays in a body.</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to the Time of the Last Measureable Concentration (AUClast) of Simvastatin</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 72 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>AUClast is the area under the concentration versus time curve from the time of dosing to the last measurable concentration. AUC can be used as a measure of drug exposure. It is derived from drug concentration and time so it gives a measure how much and how long a drug stays in a body.</description>

    <time_frame>Over 72 hours post-dose</time_frame>
