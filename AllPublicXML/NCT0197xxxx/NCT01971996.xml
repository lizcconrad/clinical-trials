  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During general anaesthesia, to ensure sufficient oxygen supply to the brain, the NIRS
      technology can be used. It consist of two sensors placed on the forehead, and measures the
      oxygen saturation of the tissue underneath the sensor. For patients undergoing back surgery
      placed in the prone position, the NIRS measurement will be affected, because the weight of
      the head will produce a pressure on the sensors. We wish to investigate how much the
      measurement is affected. Furthermore we plan to lift the head to remove the pressure, and
      record the time needed for the measurements to return to baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When placed in the prone position an external pressure is applied to the NIRS sensor. This
      pressure changes the amount of blood in the underlying tissue and thereby has an influence on
      the regional cerebral oxygen saturation measured. We wish to investigate to which extend this
      value is affected by the external pressure. Furthermore by lifting the head we want to
      investigate how long takes for the measurements to return to baseline (no pressure in the
      supine position).

      Patients will receive written and oral information about the study, when seen by an
      anaesthesiologist prior to surgery. Before the anaesthesia one NIRS sensors is placed on the
      right side of the forehead, avoiding til frontal sinus, and one NIRA sensor is placed on the
      left musculus deltoideus. The patient is placed in the prone position with the head in af
      prone-view face mask. Measurements will start after 30 minutes with no change in infusion
      rate of anaesthetic and no inotropics administered. Registration of NIRS measurements will be
      done every 15 seconds, first five minutes without intervention, then five minutes with
      headlift, and last five minutes without interventions. Blood pressure, pulse, saturation,
      end-tidal carbon dioxide and temperature, will be recorded. Registration wil be om case
      report forms.
