          -  Use of experimental or investigational drugs and/or participation in drug clinical
             studies within 6 months prior to Baseline visit (randomization).

          -  Use of immunosuppressive agents, or cytotoxic agents, including cyclophosphamide and
             azatioprine within 12 months prior to Baseline.

          -  Natalizumab (Tysabri®) if given more than 6 months prior to randomization AND the
             subject is John Cunningham (JC) virus antibody test negative at Screening.

          -  Previous use of Rituximab, ocrelizumab, or ofatumumab is allowed if the B cell count
             (CD19) is higher than 80 cells /μL.
