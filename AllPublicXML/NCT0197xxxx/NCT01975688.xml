  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate what the body does to single doses of Sativex (i.e. the pharmacokinetics [PKs]
      of four sprays containing 10.8 mg Δ9 tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] and 10 mg cannabidiol [CBD])
      when mild, moderate or severe oral mucositis is induced. This will be done by looking at the
      effects of the body on the drug before and after oral mucositis is induced. The study
      participants will have Non-surgical Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC), and oral
      mucositis will be induced with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.

             Sativex® in the absence of oral mucositis.

          -  Any surgical or medical condition, significant disease or disorder or any finding on
             physical examination (or oral examination) (other than their underlying condition)

             evidence of clinically significant cardiac disease on electrocardiogram at screening.

             study.

          -  Following a physical examination, the subject has any abnormalities that, in the
