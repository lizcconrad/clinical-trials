      The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a computer-based automated symptom
      monitoring telephone system used by patients who received chemotherapy for their cancer to
      communicate unrelieved symptoms they experienced to their oncology providers. The symptoms
      monitored in the project were nausea/vomiting, pain, sore mouth, diarrhea, constipation,
      depressed mood, anxiety, trouble sleeping, and fatigue. The study randomly assigned
      participants into either the intervention group or the group that received usual care from
      their oncology providers without alert notifications. All participants called the automated
      system daily to report their symptom presence, severity, and distress. When participants in
      the intervention group rated symptoms at moderate (4-7) to severe (8-10) levels an e-mail
      alert report of their symptom information was sent to the participant's medical oncologist
      and oncology nurse. The usual care group also reported symptoms daily to the automated system
      but their information was not sent to the providers. Participants in the usual care group
      were told daily to call their oncology provider if they had concerns about their symptoms.
      The two study groups were compared over chemotherapy cycles 2 and 3 on symptom presence,
      severity, and distress. Functional status, patient reported degree of symptom interference
      with normal activities, and work attendance if they had indicated that they worked during
      their treatment were also recorded. In addition, the groups were compared for the number and
      purpose of unscheduled patient-provider contacts, visits to the emergency department or
      urgent care facility, and unscheduled hospitalizations.

    <description>When a patient reports during their daily phone call with the automated symptom monitoring system that they had been in contact with a health care provider, the research staff would conduct a short telephone interview to collect data about the nature of the medical encounter including whether the medical encounter was related to the symptoms being monitored by the system.</description>

    <description>An End of Study Telephone Interview was conducted at the end of a patient's participation in the project to obtain data on patient satisfaction with the symptom monitoring system and to obtain suggestions for improvement of the system.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Provider Unrelieved Symptom Alert</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in the intervention arm called the automated monitoring system daily to report presence, severity and distress on a 1-10 scale for nine symptoms. The system immediately sent an emailed symptom alert report to their oncologist and oncology nurse if symptoms exceeded preset thresholds (moderate to severe levels). Two thresholds were set: a simple alert when severity or distress was 4 or greater on the 10 point scale and trend alerts based on a pattern of moderate severity over several days.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Attentional Control Usual Care Group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in the usual care group called the automated monitoring system daily to report presence, severity and distress (1-10 scale) on 9 symptoms and also measured symptom interference with daily activities, functional status, work attendance, and unscheduled provider visits, urgent care and emergency department visits, and unscheduled hospitalizations. The usual care group received equivalent contact time with the automated system including identical voice and assessment questions. Data were not available for clinical action and not reported to the oncology providers. On every call, usual care participants were reminded to call their oncology provider if they had symptom concerns, which is the usual practice in oncology settings to address unrelieved symptoms.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Other</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Provider Unrelieved Symptom Alert</intervention_name>
    <description>The Provider Unrelieved Symptom Alert intervention sent an automatic symptom report to oncology providers (both physician and nurse) when the patient reported symptoms at a moderate to severe level (4-10 on a 0-10 scale). The oncology providers used their clinical judgement in terms of what they did with the information received. There was no prescribed response as part of the intervention.</description>
