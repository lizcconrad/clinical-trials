  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, two way cross-over, 12 weeks
      noninferiority study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of FSC 250/50 mcg
      capsule-based inhaler and a multi-dose inhaler administered BID in adults with COPD. The
      primary objective of this study is to establish the non-inferiority of the efficacy of the
      FSC 250/50 mcg capsule-based inhaler compared to the FSC 250/50 mcg multi-dose inhaler
      administered BID. The study consists of 6 phases: Pre-screening, Screening/Run-in (3 weeks),
      Treatment Period 1 (12 weeks), Washout (minimum 4 weeks), Treatment Period 2 (12 weeks) and
      Follow-up (1 week). The total duration of the study for each subject will be at least 32
      weeks.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Trough Morning Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Day 85</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 85 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The trough FEV1 is defined as morning prebronchodilator and predose (12 hours after the last evening dose Day 84). Trough FEV1 was measured electronically by spirometer in the morning, before using the bronchodilator and predose, at Week 12 (Day 85) of each Treatment Period. Baseline was defined as the value obtained predose (0 minutes) on day 1 in each treatment period. Change from Baseline within each period was calculated as trough FEV1 at Day 85 minus the period specific Baseline value. The change from Baseline in trough FEV1 was analyzed using mixed model for repeated measures analysis, having fixed effect participant level Baseline, adjusted period-specific Baseline, treatment group, period, visit, visit by treatment, visit by participant level Baseline, visit by adjusted period-specific Baseline, with participant as random effect.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Transition Dyspnoea Index (TDI) Focal Score at Days 28, 56 and 85</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and Days 28, 56 and 85</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline Dysponea Index (BDI) and Transition Dyspnoea Index (TDI) are interview-based measurements of breathlessness due to COPD related daily living activities. Scores depend on ratings for 3 categories: functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort. BDI was collected at Day 1 and TDI at Days 28, 56 and 85 of each treatment (trt) period. Each BDI scale has 5 possible scores ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 (worst) to 12 (best) as the total range. Each TDI scale has 7 possible scores ranging from -3 to +3, with -9 (worst) to +9 (best) as the total range. TDI focal score &gt;=1 is considered to be a clinically meaningful change. Change from Baseline was calculated as TDI minus BDI values. Analysis was performed using MMRM by par. level BDI focal score, adjusted period-specific BDI focal score, trt group, trt period, visit, visit*trt group, visit*par. level BDI focal score, visit*adjusted period-specific BDI focal score as a fixed effect and with par. as a random effect.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire-COPD (SGRQ C) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ-C is a 40-item COPD-specific questionnaire designed to measure the effect of COPD and its treatment on the participant's health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The SGRQ-C includes 14 questions with a total of 40 items grouped into three components (symptoms, activity, and impacts). Each questionnaire response has a unique empirically derived weight. The lowest possible weight is zero and the highest is 100. Higher scores indicate greater impairment of HRQoL. HRQoL of participants was assessed using the SGRQ-C at Baseline (Day 1) and Week 12 of each treatment period. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at Week 12 minus the period specific Baseline value. Change from Baseline in SGRQ total score at Week 12 was analyzed using a mixed effects ANCOVA model, with participant-level Baseline SGRQ total score, adjusted treatment period-specific Baseline SGRQ total score, treatment group, and treatment period as fixed effects and participant as a random effect.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in COPD Assessment Test (CAT) Scores at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The CAT is a participant-completed instrument designed to provide a simple and reliable measure of health status in COPD for the assessment and long-term follow-up of the individual participant. The CAT consists of eight items, each formatted on a semantic differential scale. Participants rated their experience on a 6-point scale for each question, ranging from 0 to 5 with a maximum total score of 40. Higher scores indicate greater disease impact. CAT of each participant was assessed at Baseline (Day 1) and Week 12 (Day 85) of each treatment period. Change from Baseline within each period was calculated as values at Week 12 minus period specific Baseline value. The change from Baseline in CAT overall score at Week 12 was analyzed using a mixed effects ANCOVA model, with participant-level Baseline CAT overall score, adjusted treatment period specific Baseline CAT overall score, treatment group, treatment period as fixed effects and participant as a random effect.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Trough Morning Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Day 85</title>
        <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The trough FEV1 is defined as morning prebronchodilator and predose (12 hours after the last evening dose Day 84). Trough FEV1 was measured electronically by spirometer in the morning, before using the bronchodilator and predose, at Week 12 (Day 85) of each Treatment Period. Baseline was defined as the value obtained predose (0 minutes) on day 1 in each treatment period. Change from Baseline within each period was calculated as trough FEV1 at Day 85 minus the period specific Baseline value. The change from Baseline in trough FEV1 was analyzed using mixed model for repeated measures analysis, having fixed effect participant level Baseline, adjusted period-specific Baseline, treatment group, period, visit, visit by treatment, visit by participant level Baseline, visit by adjusted period-specific Baseline, with participant as random effect.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Trough Morning Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Day 28 and 56</title>
        <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The trough FEV1 at Days 28 and 56 is defined as morning prebronchodilator and predose (12 hours after the last evening dose Days 27 and 55). Trough FEV1 was measured electronically by spirometer in the morning, before using the bronchodilator and predose, at Days 28 and 56 of each Treatment Period. Baseline was defined as the value obtained predose (0 minutes) on day 1 in each treatment period. Change from Baseline within each period was calculated as trough FEV1 at Day 85 minus the period specific Baseline value. The change from Baseline in trough FEV1 was analyzed using mixed model for repeated measures analysis, having fixed effect participant level Baseline, adjusted period-specific Baseline, treatment group, period, visit, visit by treatment, visit by participant level Baseline, visit by adjusted period-specific Baseline, with participant as random effect.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Transition Dyspnoea Index (TDI) Focal Score at Days 28, 56 and 85</title>
        <description>Baseline Dysponea Index (BDI) and Transition Dyspnoea Index (TDI) are interview-based measurements of breathlessness due to COPD related daily living activities. Scores depend on ratings for 3 categories: functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort. BDI was collected at Day 1 and TDI at Days 28, 56 and 85 of each treatment (trt) period. Each BDI scale has 5 possible scores ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 (worst) to 12 (best) as the total range. Each TDI scale has 7 possible scores ranging from -3 to +3, with -9 (worst) to +9 (best) as the total range. TDI focal score &gt;=1 is considered to be a clinically meaningful change. Change from Baseline was calculated as TDI minus BDI values. Analysis was performed using MMRM by par. level BDI focal score, adjusted period-specific BDI focal score, trt group, trt period, visit, visit*trt group, visit*par. level BDI focal score, visit*adjusted period-specific BDI focal score as a fixed effect and with par. as a random effect.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire-COPD (SGRQ C) Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The SGRQ-C is a 40-item COPD-specific questionnaire designed to measure the effect of COPD and its treatment on the participant’s health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The SGRQ-C includes 14 questions with a total of 40 items grouped into three components (symptoms, activity, and impacts). Each questionnaire response has a unique empirically derived weight. The lowest possible weight is zero and the highest is 100. Higher scores indicate greater impairment of HRQoL. HRQoL of participants was assessed using the SGRQ-C at Baseline (Day 1) and Week 12 of each treatment period. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at Week 12 minus the period specific Baseline value. Change from Baseline in SGRQ total score at Week 12 was analyzed using a mixed effects ANCOVA model, with participant-level Baseline SGRQ total score, adjusted treatment period-specific Baseline SGRQ total score, treatment group, and treatment period as fixed effects and participant as a random effect.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in COPD Assessment Test (CAT) Scores at Week 12</title>
        <description>The CAT is a participant-completed instrument designed to provide a simple and reliable measure of health status in COPD for the assessment and long-term follow-up of the individual participant. The CAT consists of eight items, each formatted on a semantic differential scale. Participants rated their experience on a 6-point scale for each question, ranging from 0 to 5 with a maximum total score of 40. Higher scores indicate greater disease impact. CAT of each participant was assessed at Baseline (Day 1) and Week 12 (Day 85) of each treatment period. Change from Baseline within each period was calculated as values at Week 12 minus period specific Baseline value. The change from Baseline in CAT overall score at Week 12 was analyzed using a mixed effects ANCOVA model, with participant-level Baseline CAT overall score, adjusted treatment period specific Baseline CAT overall score, treatment group, treatment period as fixed effects and participant as a random effect.</description>
