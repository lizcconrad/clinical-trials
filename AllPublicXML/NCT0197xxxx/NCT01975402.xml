      We will evaluate the end to end remote monitoring system in a less controlled environment and
      concurrently develop the infrastructure to support the back end of the system

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of our research is to test, adapt, refine and validate the BodyGuardian
      technology and related end-to-end remote monitoring system to be used outside usual medical
      care environments to reduce hospital readmissions and facilitate independent living for heart
      failure patients. An important component of our overall strategy for continued development
      and refinement of the remote monitoring system is the incorporation of iterative behavioral
      evaluations to facilitate assessment and refinement in order to optimize adherence,
      utilization, and usability for patients as well as efficiency and functionality for
      providers.
