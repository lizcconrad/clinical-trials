  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, multi-centre phase IIa proof-of-concept
      study to evaluate efficacy and safety of APD-209 Eye drops for treatment of acute phase
      adenovirus-induced EKC. The aims of the study are to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of
      APD-209 Eye drops as measured by adenoviral load, time to viral eradication, clinical
      resolution of EKC (objective and subjective assessments), presence of opacities, visual
      acuity and frequency of second eye infections, and to assess the safety and tolerability of
      APD-209 Eye drops in EKC infected eyes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The patients have to meet all of the following criteria to be eligible to enter the study:

          -  Willing and able to provide informed consent.

          -  Men or women aged 18 years or above with onset of adenoviral EKC symptoms in at least
             one eye, as clinically diagnosed and with symptoms appearing within less 7 days at the
             time of giving informed consent.

          -  Using adequate contraceptive measures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known or suspected allergy to any ingredient of the IMP or placebo.

          -  Symptoms correlating with EKC since more than 7 days.

          -  Diagnosis of other significant disease(s) than EKC in the eye.

          -  Diagnosis of bacterial or fungal ocular infections.

          -  Use of antibiotics or corticosteroids by any route (except intravitreal
             corticosteroids) within 14 days prior to inclusion. Ocular antibiotics may, however,
             be used until 2 hours prior to first dose of IMP, but are thereafter prohibited during
             the study.

          -  Use of immunosuppressive medications (including intravitreal corticosteroids) within 6
             months prior to inclusion.

          -  Use of antiviral medications within 7 days prior to inclusion.

          -  Usage of any medication or herbal medicinal product with documented adverse reactions
             affecting the eyes.

          -  Usage of any medication or herbal medicinal product for ocular administration at
             inclusion.

          -  Female patients: currently pregnant or breast-feeding or intending to become pregnant
             during the study period.

          -  Known or suspected drug abuse.

          -  Usage of contact lenses during the study.

          -  Participation in any other interventional clinical study within 30 days prior to
