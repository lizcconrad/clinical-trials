  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In coronary artery bypass grafting, saphenous veins are widely used as a composite grafts
      that are Y-anastomosed to in-situ left internal thoracic artery. Based on our observation
      that remodeling of saphenous vein graft differs between those harvested from upper leg vein
      and lower leg, this study aims to compare histologic and immunohistochemical findings between
      saphenous vein grafts harvested from upper leg and lower leg.

      Inclusion criteria:

        -  Patients aged from 40 to 75 years with triple vessel disease

        -  Patients who are eligible for the use of left internal thoracic artery as an in situ
           primary conduit

        -  Operation plan: saphenous vein graft will be Y-anastomosed to left internal thoracic
           artery.

        -  Patients whose saphenous vein grafts can be harvested from both upper legs and lower
           legs

        -  Patients who are eligible for off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting

        -  Patients who agreed with the participation in the research based on thorough
           explanation.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to upper leg vein (ULV) group and lower leg vein (LLV)
      group immediately after anesthetic induction.

      Pieces of residual saphenous vein graft will be sent for histologic and immunohistochemical
      examination for the evaluation of endothelial cell preservation and the expression of matrix
      proteins.
