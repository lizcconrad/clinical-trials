  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic colorectal surgery has been widely accepted worldwide; however, despite the
      well-known benefits and comparable oncological outcomes, it is still limited by a lack of
      tactile sensation and a reduced operative field view. In addition, the inconsistency in the
      number and course of the mesenteric vessels significantly influences the learning curve with
      30 to 70 cases required for proficiency. To overcome these limitations, the vascular anatomy
      can be mapped using CT-angiography, and the images can be processed with rendering software
      to reconstruct a three-dimensional model of the mesenteric vessels. The aim of this study was
      to assess the influence of visualizing the three-dimensional vascular anatomy on the learning
      curve for laparoscopic colorectal surgery.All patients who underwent laparoscopic left or
      right hemicolectomies between January 2012 and January 2014 were evaluated for inclusion in
      this study. To assess the influence of preliminary knowledge of colonic vascular anatomy on
      the learning curve, we considered 2 groups of two surgeons with different levels of
      experience. In the first group (group A), the surgeons were able to view 3D reconstructions
      before and during the surgery, while the surgeons in Group B were only able to view the 3D
      reconstructions after surgery.

        We included only patients in which standard laparoscopic right or left hemicolectomy was
        planned and who needed a CT scan but had not received a scan prior to their first office
        visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in which standard laparoscopic right or left hemicolectomy was planned

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients who underwent extended right hemicolectomy and segmental colectomy or
             sigmoidectomy and patients for whom the surgical technique was modified
             intraoperatively

          -  patients who underwent anterior rectal resection and emergency procedures for
             complicated diverticulitis were excluded because these procedures require higher
             technical skills.

          -  Patients who had an ASA score of IV, a BMI over 40 or contraindications for
             laparoscopy were also excluded.
