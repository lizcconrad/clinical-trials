    <textblock>
      A. Background.

      Patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, suffer from a combination of pain, stiffness,
      joint instability, swelling and muscles weakness. This leads to decrease in quality of life,
      Active Daily living (ADL) and increase of medical services consumption in the community. OA
      of the knee, Is one of the world's common musculoskeletal disorder (18% among women and 10%
      among men). 80% of patients with OA of the knee suffer from decrease in mobility and 20% of
      them suffer an inability to perform everyday activities.

      Physical therapy training includes exercises for OA patients (Mild to Severe degree) is the
      cornerstone of non medicinal treatment. This training aimed to pain reduction, improved
      functioning and participation in family and working social life. Physical training with
      exercises can enhance physical capabilities such as: muscular strength, range of motion,
      balance, proprioception and cardiovascular performance. Other benefits are improving
      mobility, reducing risk of falls and body weight and improvement in psychological condition.

      B. Purpose

      The purpose of this research is to check the effectiveness of treatment in the framework of
      &quot;knee Osteoarthritis project&quot; compared to conventional Physical therapy in physical
      functioning, pain and quality of life scales, among patients over the age of 60 who suffer
      from OA of the knee .

      C. Research method

      A comparative non blinded, clinical trial will be conducted. This research will include 60
      independent patients divided into equal groups: Intervention group will be trained in &quot;knee
      Osteoarthritis project&quot; (in which patients receive 6 individual treatments and 6 Group
      treatments). Control group will be treated with conventional physical therapy, which includes
      12 individual treatments. Effect of the treatment will be evaluated by: 1. WOMAC
      questionnaire- used to evaluate function and pain. 2. EQ-5D questionnaire for evaluating the
      quality of life. 3. Time up and go test- a Common functional test. This Questionnaires and
      test will be Performed before and after the study.

      D. Study hypothesis

      Physical therapy treatment within the framework of &quot;knee Osteoarthritis project&quot; is favor
      than the treatment of the conventional Physical therapy. Therefore the investigators expect
      much improvement in terms of pain, physical functioning and quality of life among
      intervention group compared to control groups.

    <textblock>
      This research is divided into o Intervention and control groups. Research Population is 60
      Patients (30 patients to each arm), aged 60 and above suffering from OA of the knees and
      admitted to physical therapy .Intervention group patients were treated by the concept of
      &quot;Knee Osteoarthritis Project&quot;. This was first applied in middle of 2010 and its effectiveness
      was never tested.

      The main idea was to make patients more active, to encourage them to do exercise at home,
      increase their motivation and self efficacy. In addition, patients received prescription for
      TENS device (Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator) for home use.

      Individual sessions include: muscle strengthening, proprioception exercise, taping, soft
      tissue stretching, joint and soft tissue mobilization, electrotherapy, aerobic exercise
      (bicycle, treadmill), functional exercise. Group session include: muscle strengthening,
      stairs exercise, balance exercise and education about the disease and treatment (lecture
      about knee OA and recommendations for changes in life style).

      In Intervention group were given 12 session. 6 individual treatments and 6 group treatments
      Control group patients were given 12 individual sessions of conventional physical therapy.

      The Outcome measures that were mention above will be performed in the beginning and the end
      of 12 sessions.
