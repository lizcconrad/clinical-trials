      Part 1: This is a phase I trial of the combination of bendamustine, rituximab and pixantrone
      in patients with relapsed/refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A standard 3+3 design will
      be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination. A static dose of
      bendamustine and rituximab will be used and the dose of pixantrone will be escalated in each
      cohort. Pixantrone will be dosed on a 21 day cycle at 55mg/m2, 85mg/m2, and 115mg/m2 in
      sequential cohorts dependent on acceptable toxicity profile at each dose level. MTD will be
      determined based on DLTs that occur during the first 2 cycles of the drug combination.

      After 2 cycles of study drug, all subjects achieving stable disease or better may continue on
      study for up to 6 cycles. However, adverse events occurring during cycles 3-6 will not be
      considered DLTs and will not contribute to the determination of the MTD.

      Part 2: After the MTD is determined an expansion study is planned. This will be a phase II,
      prospective, open label, single arm study of combination therapy with bendamustine,
      rituximab, and pixantrone at the defined MTD schedule based on the phase I portion of this
      study. Subjects enrolled in part 2 of the study must have an aggressive, relapsed or
      refractory B-cell NHL, to include follicular lymphoma (FL) grade 3, Diffuse Large B Cell
      Lymphoma (DLBCL), transformed NHL, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and other aggressive
      histologies. We anticipate the total sample size to be 36 patients accrued at a rate of 2
      patients per month. Restaging will be employed after cycle 2, and if the patient has stable
      disease or better they may continue on study for up to 6 cycles.

      Part 1: This is a phase I trial utilizing a traditional 3+3 design to evaluate maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and optimal dose schedule of pixantrone in combination with bendamustine
      (120mg/m2 on day 1 of each 21 day cycle) and rituximab (375mg/m2 on day 1 of each 21 day
      cycle). No patients will be entered on an escalated dosage level until at least 3 patients
      have been treated at the previous level and assessed for a dose limiting toxicity. Dose
      levels will be escalated in cohorts of 3 patients as long as no drug-related DLT occurs in
      the first 2 cycles. If one patient is observed to suffer a DLT, this cohort will be expanded
      to include at least 6 patients total. If less than 2 patients in the expanded cohort of 6
      patients experience a DLT, dose escalation will resume. If 2 of 6 patients enrolled at the
      same dose level experience a DLT, the MTD has been exceeded, and the dose escalation will
      cease. The next lower dose will be considered the MTD. If any patient withdraws from the
      study prior to completing 2 cycles for reasons other than a DLT then that patient will be
      replaced in order to determine the MTD.

      If dose limiting toxicity is observed at the initial dose level in 2 patients, the MTD has
      been exceeded and the starting dose level will be reduced to 25mg/m2. If 1 patient
      experiences a DLT in the -1 dose range, the cohort will be expanded to at least 6 patients.
      If a second patient experiences a DLT at the -1 dose level, the trial will be closed.

      For part 1, those who have a confirmed diagnosis of relapsed/refractory B cell non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma of any subtype will be considered eligible for enrollment. Each cycle will be 21
      days. Subjects will be assessed for DLTs during the first 2 cycles of study drug. They will
      be assessed for response after cycle 2. Patients not experiencing a DLT during the first 2
      cycles and who have stable disease or better may continue to receive up to 6 cycles of
      treatment with the triplet combination. If any patient withdraws from the study prior to
      completing 2 cycles for reasons other than a DLT then that patient will be replaced in order
      to determine the MTD.

      Part 2: It is a phase II, prospective, open label, single arm study of the combination of
      bendamustine, pixantrone and rituximab. The dose of pixantrone will be the MTD determined
      during Part 1 of the study. A confirmed diagnosis of aggressive, relapsed or refractory B
      cell NHL, to include follicular lymphoma (FL) grade 3, Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL),
      transformed NHL, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), or any other B cell NHL aggressive histology
      (per the updated 2008 WHO criteria) will be required to participate in the phase II portion
      of the study.

      Cycle length is 21 days. Restaging will be employed after cycle 2, and if the patient has
      stable disease or better, then they may continue on study up to 6 cycles maximum with
      restaging performed after hematologic recovery following the final cycle of therapy.

      Bendamustine 120mg/m2 IV on day 1. Rituximab 375mg/m2 IV on day 1. Pixantrone will be the MTD
      determined by Part 1 of the study.
