          -  Subjects' leg ulcers will meet at least 3 of the 5 following clinical signs of
             infection: pain between two dressing changes, peri-ulcer skin erythema/inflammation,
             oedema, malodour (foul odour), and heavy exudate.

          -  Subjects who agree to wear compression therapy daily in combination with the trial
             dressing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of skin sensitivity to any of the components of the study
             product.
