          -  Relevant concomitant disease such as asthma (exercise induced asthma is permitted),
             chronic sinusitis or nasal structural abnormalities causing greater than 50 percent
             obstruction (polyposis nasi, marked septal deviation) that can interfere with the
             conduct of the study in the judgment of the investigator

          -  Current or past history of bleeding disorder(s)

          -  Acute illness or local infection prior to surgery that can interfere with the conduct
             of the study in the judgment of the investigator

          -  Chronic use of antihistamines defined as using 5 or more times a week for 2 or more
             consecutive weeks during the past 3 months

          -  Positive alcohol breathalyzer test and positive urine drug test prior to surgery

          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Chronic or severe sleep problems that do not respond to Over the Counter (OTC)
             medication and requires a prescription hypnotic or sedative

          <description>Sleep efficiency was calculated as (total sleep time/total time in-bed time) × 100; total in-bed time was fixed at 10 hours. Actigraphy is a non-intrusive tool that measures an individual’s movement during sleep.
