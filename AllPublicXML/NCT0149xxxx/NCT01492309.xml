  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (TMS) will alleviate symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) in pregnant women.

      TMS uses electromagnetic impulses to encourage neurons in the brain to communicate more
      effectively with one another. Effective neuron communication is thought to lead to the
      lessening of depressive symptoms. In this study subjects require daily TMS treatment for
      approximately four weeks.

      We hypothesize that there will be a decline in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression
      (HDRS-17) scores from the beginning to end of treatment. We expect that this decrease will be
      significantly greater in subjects receiving active transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
      compared to those receiving placebo TMS. Treatment response will be defined as greater than
      50% reduction in HDRS-17 score.

      We also hypothesize that levels of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a protein
      thought to regulate mood and cognitive functioning, will increase in subjects who respond to
      TMS treatment. We expect BDNF levels to increase by greater than or equal to 20% in those who
      respond to TMS. As previously stated, TMS response will be defined as a significant decrease
      (50% or greater) in the HDRS-17 from baseline to end of treatment.

    <description>We measured changes in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HDRS-17) scores from baseline to post-treatment. The HDRS-17 was administered on test days 1, 10, &amp; 20. Scoring is based on the 17-item scale and scores of 0-7 is generally accepted to be within the normal range, indicating minimal to no depression; scores of 8-16 suggest mild depression, 17-23 moderate depression and scores over 24 are indicative of severe depression; the maximum score being 52 on the 17-point scale.</description>

    <description>We measured the levels of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) concentration across time. BDNF is a protein thought to regulate mood and cognitive functioning and research has suggested that levels may vary by severity of mood symptoms. We obtained BDNF values on test days 1 &amp; 20.</description>

        <title>Change in Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) With Active Transcranial Magnetic Simulation (TMS)</title>
        <description>We measured the levels of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) concentration across time. BDNF is a protein thought to regulate mood and cognitive functioning and research has suggested that levels may vary by severity of mood symptoms. We obtained BDNF values on test days 1 &amp; 20.</description>

        <population>Only 4 participants from both the active and sham TMS groups were used in analysis because these participants had BDNF data at both time points. Furthermore, some samples were deemed unusable.</population>
