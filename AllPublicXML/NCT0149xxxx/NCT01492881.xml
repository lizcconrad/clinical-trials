  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine how multiple myeloma responds when the
      study drug vorinostat is added to the standard treatment of bortezomib and pegylated
      liposomal doxorubicin (PLD). After participants complete the three drug combination and if
      their multiple myeloma has decreased, the investigators also want to learn what effects (both
      good and bad) when vorinostat and bortezomib are given to people with multiple myeloma over a
      longer period of time. This type of treatment is called 'Maintenance Therapy'.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label single arm phase II trial of vorinostat, bortezomib and
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) followed by vorinostat/bortezomib (VB) maintenance
      therapy for patients with relapsed and relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM). The
      primary hypothesis being evaluated is that the addition of vorinostat to the PLD and
      bortezomib backbone (VB-PLD) will improve the overall response rate (ORR) as compared to a
      historical control of PLD in combination with bortezomib.[1] We anticipate that the addition
      of maintenance therapy will not improve the ORR, but may improve the quality (depth) of
      response and progression free survival (PFS).

      Secondary endpoints include PFS, high quality response rates (very good partial responses
      (VGPR) + complete responses (CRs)), duration of remission (DOR), quality of life (QOL),
      overall survival (OS) and tolerability of the regimen in patients with relapsed and relapsed
      and refractory multiple myeloma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma:

          -  Relapsed MM is defined as clinically active disease, in patients who have received one
             or more prior therapies, that is not refractory to the most recent treatment.
             (Refractory to the prior treatment means either progressive disease (PD) on last prior
             therapy; best response of stable disease (SD) to last prior therapy, or PD within 60
             days of completing therapy).

          -  Relapsed and refractory MM is defined as relapsed disease, which either becomes
             non-responsive while on salvage therapy, or progresses within 60 days of last therapy.

             1 to 3 prior lines of therapy for multiple myeloma (a single line of treatment may
             consist of 1 or more agents and regimens. A single line of therapy may be most easily
             delineated by a response to treatment followed by a change in treatment due to the
             progression of disease.

        combination of methods) as per standard of care, including abstinence. Females of
        non-childbearing potential are those who are postmenopausal greater than 1 year or who have

        reactions to other liposomal drug formulations will be evaluated individually, and if their
        reactions were felt to have been due to the liposome itself, as opposed to the encapsulated
        agent, they will be excluded at the discretion of the investigators.

        Prior or concomitant use of a histone deacetylase inhibitor (exception: prior valproic acid
        for epilepsy is allowed provided patient undergoes a 30 day wash out prior to D1 of study
        treatment)

        No major surgery within 3 weeks prior to day 1 of study treatment
