  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tyrosine is a non essential amino acid that is the precursor of the neurotransmitter,
      dopamine. Tyrosine is converted into Levodihydrophenylalanine (L-Dopa) and L-Dopa is
      subsequently and avidly converted into dopamine. It is well known that dopamine deficiency
      leads to the manifestations of restless legs syndrome (RLS). Studies have shown dopamine
      agonists and L-dopa to be effective in controlling symptoms. No studies to date have been
      done to determine the role of tyrosine in RLS. This open-label pilot study aims to determine
      the efficacy and tolerability of tyrosine in RLS, as current agents have limitations in
      treating RLS in addition to adding another possible agent to the investigators arsenal of
      treating RLS that maybe more cost efficient. In this pilot study, the dose of tyrosine will
      be escalated from 750 mg once daily by mouth (PO) up to 3000 mg once daily PO, as tolerated,
      in increments of 750 mg every week in patients who meet the inclusion criteria for RLS.
      Patients' symptoms will be monitored on a weekly basis for six weeks.
