      Patients with ischemic heart disease often report multiple symptoms, including angina and
      palpitations. Ranolazine has antiarrhythmic effects which are largely a result of the drug's
      effect on multiple ion channels. It remains unknown, however, whether the favorable effects
      of ranolazine on symptoms and arrhythmias are maintained over time. Aim of this study is to
      test the hypothesis that chronic treatment with ranolazine can improve the symptomatic status
      of patients with ischemic heart disease by reducing the occurrence of palpitations.

      Background:

      Patients with ischemic heart disease often report multiple symptoms, including angina and
      palpitations.

      Ranolazine is a novel antianginal and antiischemic drug that reduces intracellular sodium and
      calcium accumulation during ischemia thus limiting ischemic injury. Furthermore, ranolazine
      has antiarrhythmic effects which are largely a result of the drug's effect on multiple ion
      channels.

      It has previously been shown that treatment with ranolazine can reduce the frequency of
      supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia in the short term. In a subgroup analysis of the
      MERLIN-TIMI 36 trial, the continuous ECGs of 6,351 patients were analyzed. The results showed
      that, in comparison with placebo, treatment with ranolazine resulted in fewer episodes of
      ventricular tachycardia that lasted 8 beats or longer (5.3% versus 8.3%; P &lt;0.001), and in
      fewer episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (44.7% versus 55%; P &lt;0.001) and new-onset
      atrial fibrillation (1.7% versus 2.4%; P=0.08).

      It remains unknown, however, whether the favorable effects of ranolazine on symptoms and
      arrhythmias are maintained over time.

      Purpose:

      The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that chronic treatment with
      ranolazine can improve the symptomatic status of patients with ischemic heart disease by
      reducing the occurrence of palpitations.
