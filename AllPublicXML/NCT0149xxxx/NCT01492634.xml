      Title of study: Optimizing Fluid Status

      Study code: HD-IIT-01-E

      Study design: Prospective open design in study centre at two locations

      Applied medical device: Body Composition Monitor (BCM) for determination of fluid overload
      and dry weight

      Aim of the study: To improve the fluid status in chronic HD patients (measured as OH
      (overhydration) or TAFO (time averaged fluid overload)) based on BCM measurements. Up to now,
      the BCM was occasionally applied in both locations of the study centre.

      Study hypothesis: Regular measurement of fluid status (assessed by BCM) and display of dry
      weight (post-weight plan)will have significant consequences, namely a decrease of the:

        -  time averaged fluid overload (TAFO),

        -  proportion of patients with severe overhydration OH &gt; 2.5 L,or OH/ECW &gt; 15 %)

        -  proportion of dehydrated patients (OH &lt; -1.0 L, or OH &lt; -7 %),

        -  mean overhydration,

        -  variance of overhydration,

        -  time outside the reference range (-1.0L &lt; OH &lt; 2.5L).

      Devices used in this study: Dialysis machine 5008 equipped with Blood Pressure Monitor BPM,
      Blood Volume Monitor BVM, Blood Temperature Monitor BTM, and Online Clearance Monitor OCM ;
      Body Composition Monitor BCM ; Data management software / database system NephroLink
      Disposables used in this study: BVM blood lines and BCM electrodes

      Patients: 60 patients

    <intervention_name>Prescription of post-dialytic weight based on BCM device</intervention_name>
    <description>Prescription of post-dialytic weight target: On a weekly base, the patients are pre-dialytically measured by BCM (body composition monitor).
The time average fluid overload (TAFO) determines the target range. TAFO is defined as the mean value of pre- and post-dialytic overhydration (TAFO = (OHpre+OHpost)/2). The target range is set asymmetrically around a TAFO of 0.8, from -1.0 L to +0.5, i.e. the TAFO target range will be from -0.2 L to 1.3 L.
Prescription steps will be calculated weekly for all study patients. TAFO &lt; -0.2 L: Increase post-dialytic weight by Cw x 0.5 kg/week, TAFO between -0.2 to 1.3 L: No action, TAFO between 1.3 to 2.8 L Decrease post-dialytic weight by Cw x 0.5 kg/week, TAFO &gt; 2.8 L: Decrease post-dialytic weight by Cw x 1.0 kg/week.</description>
