  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to improve the efficiency of training and assessment of technical
      skill in surgical treatment of otologic disease. Through previous funding, we have developed
      an intuitive virtual simulation environment to be used as an adjuvant for teaching temporal
      bone surgery. Using direct-volume visualization techniques with integrated stereoscopic
      display, haptic (force) feedback, and aural simulation, we have achieved a straightforward,
      low-cost learning environment ready for translation into a practical training and assessment
      tool. This application challenges and seeks to shift current practice in clinical training by
      translating the simulation environment into a vehicle for curriculum development, technical
      skills assessment, and dissemination. The intent is to provide more accessible, inexpensive,
      safe, and deliberate practice with objective and continuous quantitative, objective
      assessment in the early stages of training.

      The aims of this research include: 1) definition of standardized metrics for otological
      surgical techniques, 2) the translation of those standards into objective criteria for use in
      a computer synthesized surgical environment, and 3) the correlation between expert evaluation
      and computer automated assessment of resident proficiency.

      The interactions will be computer-based and include:

      Experts will learn to use the system so that they can evaluate the quality of translation of
      metrics to the simulation environment.

      Evaluations will be in the form of anonymous web-based surveys. Experts serve as a focus
      group.

      Residents will use the simulation environment to perform surgical procedures on virtual
      specimens. Residents will then evaluate the quality of the simulation environment via
      anonymous web-based surveys.

      Experts will use the simulation environment to evaluate and rate the residents performance.

      The computer environment will be used to automatically assess and rate the residents
      performance.

      Expert and computer assessment will be compared.

    <description>A collection of metrics designed to measure technical performance during a mastoidectomy will be validated by expert survey. These metrics will be translated to an automated system within the surgical simulation system. Resident subjects will be asked to perform the surgical procedure (mastoidectomy) within the simulation. Experts will then rate the playback of the performances using the validated metrics. These results will be compared to the automated scoring system. A conclusion will be drawn about the accuracy of the automated process compared to the expert rated process.</description>
