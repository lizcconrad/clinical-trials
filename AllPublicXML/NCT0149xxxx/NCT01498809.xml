      This project aims to evaluate the physiological effects of Midodrine administration during
      orthostatic challenge in those with high level spinal cord injury. Midodrine has been shown
      to improve orthostatic symptoms in those with spinal cord injury but the physiological
      mechanisms influenced have not been identified. The investiagtors will examine key
      physiological components influencing orthostatic tolerance. The investiagtors will do this,
      by measuring the baroreflex, and brain blood flow autoregulation (the ability to maintain
      brain blood flow) before during and after the sit-up test. Two sit-up tests will occur; one
      before Midodrine administration, and one after administration of a 10mg dose of Midodrine.
