  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If radical cystectomy remains the standard of care for muscle invasive bladder cancer,
      consequences of this surgical procedure are often harsh. Over the past years, concurrent
      chemo-radiotherapy has imposed itself as an alternative treatment. Published data on
      concomitant radiochemotherapy (radiotherapy/cisplatin or
      radiotherapy/cisplatin/5-fluorouracil combinations) showed local control rates with bladder
      preservation at 5 years ranging from 40% to 65% according to the disease stage, and overall
      survival probabilities ranging from 40% to 50% at 5 years. In order to improve local and
      systemic prognosis, evaluation of other chemotherapy agents with higher radiosensitizing
      effect, such as gemcitabine, is justified. Gemcitabine possesses its own anti-cancer
      activities on urothelial diseases and has a synergetic activity with cisplatin. The
      investigators completed a monocenter phase I study combining radiotherapy, cisplatin, and
      twice-weekly gemcitabine, and determined a recommended dose of gemcitabine 25 mg/m². The
      objective of the present study is to evaluate the combination of radiotherapy + cisplatin +
      gemcitabine in terms of disease-free survival in non metastatic muscle invasive urothelial
      cancer patients.

    <description>Before starting radiotherapy, 5ml of blood will be sampled in a 5ml heparinised tube to prospectively measure the rate of CD8 radio-induced lymphocyte apoptosis before any radiotherapy treatment. A correlation between the low rate of lymphocyte apoptosis and the severity of late toxicities will be studied to confirm the predictive power of this biological test on radio-induced side-effects.</description>

    <description>RT will encompass bilateral internal and external iliac lymph nodes at a dose of 45 Gy and the bladder up to 63 Gy. Fractionation will be 1.8 Gy per fraction.
Cisplatin: 20 mg/m2/day through continuous iv perfusion for 4 consecutive days, from D2 to D5 and from D23 to D26 for the first part of the treatment, then from D2 to D5 if an additional treatment is decided.
A cystoscopy with a transurethral resection will be performed 3 weeks after the last day of the first part of radio-chemotherapy.
In the absence of tumor cells, the 2nd part will start on the 4th week or at latest on the 5th week after the last day of the 1st part of radio-chemotherapy.
In case of a microscopic tumor residue or of a local tumor progression, operability will be re-evaluated in view of a radical cystectomy and the patient will exit the study.</description>
