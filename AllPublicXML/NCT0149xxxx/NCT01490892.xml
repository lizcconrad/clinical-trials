      This is a non-randomized trial of 450 women with a breast abnormality, who are scheduled for
      a breast biopsy of this abnormality. The study will be conducted at two clinical sites. The
      primary objective of this trial is:

      To evaluate if quantitative 3D Subharmonic imaging (SHI) or pulse inversion harmonic imaging
      (HI) can improve the characterization of benign and malignant breast masses (independently or
      in combination with other imaging modes) compared to x-ray mammography, fundamental grayscale
      ultrasound (US) or power Doppler imaging (PDI).

      The secondary aim of this trial is:

      To compare quantitative (bifurcations &amp; vessel length) and semi-quantitative (blood pool &amp;
      parametric imaging) measures of the vascular morphology of breast lesions determined by
      pathology and by SHI.

      This is an open-label, non-randomized trial that will be conducted at two clinical sites (the
      Breast Imaging Centers at Thomas Jefferson University (TJU) Hospital and University of
      California, San Diego (UCSD) Hospital). All 450 subjects will receive at most two IV bolus
      injections of Definity (Lantheus Medical Imaging, Billerica, MA), will undergo an unenhanced
      (baseline) and Definity contrast-enhanced US imaging study for evaluation of a breast mass or
      breast abnormality without mass, and will be scheduled to undergo a clinically indicated
      biopsy of the breast lesion under investigation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be a female diagnosed by x-ray mammography (performed within 90 days prior to the
             study procedure) as having a solid breast mass or abnormal area without a mass.

          -  Be scheduled for a biopsy (core / excisional / lumpectomy) of the mass or region of
             abnormality or for mastectomy within 30 days after this study procedure.

          -  Be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Be medically stable.

          -  If a female of child-bearing potential, must have a negative pregnancy test.

          -  Have signed Informed Consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Males

          -  Females who are pregnant or nursing.
