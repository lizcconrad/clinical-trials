  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing rotator cuff repair or subacromial decompression at the investigators
      institution are frequently hospitalized overnight due to inadequate pain relief after
      resolution of interscalene brachial plexus blocks. For ropivacaine 0.5%, the investigators
      usual local anesthetic, previous studies report an analgesic duration of 11.1 ± 5 hours
      without epinephrine and approximately 12 hours with epinephrine. Consequently, a method of
      prolonging analgesia from a brachial plexus block without the extra equipment and logistical
      difficulties of indwelling catheters would benefit both patients and caregivers. A potential
      approach is use of adjuvant drugs that prolong block duration when added to the local
      anesthetic.

      In addition to the usual adjuvant anesthetic drugs, investigators have begun to evaluate
      glucocorticoids as adjuvants for regional anesthesia. Known for their anti-inflammatory,
      analgesic, immunosuppressive, and antiemetic properties, these corticosteroids exert their
      effects by inhibition of phospholipase A2 as well as changes in cell function induced by
      glucocorticoid receptor activation. Although associated with significant toxicity when
      administered in large doses for long periods, emerging literature suggests that a single
      perioperative dose of glucocorticoid is safe. Several studies, including a recent trial at
      the investigators institution, have demonstrated the efficacy of dexamethasone in prolonging
      regional anesthetics. Available data thus suggest that combining glucocorticoids with local
      anesthetics prolongs block duration. However, systemic glucocorticoids have also been shown
      to reduce postoperative pain. This raises the question whether the beneficial effects of
      adding glucocorticoid to a regional anesthetic is solely due to local effect or is mediated
      at least in part by systemic action. Previous trials, however, have not addressed this
      important issue. If this beneficial effect of analgesic duration is mediated by systemic
      action, adding dexamethasone to the local anesthetic mixture may be unnecessary. Although no
      study has reported neurotoxicity from perineural dexamethasone and laboratory data appear to
      confirm the safety of this route, achieving similar results with more conventional
      administration would be desirable for two reasons. First, conventional intravenous dosing is
      convenient, useful for other reasons (for example, postoperative nausea prophylaxis), and
      well-studied. Second, equivalent (or not equivalent) results from systemic dosing would
      provide valuable information about the mechanism behind dexamethasone's effect on block
      duration.
