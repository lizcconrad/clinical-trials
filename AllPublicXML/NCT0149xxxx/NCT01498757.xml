      To explore biomarkers predictive of clinical response to Taxane/5-FU/platinum based
      chemotherapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. To identify negative predictive markers
      to 5-FU/platinum/Taxane. To elucidate signal transduction pathway attributable to
      5-FU/platinum/Taxane resistance. To analyze correlation between the quantity of circulating
      tumor cells and circulating endothelial cell precursors and treatment response to
      Taxane/5-FU/platinum based chemotherapy.
