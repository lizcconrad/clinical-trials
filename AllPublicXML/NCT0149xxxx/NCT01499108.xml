    <textblock>
      Background: Preclinical blood pressure (BP) data from studies of hypoglycemic effects of
      liraglutide treatment (the LEAD program), revealed a significant antihypertensive potential.
      The time course and the mechanism behind this effect are unknown.

      Objectives: To evaluate the time course of the antihypertensive effect of liraglutide
      treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes

      Design: Open-label study with intervention and subsequent washout period

      Patient Population: 35 hypertensive (SBP ≥130 mm Hg and DBP ≥80 mmHg) patients with type 2
      diabetes.

      Intervention: All patients will be treated with liraglutide 0.6 mg once daily for 7 days and
      will then be titrated to 1.2 mg once daily for 14 days and then titrated to 1.8 mg once daily
      for 4 weeks. This is followed by a washout period of 3 weeks without liraglutide treatment.

      Endpoints: 24-hour blood pressure, natriuresis, extra cellular volume (ECV

      Hypotheses Primary hypothesis • Liraglutide treatment causes a reduction in 24h BP

      Secondary hypothesis:

        -  The effect on BP may be mediated by an increase in natriuresis, thereby affecting ECV

        -  The effect on BP may be mediated by a decrease in arterial stiffness and central aortic
           pressure

      Purpose Primary purpose

      • To assess how quickly the antihypertensive effect of liraglutide treatment set in after
      initiation in patients with type 2 diabetes

      Secondary objectives

        -  To measure the effect of liraglutide treatment on natriuresis.

        -  To measure the effect of liraglutide treatment on ECV

        -  To measure the effect of liraglutide treatment on arterial stiffness

        -  To measure weight change after initiation of liraglutide treatment
