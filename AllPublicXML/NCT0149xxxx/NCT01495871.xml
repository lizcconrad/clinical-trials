  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in young people. It
      has been called the &quot;signature wound&quot; of the Iraq war because of its frequency among troops.
      TBI is associated with many chronic disabilities. Physical alterations include reduced
      exercise tolerance and profound muscle weakness, whereas psychological alterations include
      diminished sense of well-being, depression, fatigue and anxiety. Muscle and brain tissues
      rely upon circulating blood amino acids as precursors for metabolic functions. The
      investigators have shown that even one year after injury, plasma valine, an essential amino
      acid (EAA), was markedly reduced in patients with TBI compared to healthy controls. The
      investigators speculate that low plasma valine concentration contributes to chronic fatigue
      after TBI, since valine and tryptophan compete for the same transporter into the brain, and a
      low plasma valine concentration will allow more tryptophan to be transported. As a
      consequence, increased brain tryptophan will increase serotonin production, which may
      significantly contribute to the development of fatigue. Thus, the investigators will test if
      restoring valine concentration in persons with TBI may reduce fatigue perception and improve
      physical and neuropsychological function. Further, the investigators have previously shown
      that EAA intake has an anabolic effect in healthy young and elderly individuals. However, no
      data are currently available in persons recovering from TBI. Thus,the investigators will also
      test if EAA and/or valine can improve muscle mass in patients with TBI.

    <description>TBI patients are deficient in a number of essential amino acids (EAA) post injury and we have shown that TBI patient are deficient in valine up to 17 months post injury. We propose to assess plasma amino acid concentrations in TBI patients who are receiving EAA supplementation or valine supplementation compared to placebo patients.</description>

    <description>Reduced plasma EAAs may be related to the psychological and metabolic complications associated with TBIs. We aim to assess measures of psychological and physical functionality in TBI patients receiving EAA supplementation.</description>
