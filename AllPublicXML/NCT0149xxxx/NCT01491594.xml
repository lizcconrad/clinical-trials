  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the effect of eltrombopag on chemotherapy induced
      thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia is when there is a low number of platelets in the blood.
      Sometimes, thrombocytopenia occurs as a side effect of chemotherapy treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination chemotherapy regimen of gemcitabine and docetaxel has become an increasingly
      used treatment choice for subjects with advanced sarcomas. The regimen has shown activity in
      first and second line for subjects with metastatic uterine leiomyosarcoma,
      relapsed/refractory pediatric sarcomas, and improved progression-free survival and overall
      survival in persons with metastatic sarcoma when compared to gemcitabine alone. The regimen
      has additionally been recognized as a treatment option for subjects with advanced sarcoma.

      Chemotherapy-induced toxicity in the blood such as low platelet level is a common and often
      therapy-limiting side effect of treatment.

      There are two phases in this study. The purpose of the Phase I study is to determine the
      recommended dose of eltrombopag. The purpose of the Phase II study is to determine the
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy (how well the drug works) of eltrombopag in subjects who
      are receiving gemcitabine and docetaxel chemotherapy.

      Eltrombopag (Promacta) is an FDA approved drug for the treatment of chronic idiopathic
      thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)- a condition of having an abnormally low platelet count.
      Eltrombopag is now being further investigated for other thrombocytopenic (low
      platelet)disorders.

      Participants will take the assigned dose of eltrombopag once a day starting five days before
      each cycle of chemotherapy and for 5 days after chemotherapy. Eltrombopag is not taken on the
      day of chemotherapy. Eltrombopag is taken orally.
