  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle mass is normally maintained through the regulated balance between the processes of
      protein synthesis (i.e. making new muscle proteins) and protein breakdown (breaking down old
      muscle proteins). Proteins are composed of amino acids and we know that amino acids increase
      muscle protein synthesis. However, not all amino acids are the same. Essential amino acids
      are ones that must be consumed through food, while non-essential amino acids can be made by
      our body. Interestingly, the essential amino acids are all that are required to increase the
      rate of muscle protein synthesis. In addition, the essential amino acid leucine appears to be
      particularly important in regulating protein synthesis. However, how leucine is able to
      increase protein synthesis is not entirely understood. Previously, it has been shown that
      20-25 g of high-quality protein, such as that found in milk, appears to be the amount of
      protein that maximizes the rate of muscle protein synthesis after performing a bout of
      resistance exercise. Thus, we aim to measure the synthesis of new muscle proteins after
      ingesting the following:

        1. 25g whey protein

        2. 6.25g whey protein supplemented with leucine

        3. 6.25g whey protein supplemented with essential amino acids but no leucine

      Thus, we will measure muscle protein synthesis after consumption of the above beverages in a
      leg that has done no exercise ( ie. a rested leg) and in the other leg that has done
      resistance exercise. We hypothesize that 6.25g whey supplemented with leucine will stimulate
      muscle protein synthesis as effectively as 25g whey, but that 6.25g whey supplemented will
      all the essential amino acids except whey will be less effective at increasing muscle protein
      synthesis. Whey protein is a dairy based protein found in cow's milk, thus when you drink a
      glass of milk you are consuming some whey protein. However we are using an isolated form of
      whey protein, meaning it has been removed from milk. As mentioned previously, amino acids are
      'strung-together' to make protein. The 'essential' amino acids must be consumed through food
      because our body cannot make them, thus they are consumed when you eat protein rich foods
      like milk or chicken.
