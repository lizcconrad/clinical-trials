  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the safety of Pentaxim® vaccine as a three-dose primary vaccination at
      2, 3, and 4 months of age in order to meet the regulatory requirements for the license
      renewal as for any other product registered in China, and to generate additional clinical
      data using the three-dose primary vaccination schedule in some other Chinese provinces.

      Primary Objective

        -  To describe the safety after administration of PENTAXIM® at 2, 3, and 4 months of age in
           the study population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each study participant will receive an injection of PENTAXIM® at 2, 3, and 4 months of age
      and will be monitored for safety through the entire study period.

      The duration of each participant in the trial will be approximately 3 to 4 months.
