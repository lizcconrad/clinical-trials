    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the drug RAD001 in combination with another chemotherapy
      drug, Carboplatin, as well as radiation therapy in the treatment of esophageal cancer.
      Because RAD001 has not been used in this combination before, it is not clear which dose will
      be best when used in combination.

      The standard of care for patients who have esophageal cancer that has not moved to other
      areas of the body (non-metastatic) includes a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy
      and possibly surgery. If the patient chooses to participate in this study, the patient will
      receive chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The patient will possibly also have surgery to
      have the cancer removed. This decision will be made by the treating physicians. All of the
      chemotherapy the patient will receive on the study is considered standard chemotherapy for
      esophagus cancer. The investigators do not know as of yet if the drug called RAD001 will help
      improve the treatment for patients with this disease. RAD001 is a pill that has been used in
      many other types of cancer and has been proven to be effective in other cancers such as
      kidney cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is the sixth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Recent
      medical advances have led to small improvements in survival, but the overall rate of survival
      remains low, making new treatment approaches necessary.

      Chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy are often both used in treating esophageal cancer.
      The combination of oxaliplatin and capecitabine (XELOX) is a commonly used chemotherapy
      combination. Sometimes chemotherapy is given as an &quot;induction&quot; therapy, before the radiation
      is given.

      The drug RAD001 is a targeted drug that acts specifically on a protein inside cells (called
      mTOR), which is important for cancer development. The combination of RAD001 and radiation
      therapy has been shown to improve anti-cancer effects.

      This study will look for the ideal dose of RAD001 when given in combination with radiation
      therapy after induction chemotherapy with XELOX, and test the anticancer effects of this
      treatment approach in patients with esophageal cancer.

    <description>Patients receive XELOX comprising oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 120 minutes on day 1 and capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo radiotherapy (RT) 5 days a week for up to 6 weeks. Patients also receive carboplatin IV over 15 minutes to 24 hours once weekly for 5-6 weeks and RAD001 PO every other day (QOD) or once daily (QD) for 5-6 weeks during radiation therapy (RT). Patients with resectable disease undergo surgery.</description>
