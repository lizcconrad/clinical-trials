      This is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the ACTIVE memory training intervention and
      ACTIVE speed of processing training to waitlist, no-contact control conditions. Specific aims
      and hypotheses are:

      Aim 1: Evaluate the acceptability and usefulness of the ACTIVE memory intervention among
      Breast Cancer Survivors (BCS).

      Hypothesis 1: BCS assigned to the memory intervention arm will perceive the intervention as
      more acceptable and useful than BCS assigned to the attention control condition.

      Aim 2: Establish preliminary efficacy of the ACTIVE memory training intervention relative to
      the attention control and no-contact control conditions.

      Hypothesis 2: Memory training will result in greater memory enhancement immediately post and
      2-months post-intervention relative to attention control or no-contact control conditions.

    <textblock>
      Memory deficits are a prevalent, bothersome, and potentially debilitating symptom for
      millions of breast cancer survivors (BCS). Evidence-based treatment is difficult because
      there has been little intervention research in this area. Memory training may be a viable
      treatment option for BCS in need. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the
      acceptability, usefulness, and preliminary efficacy of the memory training intervention from
      the Advanced Cognitive Training in Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) trial, the largest controlled trial
      of cognitive interventions in the behavioral sciences. The memory training intervention will
      be compared to attention control and no-contact control groups. Specific aims are to (1)
      evaluate the acceptability and usefulness of the memory intervention in BCS and (2) establish
      preliminary efficacy of the ACTIVE memory training intervention relative to attention control
      and no-contact control conditions. Acceptability and usefulness will be assessed through
      self-report. Memory will be assessed through objective neuropsychological tests. A total of
      108 eligible BCS will be randomized to memory training, attention control, or no-contact
      control. A blinded and trained tester will perform data collection and neuropsychological
      testing at three time points: baseline prior to the intervention, immediately
      post-intervention, and 2 months post-intervention. Findings will provide information about
      the acceptability, usefulness, and preliminary efficacy of the ACTIVE memory training
      intervention on memory performance in BCS. Positive results will lead to a larger, full-scale
      study to determine efficacy of memory training interventions for BCS. Nursing interventional
      research in this area is vital to the development of evidence-based interventions to address
      memory deficits in BCS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. female gender (breast cancer is rare in men);

          2. self-reported memory impairment and desire for treatment (to focus on BCS in greatest
             need);

          3. first diagnosis of non-metastatic breast cancer (to control for multiple treatments or
             brain metastases in women with recurrent or metastatic disease);

          4. ≥ 1 year post-treatment including surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy (reduce
             confounding factors related to acute effects of treatment);32

          5. age ≥ 40 years (our prior studies indicate approximately 75% of BCS meet this
             criterion and reduce sample variability);

          6. post-menopausal (majority are post-menopausal at diagnosis and reduce sample
             variability); and

          7. able to read, write, understand, and speak English (to ensure informed consent).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Women will be excluded if they have other co-morbidities or deficits that would
        sufficiently impair performance or inhibit cognitive training including:

          1. substantial cognitive decline (score &lt; 24 on the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE);33

          2. history of stroke, encephalitis, traumatic brain injury, brain surgery, dementia,
             Alzheimer disease, or Parkinson disease;

          3. cranial radiation therapy or intrathecal therapy;

          4. current active major depression or substance abuse or history of bipolar disorder,
             psychosis, schizophrenia, or learning disability;

          5. history of or current other cancer except for basal cell skin cancer; or

          6. receiving other cognitive training (to avoid exposure to other training).
