    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effects on the body that PLX3397 on male
      subjects with CRPC.

      Secondary objectives include evaluating the safety and tolerability of PLX3397 and the
      antitumor effects that PLX3397 has on the the subjects.

    <description>Subject incidence of adverse events will be summarized. Adverse events will be tallied for overall frequency, worst reported severity, and relationship to study drug for each preferred term per subject. Serious adverse events will be similarly summarized.
Clinically significant changes in vital signs, ECGs and clinical laboratory tests (hematology and chemistry) will be summarized by changes from baseline to scheduled time points using descriptive statistics.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be monitored for disease progression using the following outcomes:
Prostate Serum Antigen (PSA). PSA will be measured every 8 weeks
Soft Tissue Disease. Target lesions will be measured via CT scan every 8 weeks
Bone Disease. Assessed via radionuclide bone scans and whole body MRIs every 8 weeks.
Time to Progression (TTP). Measured from start of treatment until progression.</description>
