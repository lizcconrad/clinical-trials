  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetics of iloperidone at different dose levels based on AUC (area under the plasma concentration time curve during a dosage interval) Cmax ss (maximum plasma concentration at steady state), Tmax ss (time to Cmax at steady state).</measure>

    <description>Pharmacokinetics describes the action of a drug in the body over a period of time. Blood samples are collected to measure plasma concentrations of the study drug at different times after dosing. From the plasma concentration data, AUC, Cmax ss, and Tmax ss are calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of treatment emergent adverse events, frequency of clinically notable changes from baseline in vital signs, electrocardiograms, laboratory tests, and reponses on movement disorder rating scales (Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale, Simpson-Angus Scale) and on a rating scale for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale)</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Clinical Global Impression of Improvement Scale (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, then Weekly for 2 weeks, then every 2-4 weeks for 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is scored from 1 to 7 and assesses the overall degree of illness relative to baseline. A CGI-I rating of 4 is equivalent to &quot;no change.&quot; Ratings less than 4 are equivalent to &quot;improvement&quot; and ratings of more than 4 are equivalent to &quot;worsening.&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Children's Global Asessment Scale (CGAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, then Weekly for 2 weeks, then every 2-4 weeks for 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGAS) is a numeric scale (1 through 100) used to rate the general functioning of children; high scores indicate better functioning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of iloperidone on QT, QT beat-to-beat (QTbtb), QT corrected using the Fridericia formulat (QTcF), QT corrected using the Bazett formula (QTcB), individual based correct QT (QTcI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (24 hours), Visit 3 (4-hours post initial dose), and Visit 7 (13 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Patients wear a holter monitor for ~24 hours during the baseline period, for an additional 4 hours after the first dose, and for ~13 hours after they have been on the same dose for at least 7 days to compare how the heart beats before and after the study drug is taken. The holter monitor transmits continuous data to a computer on how the heart beats for the time when the monitor is on and is a better measurement than data collected by a traditional electrocardiogram (ECG), which provides data on a limited number of heart beats over a short period of time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinically notable changes from baseline on electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters (QTcF, QTcB, QRS, PR, heart rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, baseline, 5x over 2 weeks, then every 2-4 weeks for 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Three ECGs are obtained for each assessment. The values are averaged for each ECG parameter (QTcF, QTcB, QRS, PR interval, heart rateare) and clinically notable changes from baseline and new or worsening heart rhythm disorders are identified</description>

Part B (optional extension phase): Patients who successfully complete Part A of the study are eligible to continue treatment with iloperidone for an additional 26 weeks</description>
