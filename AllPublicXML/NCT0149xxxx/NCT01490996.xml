  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral curcumin (complex C3, Sabinsa Corp, Utah) will be given to patients with inoperable
      colorectal metastases who will be commencing standard care oxaliplatin-based (FOLFOX)
      chemotherapy for up to 12 cycles(approximately 6 months) of treatment.

      Primary measurements focus on safety and tolerability. These will be recorded in real-time
      and report the number and severity of adverse events.

      Secondary measurements will include efficacy, (measured by response rate with RECIST and
      overall survival in months) supported by biomarker analysis.

      Hypothesis Combination of oral curcumin with FOLFOX-based chemotherapy will be a safe and
      tolerated regimen for long-term administration to patients with colorectal metastases.

      Primary objectives

      To establish a tolerated dose of daily oral curcumin to be taken long-term with FOLFOX-based
      chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer will be conducted to assess:

      1. Safety, tolerability and feasibility of administering oral curcumin at increasing doses
      escalating to 4 capsules (≈2 g C3-complex) during FOLFOX-based chemotherapy and continued for
      the duration of the chemotherapy course.

      Secondary objectives

        1. To observe any changes to the neuropathic side-effects of chemotherapy.

        2. To observe potential for efficacy in terms of disease response and survival.

        3. To identify putative biomarkers in plasma.

      This is a phase I/IIa study:

      Phase I will be a traditional escalation response design study (or 3+3+3) to firstly assess
      the safety of this combination and identify a maximum tolerated dose up to 4 g per day.

      Phase IIa will be a randomised control study comparing curcumin and FOLFOX with FOLFOX alone,
      recruited at a 2:1 ratio respectively.

    <description>Patients will start curcumin a week prior to chemotherapy. Upon completion of two cycles of therapy without dose-limiting toxicity in 3 consecutive patients, the dose will be escalated for the next 3 patients. Real-time adverse event reporting will be undertaken to record number and severity of events.</description>
