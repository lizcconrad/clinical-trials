  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin showed better treatment response compared with cremophor-based
      paclitaxel and carboplatin as first-line therapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer,
      especially for squamous cell cancer. The regimen of weekly nab-paclitaxel, carboplatin and
      concurrent radiotherapy was well tolerated in a phase I study. Given nab-paclitaxel,
      carboplatin and concurrent radiotherapy in patients with local advanced squamous cell lung
      cancer may have promising result.

      This study was conducted to explore the efficacy and toxicity of concurrent chemoradiotherapy
      with nab-paclitaxel, carboplatin and thoracic radiotherapy in unresectable local advanced
      squamous cell lung cancer. Patients will be given nab-paclitaxel weekly at a dose of 60mg/m2,
      in combination with carboplatin (AUC 2) weekly during concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Thoracic
      radiation was administered at a dose of 66 Gy/33 fractions, both 3 dimensional conformal and
      intensity modulated radiation therapy are allowed. Two cycles of consolidation therapy with
      full dose nab-paclitaxel (260 mg/m2 on day 1) and carboplatin (AUC 6 on day 1) every 21 day
      will be delivered.
