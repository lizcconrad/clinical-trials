      This study is a Phase I/II open label, multi-centre trial. Patients with HER2+ve metastatic
      breast cancer, following disease progression during, or after, treatment with trastuzumab and
      taxanes, will be treated with Lapatinib (Tyverb™ 500-1250 mg orally daily - depending on the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determined in the Phase I part of the study) plus Myocet™, 50-60
      mg/m2 i.v q3 weeks).

      Within the Phase I part, doses are assigned at registration according to the dose escalation
      scheme.

      The dose for the Phase II part of the trial will be based on the MTD established in the Phase
      I part of the study.

      Clinical and laboratory parameters will be assessed to evaluate disease response and toxicity
      of study therapy. Safety assessments will be performed every 3 weeks for the first 24 weeks.
      Efficacy assessments (radiological examination) will be performed on all patients every 8
      weeks (± 7 days) for the first 24 weeks. Cardiotoxicity assessments will be performed at
      weeks 6 and 12. From week 24, safety, efficacy and cardiotoxicity assessments will be
      performed every 12 weeks and at the end of treatment (disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity or patient withdraws consent).

      Primary Objective:

        1. To determine the optimal dose for lapatinib plus Myocet™, in combination, in patients
           with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer following disease progression during, or
           after, treatment with trastuzumab and taxanes (Phase I).

        2. To evaluate the 6 month progression-free survival of patients with HER2-positive
           metastatic breast cancer, following disease progression during, or after, treatment with
           trastuzumab and taxanes, who are treated with lapatinib plus Myocet™ (Phase II plus
           patients treated at MTD in Phase I).

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the overall survival time, duration of progression -free survival, time to
           treatment failure, confirmed tumour response rate and duration of response in patients
           treated with this regimen (Phase II plus patients treated at MTD in Phase I).

        2. To assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        3. To assess the incidence of cardiotoxicity in these patients treated with this regimen.
