  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents receive anticipatory guidance
      about violence prevention as part of the routine well child visit. Educational resources are
      needed to help physicians routinely provide these important anticipatory guidance messages.
      In this study, consecutive parents will be exposed to routine anticipatory guidance messages
      before the well child visit with the physician. After the clinic visit, parents will be
      invited to participate in a research study to determine if they plan any changes at home. The
      key research question of this study is:

      Can a brief multimedia program (i.e. Play Nicely program) and/or the AAP Connected Kids
      brochure, entitled, &quot;Pulling the Plug on TV Violence&quot;, help parents develop plans to
      decreases their children's exposure to violence in the media (e.g. less media time, no TV in
      the bedroom)?
