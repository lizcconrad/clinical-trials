  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted in a population of patients with chronic phase Chronic Myeloid
      Leukemia (CML) to learn more about how patients follow prescribed regimens for taking oral
      cancer drugs.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled pilot study to introduce eMedonline telemonitoring
      technology to CML patients taking Gleevec or Tasigna. eMedonline will be used to
      automatically collect time-dose specific medication data for individual patients, including
      dosing times, missed doses, adverse events and e-diary data. All data will be available to
      research staff for remote review via Web interface. Adverse events and non-adherence will
      prompt interventions including supportive care counseling.

    <measure>eMedonline will be used to measure non-compliance in taking oral drug regimens.</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6 months, non-compliance will be measured in each arm of study</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are stratified to one of two groups: Group 1 is pateints on Gleevec or Tasigna who have been on drug less than 6 months; Group 2 is patients on Gleevec or Tasigna who have been on drug for equal to or more than 6 months.
Group 1 is then divided into 2 groups: one using eMedonline for 3 months and the other not using eMedonline for 3 months. A crossover survey and pill counts will be done at the 3 month timepoint and then the groups will switch their access status to eMedonline.</description>
