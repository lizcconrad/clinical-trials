  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence has pointed to distinct alterations of brain functions in obese subjects some
      of which may even be causative for their obesity. The objective of this study was to examine
      food and non food related alterations in brain functions after excessive weight loss due to
      Roux-en Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB), one of the most successful therapeutic approaches
      for long lasting weight loss. The investigators hypothesized that obese as compared with lean
      women show an altered activation pattern in the brain areas involved in the homeostatic
      regulation of eating behavior, i.e. the hypothalamus, in reward-related brain areas, such as
      the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) and the striatum as well as in prefrontal inhibitory control
      areas. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesized that women who had undergone a RYGB
      operation show a brain activity pattern that more closely mimics that of lean than severely
      obese women. In a supplementary test the investigators will assess gastrointestinal and
      metabolic response to a standardized meal in order to elucidate putative correlation of these
      responses with the results of fMRI scannings.

        Severely obese (body mass index; BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2) women and previously severely obese women
        who had undergone a Roux-en Y gastric bypass operation were recruited from the
        Interdisciplinary Obesity Center, cantonal hospital St. Gallen (Switzerland), and the
        adiposity platform of the University of T端bingen.

        lean control women were recruited in St. Gallen and in T端bingen
