      Rationale

      Currently, hepatic resection is often the only curative treatment for primary or secondary
      hepatic malignancies and is also frequently performed in patients with benign liver tumors to
      prevent malignant transformation and/or alleviate symptoms. Liver resections are nowadays
      associated with low mortality and acceptable morbidity. As result of that, an increasing
      number of patients is currently under consideration for resection of more complex or large
      tumors, thus requiring extensive resection procedures. Application of vascular exclusion
      (i.e., clamping of the portal vein and hepatic artery) during such procedures reduces blood
      loss, which is one of the most important factors affecting peri-operative outcomes. However,
      vascular exclusion leads to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury as an inevitable side-effect,
      which adversely impacts postoperative liver function and regeneration. Additional cooling of
      the liver by means of hypothermic perfusion is expected to further reduce intraoperative
      blood loss, as well as to protect the liver from I/R injury. Therefore, the aim of this pilot
      study is to cool the future remnant liver (FRL) in situ during right hemihepatectomy under
      vascular exclusion. Consequently, an overall improvement in postoperative outcomes is
      expected due to a decrease in intraoperative blood loss, reduced parenchymal damage, and a
      better ability of the liver remnant to regenerate.

      Objective

      To reduce intraoperative blood loss and enhance tolerance of the FRL to I/R injury during
      right hemihepatectomy under vascular exclusion by means of in situ hypothermic perfusion with
      retrograde outflow (R-IHP) of the FRL.

      Study design

      The study is designed as a prospective randomized pilot study in 18 patients (9 interventions
      and 9 controls) to assess the effects of the proposed intervention. Additionally, 4 patients
      will be included separately for assessment of the intervention's feasibility prior to
      randomized inclusion.

      Study population

      Eligible patients for participation in this study are those planned to undergo right
      hemihepatectomy under vascular inflow occlusion because of a malignant or benign liver tumor,
      and who do not suffer from any hepatic co-morbidity that might influence postoperative
      outcomes (i.e., severe steatosis, cholestasis, cirrhosis, or hepatitis B/C infection).

      Intervention

      During right hemihepatectomy, the FRL of patients allocated to the intervention group will be
      perfused with a chilled perfusion solution (i.e., lactated Ringer's solution).
