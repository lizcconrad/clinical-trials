      The purpose of this study is to compare the use of modern ring external fixation versus
      internal fixation for fracture stabilization of severe open tibia fractures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe open fractures of the tibia (shin) bone are difficult to treat and are associated with
      high rates of infection and other complications. There is controversy regarding the best
      treatment, particularly in fractures with large wounds from trauma. The two current standard
      treatment options are to place an internal fixation device (a nail or plates with screws) or
      to use a device with pins that stick out of the skin and attach to rings outside the body
      (modern ring external fixator). It is unknown which of these standard of care treatment
      options will result in lower complication rates and better function of the leg.

      Our goal is to perform a multi-center randomized controlled trial of the use of modern ring
      external fixation versus internal fixation for fracture stabilization of severe open tibia
      fractures. Patients who refuse randomization have the option of participating in a
      prospective observational study and the treatment is decided by the surgeon and patient.

      Primary Aim: To compare the outcomes associated with modern ring external fixators versus
      standard internal fixation techniques in treating &quot;severe&quot; open tibia shaft or metaphyseal
      fractures with or without a bone defect of any size.

      Primary Hypothesis: Among patients with open tibia shaft or metaphyseal fractures (with or
      without a bone defect of any size), the rate of re-hospitalization for major limb
      complications will be lower for patients treated with ring fixators than those treated with
      standard internal fixation.

      Secondary Hypotheses: Among patients with open tibia shaft or metaphyseal fractures (with or
      without a bone defect of any size), the overall rate of infections will be lower for patients
      treated with ring fixators than those treated with standard internal fixation. Measures of
      fracture healing, limb function, and patient reported outcomes (including pain) will be as
      good or better among patients treated with ring fixators than those treated with standard
      internal fixation.

      Secondary Aim #1: To determine the percentage of Gustilo IIIB open tibia shaft fractures that
      can be treated successfully (i.e. without amputation) without a soft tissue flap secondary to
      the use of ring external fixators.

      Secondary Aim #2: To determine the two-year treatment costs associated with fixation of
      &quot;severe&quot; open tibia shaft or metaphyseal fractures (with or without a bone defect of any
      size) using modern ring external fixators versus standard internal fixation techniques.

      Secondary Aim #3: To determine patient reported levels of satisfaction with the fixation
      method and overall treatment and to compare satisfaction between the two treatment groups.

    <description>A hospital re-admission for a complication is defined as any re-admission to the hospital secondary to the treatment of the open tibia fracture for a defined set of complications. The list of complications includes: amputation (at any level), infection (defined using CDC criteria), flap failure, non-union, mal-union, loss of reduction, or hardware failure.</description>

    <description>Modern ring external fixator is defined as any fixator that has at least 1 ring proximal and 1 ring distal to the fracture site. The rings may be connected to the tibia using any combination of external fixation pins or wires at the surgeon's discretion. There must be at least two pins or wires connected to each ring, and typically there will be at least three pins or wires. Any FDA approved ring fixator meeting this definition from any manufacturer is allowed.</description>

    <intervention_name>Definitive fixation with a locked IM nail or plate</intervention_name>
    <description>Eligible patients with tibial diaphyseal fractures will typically receive a standard locked IM Nail. The nail must use at least one static interlock proximal to and one static interlock distal to the fracture site. The nail may be placed with either a reamed or unreamed technique.
Methaphyseal fractures, especially those with fracture lines extending into the joint may be more commonly treated with plate fixation. The plate may be applied in an open or percutaneous fashion. Any combination of locked and/or non-locked screws may be used.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All open tibia fractures meeting at least one of 1 the following criteria:

               -  Diaphyseal or metaphyseal Type IIIB (Gustilo IIIB Fractures are open fractures
                  that require either a rotational or free flap for coverage of a soft tissue
                  defect).

               -  Diaphyseal or metaphyseal Type IIIA where extensive contamination or muscle
                  damage (e.g. all military injuries from IED) precludes nail/plate placement at
                  first debridement.

               -  Diaphyseal or metaphyseal Type IIIA, where injury would have been classified as a
                  IIIB, but because enough muscle was removed, the skin could be closed.

               -  Diaphyseal or metaphyseal Type IIIA, where after debridement, bone gap is greater
                  than 1cm.

               -  Diaphyseal or metaphyseal Type IIIA, where fasciotomies were performed for
                  impending or diagnosed compartment syndrome, and wounds could not be closed
                  primarily (i.e. needs skin grafting).

          2. Ages 18 - 64 years inclusive

          3. Study fracture is suitable for limb salvage using either a modern ring external
             fixator or internal fixation (internal fixation =locked intramedullary nail or plate).

        Inclusion notes:

          1. Patients may have co-existing non-tibial infection, with or without antibiotic
             treatment.

          2. Patients may have risk factors for infection including diabetes, immunosuppression
             from steroids or other medications, HIV, or other infections.

          3. Patients may have a traumatic brain injury.

          4. Patients may be treated initially with a temporary external fixator prior to
             randomization.

          5. Patients may be treated initially at an outside institution prior to transfer to the
             study institution, as long as the definitive fixation was not performed prior to
             entrance into the study.

          6. Patients with bilateral injuries that meet inclusion criteria may be included, but
             only the limb rated as &quot;more severe&quot; by the treating surgeon will be enrolled in the
             study.

          7. Fractures may have a gap after debridement of any size, including no gap.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients presenting with a traumatic amputation of the tibia

          2. Patients already received definitive fixation with an IM nail, plate or ring fixator
             prior to study enrollment

          3. Tibia already infected as diagnosed by a surgeon and currently receiving treatment for
             it

          4. Patient speaks neither English nor Spanish

          5. Patient is a prisoner

          6. Patient has been diagnosed with a severe psychiatric condition

          7. Patient is intellectually challenged without adequate family support

          8. Patient lives outside the catchment area

          9. Non-ambulatory patient due to an associated complete spinal cord injury

         10. Non-ambulatory before the injury due to a pre-existing condition.

         11. Complex pilon and plateau fractures. The study tibia fracture may have extension into
             the joint surface, but should primarily be a metaphyseal or diaphyseal fracture and
             not have an ipsilateral tibial plateau or pilon fracture.Contralateral tibial plateau
             and pilon fractures are allowed
