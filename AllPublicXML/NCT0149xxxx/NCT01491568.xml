      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using the investigational implant
      (rhBMP-2/CRM with the CD HORIZON® Spinal System) as a method of facilitating posterolateral
      lumbar spinal fusion at two adjacent treatment levels in patients with symptomatic
      degenerative disc disease.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Has degenerative disc disease at two adjacent lumbar levels as noted by back pain of
             discogenic origin, with or without leg pain, with degeneration of the disc confirmed
             by patient history and radiographic studies to include one or more of the following:

               -  instability;

               -  osteophyte formation;

               -  decreased disc height;

               -  thickening of ligamentous tissue;

               -  disc degeneration or herniation; and/or

               -  facet joint degeneration.

          2. Has preoperative Oswestry score &gt;= 30.

          3. Has no greater than Grade 1 spondylolisthesis utilizing Meyerding's Classification
             (Meyerding, HW, 1932) at either treatment level.

          4. Requires fusion at two adjacent lumbar levels from L1 to S1.

          5. Is at least 18 years of age, inclusive, at the time of surgery.

          6. Has not responded to non-operative treatment( e.g., bed rest, physical therapy,
             medications, spinal injections, manipulation, and/or TENS) for a period of 6 months.

          7. If a female of child-bearing potential, patient is non-pregnant and non-nursing and
             agrees to not become pregnant for 1 year following surgery.

          8. Is willing and able to comply with the study plan and sign the Patient Informed
             Consent Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has primary diagnosis of a spinal disorder other than degenerative disc disease with
             Grade 1 or less spondylolisthesis at the involved levels.

          2. Has had previous spinal fusion surgical procedure(s) at the involved levels.

          3. Requires spinal fusion at more than two lumbar levels.

          4. Has a condition that requires postoperative medications that interfere with fusion,
             such as steroids or prolonged use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, excluding
             routine perioperative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This does not include low
             dose aspirin for prophylactic anticoagulation.

          5. Has been previously diagnosed with osteopenia, osteomalacia, or osteoporosis, or has

                  -3.6, - 3.7, etc.) or a T score of -2.5 or lower( i.e., -2.6,

               -  2.7, etc.) with vertebral crush fracture, then the patient is excluded from the
                  study.

          6. Has presence of active malignancy or prior history of malignancy (except for basal
             cell carcinoma of the skin).

          7. Has overt or active bacterial infection, either local or systemic.

          8. Has a documented titanium alloy allergy or intolerance.

         14. Has a history of autoimmune disease.

         15. Has a history of exposure to injectable collagen or silicone implants.

         16. Has a history of hypersensitivity to protein pharmaceuticals (monoclonal antibodies or
             gamma globulins) or collagen.

         17. Has received treatment with an investigational therapy within 28 days prior to
             implantation surgery or such treatment is planned during the 16 weeks following
             rhBMP-2/CRM implantation.

         18. Has received any previous exposure to any/all BMPs of either human or animal
             extraction.
