  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous investigations and anecdotal experience have shown safety and utility of Noninvasive
      Positive Pressure Ventilation/Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (NIPPV/BiPAP) for the
      treatment of asthma in children. If NIPPV/BiPAP can be shown to have a beneficial effect in
      children with respiratory insufficiency, emergency department and ICU stays may be shortened,
      and the need for more invasive and dangerous airway procedures may be decreased. This would
      result in a change in the standard of care for asthma treatment in emergency departments. The
      investigators hypothesis is that the use of this new NIPPV, in conjunction with current
      standard of care therapies, in acute moderate to severe asthma exacerbations will lead to a
      more rapid improvement in patient ventilation, faster resolution of respiratory distress, and
      overall improved secondary outcomes.

    <description>The primary outcome indicator will be a decrease in PAS to ≤ to 7 to occur 3 hours faster in the NIPPV/BiPAP group as compared to the control group (median expected time to PAS 7 ≤ in BiPAP group is 5 hours; median expected time to PAS ≤ 7 in control group is 8 hours; hazard ratio is 1.6). A total sample size of 366 (122 in each group) is required for 80% power and a significance level of 0.05 (2 tailed test). With an estimated 20% drop out rate will anticipate 147 subjects enrolled per arm for a total of 441 subjects enrolled.</description>
