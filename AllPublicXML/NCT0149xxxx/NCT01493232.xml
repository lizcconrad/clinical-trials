  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized clinical trial to compare the patients' satisfaction of complete dentures
      with different occlusal forms, after simple randomized sampling of 15 participant that will
      be signed informed consent and their latest teeth was extracted 3 month ago, will be
      selected. For each participant, it will be made 3 set of complete dentures that are variable
      in occlusion only. During the study, dissatisfied participants can leave it. Each set will be
      inserted for 1month in 5 participant randomly. The participants will be examined in two
      stages, after a day and after a week. At the end of month the questionaire will be filled out
      and the pressure under the mandibular denture base will be measured with the pressure
      sensors. Then the second and third denture will be inserted simultaneously.
