  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Buspirone is a drug that is approved for the treatment of anxiety in adults. Studies
      suggest that buspirone might act on parts of the brain that can increase certain levels of
      brain activity. Increasing this brain activity may help decrease epileptic seizures that come
      from certain parts of the brain. Researchers want to see if buspirone can reduce seizure
      frequency in people with seizures who are already taking antiseizure medication.

      Objectives:

      - To test whether buspirone can reduce the frequency of seizures in people whose seizures
      seem to start from one part of the brain.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age who have seizures coming from one or more
           places in the brain.

        -  Participants must have tried at least two different antiseizure medications. They must
           also have had at least three seizures during a 1-month observation period while on
           current medicines.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have a screening visit with a physical exam and medical history.
           Participants will complete mood and memory testing scales. Blood, urine, and saliva
           samples will be collected.

        -  Participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging scan to evaluate brain structures
           that relate to epilepsy. They will also have a positron emission tomography scan to look
           at parts of the brain that are affected by buspirone.

        -  Participants will start taking a study drug (either buspirone or placebo) twice daily.
           They will keep a calendar of seizures and record any side effects. Treatment will be
           monitored with clinic visits and blood samples.

        -  After 12 weeks on the study drug, participants will gradually stop taking either the
           placebo or buspirone over two weeks. They will stay off the drug for another 2 weeks.

        -  After 2 weeks, participants will start taking a study drug that is the opposite of the
           one they had before. They will keep a calendar of seizures and record any side effects.
           Treatment will be monitored with clinic visits and blood samples.

        -  After 12 weeks on the study drug, participants will gradually stop taking either the
           placebo or buspirone.

        -  Participants will have a final followup visit with additional blood tests, mood and
           memory testing scales and imaging studies.

      OBJECTIVE:

      To initiate a pilot clinical trial assessing the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the
      5HT1A receptor agonist buspirone in patients with localization-related epilepsy. Buspirone is
      a 5HT1A receptor agonist that is approved for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Patients
      with localization-related epilepsy have reduced 5HT1A receptor binding on 18FCWAY positron
      emission tomography (PET). Increasing neurotransmitter activity at 5HT1A receptor sites may
      ameliorate seizures.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Forty patients with localization-related epilepsy

      DESIGN:

      A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over, phase II clinical trial.

      The trial will have a screening phase in which each patient will undergo physical and
      neurological examination, and standard blood tests, followed by a one month baseline phase.
      At the end of baseline, patients who qualify will have neuropsychological, anxiety, and mood
      evaluation, FCWAY PET and MRI (if imaging was not performed already). During the subsequent
      first study phase, patients will be randomized to buspirone or matching placebo. After
      completion of the first study phase, patients will be crossed over to the alternate study
      arm. At the end of the study, any patient who wishes to do so may remain on open-label
      buspirone.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

        1. Difference in seizure rate comparing the 3 month placebo and active study phases

        2. Neuropsychological, anxiety, and mood indices comparing the 3 month placebo and active
           study drug phases
