    <textblock>
      Hysterectomy is one of the common operations in gynecology. With population aging in modern
      society, the incidence of these surgeries is expected to increase even more. One of the major
      complications of pelvic surgery is symptomatic pelvic hematoma, which can present with pain,
      fever, and foul smelling discharge. The incidence of pelvic hematoma is 40%, and varies
      according to the type of hysterectomy and the diagnostic procedure. Those hematoma increase
      the risk for infection. Diagnosis usually is not a clinical one unless symptoms occur, and
      then the diagnosis is made by CT or ultrasound. Number of interventions are mentioned in the
      literature to try and decrease post operative complications and infections, none have
      suggested effective enough. This is a prospective study which objective is to characterize
      the incidence of pelvic hematoma following hysterectomy using ultrasound. The investigators
      will also try to identify preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative risk factors for
      infection of this hematomas. This identification might decrease the incidence of
      postoperative hematoma and infection.
