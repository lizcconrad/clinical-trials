      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad of two treatment methods
      on subjects and their cancer.

      Proton beam radiation therapy is one of the treatments for men with prostate cancer who have
      localized disease. The benefit of the combination with androgen suppression is not completely
      understood. This study will compare the use of hypofraction proton therapy (28 treatments)
      alone to proton therapy with androgen suppression therapy.

    <description>To determine if androgen suppression along with radiation therapy will result in a higher freedom from failure (FFF) than radiation therapy without androgen suppression.
Freedom from failure (FFF): The events for FFF will be the first occurrence of clinical failure (local recurrence, regional recurrence, or distant metastasis), biochemical failure by the Phoenix definition (PSA ≥ 2 ng/ml over the current nadir PSA) (45) discounting bounces per investigator discretion, or the start of salvage therapy including androgen suppression</description>

             molecular weight heparin, Clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix), or equivalent (unless it can

          -  Major medical, addictive or psychiatric illness which in the investigator's opinion,
