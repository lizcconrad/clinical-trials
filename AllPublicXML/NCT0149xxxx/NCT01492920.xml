      This randomized phase III trial studies how well acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride works
      compared to a placebo in preventing peripheral neuropathy in patients with recurrent ovarian
      epithelial cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer undergoing
      chemotherapy. Acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride may prevent or lessen peripheral neuropathy
      caused by chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride is more
      effective compared to a placebo in preventing peripheral neuropathy caused by chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride (ALC) in preventing
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in patients with recurrent ovarian, primary
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effect of ALC on chemotherapy-induced fatigue based upon the Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Fatigue scale.

      II. Evaluate the effect of ALC on sensory peripheral neuropathy as measured with the first 4
      items of the FACT/Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)-Neurotoxicity (Ntx) subscale
      (FACT/GOG-Ntx_4 subscale).

      III. Evaluate the effect of ALC on the health-related quality of life as measured by the
      FACT-Ovarian (O) trial outcome index (TOI).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to planned dosage of
      paclitaxel (&lt; 150 mg/m^2 vs ≥ 150 mg/m^2), and age (&lt; 60 years of age vs ≥ 6 years of age).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive acetyl-L-carnitine hydrochloride (ALC) orally (PO) twice daily (BID)
      on days 1-21 (during chemotherapy treatment).

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID on days 1-21 (during chemotherapy treatment) (maximum
      of 8 courses).

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients also complete questionnaires comprising the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy
      (FACT)-Fatigue scale, the FACT-Gynecologic Oncology Group Neurotoxicity subscale
      (FACT/GOG-Ntx_4 subscale), and the FACT-Ovarian trial outcome index (FACT-O TOI) at baseline,
      prior to courses 3 and 5, within 4 weeks after completion of treatment, and then at 3 months
      after completion of treatment.
