    <description>Response to a constant (duration, pressure, temperature, distance from target) jet of air applied to a hypersensitive tooth was evaluated using Schiff Cold Air Sensitivity Scale. According to this analog scale hypersensitivity scores for the stimulated tooth is 0, 1, 2 or 3 (lower the score, lower the hypersensitivity).0= no response; 1= response and no discontinuation request; 2= response and discontinuation request; 3= painful response and discontinuation request. Change was calculated as Schiff score immediately after treatment minus Schiff score at baseline.</description>

    <description>Measured with an electronic force sensing probe (Yeaple Probe): 10, 20, 30, 40, up to 80 grams of force applied to hypersensitive tooth until pain was elicited. Grams of force needed to elicit pain was recorded as hypersensitivity score for the tooth. The higher the score, the lower the hypersensitivity. Hypersensitivity scores on a per study participant basis was recorded as mean scores of all hypersensitive teeth.

          <description>Response to a constant (duration, pressure, temperature, distance from target) jet of air applied to a hypersensitive tooth was evaluated using Schiff Cold Air Sensitivity Scale. According to this analog scale hypersensitivity scores for the stimulated tooth is 0, 1, 2 or 3 (lower the score, lower the hypersensitivity).0= no response; 1= response and no discontinuation request; 2= response and discontinuation request; 3= painful response and discontinuation request. Change was calculated as Schiff score immediately after treatment minus Schiff score at baseline.</description>

        <description>Measured with an electronic force sensing probe (Yeaple Probe): 10, 20, 30, 40, up to 80 grams of force applied to hypersensitive tooth until pain was elicited. Grams of force needed to elicit pain was recorded as hypersensitivity score for the tooth. The higher the score, the lower the hypersensitivity. Hypersensitivity scores on a per study participant basis was recorded as mean scores of all hypersensitive teeth. Change was calculated as mean score at Day 14 minus mean score at baseline.</description>
