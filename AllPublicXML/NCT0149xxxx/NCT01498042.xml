  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is among the most disabilitating diseases worldwide in terms of numbers affected and
      its consequences. A relatively new and well documented treatment of acute ischemic stroke
      today is tPA (tissue plasminogen activator; will be called thrombolysis from now on)
      Unfortunately only a minority of patients is given this treatment.

      The large randomised controlled trials that investigated the safety and efficacy of
      thrombolytic therapy in treatment of acute stroke did not include patients over 80 years. In
      an aging population in the western world it will be of importance to investigate whether this
      treatment is safe and effective in this group.

      Both Sorlandet hospital Kristiansand Norway and Bergen hospital have administered
      thrombolysis to selected patients over 80 years the last years. In addition there has been a
      registration of patients in stroke registers at both locations. This lays a foundation for
      further investigation. In association with Bergen the investigators have included 77 patients
      over 80 years treated with thrombolysis. In addition the investigators have 85 patients
      treated with tpa below 80 years. In our cohort the investigators are going to compare outcome
      in the 2 groups. In addition the investigators are going to perform a regression analysis of
      selected variables to see if there is an association of those variables with predefined
      outcome measures. Our outcome measures is as follows: mRS=6 (death)and mRS 0-1(good outcome)
      on 3 months control. The third outcome measure will be developement of sICH secondary to tPA
      treatment. As definition of sICH we have chosen the same definition as Ecass.

        Sorlandet hospital is a secondary hospital. The patients will be drawn from thrombolysis
        treated patients in its catchement area. A registry of these patients has been ongoing
        since before the inclusiondate. All thrombolysed patients at Sorlandet will be included in
        the predefined inclusionperiode. In addition we have enrolled 39 patients treated with
        thrombolysis from Haukeland hospital; Bergen. These 77 patients over 80 years will be
        compared to 85 patients below 80 years treated at SSK in the same defined periode.
