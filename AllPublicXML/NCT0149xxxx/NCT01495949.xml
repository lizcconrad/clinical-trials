  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During induction for cardiac surgery, patient hemodynamic stability is achieved by using
      anesthetic drugs which least affects hemodynamics such as benzodiazepines, etomidate.
      Etomidate although has been used for a long time but its safety regarding cortisol synthesis
      suppression is still doubtful. This study measures the changes in cortisol levels during
      cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass by comparison between two inductive
      agents (etomidate and thiopentone). Recording data also include hemodynamic changes during
      induction, inotropic use for coming of cardiopulmonary bypass, blood glucose levels, amount
      of insulin usage, length of ICU and hospital saty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ninety-two cardiac patients who undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass graft (CABG) or valve
      surgery will be enrolled in this study. They will be randomized into two groups (thiopentone
      and etomidate groups). Apart from different in two inductive drugs, other anesthetics will be
      the same. We record hemodynamic changes during inductions, inotropic use (dose and duration),
      blood glucose levels, total insulin requirement to keep blood glucose 140-180 mg% in
      perioperative period, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in ICU and total
      hospital length of stay. The changes in cortisol levels will be recorded at time 0 (before
      induction), 2, 4, 8, 24 hours in 26 patients (13 patients in each group and only patients who
      are the first in the operating list (morning list)).The 26 patients is needed from sample
      size equation for the changes in cortisol level and the 92 patients is calculated from the
      differences in inotropic use.
