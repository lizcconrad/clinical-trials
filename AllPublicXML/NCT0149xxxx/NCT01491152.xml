  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Palsy (CP) is the most common cause of physical disability in childhood. Up to day
      the investigators have treated children diagnosed cerebral palsy with side-alternating whole
      body vibration (System Galileo®) from the age of two years on. Considering verticalisation
      (standing and walking) at about 12 months of age in a normal developing child the
      investigators suggest the introduction of verticalisation with whole body vibration to a
      child with CP at this early age in order to enhance motor development and participation.

      In this pilot study the investigators will test the feasibility and the effect on motor
      development of whole body vibration in children with CP from 12 months of age. The
      investigators will investigate the effect of whole body vibration on motor performance,
      independence in all day living situations, quality of life and contractures compared to a
      control group.

    <description>Training compliance will be evaluated by the number of completed training units during the 14-week training period at home. Each training session will be documented in the patient diary (training protocol). Additionally the Galileo® WBV system will automatically record all training sessions performed on the device as date, time and duration of training session.</description>
