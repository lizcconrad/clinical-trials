  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind, fixed dose, parallel group study to characterize the dose response of
      ropinirole PR as adjunctive therapy to L-dopa in patients with late stage Parkinson's
      disease. The primary endpoint of this study, mean change from baseline in total awake time
      spent &quot;off' is the same endpoint as used in the ropinirole PR pivotal study for advanced
      Parkinson's disease patients. This study includes a wide range of ropinirole doses (4-24mg)
      with the 8mg, 12mg, and 16mg per day doses powered to detect a 1.7 hour difference in total
      awake time spent &quot;off&quot; compared with placebo. The dose of Ldopa will remain stable through
      the study, unless the subject experiences tolerability issues that require an L-dopa dose
      reduction. Up to three L-dopa dose reductions are allowed, making a total reduction of up to
      approximately 30%. Keeping the L-dopa dose constant where possible is important to avoid
      confounding the efficacy data. Clinical review of the primary and secondary endpoints will be
      performed in order to establish the lowest maximally effective therapeutic dose.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4 of the Maintenance Period (Study Week 17)</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;Off&quot; time is defined as the state in which the participants(par) symptoms include lack of mobility(bradykinesia) with or without additional features such as tremor or rigidity. Par were asked to record awake time &quot;off &quot;, awake time &quot;on&quot;, troublesome dyskinesias(TD) during awake time &quot;on&quot;, or time asleep for 30 minute intervals in 24 hr diary cards for 2 days preceding visits. Total number of awake hrs spent &quot;off&quot; per 24-hr period was the average of the 2 diary cards of the sum of awake hours spent &quot;off&quot; in each 24-hr diary card. BL is the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose, change from BL was calculated by subtracting the BL values from the MP Week 4 values. Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) model used BL total awake time 'Off', treatment, visit and treatment by visit</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (according to modified Hoehn &amp; Yahr
             criteria Stages II-IV) and demonstrating lack of control with L-dopa therapy (e.g.

        end of dose akinesia, simple on/off fluctuations).

          -  Subjects receiving a stable dose of L-dopa for at least 4 weeks prior to screening.

          -  A minimum of 3 hours awake &quot;off-time&quot; for each diary day recorded during the baseline
             period.

          -  Men or non-pregnant/non-breast-feeding women of at least 30 years of age at screening.
             Women of child-bearing potential must be practicing a clinically accepted method of
             contraception during the study and for at least one month prior to randomization and
             one month following completion of the study. Acceptable contraceptive methods include
             abstinence, oral contraception, injectable progestogen, implants of levonorgestrel,
             estrogenic vaginal ring, percutaneous contraceptive patches, surgical sterilisation,
             male partner sterilization, intrauterine device [IUD], or double barrier method:
             condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) plus spermicidal agent
             (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.

          -  Provide written informed consent for this study.

          -  Be willing and able to comply with study procedures, including diary card completion
             and follow-up clinic visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Late stage advanced subjects demonstrating incapacitating peak dose or diphasic
             dyskinesia on their stable dose of L-dopa

          -  Consumption of any dopamine agonist, including ropinirole, within four weeks of
             randomization in the study.

          -  Subjects with severe, clinically significant condition(s) other than Parkinson's
             disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, would render the subject unsuitable
             for the study (e.g., psychiatric, haematological, renal, hepatic, endocrinology,
             neurological [other than Parkinson's disease], cardiovascular, or active malignancy
             [other than basal cell carcinoma]).

          -  Subjects with crippling degenerative arthritis or other physical or mental conditions
             which would preclude accurate assessment of efficacy or safety.

          -  Subjects with prior or current major psychosis (e.g., schizophrenia or psychotic
             depression) e.g. scoring 3 or 4 on UPDRS item 2 [thought disorder] or item 3
             [depression].

          -  Subjects with severe clinical dementia e.g. scoring 3 or 4 on UPDRS item 1
             [mentation].

          -  Subjects with severe dizziness or fainting due to postural hypotension on standing.

          -  Subjects with a personal history of melanoma.

          -  Subjects with clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory or ECG tests at
             Screening. If findings are outside the normal range and the subject is included, it
             must be documented by the investigator that the findings are not of clinical
             significance.

          -  Subjects who are diagnosed with an impulse control disorder. The modified MIDI will be
             conducted at screening. Subjects who score positive for this screen must be referred
             to a specialist for diagnostic evaluation.

          -  Subjects who have an active suicidal plan/intent or have had active suicidal thoughts
             in the past 6 months. Subjects who have a history of suicide attempt in the last 2
             years or more than 1 lifetime suicide attempt.

          -  Current alcohol or drug dependence.

          -  Definite or suspected personal or family history of clinically significant adverse
             reactions or hypersensitivity to ropinirole (or to drugs with a similar chemical
             structure) that would preclude long-term dosing with ropinirole.

          -  Withdrawal, introduction, or change in dose of hormone replacement therapy and/or any
             drug known to substantially inhibit CYP1A2 (e.g. ciprofloxacine, fluvoxamine,
             cimetidine, ethinyloestradiol) or induce CYP1A2 (e.g. tobacco, omeprazole) within 7
             days prior to enrolment (randomization). Subjects already on chronic therapy with any
             of these agents may be enrolled but doses must have remained stable from 7 days prior
             to enrolment (randomization) through the end of the treatment period.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Use of an investigational drug from 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)
             prior to enrolment (randomization) through to the end of the treatment period. 15.
             Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding. 16. Use of an investigational drug from 30
             days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to enrolment (randomization) through
             to the end of the treatment period.

        <description>&quot;Off&quot; time is defined as the state in which the participants(par) symptoms include lack of mobility(bradykinesia) with or without additional features such as tremor or rigidity. Par were asked to record awake time “off ”, awake time &quot;on&quot;, troublesome dyskinesias(TD) during awake time &quot;on&quot;, or time asleep for 30 minute intervals in 24 hr diary cards for 2 days preceding visits. Total number of awake hrs spent &quot;off&quot; per 24-hr period was the average of the 2 diary cards of the sum of awake hours spent &quot;off&quot; in each 24-hr diary card. BL is the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose, change from BL was calculated by subtracting the BL values from the MP Week 4 values.

        <description>The responder rate was defined as the percentage of par with greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 20 percent (%) reduction in their individual BL &quot;off&quot; time at Week 4 of the Maintenance Period. The &quot;off&quot; time is defined as the state in which the participants' symptoms include lack of mobility (bradykinesia) with or without additional features such as tremor or rigidity. BL is defined as the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose date. Responder Rate (Least Squares [LS] means on inverse linked scale), odds ratio with 95% CI and p-value comparing against placebo were estimated by Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model. Baseline total awake time 'Off', treatment, visit and treatment*visit are included in the model.</description>

        <description>The &quot;off&quot; time is defined as the state in which the participants' symptoms include lack of mobility (bradykinesia) with or without additional features such as tremor or rigidity. BL is defined as the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose date. The percent change from BL was calculated by subtracting the BL values from the Maintenance Period Week 4 values. Percentage of participants meeting the criterion (LS mean on inverse linked scale), odds ratio with 95% CI and p-value comparing against placebo were estimated by Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model. Baseline 'off-time', treatment, visit and treatment*visit are included in the model.</description>

          <description>The &quot;off&quot; time is defined as the state in which the participants' symptoms include lack of mobility (bradykinesia) with or without additional features such as tremor or rigidity. BL is defined as the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose date. The percent change from BL was calculated by subtracting the BL values from the Maintenance Period Week 4 values. Percentage of participants meeting the criterion (LS mean on inverse linked scale), odds ratio with 95% CI and p-value comparing against placebo were estimated by Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model. Baseline 'off-time', treatment, visit and treatment*visit are included in the model.</description>

        <title>Responder Rate According to the Clinical Global Impression-global Improvement (CGI-I) Scale at Week 4 of the Maintenance Period</title>
        <description>The CGI-I scale allows the investigator to rate the participant's total improvement since the beginning of treatment (Baseline). Baseline is defined as the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose date. The scale is rated from 1-7 where 1 = &quot;very much improved&quot;, 2 = &quot;much improved&quot;, 3 = &quot;minimally improved&quot;, 4 = &quot;no change&quot;, 5 = &quot;minimally worse, 6 = &quot;much worse&quot;, and 7 = &quot;very much worse&quot;. The responder rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a score of 1 or 2. The Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model was used to determine CGI responder rate with treatment, visit, and treatment by visit interaction included in the model. Only scheduled visits were included.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Absolute Awake Time Spent &quot;on&quot; Without Troublesome Dyskinesia (TD) at Week 4 of the Maintenance Period</title>
        <description>Dyskinesias are involuntary twisting, turning movements caused by medication during “on” time in Parkinson's Disease (PD). TD is defined as those movements that interfere with function and cause meaningful discomfort. Par were asked to record awake time &quot;off&quot;, awake time &quot;on&quot;, TD during awake time &quot;on&quot;, or time asleep for all 30 minute time intervals in 24 hour diary cards for the 2 days preceding each visit. The total number of awake hours spent &quot;on&quot; without TD per 24-hour period was the average across the 2 diary cards of the sum of awake hours spent &quot;on&quot; without TD in each 24 hour diary card. The change from BL was calculated by subtracting the BL values from the MP Week 4 values. LS means, 95% CIs and P-values were estimated from Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM). Par with a non-missing efficacy observation at BL and during the MP were analyzed.</description>

The total number of awake hours spent &quot;on&quot; per 24-hour period was the average across the 2 diary cards of the sum of the awake hours spent &quot;on&quot; in each 24 hour diary card. BL is defined as the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose date. The change from BL was calculated by subtracting the BL values from the Maintenance Period Week 4 values. LS means, 95% CIs and P-values were estimated from MMRM.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Awake Time Spent &quot;Off&quot; at Week 4 of the Maintenance Period</title>
        <description>The &quot;off&quot; state is defined as the state in which the participants' symptoms include lack of mobility (bradykinesia), with or without additional features such as tremor or rigidity. Par. were asked to record awake time &quot;off&quot;, awake time &quot;on&quot;, TD during awake time &quot;on&quot;, or time asleep for all 30 minute time intervals in 24 hour diary cards for the 2 days preceding each visit of the study. The total number of awake hours spent &quot;off&quot; per 24-hour period was the average across the 2 diary cards of the sum of awake hours spent &quot;off&quot; in each 24-hour diary card. The percent change from BL was calculated by subtracting the BL values from the Maintenance Period Week 4 values divided by BL values multiplied (×) the results with 100. LS means, 95% CIs and P-values were estimated from MMRM.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Awake Time Spent &quot;on&quot; at Week 4 of the Maintenance Period</title>
        <description>Par. were asked to recordawake time &quot;off&quot;, awake time &quot;on&quot;, TD during awake time &quot;on&quot;, or time asleep for all 30 minute time intervals in 24 hour diary cards for the 2 days preceding each visit of the study. The total number of awake hours spent &quot;on&quot; per 24-hour period was the average across the 2 diary cards of the sum of awake hours spent &quot;on&quot; in each 24-hour diary card. The percent change from BL was calculated by subtracting the BL values from the Maintenance Period Week 4 values divided by BL values × 100. LS means, 95% CIs and P-values were estimated from MMRM.</description>

        <description>The &quot;off&quot; state is defined as the state in which the participants' symptoms include lack of mobility(bradykinesia), with or without additional features such as tremor or rigidity. Par were asked to record awake time &quot;off&quot;, awake time &quot;on&quot;, TD during awake time &quot;on&quot;, or time asleep for all 30 minute time intervals in 24 hour diary cards for the 2 days preceding each visit of the study. The total number of awake hours spent &quot;off&quot; per 24-hour period was the average across the 2 diary cards of the sum of awake hours spent &quot;off&quot; in each 24-hour diary card. The percentage of awake time spent &quot;off&quot;= Awake time spent &quot;off&quot; divided by (Awake time spent &quot;off&quot; + Awake time spent &quot;on&quot;) × 100. BL is defined as the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose date. The change from BL was calculated by subtracting the BL values from the MP Week 4 values. LS means, 95% CIs and P-values were estimated from MMRM.</description>

        <description>Par. were asked to record awake time &quot;off&quot;, awake time &quot;on&quot;, TD during awake time &quot;on&quot;, or time asleep for all 30 minute time intervals in 24 hour diary cards for the 2 days preceding each visit of the study. The total number of awake hours spent &quot;on&quot; per 24-hour period was the average across the 2 diary cards of the sum of awake hours spent &quot;on&quot; in each 24-hour diary card. The percentage of awake time spent &quot;on&quot;= Awake time spent &quot;on&quot; divided by (Awake time spent &quot;on&quot; + Awake time spent &quot;off&quot;) × 100. BL is defined as the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose date. The change from BL was calculated by subtracting the BL values from the Maintenance Period Week 4 values. LS means, 95% CIs and P-values were estimated from MMRM.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Percent of a 24- Hour Day Spent &quot;on&quot; Without TD at Week 4 of the Maintenance Period</title>
        <description>Dyskinesias are involuntary twisting, turning movements caused by medication during &quot;on&quot; time in PD. TD is defined as those movements that interfere with function and cause meaningful discomfort. Par were asked to record awake time &quot;off&quot;, awake time &quot;on&quot;, TD during awake time &quot;on&quot;, or time asleep for all 30 minute time intervals in 24 hr diary cards for the 2 days preceding each visit. The total number of day awake hr spent &quot;on&quot; without TD per 24-hr period was the average across the 2 diary cards of the sum of awake hours spent &quot;on&quot; without TD in each 24-hour diary card. The percentage of 24 hr day spent &quot;on&quot; without TD= awake time spent &quot;on&quot; without TD divided by 24 × 100. BL is defined as the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose date, change from BL was calculated by subtracting the BL values from the MP Week 4 values. LS means, 95% CIs and P-values were estimated from MMRM.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Sleep Time During the Night Time Hours of Sleep as a Percentage of a 24-hour Day, at Week 4 of the Maintenance Period</title>
        <description>Par were asked to record awake time &quot;off&quot;, awake time &quot;on&quot;, TD during awake time &quot;on&quot;, or time asleep for all 30 minute time intervals in 24 hour diary cards for the 2 days preceding each visit of the study. The total sleep hours during the night time hours of sleep was the average across the 2 diary cards of the sum of time (hours) asleep during night time in each 24-hour diary card. The percentage of a 24-hour day spent asleep during the night time hours = Total sleep hours during the night time hours of sleep divided by 24 × 100. BL is defined as the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose date. The change from BL was calculated by subtracting the BL values from the Maintenance Period Week 4 values. LS means, 95% CIs and P-values were estimated from MMRM.</description>

        <description>The UPDRS is a clinician based rating scale used to measure motor impairments and disability. The UPDRS assesses six features of PD impairment. These are evaluated using a combination of data collected by interview and examination of the par.. One of the six features include the Part III-motor examination where scores can range 0 to 108 with par. in an &quot;on&quot; state where the maximum score indicates the worse condition. BL is defined as the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose date. The change from BL was calculated by subtracting the BL values from the Maintenance Period Week 4 values. LS means, 95% CIs and P-values were estimated from MMRM.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in UPDRS Part I at Week 4 of the Maintenance Period</title>
        <description>The UPDRS Part I scores mentation, behavior and mood as determined by a physician and par. were tested during the &quot;on&quot; phase of PD. This component of the UPDRS is the total score for 4 items (the items 1 to 4 include intellectual impairment, thought disorder, motivation / initiative, and depression) and may have a value ranging from 0 to 16 as determined by a physician. The higher score (16) indicates the maximum score and the worse condition. All 4 items have to be present for a total score to be calculated. If one or more items are missing, the total score for the component would also be missing. BL is defined as the last non-missing assessment measured on or before the first dose date. The change from BL was calculated by subtracting the BL values from the individual post-randomization values. LS means, 95% CIs and P-values were estimated from MMRM.</description>
