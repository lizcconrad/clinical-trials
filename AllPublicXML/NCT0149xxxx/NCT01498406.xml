    <textblock>
      Lupus is a disease in which the immune system, which normally fights infection, begins to
      attack healthy cells in the body. This phenomenon is called autoimmunity and what the immune
      system attacks is called the autoantigen. Lupus can affect many parts of the body and often
      affects the skin, with immune cells attacking autoantigens in the skin and causing a rash.
      This rash is often visible to the public because it tends to occur on sun-exposed areas, for
      example a patient's face, chest, and arms. For this reason, among others, skin lupus can be a
      source of disability and poor health related quality of life in many patients with this
      disease. It is not completely understood why or how someone might develop lupus, however
      there are likely many reasons which include their genetics and also the kind of environment
      they live in.

      One such environmental factor, vitamin D, is more commonly known as a vitamin important for
      bone health. However, we are learning that vitamin D has effects all over the body, and is
      also important for a healthy immune system. Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with
      an increased risk of other autoimmune disorders such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis, and
      have also been found to be common in skin lupus patients.

      Vitamin D is made in the skin when it is exposed to the sun, specifically ultraviolet B
      radiation (UVB). The main source of vitamin D for most people is its production in the skin
      because the normal American diet is not high in vitamin D. However, patients with skin lupus
      tend to stay out of the sun because their rash is made worse by sunlight, which is thought to
      produce more of the autoantigens in the skin attacked by the immune system. Additionally, as
      skin doctors (dermatologists) we recommend sun protection to skin lupus patients to minimize
      sun-sensitivity and prevent flares of their skin disease. However we may be putting them at
      risk for low vitamin D status and even more severe disease. Another risk factor that puts
      skin lupus patients at risk for vitamin D deficiency is that these patients generally have
      darker skin types which blocks UVB and further limits vitamin D production in the skin.

      Given that skin lupus patients are at high risk for low vitamin D status as mentioned above,
      the investigators propose a research study that will provide information about vitamin D
      levels in these patients. The investigators seek to identify how many skin lupus patients
      have low vitamin D status and how vitamin D influences the natural history of this skin
      disease. Additionally the investigators will evaluate whether or not supplementation with
      high dose vitamin D will lessen the severity and negative quality of life impact of skin
      lupus. Supplementation of vitamin D by mouth is an inexpensive, well tolerated, and safe over
      the counter method to replete and maintain a normal vitamin D status. Studies in other
      autoimmune diseases, specifically Crohn's disease and multiple sclerosis, have shown that
      high dose vitamin D supplementation improves disease severity. It is the hope of the
      investigators that this will also be observed in skin lupus patients.

      In summary, the investigators seek to move beyond establishing an association between vitamin
      D status and skin lupus. The investigators aim to elucidate the therapeutic benefit, if any,
      of vitamin D status on disease severity and quality of life while controlling for important
      factors that may influence vitamin D status. If the investigators are to show improvement in
      disease severity with vitamin D supplementation, this would be a cost-effective additional
      therapy to our standard clinical practice. Future research would also allow us to investigate
      other alternative markers of vitamin D deficiency and disease activity in skin lupus
      patients, a population at high risk for low vitamin D status and in need of further research.

    <description>The CLASI (Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index) is a validated CLE disease severity measure that has been in use in clinical trials since 2005. This scale captures cutaneous, mucosal membrane, and alopetic disease activity (erythema and scale/hypertrophy) as well as damage (dyspigmentation and scarring/ atrophy/ panniculitis).</description>

    <description>No cutaneous lupus specific quality of life (QOL) measure exists, but the Skindex 29, a validated skin-specific QOL measure has been used in previous studies along with three added questions: two related to patient concerns about photosensitivity and one related to patient concerns about hair loss. The investigators propose to use the Skindex-29, with three independent scores that can be used in the measurement of health related QOL in dermatological patients.</description>

    <description>The investigators will carry out a two-armed prospective pilot study of the influence of vitD on cutaneous lupus (CLE) disease severity. Patients with CLE will be eligible for an observational or interventional arm based on their 25(OH)D levels and consent. Subjects with low vitD status (&lt;30 ng/mL) will be eligible for the investigational arm involving participation in a randomized controlled trial of daily high dose (4000 IU) vs. low dose (400 IU) vitD supplementation for 8 months. Subjects who have sufficient vitD status (&gt;30ng/mL) or those with low vitD who choose not to participate in the RCT are eligible for continued participation in the observational arm of the study. All subjects will be followed at 4, 8, and 12 months.</description>
