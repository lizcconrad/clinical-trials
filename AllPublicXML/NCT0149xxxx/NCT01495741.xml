    <textblock>
      This study will assess asenapine (Sycrest®) use in participants with bipolar disorder;
      comparison will be made to the use of risperidone (RISPERDAL®CONSTA®) and olanzapine
      (Zyprexa®). The occurrence of identified and potential clinically important risks will also
      be assessed.

    <description>Identified and potential clinically important risks will include: extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence and sedation, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, seizure, hyperprolactinaemia, orthostatic hypotension, neutropenia, allergic reactions, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus with the use of asenapine versus risperidone or olanzapine</description>

    <description>When enrollment and participant exposure reaches a level that adequate power (80%) is achieved according to pre-defined power calculations, risk incidence with use of asenapine in participants diagnosed with schizophrenia with no prior and/or concomitant diagnosis of bipolar disorder will be analyzed. Identified and potential clinically important risks will include: extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence and sedation, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, seizure, hyperprolactinaemia,orthostatic hypotension, neutropenia, allergic reactions, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus with the use of asenapine versus risperidone or olanzapine</description>

    <description>When enrollment and participant exposure reaches a level that adequate power (80%) is achieved according to pre-defined power calculations, risk incidence with use of asenapine in participants with no prior and/or concomitant diagnoses of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, but diagnosed with i) Alzheimer's disease, ii) other diagnoses - mental disorders or iii) no diagnosis, will be analyzed. Identified and potential clinically important risks will include: extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence and sedation, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, seizure, hyperprolactinaemia,orthostatic hypotension, neutropenia, allergic reactions, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus with the use of asenapine</description>

        Participants with Bipolar Disorder codes who are included in the United Kingdom Clinical
        Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and, if required, The Health Improvement Network (THIN)
        database.

        If pre-specified sample size and exposure criteria are met, secondary objectives will be
        conducted in 2 separate study populations: 1. Participants treated with asenapine and
        diagnosed with schizophrenia and no prior and/or concomitant diagnosis of bipolar disorder;
        2. Participants treated with asenapine with no prior and/or concomitant diagnoses of
        bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, but diagnosed with i) Alzheimer's disease, ii) other
        diagnoses - mental disorders or iii) no diagnosis.
