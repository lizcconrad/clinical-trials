  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, biomarkers like procalcitonin have been studied in order to help physicians to
      decrease the duration of the antibiotic therapy. The investigators objective was to assess
      whether the decrease in procalcitonin levels could be used to reduce the antibiotic therapy
      in critically ill patients with a proven infection without risking a worse outcome.

    <description>the primary objective was to assess if a procalcitonin measurement protocol can reduce the duration of antibiotic therapy in critically ill patients with sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock with documented infection</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>all cause mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoints were in-hospital mortality, ICU mortality, ICU length of stay, recurrence of the initial infection, analyis of the C-reative protein levels along with the procalcitonin protocol and costs</description>

  <intervention>

    <intervention_name>procalcitonin measurement</intervention_name>
    <description>The patients assigned to the procalcitonin group had procalcitonin and C reactive protein levels measured at day 0 (bacteremia), 5 or 7 (if positive blood culture) and then every 48 hours until hosptital discharge, death or until the antibiotics were stopped. A predefined procalcitonin protocol was used together with the clinical outcome, to guide the physician´s decision to discontinue antibiotics.
The procalcitonin protocol encouraged the physician to discontinue the antibiotics when: 1)procalcitonin dropped more than 90% from the baseline peak level or 2)an absolute value below 0,5ng/mL was reached. Cases in which the antibiotic treatment was continued against what the PCT values indicated were categorized as &quot; antibiotic discontinuation overruling&quot;</description>
