  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, Phase 2A study with multiple
      administrations of the rotigotine transdermal system. The study was conducted in adolescent
      subjects (13 to &lt;18 years of age) with idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS).
