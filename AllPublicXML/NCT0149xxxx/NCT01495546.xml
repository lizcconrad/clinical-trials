  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Brazil, several hip surgeries performed, especially total knee arthroplasty, which
      represents 1.5 million procedures (Penedo, New, 2007). The rehabilitation of these
      individuals is slow with respect to the march because it requires an aid and not to use the
      operated leg as support for three weeks, according to conventional methods. After the third
      week, the support becomes part and after that period (sixth week), the support becomes total.
      Therefore, and in order to provide better quality of life, the goal of this work is to
      compare the march in 40 patients divided into two groups of 20 subjects each. In the control
      group, the treatment approach is the traditional, i.e., without immediate loading, while the
      other charge will be applied immediately in the operated limb. In order to verify the
      possible gain in the quality of life of these patients, the SF-36 will be applied. The march
      will be assessed with the Time Up and Go test and the force platform and the Harris Hip score
      analyze the function of the hip. Individuals will receive such care at the Institute of
      Orthopedics and Traumatology, Hospital das Clinicas, Faculty of Medicine, University of São
      Paulo (IOT - HC - USP). The results of comparisons between the two groups and the clinical
      findings obtained will be subjected to appropriate statistical tests, guided by the
      principles of evidence-based clinical practice, seeking to facilitate and improve the lives
      of these individuals so they can move freely.
