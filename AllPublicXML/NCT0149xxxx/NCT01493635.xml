  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization analgesic ladder for cancer pain relief is an internationally
      used approach to managing cancer pain. Patients generally start on Step 1 of the ladder
      (paracetamol). As pain increases or is not well controlled on this, they progress to Step 2
      which involves a stronger pain killer (weak opioid such as codeine). If pain is still not
      controlled they progress to Step 3 of the ladder which is a strong opioid (such as morphine).
      Work to date has suggested that Step 2 may be unnecessary and most patients usually require
      Step 3 analgesia. The TVT trial aims to examine the standard approach (Step 1-Step2-Step-3)
      versus a two step approach (Step 1-Step 3).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age and over.

          -  Patient has a cancer diagnosis (based on radiological, histological, cytological, or
             operative evidence). Those with haematological malignancies are eligible.

          -  Cancer related pain - which in the opinion of the clinician is caused by the presence
             of tumour or metastases.

          -  Average pain score &gt; 4, on a numerical rating scale from 0-10, requiring step 2
             analgesia (weak opioid).

          -  Patient is able to comply with trial procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received radiotherapy in the previous 6 weeks or are planned to
             receive radiotherapy during the trial period where in either case, it is expected to
             affect pain during the trial period.

          -  Pain due to surgery in the preceding 4 weeks.

          -  Life expectancy less than two months (based on clinical impression).

          -  Patients with psychotic disorders or cognitive impairment.

          -  Patients who have received regular doses (scheduled doses - NOT as required dosing) of
             weak or strong opioids in the preceding two weeks.

          -  Patients using immediate release opioids &gt; 2 doses/24 hours, in the previous 24 hours.
