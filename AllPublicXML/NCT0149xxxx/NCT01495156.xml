  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study is a placebo-controlled, parallel group, randomized clinical trial
      comparing two treatment strategies in adolescents with mania and prominent psychotic
      features. One group will receive a second generation antipsychotic (SGA) and placebo and the
      other will receive a SGA and lithium.

      The primary double-blind phase of the study will last 8 weeks, followed by a 24-week
      extension-phase.

    <description>All patients will be treated with aripiprazole with a target dose of 10 mg/day and a max daily dose of 30 mg. If aripiprazole is ineffective or not tolerated, it will be tapered and risperidone treatment will be started. If patient had an adequate aripiprazole trial in the past as described above, risperidone will be the initial treatment. Risperidone dosing will begin with 0.5 mg/day on day 1 with a target dose of 2.5 mg/day and a max daily dose of 6mg.
Subjects in the lithium /adjunctive SGA group will be started at 900 mg/day lithium in thrice daily dosing. The lithium dose will be increased to 1200mg/day on day 4 if lithium has been well-tolerated and symptoms of mania remain, as determined by a phone assessment done by a blinded study physician. The target serum level of lithium will be 1.2 mEq/L (range 0.8 to 1.4 mEq/L).</description>
