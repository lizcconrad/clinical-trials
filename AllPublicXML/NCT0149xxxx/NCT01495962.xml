      Damage control laparotomy (DCL) is a life saving maneuver used with success in trauma and
      acute general surgery patients. The technique involves source control of sepsis and
      hemorrhage with an abbreviated laparotomy. In other words, the surgical procedure is cut
      short to allow for resuscitation in the ICU after the immediately life threatening pathology
      is treated. Planned re-exploration is then performed within 24-48 hours. It is at this
      procedure that the injuries are reconstructed. This technique, unfortunately, has several
      complications implicit with its use including wound infection, enterocutaneous fistula
      formation, and intra-abdominal abscess development.[1] Additionally, in patients whom primary
      fascial closure is not achieved, extensive abdominal wall reconstruction will be required in
      6-12 months. The key for preventing these complications is definitive closure of the
      abdominal fascia, however, 10-50% of patients will have a planned ventral hernia with an open
      abdominal wound at dismissal [1,2] Proven methods for decreasing the rate of planned ventral
      hernia utilize tension in the midline to counter the effects of lateral abdominal muscular
      retraction.[3,4,5] Despite these improvements, however, the planned ventral hernia rate
      continues to be substantial.[2] Botulinum toxin a (BTX) is an FDA approved neuron modulating
      agent which has been used extensively in cosmetic, motor and pain disorders over the past 20
      years [6,7]. The toxin blocks acetylcholine and pain modulator release (calcitonin gene
      related peptide and substance P) from the pre-synaptic cholinergic nerve terminal. The
      peptides are unable to bind at their motor end plate receptors through a process that cleaves
      proteins involved in the transport protein cascade. This results in flaccid paralysis and
      neuromodulation of the abdominal wall muscles resulting in reduced lateral tension and pain.
      Theoretically, this could increase the rates of primary fascial closure, improve pain
      sensation, decrease the rate of complications associated with open abdomens all while
      lowering the costs and need for future abdominal wall reconstruction.
