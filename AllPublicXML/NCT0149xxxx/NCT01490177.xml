      The Primary Objective of the study is to develop a customized regimen for oral immunotherapy
      that reflects what the subject is allergic in a clinically significant way (i.e., the
      offending food allergen is defined as a food allergen with a positive skin test or positive
      specific IgE and a positive DBPCFC). Therefore, the investigators prefer that both single and
      multiple food allergy subjects are included in the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Moderate to severe peanut and/or egg and/or milk and/or tree nut and/or seed allergic
             subjects between the ages of 4 to 55 years old.

          -  Sensitivity to food allergen will be documented by a positive skin prick test result
             (see Appendix for details) or allergen specific ImmunoCAP IgE level with 7 kU/L as a
             lower limit of eligibility.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No absolute contraindications are known. However, the risk of serious systemic
             anaphylactic reactions to food allergens suggests a number of preexisting conditions
             that should be considered relative contraindications. Among those conditions are acute
             infections, autoimmune disease, severe cardiac disease, and treatment with
             beta-adrenergic antagonistic drugs (beta-blockers).

          -  Subjects having a history of severe anaphylaxis to food allergens that will be
             desensitized in this study requiring intubation or admission to an ICU, frequent
             allergic or non-allergic urticaria, or history consistent with poorly controlled
             persistent asthma.
