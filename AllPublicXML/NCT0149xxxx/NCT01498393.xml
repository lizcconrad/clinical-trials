    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to improve the appearance of onychomycosis and
      morphology of the nail (fungal infection). The researcher can use a light based therapy to
      gently heat the toenail infected with fungus to improve the appearance of onychomycosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Toenail fungus (onychomycosis) is a common fungal infection of the nail that affects roughly
      10% of Americans. Onychomycosis may be a precursor to many complications like ulcers, or skin
      infections, which may rarely result in amputation. Current treatment options have relatively
      limited long-term success and recurrence is common.

      The researcher can determine that the laser therapy can heat the nail and destroy and
      decrease the fungus infecting the nail to improving the appearance of the nail.

          -  Receipt of any topical therapy for onychomycosis (i.e. antifungal) within 2 weeks of
             enrollment, systemic therapy for onychomycosis (i.e. antifungal) within 3 months of
             enrollment, or any other procedures done on the test area within 6 months of
             enrollment.
