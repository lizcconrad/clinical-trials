    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single oral 75
      mg dose of cabozantinib in hepatic impaired adult subjects to healthy adult subjects. Another
      objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib in these adult subjects.
