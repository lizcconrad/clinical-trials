    <textblock>
      Background: Models have tried to explain the driving mechanisms behind chronic non specific
      low back pain (CNSLBP) in order to propose better appropriate conservative treatment. Altered
      responses at spinal and/or supraspinal level may affect the perception of pain and degree of
      disability of CNSLBP patients. Recent clinical recommendations still propose active exercises
      (AE) for CNSLBP. However, acceptance of exercises by patients may be limited by pain-related
      manifestations. Current evidences suggest manual therapy (MT) induces a short-term analgesic
      effect through neurophysiological mechanisms at peripheral, spinal and cortical levels. The
      aim of this study was first, to assess whether MT has an instant analgesic effect, and
      second, to compare the long-lasting effect on functional disability of MT followed by AE to
      sham therapy (ST) followed by AE. Methods: Forty-two CNSLBP patients without co-morbidities,
      randomly distributed into 2 treatment groups, received either spinal
      manipulation/mobilization (first intervention) plus AE (MT group; n = 22), or detuned
      ultrasound (first intervention) plus AE (ST group; n = 20). Eight therapeutic sessions were
      delivered over 4 to 8 weeks. Instant analgesic effect was obtained by measuring pain
      intensity (Visual Analogue Scale) before and immediately after the first intervention of each
      therapeutic session. Pain intensity, disability (Oswestry Disability Index) and
      fear-avoidance beliefs (Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire) were determined before
      treatment, after the 8th therapeutic session, and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups.
