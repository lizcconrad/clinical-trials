  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project the investigators seek to utilize our experience for developing a
      comprehensive informatics framework for rapid adaptation and dissemination of Comparative
      Effectiveness Research (CER) products tailored to different categories of health consumers
      including difficult-to-reach patients. Based on our previous successful experience in
      computer-assisted education, the investigators will refine the current CO-ED platform to
      implement and test a novel system for individualized continuous patient education (iCOPE).
      The iCOPE platform will be specifically designed to support rapid adaptation, customization,
      and dissemination of the CER products to the difficult-to-reach populations. The iCOPE
      platform will implement universal means for customized delivery of CER information in the
      format of interactive self-paced educational modules, quick &quot;question &amp; answer&quot; guides, and
      interactive decision aids. In addition, the iCOPE platform will support the innovative
      concept of continuous patient health education by providing patients with easy access to the
      interactive CER updates via web, MP3 players and phone-based interactive voice response (IVR)
      technology. Though iCOPE will be designed to support the whole spectrum of CER products, in
      this project the investigators will focus on the Comparative Effectiveness Research Summary
      Guide (CERSG) entitled &quot;Pills for Type 2 Diabetes.&quot;

      The following primary hypothesis will be tested in the RCT: Use of the iCOPE platform will be
      associated with improvement in CERSG knowledge in elderly at 6 months after the intervention.

      The investigators will also examine the impact of iCOPE on medication adherence
      self-efficacy, diabetes medication satisfaction, HbA1c, and CERSG acceptance.

      Interactive, computer-based education has the potential to greatly increase interest, because
      the learner actively participates in the learning process (Fox, 2009). In addition, the
      involvement of auditory, visual, and interactive learning strategies can increase recall of
      information. Computer-assisted educational programs may incorporate features that promote
      ease of use, be written in multiple languages, be scripted at a level that addresses the
      needs of low literacy learners, and be viewed as often as needed by a patient (Fox, 2009).

      Several studies reported results of using computer technology in educating elderly patients
      about health conditions. Stromberg et al (2006) used a single-session, interactive
      computer-based educational program about chronic heart failure in elderly patients. They
      demonstrated that interactive computer-mediated education may be effectively used to increase
      patients' knowledge, about heart failure. Another study, conducted by Lin et al (2009),
      evaluated the usability of a touch-screen-enabled personal education program (PEP). The
      results showed that the system was evaluated as usable and useful, and older adults were
      satisfied with their experience. Similar findings were reported by Neafsey et al (2008) who
      also evaluated a patient-centered computer-mediated program using touch screen computers.
      Authors reported high satisfaction of the older adult users, increased knowledge and
      self-efficacy for avoiding adverse self-medication behaviors.

      Elderly patients are less likely than younger patients to seek incidental information on
      their condition via internet. (Tian &amp; Robinson, 2008) Elderly patients therefore are less
      likely to navigate internet looking for information about evidence or treatment guidelines
      for their conditions. More targeted efforts may be needed to reach such populations.
      Disseminating information via combination of high technology media along with traditional
      media that are easily usable is helpful (Longo, 2005). A recent review of barriers and
      drivers of health IT use by elderly, very ill, and underserved, revealed that such technology
      can play a role in offering effective interventions. The consumer perceptions on benefits
      from use of system, convenience of use, and familiar technology were all important factors
      for intervention success (Jimison et al., 2008).

    <description>The study participants in the intervention group will use iCOPE platform providing adapted CERSG content in an interactive and tailored way. The intervention provided by the iCOPE platform will be implemented with the understanding that it should be user-friendly and not time consuming. Initially, all participants will be asked to complete the computer-mediated interactive CERSG module via touch screen tablet PC provided at hospital, in a primary care office, and in senior centers. The total time to complete the curriculum is about 30 min, however the patients will be able to distribute this time throughout a day at their convenience. Once the educational curriculum is completed, the intervention subjects will receive access to other components of the iCOPE platform.</description>
