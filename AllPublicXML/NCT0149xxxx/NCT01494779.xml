    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      effect between two preparations of somatropin (T and C) after a single administration of 5 mg
      in healthy subjects by altering serum somatropin pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC0-24h,
      AUC0-inf, Cmax, Tmax and T1 / 2) and pharmacodynamic (measurement of serum levels of IGF-1
      presented by the concentration-time profile, AUC 0-24h and AUC0-inf.).

      Secondly, the investigators will observe the clinical safety and tolerability after single
      dose administration in subjects, by comparing clinical parameters and the incidence of
      adverse events between groups.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary efficacy endpoint will be based in the investigation of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of somatropin in research subjects after administration of single dose, sc, of the drug.</measure>
    <time_frame>PK: 0, 1, 2, 3, 3:30, 4, 4:30, 5, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24 hours. PD: 0, 6, 12, 24 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacokinetic evaluation will be based on data obtained from the average dosage of somatropin plasma. Thus, the time of collection facilities provide the pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0-24h, AUC0-inf, Cmax, Tmax and T1 / 2, which will be compared between the two formulations.
The quantification of serum somatropin kit will be performed by ELISA validated using human serum as a biological matrix.
The evaluation of the pharmacodynamics will be performed by quantifying serum levels of IGF-1 presented by the concentration-time profile, AUC 0-24h and AUC0-inf.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>After administration of the drug will be evaluated for safety and tolerability of the drug through the presence of hematoma, pain, itching and local redness, as well as the incidence of adverse events directly related to somatropin.</measure>
