    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, Phase II trial investigating axitinib as a single-agent
      maintenance therapy following standard first-line FOLFOX/bevacizumab therapy for patients
      with mCRC.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will receive FOLFOX/bevacizumab for four 28-day cycles (a total of 16 weeks).
      After 4 cycles, maintenance axitinib will be started. With approval of the Medical
      Monitor,patients who are having significant benefit from FOLFOX/bevacizumab may continue
      chemotherapy to a maximum of six 28-day cycles. During trial treatment, all patients will be
      assessed for response every 8 weeks (2 cycles).

      <pre_assignment_details>In this non-randomized open label trial, patients began treatment with FOLFOX/bevacizumab every 4 weeks for 16 weeks. Patients with objective response or stable disease began Axitinib maintenance therapy at week 17. Axitinib therapy continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or did not meet any criteria for discontinuation.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>All patients receive FOLFOX/bevacizumab for four 28-day cycles (16 weeks). After 4 cycles, axitinib maintenance will be administered starting on Week 17. Maintenance treatment will continue until disease progression or intolerable toxicity occurs.
FOLFOX/bevacizumab ( FOLFOX is a combination of Leucovorin, fluorouracil and oxiloplatin):
5-Fluorouracil: 400 mg/m2 Days 1 and 15 by IV followed by 2400 mg/m2 over 46-48 hours Days 1 and 15 by continuous infusion;
Leucovorin: 400 mg/m2 given Days 1 and 15 by IV
Oxaliplatin: 85 mg/m2 Days 1 and 15 by IV
Bevacizumab: 5 mg/kg on Days 1 and 15 by IV
Maintenance:
- Axitinib: 5-mg tablets orally twice per day on Days 1 thru 28 of each cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.</description>

            <description>All patients receive FOLFOX/bevacizumab for four 28-day cycles (16 weeks). After 4 cycles, axitinib maintenance will be administered starting on Week 17. Maintenance treatment will continue until disease progression or intolerable toxicity occurs.
FOLFOX/bevacizumab ( FOLFOX is a combination of Leucovorin, fluorouracil and oxiloplatin):
5-Fluorouracil: 400 mg/m2 Days 1 and 15 by IV followed by 2400 mg/m2 over 46-48 hours Days 1 and 15 by continuous infusion;
Leucovorin: 400 mg/m2 given Days 1 and 15 by IV
Oxaliplatin: 85 mg/m2 Days 1 and 15 by IV
Bevacizumab: 5 mg/kg on Days 1 and 15 by IV
Maintenance:
- Axitinib: 5-mg tablets orally twice per day on Days 1 thru 28 of each cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.</description>
