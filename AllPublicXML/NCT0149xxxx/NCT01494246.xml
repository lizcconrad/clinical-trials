      Objectives. To evaluate the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of clinical practice guide
      based intervention with two face-to-face visits and e-mail tracking compared to brief advice
      to obtain continued smoking abstinence at 6 and 12 months after intervention.

      Methodology. simple randomized controlled multicentric trial. All smokers (N=1064) aged 18 or
      older that attend by any reason to the primary care center and that have an e-mail account
      and they checked it at least once a week will be invited to participate. The enrolled
      participants will be randomly divided into control (N=532) and intervention group (N=532). An
      intensive intervention, based on the recommendations of the clinical practice guides, that
      will include six contacts (2 face-to-face and 4 by e-mail) will be applied to the
      intervention group. Control group will receive brief advice.

      The main dependent variable will be continued abstinence of tobacco consumption at six and
      twelve months after the beginning of the intervention which will be validated by and a carbon
      monoxide breathe analysis measured by a cooximeter in standard conditions. Secondary
      variables will include: stage change on the quitting smoking process and evaluation of the
      effectiveness on the reduction of the number of smoked cigarettes at six and twelve months
      after intervention. A descriptive analysis of all variables will be done. A multivariate
      analysis will be undertaken to assess differences among intervention and control group;
      logistic regression for dichotomic variables and lineal regression for continuous variables.

      In preliminary phase is planned to carry out 2 descriptive sub-studies: a qualitative one,
      which will reflect the views of patients and physicians regarding the use of email as a
      smoking cessation intervention, and another smoker's profile in relation to Information and
      Communication Technologies (ICT), which collects information on the actual use of them in
      smokers. The result of both will help to release data on the type of participants who would
      be involved in the clinical trial.
