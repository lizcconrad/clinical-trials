  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data about psychodynamics in uveitis patients are scare. A negative impact of disease is
      described not only in adult patients with active, but also with quiescent disease. During
      adolescence even less is known about psychodynamics although this is an especially sensible
      and challenging stage of life. Given the assumption that juvenile patients with quiescent
      disease still could suffer from emotional distress, this would require special attention.

      In this study the investigators evaluate the impact of juvenile uveitis on HRQoL and
      attempted to identify clinical and demographic factors contributing to an impaired health
      status. The investigators limit the study to patients with quiescent uveitis and good visual
      function in at least one eye to exclude additional negative stressors. As there are no
      validated uveitis-specific psychometric questionnaires evaluating QoL available yet, the
      investigators use age-appropriate generic instruments. This should allow obtaining an
      overview about the adolescents' general Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and whether
      psychological interventions should be offered to this sensitive patient group.
