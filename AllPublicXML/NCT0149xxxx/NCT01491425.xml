      This study is designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the rhBMP-2/ACS/LT-CAGE®
      Device using laparoscopic surgical technique as compared to an historical control group
      treated with Autogenous Bone/LT-CAGE® Device using an open surgical technique in patients
      with symptomatic degenerative disc disease.
