  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>

      Cognitive-behavioral Therapy (CBT) would help chronic pain patients who had previously
      undergone a multidisciplinary treatment but still have residual problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study investigates Internet-delivered CBT as a tertiary intervention. This is
      motivated by the fact that many pain patients relapse after rehabilitation and some may be in
      need of additional treatment. The persons who fulfills the inclusion criteria undergoes a
      structured telephone interview. The study is a experimental design with a treatment and an
      active control group measured before and after a treatment period. The control group were
      invited to participate in a moderated online discussion forum. Follow up data was collected
      six months after the treatment.
