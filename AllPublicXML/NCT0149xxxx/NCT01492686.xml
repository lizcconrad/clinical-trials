    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to confirm the efficacy of 60 mg of MCI-186 via
      intravenous drip infusion once a day in the patients with ALS based on the changes in the
      revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) scores after 24 weeks administration in
      double-blind, placebo-controlled manner. The study is also to examine the safety of MCI-186
      to the ALS patients.
