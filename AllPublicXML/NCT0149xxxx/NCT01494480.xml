  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) typically endure a progressive paralysis
      due to the continued loss of motoneurons that leads them to death in less than 5 years. No
      treatment has changed its natural history. Intrathecal injection of umbilical cord
      mesenchymal stem cells can secret trophic factors that keep the motorneurons functional. The
      investigators have designed a phase I/II clinical trial to check the feasibility of this
      approach in humans.
