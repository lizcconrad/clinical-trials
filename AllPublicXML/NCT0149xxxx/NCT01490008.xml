      Investigation of systemic catechin exposure following topically administered Veregen® 15%
      ointment in patients with external genital and perianal warts and following oral intake of a
      standardized green tea beverage in healthy subjects.

      Pharmacokinetic parameters for the main catechin EGCg used as a marker of overall catechin
      exposure following dermal administration in the patient group will only be calculated if
      sufficiently consistent data can be obtained e.g. sufficient plasma catechin concentrations
      to pharmacokinetically evaluate plasma profiles for plasma catechin concentrations.

      If applicable, a safety margin for ointment use might need to be established with respect to
      intolerable systemic exposures of catechins following application of Veregen® ointment.

      In treatment arm 1, patients with anogenital warts will apply Veregen® 15% ointment 250 mg
      three times daily: in the morning, at midday, and in the evening on the defined anogenital
      administration area (total dose of 750 mg/d) for one week .

      In treatment arm 2, healthy subjects will ingest 500 mL commercially available green tea
      beverage (&quot;Lipton® Green Limone&quot; distributed by PepsiCo Deutschland GmbH, Neu-Isenburg,
      Germany), three times daily in the morning, at midday, and in the evening (total dose of 1500
      mL/d) for one week.

      Plasma samples will be collected to aim for a complete pharmacokinetic assessment (over 24
      hours) on Days 1 and 2 at Visit 2 and on Days 7 and 8 at Visit 3 (one week after first
      dosing).

      To avoid any influence on overall systemic catechin exposure deriving from any other source
      than Veregen® or Lipton Green Tea, all subjects participating in the trial (patients and
      healthy volunteers) will be asked to follow a defined diet abstaining from food or beverages
      known to containing catechins (a list of all prohibited and allowed foods and beverages will
      be provided to all subjects).

      For concomitant medication, only paracetamol and oral contraceptives are allowed.

    <description>The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the systemic exposure, and, if possible, the plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetics of green tea catechin EGCg after topically applied Veregen® 15% ointment in patients with external genital warts and that following oral intake of commercially available green tea beverage by healthy subjects.
On the sampling Days 1/2 and 7/8, blood samples of 3 mL each will be collected (non-fasting condition) at specified time points (see above)</description>
