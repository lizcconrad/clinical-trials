      Until now very few studies have been done to compare the efficacy of tubigrips or plaster of
      paris in the treatment of lateral ankle sprains, the investigators aim to compare the
      tubigrip against plaster of paris in the treatment of lateral ankle sprains.

      200 patients were enrolled after meeting inclusion criteria.All patients gave the verbal as
      well as written consent for inclusion in the study. The hospital committee ethical review
      board gave the permission for this study. Only 126 patients agreed to participate in the
      study. After informed consent was obtained the patients were randomized such that each
      patient was allocated to use either a Tubigrip (Group A) or Plaster of Paris (Group B)using
      the Block randomization. The patients in TG group receive the Tubigrip treatment and the
      patients in POP group were given a below knee plaster cast. Patients were instructed to
      follow up at 2 weeks and then at 6 weeks. The functional score and pain were used as outcomes
      of the study

    <description>After informed consent was obtained the patients were randomized such that each patient was allocated to use either a Tubigrip (Group A) or Plaster of Paris (Group B). The standardized treatment in the form of RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation) protocol was given to all patients. The Patients were randomized using the Block randomization. One hundred and twenty six white papers were taken and &quot;TG&quot; for Tubigrip and &quot;POP&quot; for Plaster of Paris were written and the patients were allowed to pick the envelope of their choice. The authors were blinded till the opening of the envelope by the patients. Patient's usage of analgesia in form of Paracetamol was specifically noted. The patients in TG group receive the Tubigrip treatment and the patients in POP group were given a below knee plaster cast. Patients were instructed to follow up at 2 weeks and then at 6 weeks</description>
