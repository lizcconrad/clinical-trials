      Psychological Impact, Metabolic Control, and Biological Stress Markers in Diabetes:
      Intervention Study With Affect School and Basal Body Awareness

      Background:

      Depression is common in patients with diabetes and is associated with impaired metabolic
      control. Alexithymia has been associated with depression, anxiety, stress related disorders
      and diabetes mellitus. Affect School (AS) is an intervention that may reduce depression and
      alexithymia according to previous research. Basic Body Awareness Therapy (BBA) is a
      stress-reducing technique.

      Purpose:

      Our aim is to: 1. Analyze the prevalence of depression and anxiety and the personality
      variables alexithymia and self image in diabetes patients. 2. Explore correlations between
      these variables and risk factors, including biochemical markers for diabetic complications.
      3. To evaluate an intervention with AS and BBA in patients with diabetes that scored high in
      psychometric self-report tests and at the same time showed impaired metabolic control.

      Method:

      A randomized controlled trial of 350 people with diabetes, 18-59 years, 56% men, 44% women.
      Base-line study: from medical records and the National Diabetes Registry - waist
      circumference, BMI, blood pressure, type and duration of diabetes, diabetes complications,
      other diseases, medications, exercise habits and smoking. Tests - A1c, blood lipids,
      cytokines, hormones, beta-cell antibodies, c-peptide, midnight cortisol (salivary).
      Self-report tests of psychological and personality variables: HAD, TAS-20, SASB.
      Intervention: patients with A1c ≥ 8 and anxiety (HAD ≥ 8), depression (HAD ≥ 8), negative
      self-image (SASB: AFF &lt;284) or alexithymia (TAS-20 ≥ 61) were randomized to AS or BBA. AS: 8
      group sessions followed by 10 individual sessions. Instructors were a primary care physician
      and a psychotherapist. BBA: 9 group meetings and 6 individual sessions with a physiotherapist
      as instructor. Post intervention: Self report tests, A1c, cytokines, hormones, cortisol.
