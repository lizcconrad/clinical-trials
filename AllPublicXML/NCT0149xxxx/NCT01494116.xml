  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of syringe size on the amount of time it
      takes a health care provider to administer a known volume (900 mL) of resuscitation fluid to
      a non-clinical, toddler-sized, model. The investigators hypothesize that syringe size will
      impact fluid resuscitation time.

    <textblock>
      The Surviving Sepsis Guideline for the resuscitation of pediatric septic shock indicates that
      up to 60 mL/kg of isotonic saline should be administered within the first 15 minutes of
      resuscitation. There are practical challenges to achieving these benchmarks. Syringes are
      often used to perform manual fluid resuscitation as they are generally available and health
      care providers are typically comfortable using them. Health care providers have been observed
      to have different preferences regarding the syringe size used to perform manual fluid
      resuscitation. Larger syringes e.g. 60 mL-size requires more force to depress the syringe
      plunger, due to a larger crosssectional area, but fewer syringes are needed to administer a
      given volume. Fewer syringes results in less time spent connecting and disconnecting
      syringes, which contributes to total fluid resuscitation time using this technique.

      Consenting participants will be randomly assigned (by an independent Randomization
      Coordinator) to one of four syringe size groups (10 mL, 20 mL, 30 mL, 60 mL sizes). The
      allocation sequence is therefore concealed. After undergoing a standardization procedure,
      each participant will be instructed to administer 900 mL of 0.9% normal saline using
      pre-filled provided syringes by manual push as rapidly as possible using the
      disconnect-reconnect method. Participants will be advised to consider that they are in a
      situation where they are resuscitating a 15 kg child (represented by the model) in
      decompensated shock. Syringes for each 300 mL (20 mL/kg) aliquot will be colour-coded for
      identification purposes.

    <description>Subject is randomized and the intervention is performed the same day. Start Intervention Time (time zero): Subject begins administering the intervention; End Intervention Time: Subject has completed the intervention (900 mL of Saline has been administered); Total Intervention Time = End Intervention Time - Start Intervention Time. All testing is being video recorded. A blinded outcome assessor will review the video tapes and based upon clear, a priori defined, definitions will determine the Start Intervention Time and the End Intervention Time for each subject.</description>

    <description>Any IV catheter dislodgement episodes will be recorded. The catheter used in this model is a 1.00 inch, 22-gauge, Insyte Autoguard IV catheter. The proximal end (hub) of the IV catheter is transfixed to the hand of the mannequin in typical clinical fashion, while the distal end is located within conduit tubing that leads to a 1 litre graduated cylinder. Connected to the hub of the IV catheter is a 7 inch long IV Catheter Extension Set.</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of the administration of 900 mL of Normal Saline to the model using the &quot;Disconnection- Reconnection&quot; method of manual fluid resuscitation. All syringes (syringe size based on study arm) will be prepared by research staff following subject randomization. Each subject will take the prepared syringes, and sequentially administer them to the model by 1. Selecting and connecting a fluid-filled syringe to the catheter extension set to permit fluid administration 2. Manually administering the fluid to the model by depressing the syringe plunger 3. Disconnecting and discarding the empty syringe 4. Repeating steps 1-3 as fast as possible until all 900 mL has been administered.</description>
