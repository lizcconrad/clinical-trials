  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      JNJ-39758979 compared with placebo in patients with uncontrolled asthma despite current
      treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and/or long-acting beta 2-agonist (LABA) and/or
      montelukast for at least 4 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study; each part of the study (Part 1 and Part 2) will be approximately 34
      weeks in duration including a 4-week screening phase, a 24-week placebo-controlled treatment
      phase and a six-week follow-up phase. In Part 1, patients will be randomly assigned to
      receive placebo or JNJ-39758979 300 mg once daily through Week 24. In Part 2, patients will
      be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups to receive treatment with placebo, 30 mg, 100
      mg, or 300 mg of JNJ-39758979 once daily through Week 24. Safety assessments and evaluations
      to determine the efficacy of JNJ-39758979 to reduce the signs and symptoms of asthma will be
      performed both on a daily basis via electronic diary and at study visits.
