  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if magnesium pantoprazole 20 mg twice a day
      (b.i.d.), maintains gastric pH above 4 during a longer percentage of time than magnesium
      pantoprazole 40 mg once a day (qd). This is a comparison between split dose concept and
      standard dose of proton pump inhibitors.

      Eligible healthy volunteers will be randomly assigned for 2 different treatment sequences: A)
      magnesium pantoprazole 20 mg b.i.d. followed by magnesium pantoprazole 40 mg q.d. or B)
      magnesium pantoprazole 40 mg q.d. followed by magnesium pantoprazole 20 mg b.i.d.

      Treatment sequences will be administrated as follows: 6 days with the first medication,
      followed by a washout period of 8 days (no medication) and a further period of 6 days with
      the second medication.

      Treatment efficacy will be established by the percentage of time with intragastric pH &gt;4,
      measured by 24-hour pH-Metry on day 6 of each medication (on-treatment measurement). Basal pH
      will be measured as reference.

      The blinding distribution of treatments will be maintained for the patients, the doctor and
      the statistician who will analyze the data.
