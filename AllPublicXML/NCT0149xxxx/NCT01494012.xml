      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of stereotactic body radiation
      therapy (SBRT) in treating patients with metastatic or recurrent ovarian cancer or primary
      peritoneal cancer. SBRT may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less
      damage to normal tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate response of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer to stereotactic body radiation
      therapy (SBRT) using fludeoxyglucose F 18 (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography
      (PET)/computed tomography (CT) 3 months after therapy.

      II. Determine the rate of grade 3 or greater non-hematologic acute toxicity from SBRT using
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate response to SBRT using cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) and symptom assessment using
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Ovarian Symptom Index (FOSI).

      II. Determine the rate of late and non-grade 3 acute toxicity using CTCAE version 4.0.

      III. Evaluate local control, progression-free survival, and overall survival following SBRT.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo SBRT 5 days a week for approximately 1 week in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9, and 12
      months, and then every 6 months for 4 years.
