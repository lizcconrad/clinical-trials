  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first-in-human (Phase I) study of AMG 172, an antibody drug conjugate (ADC), in
      subjects with kidney cancer [Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC)] who have relapsed or
      who have refractory disease following at least two prior therapies. The purpose of the study
      is to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of AMG 172, and also evaluate the objective
      response rate in patients with ccRCC receiving AMG 172. The study will be conducted in two
      Parts: Part 1 will explore doses of AMG 172 given every two weeks and every three weeks to
      determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics to establish a maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD), and Part 2 (dose expansion) will examine safety, tolerability, PK and overall response
      rate in subjects treated at the MTD established in Part 1 for either every two week or every
      three week dosing.

      This First in- human study of AMG 172 will be conducted in two parts: Part 1 (dose
      exploration) and Part 2 (dose expansion). Part 1 of the study is aimed at evaluating the
      safety, tolerability and PK of AMG 172 given every two weeks and every three weeks in
      subjects with relapsed / refractory cc RCC, and Part 2 is aimed at evaluating safety,
      tolerability, PK and response rate in subjects treated at the MTD established in Part 1 for
      either every two week or every three week dosing. Up to 48 subjects may be enrolled in Part
      1, and up to 30 subjects may be enrolled in Part 2. The dose of AMG 172 utilized in Part 2
      will be dependent upon data obtained in Part 1 of the study.
