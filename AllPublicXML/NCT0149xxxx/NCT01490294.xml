  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The object of this study is to compare four different dosages of Gadavist 1.0 in cardiac
      Magnetic Resonance Tomography (MRT) imaging with the imaging results of a cardiac SPECT
      examination in terms of diagnostic quality.

      For this purpose Gadavist dosages of 0.01 mmol/kg, 0.025 mmol/kg, 0.05 mmol/kg or 0.1mmol/kg
      body weight are administered. A study participant receives the respective dose twice i.e. at
      rest and at stress using Adenosine (which puts circulation into a state of stress similar to
      that of physical exercise). The time between both injections is 10-15 min.

      The total imaging time is about 45 min.

        <title>Percentage Agreement Between Gadobutrol Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (Blinded Reading) and SPECT (Central Reading) Regarding the Diagnosis for Detection of Cardiac Perfusion Deficits Based on Myocardial Regions</title>
        <description>Rest and stress perfusion Magnetic Resonance (MR) images were evaluated by 3 independent blinded readers for presence/absence of cardiac perfusion deficits in 3 myocardial regions representing the 3 coronary territories/arteries (left anterior decendent [LAD], left circumflex [LCX], right coronary artery [RCA]). Data were compared to the corresponding regional data from Single Photon Emission Computer Tomography (SPECT). The number of regional assessments was calculated by multiplication of the number of participants with the number of the blinded readers and number of the myocardial regions.</description>

        <title>Percentage Agreement Between Gadobutrol Perfusion MRI (Blinded Reading) and SPECT (Central Reading) Regarding the Diagnosis for Detection of Cardiac Perfusion Deficits Based on Myocardial Segments</title>
        <description>Rest and stress perfusion MR images were evaluated by 3 independent blinded readers for presence/absence of cardiac perfusion deficits in 16 myocardial segments (defined according to the American Heart Association). These data were compared to the corresponding segmental data from SPECT. The number of segmental assessments was calculated by multiplication of the number of participants with the number of the blinded readers and the number of the myocardial segments.</description>

          <description>Rest and stress perfusion MR images were evaluated by 3 independent blinded readers for detailed characterization of cardiac perfusion deficits i.e. scar, ischemia or mixture of both in 16 myocardial segments (defined according to the American Heart Association). MR data were compared to the corresponding segmental data from SPECT. The number of segmental assessments was calculated by multiplication of the number of participants with the number of the blinded readers and the number of the myocardial segments.</description>

        <title>Percent Agreement Between Combined Gadobutrol Perfusion MRI (Perfusion Imaging and Delayed (DE) Imaging; Blinded Reading) and SPECT (Central Reading) Regarding a Detailed Diagnosis of Perfusion Deficits Based on Myocardial Segments</title>
        <description>Rest and stress perfusion and DE MR images were evaluated by 3 independent blinded readers regarding the detailed characterization of cardiac perfusion deficits i.e scar, ischemia or a mixture of both in 16 myocardial segments (defined according to the American Heart Association). MR data were compared to the corresponding segmental data derived from SPECT. The number of segmental assessments was calculated by multiplication of the number of participants with the number of the blinded readers and the number of myocardial segments.</description>

        <description>Rest and stress perfusion MR images were visually evaluated by 3 blinded readers. The MPRI was calculated by an independent MR expert. Analysis was performed for 16 myocardial segments (defined according to the American Heart Association). Visual and semiquantitative data were compared to each other per segment. The number of segmental assessments was calculated by multiplication of the number of participants with the number of the blinded readers and the number of the myocardial segments.</description>

        <description>Delayed enhancement (DE) -[accumulation of Gadobutrol in infarcted tissue and visualized as Gadobutrol enhanced regions]- MR images acquired at different time points, were evaluated by the clinical investigator for presence/absence of DE at 5 - 20 minutes post injection in 3 myocardial regions representing the 3 coronary territories/arteries (LAD, LCX, RCA).
