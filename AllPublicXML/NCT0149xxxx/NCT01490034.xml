  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the rising incidence of obesity, much emphasis has been placed on identifying
      mechanisms of increased energy intake. At this point, the mechanisms responsible for the
      recent increase in obesity prevalence have not been thoroughly examined. Pre-ingestive
      influences, such as cognitive factors, may play a larger role in creating an energy surplus
      than previously thought. Expectations about the satiating effect of a food may override the
      post-ingestive influences in dictating further consumption. In addition, obese individuals
      may exhibit a decreased compensatory response to foods as compared to lean individuals.

      Understanding the effects of energy content, food form, and learning on satiation, satiety,
      and energy intake will allow for a greater understanding of the mechanisms of energy
      imbalance as a whole. Food choice is dictated by sensory properties and post-ingestive
      effects. By utilizing foods with similar sensory properties, the acquired knowledge derived
      from ingesting these foods can be monitored by analyzing subsequent intake at the same meal
      and at subsequent eating occurrences. It is hypothesized that the liquid food form will
      elicit weaker dietary compensation; that is, energy intake at other eating events will not be
      adjusted to compensate for that food. In addition, it is posited that the lower energy food
      will cause lower compensation postprandially. By having participants consume the same test
      food daily over a two week learning period, it is thought that they will show improved
      dietary compensation when the initial testing is repeated due to learned associations between
      food properties and metabolism.
