      This randomized phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of
      Se-methyl-seleno-L-cysteine or selenomethionine in preventing prostate cancer in healthy
      participants. Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The
      use of Se-methyl-seleno-L-cysteine or selenomethionine, two different types of selenium
      compounds, may prevent prostate cancer from forming.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the individual toxicity profiles of Se-methyl-seleno-L-cysteine (methyl
      selenocysteine; MSC) and selenomethionine (SeMet) administered to cohorts of men daily for
      twelve weeks, with dose escalation with each successive cohort.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the pharmacokinetics of selenium, according to form (MSC vs SeMet): MSC and
      SeMet impacts on plasma, albumin, and urinary concentrations of selenium over 48 hours on
      dosing days 1 and 84.

      II. To evaluate the pharmacodynamics of selenium by form (MSC vs SeMet): plasma, albumin, and
      urinary Selenoprotein P (Sepp1) concentrations and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity over
      48 hours on dosing days 1 and 84.

      III. To store plasma and formed elements (red cells plus platelets) for future analysis of
      methyl selenol and other key selenium species, when those assays become available.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment
      arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive Se-methyl-seleno-L-cysteine orally (PO) on days 1-84.

      ARM II: Participants receive selenomethionine PO on days 1-84.

      ARM III: Participants receive placebo PO on days 1-84.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on day 112.
