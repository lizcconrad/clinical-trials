  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended dose of I-131-CLR1404, a
      radiolabeled therapy compound, for treating subjects with cancer that does not respond to
      treatment or has returned. The identified recommended dose in this study will be used as the
      optimal dose of I-131-CLR1404 in subsequent clinical trials conducted for later phase
      clinical development.

      Subjects who meet study entry criteria will receive I-131-CLR1404. For each subject, the
      study will be conducted in two phases, dosimetric and therapy. In the dosimetric phase,
      subjects will receive one 5 mCi dose of the study drug and undergo whole body imaging on on
      the day of infusion and on post-infusion days 1, 2, 3, and 6 for assessment of
      biodistribution of I-131-CLR1404. If normal and expected biodistribution are demonstrated,
      the subject will begin the therapy phase. In the therapy phase, the first cohort of subjects
      will receive a dose of 12.5 mCi/m2. Dose escalation in subsequent cohorts will initially be
      in increments of 12.5 mCi/m2. Subjects will be followed and observed for unacceptable
      toxicity through 56 days after the therapy dose infusion with follow-up for up to one year.

      All subjects will be prescribed thyroid protection medication to be taken 24 hours prior to
      injection of the dosimetric dose, and continuing for 14 days after the administration of the
      therapy dose.
