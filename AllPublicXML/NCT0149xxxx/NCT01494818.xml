  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the effect of the repeated usage of two
      different contact lens care systems (one hydrogen peroxide-based cleaning and disinfecting
      system, and one polyaminopropyl biguanide (PHMB)-containing multipurpose system) with
      silicone hydrogel contact lenses worn on a daily wear basis for three months. The specific
      aspect of interest was the effect on the ocular tissue, in particular the eyelids and their
      associations with the contact lens surface wettability and surface contamination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects attended the enrollment visit having worn their habitual silicone hydrogel
      contact lenses for at least six hours on the day of the visit. The enrollment visit was
      scheduled so that the subjects' habitual lenses were at least 14 ± 3 days old for the
      subjects replacing their lenses bi-weekly and at least 30 ± 5 days old for those replacing
      their lenses monthly.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Papillae</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Eyelid papillae (bumps on the inner eyelid) were recorded separately for three zones of the upper lid and overall for the lower lid on a 5-point forced choice scale (0 = None; 1 = Slight (diffuse papillae); 2 = Mild (diffuse &amp; tufts papillae); 3 = Moderate (moderate &amp; tufts papillae); 4 = Severe (giant papillae). The maximum value represents the worse grade in any zone. Both eyes were included in the model for analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Eyelid Hyperaemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Eyelid hyperaemia (redness) was recorded separately for three zones of the upper lid and overall for the lower lid on a 5-point forced choice scale (0 = Clear; 1 = Slight redness; 2 = Mild redness; 3 = Moderate redness; 4 = Severe redness). The maximum value represents the worst grade in any zone. Both eyes were included in the model for analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Upper Lid Redness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The contact lenses were removed and upper lid redness was objectively measured through digital images. The coverage of the palpebral surface by blood vessels is expressed as percentage of the total surface measured. Both eyes were included in the model for analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Upper Eyelid Margin Staining at Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The contact lens was removed and ophthalmic dye was instilled. Upper eyelid margin staining was objectively measured through digital images. The extent of true staining (i.e., the total area of lid margin covered by staining) was recorded. Both eyes were included in the model for analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Non-Invasive Pre-Lens Tear Film Break Up Time (PL-NIBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The pre-lens tear film is the layer of tears located on top of the contact lens (i.e., between the eyelid and the contact lens). The time required for a dry spot to appear on the pre-lens surface after blinking is referred to as the pre-lens tear film break up time. PL-NIBUT was evaluated using a biomicroscope with a diffuse illumination source, i.e., Tearscope. A longer PL-NIBUT indicates a more stable tear film and greater on-eye lens wettability. Three PL-NIBUT measurements were recorded, and the median value was used for analysis. Both eyes were included in the model for analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Protective Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>A digital video recording was made of the interblink period. The percentage of area of the visible contact lens covered by the tear film was calculated (Protected Area). The Protective Index is defined as the average tear coverage over the whole interblink period. Both eyes were included in the model for analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Front Lens Deposits</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Deposits present on the front surface of the lens were assessed with a biomicroscope while the lens was on eye. Deposits were rated on a 5-point forced choice scale (0 = none; 1 = slight; = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe) in five lens zones. The median of the five zones was used for analysis. Both eyes were included in the model for analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Lipid Uptake Per Lens</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The contact lens was aseptically removed from the eye. Lipids were extracted and analyzed using a proprietary High Performance Liquid Chromatography technique. A lower value would indicate a cleaner lens surface.</description>

        <description>Eyelid hyperaemia (redness) was recorded separately for three zones of the upper lid and overall for the lower lid on a 5-point forced choice scale (0 = Clear; 1 = Slight redness; 2 = Mild redness; 3 = Moderate redness; 4 = Severe redness). The maximum value represents the worst grade in any zone. Both eyes were included in the model for analysis.</description>

        <title>Median Non-Invasive Pre-Lens Tear Film Break Up Time (PL-NIBUT)</title>
        <description>The pre-lens tear film is the layer of tears located on top of the contact lens (i.e., between the eyelid and the contact lens). The time required for a dry spot to appear on the pre-lens surface after blinking is referred to as the pre-lens tear film break up time. PL-NIBUT was evaluated using a biomicroscope with a diffuse illumination source, i.e., Tearscope. A longer PL-NIBUT indicates a more stable tear film and greater on-eye lens wettability. Three PL-NIBUT measurements were recorded, and the median value was used for analysis. Both eyes were included in the model for analysis.</description>

          <description>Deposits present on the front surface of the lens were assessed with a biomicroscope while the lens was on eye. Deposits were rated on a 5-point forced choice scale (0 = none; 1 = slight; = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe) in five lens zones. The median of the five zones was used for analysis. Both eyes were included in the model for analysis.</description>
