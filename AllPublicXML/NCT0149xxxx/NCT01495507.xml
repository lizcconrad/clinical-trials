  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The field of patellofemoral disorders and accordant therapeutical interventions is a high
      turnover research field. It is important to verify the clinical outcome with appropriate
      measuring tools. There is evidence that the Kujala score is a reliable and widely used
      measuring instrument of patellofemoral disorders. Indeed, the Kujala score was already used
      in many studies investigating patellofemoral disorders - also in german speaking patient
      groups. Unfortunately, we are not aware of a validated german version of the Kujala score.
      Other relevant knee outcome scores were already successfully translated into german language
      and validated by previous investigators.

      So, it is the aim of our study to cross-culturally adapt and then to validate the Kujala
      score for use in German-speaking individuals with patellofemoral instability. It is
      hypothesized that the german version of the Kujala score shows:

        -  High divergent construct validity as determined by significant differences between
           patients and controls (hypothesis 1)

        -  High convergent construct validity as determined by significant correlations with other
           relevant scoring systems (hypothesis 2)

        -  High reliability (hypothesis 3)

        -  High responsiveness (hypothesis 4)
