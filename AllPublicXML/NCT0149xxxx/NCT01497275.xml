  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects (good and bad) of the combination of
      ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) and bortezomib (Velcade) in patients with relapsed/refractory
      mantle cell lymphoma.

      Zevalin is a monoclonal antibody that is combined with a radioactive substance and given with
      another monoclonal antibody called rituximab (Rituxan). It works by attaching to cancer cells
      and releasing radiation to damage those cells. Both Zevalin and Rituxan are given in this
      study, along with Velcade.

    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, unblinded single arm Phase II trial to evaluate the combination of
      yttrium90 ibritumomab tiuxetan and bortezomib in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle
      cell lymphoma (MCL). Standard hematology and chemistries, imaging and bone marrow biopsies
      will be done.

      Research tests: 17cc of blood will be collected at screen, Day 8 OR 11 and month 3. Samples
      will be collected and stored for future analysis. These analyses may include but are not
      limited to measurements of proteasome inhibition. No genetic studies will be performed on
      these samples. Samples will be destroyed at the end of the study.

      Primary Objective Estimate the overall response rate (CR + PR) of the combination of
      bortezomib and ibritumomab tiuxetan in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell
      lymphoma.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Estimate the progression free and overall survival in patients with relapsed/refractory
           mantle cell lymphoma who receive bortezomib and ibritumomab tiuxetan.

        -  Assess the toxicity of the combination of bortezomib and ibritumomab tiuxetan in
           patients with relapsed/refractory MCL.

    <description>Disease will be assessed every 3 months.
The Cheson criteria will be used to define response:
Complete Response = Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease and disappearance of all disease-related symptoms if present prior to therapy.
Partial Response = A decrease of ≥ 50% in the sum of the products of their greatest transverse diameters (SPD) of up to six of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses should be selected according to the following features: a) they should be clearly measurable in at least two perpendicular measurements; b) they should be from as disparate regions of the body as possible; and c) they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved.</description>

Rituximab 250mg/m2 will be given on day 1 and on day 8. Bortezomib 1.5mg/m2 will be given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Y90 ibritumomab tiuxetan will be given on Day 8. Dosage will be based on the platelet count obtained at the time of study enrollment. The dose will be 0.4 millicurie (mCi)/kg unless the enrollee's platelets are between 100,000 and 150,000 in which case a dose of 0.3mCi/Kg will be used. Patients who weigh over 80 Kg will receive a maximum dose of 32mCi.</description>

        <title>Response Rate (Complete Response + Partial Response)</title>
        <description>Disease will be assessed every 3 months.
The Cheson criteria will be used to define response:
Complete Response = Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease and disappearance of all disease-related symptoms if present prior to therapy.
Partial Response = A decrease of ≥ 50% in the sum of the products of their greatest transverse diameters (SPD) of up to six of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses should be selected according to the following features: a) they should be clearly measurable in at least two perpendicular measurements; b) they should be from as disparate regions of the body as possible; and c) they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved.</description>

Y90 ibritumomab tiuxetan will be given on Day 8. Dosage will be based on the platelet count obtained at the time of study enrollment. The dose will be 0.4 millicurie (mCi)/kg unless the enrollee's platelets are between 100,000 and 150,000 in which case a dose of 0.3mCi/Kg will be used. Patients who weigh over 80 Kg will receive a maximum dose of 32mCi.</description>
