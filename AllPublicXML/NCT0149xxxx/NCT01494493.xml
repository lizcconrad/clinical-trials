        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Has degenerative disc disease as noted by back pain of discogenic origin, with or
             without leg pain, with degeneration of the disc confirmed by patient history (
             e.g.,pain [leg, back, or symptoms in the sciatic nerve distribution], function deficit
             and/or neurological deficit)and radiographic studies ( e.g., CT, MRl, X-Ray, etc.) to
             include one or more of the following:

               -  instability( defined as angular motion &gt; 5° and/or translation &gt;= 2-4mm, based on
                  Flex/Ext radiographs);

               -  osteophyte formation;

               -  decreased disc height;

               -  thickening of ligamentous tissue;

               -  disc degeneration or herniation; and/or

               -  facet joint degeneration.

          2. Has preoperative Oswestry score &gt; 35.

          3. Has no greater than Grade 1 spondylolisthesis utilizing Meyerding's Classification
             (Meyerding HW, 1932.).

          4. Has single-level symptomatic degenerative involvement from L4 to S1.

          5. Is at least 18 years of age, inclusive, at the time of surgery.

          6. Has not responded to non-operative treatment (e.g., bed rest, physical therapy,
             medications, spinal injections, manipulation, and/or TENS) for a period of at least 6
             months.

          7. If female of child-bearing potential, who is not pregnant or nursing, and who agrees
             to use adequate contraception for 16 weeks following surgery.

          8. Is willing and able to comply with the study plan and sign the Patient Informed
             Consent Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          2. Has posterior spinal instrumentation (which will not be removed) stabilizing the
             involved level or has had a previous posterior lumbar interbody fusion procedure at
             the involved level.

             such as steroids or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (this does not include low
             dose aspirin for prophylactic anticoagulation or perioperative steroids).

          4. Has osteopenia, osteoporosis, or osteomalacia to a degree that spinal instrumentation
             would be contraindicated.

          5. Has presence of active malignancy or prior history of malignancy (except for basal

         17. Has a history of hypersensitivity to protein pharmaceuticals (monoclonal antibodies or
             gamma globulins) or collagen.

         18. Has received treatment with an investigational therapy within 28 days prior to
             implantation surgery or such treatment is planned during the 16 weeks following
             rhBMP-2/ACS implantation.
