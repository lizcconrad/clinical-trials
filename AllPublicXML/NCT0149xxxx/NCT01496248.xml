      Thirty-five female outpatients aging from 18 to 65 years, who were remitted from major
      depression with residual symptoms (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale, MADRS â‰¤ 12),
      were given Korean red ginseng at doses of 3g / day during 8 weeks.

    <measure>Depression Residual Symptom Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This consists of 25 items and includes specific residual depressive symptoms, e.g. sadness and anhedonia, lack of energy, psychomotor retardation and anxiety, as well as items reflecting subjective feelings of vulnerability, loss of internal reference points and increased emotionalism. Patients were instructed to compare the past 7 days with the period before the very first symptoms of the most recent depressive episode. Each item is scored as 0 to 3. A total score is the range from 0(none) to 75(most severe).</description>

    <description>This has been described as simple, highly sensitive, and reliable rating scales for subjective experiences. The VAS in this study is used for assessing of variation in severity of residual symptoms. The subject is asked to indicate his/her perceived symptom severity along a 100 mm horizontal line, and this rating is then measure from the left edge (0, no symptom) to right edge (100, most severe).</description>

    <description>This is a 10-item depression rating scale, widely used in depressed patients. Each item is rated from 0 to 6. A total score is the range from 0(none) to 60(most severe). The MADRS has been designed to measure severity of depression in clinical samples and be sensitive to change during antidepressant treatment.</description>

The VAS in this study is used for assessing of variation in severity of residual symptoms. The subject is asked to indicate his/her perceived symptom severity along a 100 mm horizontal line, and this rating is then measure from the left edge (0, no symptom) to right edge (100, most severe).</description>
