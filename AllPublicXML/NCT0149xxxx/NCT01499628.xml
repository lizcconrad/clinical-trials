  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe visual impairment in
      the UK, Europe and N America. Low vision patients with AMD have great difficulty reading,
      which leads to a loss of independence and reduced quality of life. Magnifiers alone do not
      compensate for loss of central vision in AMD. It has been proposed that special low vision
      training can improve reading ability in patients with AMD. Training programmes are widely
      available in the US and Scandinavia, but not in the UK, partly because there is a lack of
      evidence from Randomised Control Trials (RCT) showing that they are effective. The
      investigators are conducting a clinical trial comparing the conventional hospitalâˆ’based low
      vision service to enhanced rehabilitation programmes that include Eccentric Viewing training.
      Eccentric viewing training involves teaching patients who have lost their central vision to
      use a new area of retina for visual tasks. Patients are either taught to improve the use of
      the part of the retina they naturally start using after their central vision is lost, their
      so-called preferred retinal locus (PRL), or, alternatively, they are taught to use a
      different retinal area that is thought to be better suited for everyday visual tasks, the
      so-called trained retinal locus (TRL). The investigators plan to compare the two types of
      eccentric viewing training to conventional hospital-based low vision care.
