    <textblock>
      The present pilot study is designed to assess the extent to which rasagiline may improve
      cognition in Parkinson's disease patients requiring dopaminergic therapy. The primary
      objective is to assess improvement in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in patients
      who have been on rasagiline at 1mg daily for twelve weeks. The secondary objective is to
      assess changes in the SCOPA-COG, FAB, and UPDRS II &amp; III at the end of week 14.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women aged 40 or older with idiopathic Parkinson's disease on stable
             dopaminergic therapy for at least 1 month. The UK Brain Bank Criteria will be used to
             establish the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Women must be post menopausal or agree
             to avoid pregnancy. Modified Hoehn &amp; Yahr staging &lt; 3 and MoCA score must be greater
             than 21 but less than 28. Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is a sensitive and specific
             screen for depression in the Parkinson's disease population. GDS scores of &lt; 5 will be
             included in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with secondary dementia, severe depression and atypical Parkinson's syndromes
             or Parkinson's plus will be excluded from the study. Patients on acetylcholine
             esterase or NMDA inhibitor medication will be excluded from the study. Patients with
             history of brain surgery for Parkinson's disease, stroke or significant head injury,
             active epilepsy will be excluded. Patients on Amantidine, neuroleptics,
             metoclopramide, alphamethyldopa within the last 6 months will be excluded. Individuals
             using meperidine, and tramadol will be excluded. Patients with congestive heart
             failure or myocardial infarction will also be excluded to avoid vascular dementia.
