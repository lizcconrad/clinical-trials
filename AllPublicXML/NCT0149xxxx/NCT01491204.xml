  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Oral
      Paclitaxel. Eligible subjects of this study are patients with histologically or cytologically
      confirmed malignant solid tumor refractory to standard therapy.

      Administration Schedule: 1 cycle of Oraxol®(paclitaxel+HM30181A) medication was 28 days and
      Oraxol® was administrated total 3 times once a week (day 1, 8, 15). The next cycle started on
      day 29.

      Methods of Administration: HM30181A tablet was administered 1hour prior to the medication of
      paclitaxel

      Besides the main objective, there are 3 other objectives as follows.

      To determine dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) Of Oraxol. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of
      HM30181A(pgp inhibitor), paclitaxel and its metabolites following oral administration of
      Oraxol.

      To evaluate anticancer activity of Oraxol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must histologically or cytologically be diagnosed to have an advanced solid
             cancer.

          2. Patients have progressive disease in spite of standard anti-cancer therapy or are not
             expected to benefit or prolong survival from any existing anti-cancer therapy

          3. Patients who received chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery must have passed at
             least 4weeks since the final treatment and must have fully recovered from the
             toxicities Patients treated by Nitrosoureas or Mitomycin C must wait 6 weeks before
             becoming eligible.

          4. ECOG performance status ≤ 2

          5. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks

          6. Patients have proper bone marrow, kidney, liver function and patients do not have
             remarkable dysfunction of heart and lung: WBC≥4000/mm3; Platelet ≥100,000/mm3;
             Hemoglobin≥9.0g/dL; ANC≥ 1,500 /mm3; Creatinine ≤ 1.5mg/dL; AST/ALT/ALP ≤ 3 X the
             upper limit of normal; Total bilirubin ≤2.0mg/dL *AST/ALT/ALP ≤ 3 X the upper limit of
             normal but &lt;5 if liver or bone metastasis is present

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with blood tumor (ex, leukemia), uncontrolled infectious disease, neurologic
             disorders, metastasis to CNS or ileus (patients requiring non-oral administration of
             anti-biotics to treat active bacterial infection are nor eligible, but patients can
             participate in the trial after complete eradication or control of the infection)

          2. Patients who have received bone marrow transplant or are to receive bone marrow
             transplant.

          3. Patients who had the medical history of atrial or ventricular arrhythmia or congestive
             heart failure or received medical treatment for myocardial infarction within 6 months.

          4. Pregnant or lactating or with childbearing potential without use of adequate
             contraception (in case of men, appropriate contraception is required).

          5. Patients who are on PGP inhibitor such as Cyclosporine or Verapamil which are
             prohibited.: Such patients may qualify after two-week wash-out period.
