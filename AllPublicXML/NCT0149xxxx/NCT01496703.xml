  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) decreases the risk of acute rejection and is associated with
      improved graft survival in renal transplant recipients. However, MMF-related side effects
      often necessitate dose reduction which may expose transplant recipients to a higher risk of
      acute rejection and graft loss. This study's aim was to examine the reasons for MMF dose
      reduction during the first year after kidney transplantation and its impact on acute
      rejection, overall and death-censored graft loss. Methods: Retrospective electronic file
      based analysis of all patients who underwent a single kidney transplantation in our center
      between 1996 and 2007 and were treated with MMF as part of their initial maintenance
      immunosuppressive protocol (n=749).

        All patients who received a single renal transplant at the University Hospitals of Leuven
        between April 1996 (when MMF was introduced in the Leuven renal transplant program) and
        February 2007 and were treated with MMF (Cellcept®, Roche) as part of their initial
        maintenance immunosuppressive regimen were included in this retrospective analysis. If a
        patient underwent more than one kidney transplantation in the abovementioned 11-year
        period, only the last was considered. No other exclusion criteria were applied.
