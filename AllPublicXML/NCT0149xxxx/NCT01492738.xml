      This study endeavors to examine the relationship between acupuncture, anxiety, and
      performance on a test of working memory. In the study, all participants will complete the
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) survey to determine how anxious they are at the moment
      and how anxious they tend to be in general. Then ½ of subjects will receive acupuncture for
      20 minutes and ½ will rest quietly for 20 minutes. After this period, all subjects will again
      complete the STAI survey. Then all subjects will complete the Automated Operations Span Task
      (AOSPAN) which is a computerized test of working memory. Statistical analysis will be
      performed to determine if acupuncture had any effect on State-level anxiety and on
      performance on the AOSPAN.
