  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The GIFT study is a prospective, multi-center, interventional trial using the drug GM-CSF for
      the reversal of innate immune suppression in critically injured children. The study will be
      conducted in two phases, a dose-finding phase then an efficacy phase. The dose-finding phase
      is the current active phase of the study. The central hypothesis of the study is that
      immunomodulation with GM-CSF will result in reduction in the risk of nosocomial infection
      after critical injury in high-risk children through safe, rapid, and sustained improvement in
      innate immune function.

      The current phase of the study is an open-label dose-finding phase in which critically
      injured children undergo prospective, serial immune function testing in the first few days
      after injury. If a subject's immune function (as measured by whole blood ex vivo LPS-induced
      TNF-alpha production capacity) is below a critical threshold, the subject will receive GM-CSF
      at a dose of 30, 62, or 125 mcg/m2 per day for three days. Enrollment is stratified by
      pubertal status (Tanner 1 or Tanner &gt; 1) and by presence or absence of severe traumatic brain
      injury (TBI). Dose-finding is being conducted independently in each of these strata. The
      outcome variable for the dose-finding phase of the GIFT study is restoration of TNF-alpha
      production capacity and monocyte HLA-DR expression by the end of treatment, persisting to
      post-trauma day 7. A subsequent randomized, placebo-controlled trial with nosocomial
      infection as the primary outcome variable is planned once dose-finding is complete. This
      study is being conducted by the NICHD's Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research
      Network (CPCCRN) with Nationwide Children's Hospital as the primary site. The study design
      information currently displayed on this site refers to the dose-finding phase of the project.

             penetrating trauma that occurred within the last 72 hours.

          -  Age 1 - 17 years

          -  Provisional Injury Severity Score (ISS) &gt; 10
