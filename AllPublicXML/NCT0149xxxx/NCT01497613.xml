    <textblock>
      Although technology offers great potential for enhancing the health and well-being of older
      adults, robust studies are needed to quantify the value of technology and further the
      investigators understanding of barriers to technology access among older adults and of
      strategies that are effective in removing these barriers. This cross-site randomized field
      trial will evaluate a simple to use Personalized Reminder Information and Social Management
      System (PRISM) designed to support social connectivity, memory, skill building and resource
      access for older adults. The PRISM system (PRISM C condition) will be compared to an notebook
      information control condition (PRISM B condition). The target population is older adults who
      live at home alone and are at risk for isolation. The goal of the study is to gather
      systematic evidence about the value of technology for older adults and to identify factors
      that affect use and usability, acceptance and technology adoption. The investigators will
      also gather longitudinal data on the benefits of the system. Participants aged 65 - 85 years
      (100 per site) will be randomly assigned following baseline assessment to one of two
      conditions: PRISM C condition where participants receive the technology system or the PRISM B
      condition only control where participants receive a notebook that includes information
      similar to that provided in PRISM C (e.g., resource guide). The categories of information
      provided in the notebook is similar to the features provided on the system. Participants will
      include males and females who do not have a home computer and who have limited Internet
      experience. The intervention period is 12 months. A battery of measures that includes
      demographic information, attitudes towards technology (including computer self-efficacy and
      computer comfort), technology, computer and Internet experience, functional independence and
      well-being, emotional well-being social support/isolation, and quality of life will be
      administered at baseline, and 6 and 12 months post randomization. In addition, the
      investigators will assess cognitive abilities at baseline and twelve months. The
      investigators will also gather data regarding technology use and social interactions via a
      brief telephone interview at 18 months post randomization.
