      The purpose of this study is to test the effect of a mobile phone-assisted lifestyle
      intervention on weight loss at 6 months among overweight/obese Chinese adults, as compared to
      a control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rapid gains in China's economic development during the past two decades have been
      accompanied by similar gains in the population's waistline. Over 25% of Chinese adult females
      and more than a third of males are overweight or obese and rates are highest in urban areas
      such as Beijing. By 2015, overweight/obesity prevalence in China may reach 50% , thus
      imposing a heavy toll on chronic disease rates and health care costs. Despite these pressing
      public health challenges, very few obesity intervention studies have been conducted among
      Chinese adults.

      Duke University and Peking University have partnered to implement an intervention to address
      these rapid changes in weight. 124 participants in Beijing will be randomly assigned to
      either: (1) usual care (UC), or; (2) a 6-month weight loss (WL) intervention condition. The
      primary outcome is weight change (kg) at 6 months post-baseline. Secondary outcomes include
      change in blood pressure, weight circumference, dietary intake, physical activity, and
      psychosocial mediators at 6 months post-baseline.

      Participants randomized to the intervention arm will receive a series of components,
      delivered over 6 months: personalized behavior change goals to be self-monitored via text
      messaging, group &quot;starter&quot; counseling sessions, and personalized individual counseling. Each
      participant will also receive a pedometer to facilitate self-monitoring. These are
      evidence-based approaches, drawn from the investigators' collective research experience.
