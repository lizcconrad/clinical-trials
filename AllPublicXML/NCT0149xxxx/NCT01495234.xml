  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to generate data relating to patient safety, bone generating activity
      associated with the use of the rhBMP-2/BCP device as compared to autograft and to evaluate
      the feasibility of conducting a larger clinical trial in a patient population requiring
      spinal fusion.

    <time_frame>12 month</time_frame>
    <description>A neurological functional questionnaire will be completed by patients prior to surgery and postoperative, including three questions pertaining to pain (severity of pain, location of pain, and leg pain side), and four questions associated with functional activities (recreational activity level, putting on shoes and socks, squatting, occupation activity level). Success will be based on a maintenance or improvement from the preoperative condition for the functional components, except that severity of pain success will be based on an improvement of at least one point on the five point scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurological Status</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month</time_frame>
    <description>A scale will be used to measure neurological status. This scale focuses on reflexes, sensory, motor function, and the degree of straight leg raise reproducing pain. All of these elements are combined to give an overall score. Success will be based on a maintenance or improvement in all categories from the preoperative condition.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has radiographically documented spinal degeneration with instability as
             documented by the presence of translation &gt;= 4mm or angulation &gt;= 5°.

          -  Subject has intractable back pain which does not respond to conservative treatment and
             in the investigator's opinion, requires surgical spinal fusion.

          -  Subject's pain is predominantly associated with the back.

          -  Subject has only one level involvement at L3-L4, L4-L5, or L5-S1.

          -  Subject is 18 years of age or greater at the time consent is given to participate in
             the study.

          -  Subject is willing to comply with the study plan and sign the informed consent.

          -  Subject is male or a non-pregnant, non-nursing female. All females of child-bearing
             age must agree to use adequate contraception for a period of no less than 16 weeks
             following surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has primary spinal diagnosis of a disorder other than spinal degeneration with
             instability at the involved surgical level.

          -  Subject has spinal stenosis or condition which requires a full laminectomy procedure.

          -  Subject has had a previous fusion, discectomy or laminectomy procedure at L3-L4, L4-L5
             or L5-S1.

          -  Subject has received drugs which may interfere with bone metabolism within two weeks
             prior to the planned date of spinal fusion surgery (e.g., steroids, methotrexate) or
             has a condition which requires postoperative medications that interfere with fusion
             (e.g., steroids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or methotrexate).

          -  Subject has overt or active infection near the operative spinal region.

          -  Subject has active systemic infection.

          -  Subject has history of autoimmune disease (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus or
             Dermatomyositis).

          -  Subject's history includes hypersensitivity to protein pharmaceuticals (monoclonal
             antibodies or gamma globulins).

          -  Subject has received treatment with an investigational therapy within 28 days prior to
             implantation surgery or such treatment is planned during the 16 weeks following
             rhBMP-2/BCP implantation.

          -  The subject requires electrical bone growth stimulation, allograft, or bone substitute
             as part of treatment.

          -  Subject has history of endocrine or metabolic disorder known to affect osteogenesis
             (e.g. Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy, Ehlers Danlos syndrome, or osteogenesis
             imperfecta).

          -  Subject has a known diagnosis of diabetes which requires treatment with medication.

          -  Subject has received previous radiation therapy at the site to be fused.

          -  Subject is unwilling to return for required follow-up visits.

          -  Subject is a prisoner.

          -  Subject has insufficient bone mass which precludes surgery (e.g., severe osteopenia or
             osteoporosis).
