  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated hypofractionated radiotherapy
      dose (MTD) to a solitary metastatic focus ('index lesion') when followed by ipilimumab, in
      metastatic melanoma patients without brain involvement The secondary objectives are to
      determine late toxicity, immune-related clinical responses and immune pharmacodynamic changes
      after hypofractionated radiotherapy followed by ipilimumab

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patient &gt; 18 years old

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of melanoma

          -  Previously treated or previously untreated metastatic melanoma by AJCC staging
             criteria

          -  Presence of an index lesion &gt; 1 cm amenable to hypofractionated radiotherapy and at
             least one other additional lesion that can be followed for response using RECIST
             criteria

          -  ECOG Performance status 0 or 1

          -  Signed informed consent document

          -  Ability to tolerate stereotactic body radiation therapy (e.g. lie flat and hold
             position for treatment)

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Prior systemic therapy within 14 days of study enrollment. Patients must be adequately
             recovered from prior systemic therapy side effects as deemed by the PI.

          -  Clinical contraindication to stereotactic body radiotherapy (e.g. active systemic
             sclerosis, active inflammatory bowel disease if bowel is within target field, etc)

          -  Presence or history of central nervous system metastasis (including brain)

          -  Long-term use of systemic corticosteroids

          -  Prior RT that precludes the delivery of hypofractionated radiotherapy
