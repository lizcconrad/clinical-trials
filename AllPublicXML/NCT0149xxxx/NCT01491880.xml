  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will examine the feasibility of two modes of service delivery (e.g., a
      minimal therapist contact, self-help program, and a more intensive therapist supported,
      telephone-based approach) in a rural, primarily Latino, population. These modes of delivery
      may ultimately improve access to evidence based treatments and mental health outcomes among
      underserved groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with anxiety disorders are often characterized by an unmet need for treatment
      however, in special populations such as Latino and rural youth, such disparities are
      compounded by the effects of culture and geographic isolation. More specifically, barriers
      related to language, stigma, and access often lead to lower rates of utilization and poorer
      outcomes among children in need of mental health services (Alvidrez and Azocar, 1999; McCabe
      et al., 2002; Myers et al., 2008; Vega et al., 2001). These findings are disappointing given
      abundant data supporting the effectiveness of cognitive behavior and behavior therapies for
      children with anxiety disorders (Barrett et al., 1996; Beidel et al., 2007; Kendall &amp;
      Southam-Gerow, 1996; Walkup et al., 2008). Efforts to examine feasible methods to deliver
      evidence-based treatments to children with anxiety disorders are critical in order to extend
      quality care to underserved groups. The goal of this R34 is to address these disparities, by
      translating and tailoring an existing child anxiety cognitive behavior therapy program (The
      Cool Kids Outreach Program; Lyneham and Rapee, 2006), to fit the needs of Spanish-speaking
      rural families and examining the feasibility, acceptability, tolerability and safety of
      implementing this intervention using varying modes of delivery.

      A pilot study for children (age 8-13) with anxiety disorders (i.e., separation anxiety
      disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias) will
      be conducted and 40 children will be randomized to two service delivery modes which represent
      varying levels of therapist contact: 1) 20 families will be randomized to a telephone-based,
      therapist-supported CBT program, and; 2) 20 families will be randomized to a more minimal
      contact bibliotherapy condition (primarily CBT self-help materials). All families will be
      recruited from primary care settings, given its defacto mental health service status.
      Feasibility and clinical outcomes will be measured at baseline, midtreatment and
      post-treatment. Additionally, during exit interviews, participants (as well as those who may
      have dropped out of the program) will be asked to discuss the perceived usefulness,
      acceptability, and impact of the intervention. This pilot study will provide important data
      regarding the feasibility, acceptability, tolerability and safety of the intervention
      conditions as well as the opportunity to pilot procedures that will be used in a larger
      effectiveness trial with rural Latino youth.

    <description>The aim of this pilot study is to understand issues of feasibility rather than formal hypothesis testing.
The construct of acceptability will be evaluated by parents' reports on Consumer Satisfaction Questionnaire (March et al., 1999). Overall mean scores reflecting at least &quot;above average&quot; ratings (5 or greater on Consumer Satisfaction) will be considered acceptable.</description>

    <description>Overall feasibility will be defined as the ability to complete the study procedures and goals in the proposed time frame. Further the feasibility of the program will be evaluated by participants' report on the Barriers to Treatment Participation Scale (Kazdin et al., 1997); overall mean scores reflecting that &quot;barriers&quot; were &quot;never a problem, occasionally a problem or sometimes a problem&quot; will be considered acceptable.</description>

    <description>The child anxiety program by telephone is an adaptation of Ron Rapee's Cool Kids Outreach Program (Lyneham and Rapee, 2006) for child anxiety, with appropriate adaptations made to meet the needs of rural Latino families (including a Spanish translation). This is a parent mediated program, where parents are taught how all the skills of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and how to apply these skills to these children's anxieties. Children are also expected to participate, however all direct contact that a therapist may have, is with the parent only.</description>

    <description>Families randomized to the Self-Help CBT condition will receive program materials along with instructions for completing weekly assignments. Specifically, they will receive the same materials as families in the telephone-based condition however in the self-help group, parents and children are expected to read the materials for that week and complete the workbook activities without planned therapist involvement. Instead they will be given the option to initiate a telephone call to the therapist, if they have questions or need extra support.</description>
