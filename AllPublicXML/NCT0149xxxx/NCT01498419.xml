    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide written, informed consent prior to all trial-related procedures including HIV
             testing (if an HIV test was performed within 1 month prior to trial start, it should
             not be repeated as long as documentation can be provided [ELISA and/or Western Blot]).

          -  Body weight (in light clothing and with no shoes) between 40 and 90 kg, inclusive.

          -  Sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB (at trial appointed laboratory). For Drug Sensitive
             TB treatment arms, subjects should be newly diagnosed and previously untreated.
             Exception: Participants can be included in the trial if they were diagnosed and
             treated for TB greater than 5 years prior to screening and can provide documentation
             of cure for that episode. Additionally, participants who have previously received H
             prophylactically can be included as long as that treatment is/was discontinued at
             least 7 days prior to randomization into this trial. Drug sensitive status to be
             confirmed with fluoroquinolone, rifampicin and isoniazid susceptibility testing at
             screening using Hain Plus rapid sputum test.

        For the MDR-TB treatment arm only: Subjects with smear-positive MDR infection, defined as
        confirmed resistance to at least both R and H confirmed at screening for entry into this
        trial. Resistance to R and H will be determined using the rapid screen test (Hain Plus). If
        the first spot sputum shows an indeterminate result, the test must be repeated on freshly
        collected spot sputum or overnight sputum and that result may be used.

        Subjects with newly diagnosed MDR-TB are defined as a) subjects with MDR-TB who have never
        been treated for TB before, or b) subjects with MDR-TB who have previously been treated
        with only one course of first-line TB drugs (H, R, E, Z and/or S) and that treatment is/was
        discontinued at least 7 days prior to randomization into this trial. Additionally, MDR-TB
        participants who have previously received H prophylactically can be included as long as
        that treatment is/was discontinued at least 7 days prior to randomization into this trial.

          -  A chest X-ray picture which in the opinion of the Investigator is compatible with TB.

          -  Sputum positive (at site laboratory) on direct microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (at
             least 1+ on the IUATLD/WHO scale).

          -  Ability to produce an adequate volume of sputum as estimated from a spot assessment
             (estimated 10 ml or more overnight production).

          -  Females may participate if they are: 1) of non-childbearing potential (have had a
             bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation and/or hysterectomy or have been postmenopausal
             for at least 12 consecutive months), 2) if they are using effective birth control
             methods and are willing to continue practicing birth control methods throughout
             treatment or 3) be non-heterosexually active, practice sexual abstinence or have a
             vasectomized partner (confirmed sterile). Therefore to be eligible for this study
             women of childbearing potential should either: 1) use a double barrier method to
             prevent pregnancy (i.e. use a condom with either diaphragm or cervical cap) or 2) use
             hormonal based contraceptives in combination with a barrier contraceptive, or 3) use
             an intrauterine device in combination with a barrier contraceptive. They must also be
             willing to continue these contraceptive measures until one week after the last dose of
             study medication or one week after discontinuation from study medication in case of
             premature discontinuation. (Note: Hormone-based contraception alone may not be
             reliable when taking IMP; therefore, hormone-based contraceptives alone cannot be used
             by female participants to prevent pregnancy).

          -  Male participants who are having heterosexual intercourse with females of
             child-bearing potential are required to use one of the following birth control methods
             during their participation in the trial and for 12 weeks after their last dose of
             study medication to prevent pregnancy:

          -  a double barrier method which can include a male condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, or
             female condom; or

          -  a barrier method combined with hormone-based contraceptives or an intra-uterine device
             for the female partner.

        The use of the above mentioned birth control method does not apply if the male participant
        has been vasectomised or has had a bilateral orchidectomy minimally three months prior to
        screening, or is not heterosexually active, or practices sexual abstinence or if the female
        sexual partner has had a bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation and/or hysterectomy or has
        been postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months.

             results for fluoroquinolones or pyrazinamide, however once these are received after a
             participant has entered into the study and if the results show the participant is
             resistant to fluoroquinolones and/or pyrazinamide, such a participant should be
             removed from the trial. DS participants will not be replaced, but MDR-TB participants
