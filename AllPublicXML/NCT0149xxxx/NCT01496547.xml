  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with refractory and relapse leukemia had poor outcome even with allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation. In our previous retrospective study, the overall survival is 14.6+/-8.8%
      while 90% patients eventually relapsed with marrow ablative conditioning mostly standard
      iv-Bu-Cy or Cy-TBI. The accumulated TRM is 29.5+/-11.5%. Thus our data suggested that the
      conventional transplantation approach may not be able to overcome the refractory disease. A
      new strategy to combined a low dose regimen following intensive chemotherapy for tumor
      reduction seems to be effect in both relapsed. high-risk and refractory AML or ALL. In this
      study, we focus on a new treatment strategy for particular refractory AML patients.

      This is a single arm phase II trial to test the efficacy and feasibility of new sequential
      intensive chemo and transplantation approach for refractory leukemia. Patients with
      refractory acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia are enrolled in this trial. Patients will
      received intensive chemotherapy including Fludarabine, cytarabine and idarubicin as
      (FLAG-IDA). Seven days after the chemotherapy, sequential transplantation conditioning
      regimen as fludarabine and busulfan will be given.
