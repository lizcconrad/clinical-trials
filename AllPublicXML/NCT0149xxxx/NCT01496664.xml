  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the registry is to assess results of combined operative and catheter based
      (hybrid procedure) treatment of patients with significant coronary artery disease using
      essential clinical and angiographic parameters.

      Based on existing literature we expect the results of coronary artery bypass grafting of the
      anterior descendent coronary artery (LAD), segment 1 and 2, using the so-called mammary
      artery graft, to be superior to stent treatment of the same artery.

      At the same time a catheter based intervention using balloon, bare metal stents (BMS) or drug
      eluting stents (DES) seems to be a better treatment that a saphenous vein graft for other
      coronary arteries than the LAD. I.e. the right coronary artery (RCA) and the left circumflex
      coronary artery (CX).

      Therefore, we expect a combination of the mentioned surgical and catheter based techniques to
      be a better treatment than bypass operation or catheter based intervention alone.

  <detailed_description>

      A total of 150 consecutive patients will be included in the study. The patients will have a
      coronary artery narrowing located to the LAD, which can be treated with a mammary graft, and
      a stenosis located to other coronary arteries (RCA and CX), which can be treated by balloon
      or stent.

      The patients included in the study will be recruited from patients who are referred to the
      Department of Cardiology/Department of Thoracic Surgery, Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby
      for treatment of significant coronary artery disease. We will not announce for patients, and
      the patients will not receive a honorarium for participation.

      The first 100 patients will be treated i two seances; operation and stent treatment with few
      days interval. The last 50 patients will be treated in a hybrid operation room with operation
      and stent treatment in the same seance.
