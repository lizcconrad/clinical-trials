  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 26-week, prospective double-blind, randomized pilot trial of nebivolol versus an
      active control, metoprolol succinate, in patients with established lower-extremity peripheral
      artery disease, hypertension, and at least moderate risk for coronary artery disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects up to an estimated 16-29% of men and women over age
      50, and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Beta-blockers
      have been shown to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and death in patients with
      coronary artery disease (CAD) and are indicated for the treatment of hypertension in patients
      with PAD. However, there is a theoretical risk that antihypertensive therapy may decrease
      limb perfusion pressure and therefore exacerbate symptoms of claudication or limb ischemia.
      Patients with CAD and concomitant PAD are less likely to be prescribed beta-blockers, even
      though most patients are able to tolerate antihypertensive therapy without worsening of
      symptoms.

      The third generation beta-blocker, nebivolol, has vasodilating properties in addition to
      beta-adrenergic blockade. This vasodilatory effect is mediated through the L-arginine-nitric
      oxide-dependent pathway. Nitric oxide is a critical modulator of vascular disease with
      effects that lead to vasodilatation, endothelial regeneration, inhibition of leukocyte
      chemotaxis and inhibition of platelet adhesion. This combination of beta-blockade and nitric
      oxide-dependent vasodilation may enhance effectiveness and tolerability of nebivolol versus
      other beta-blockers in patients with hypertension, CAD or high-risk state, and PAD.

      This study will be a pilot comparative effectiveness study to examine the effect of nebivolol
      versus metoprolol succinate in patients with lower-extremity PAD and at least moderate risk
      for CAD on PAD symptoms as measured by both functional and quality of life measures.

    <measure>Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) - Change Calf Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline WIQ is completed at the time of enrollment and again at the final study visit at 26 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in calf pain as captured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ). A 5 point Likert scale scoring ranges from 1) No Difficulty, 2) Slight Difficulty, 3) Some Difficulty, 4) Much Difficulty, and 5) Great Difficulty. The scores are determined by dividing the score by the maximum possible score and then multiplying by 100. The score ranges from 0-100 with lower scores indicating greater pain.</description>

    <measure>Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) - Change in WIQ Distance Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline WIQ is completed at the time of enrollment and again at the final study visit at 26 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in distance score as captured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) distance score subscale. The degree of difficulty in the walking of specific distances is ranked on a 0 to 4 Likert scale, in which 0 represents the inability to walk the distance and 4 represents no difficulty. A Likert scale is an ordinal scale of consecutive, equidistant, numerical values (ie, 0 to 4). The distances assessed in the WIQ range from walking indoors around the home to walking 5 blocks (1500 feet). The items on the subscale are weighted according to the difficulty of walking. The distance score is determined by dividing the total weighted score by the greatest possible weighted score and multiplying by 100. Scores range from 0-100.</description>

    <measure>Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) - Change in WIQ Speed Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline WIQ is completed at the time of enrollment and again at the final study visit at 26 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in speed score as captured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) speed score subscale. In the walking speed component, the degree of difficulty walking is ranked on a 0 to 4 scale where speed is assessed for each of the following speeds: at the following speeds: 1, slowly; 2, average speed; 3, quickly; or 4, running or jogging 1 block. Zero represents the inability to walk the specified speed, and 4 represents no difficulty. The items on the subscale are weighted according to the difficulty of the task. The speed score is determined by dividing the total weighted score by the greatest possible weighted score and multiplying by 100. Scores range from 0-100.</description>

    <description>Change in stairs score as captured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) stairs subscale. This scale item asks the subject to describe the degree of difficulty climbing one, two, or three flights of stairs in the past week. A flight of stairs is defined as 14 steps. A 5 point Likert scale scoring ranges from 1) No Difficulty, 2) Slight Difficulty, 3) Some Difficulty, 4) Much Difficulty, 5) Unable to Do, or 6) Didn Do for Other Reasons. The items on the subscale are weighted according to the difficulty of the task. The stairs score is determined by dividing the total weighted score by the greatest possible weighted score and multiplying by 100. Scores range from 0-100.</description>

        <title>Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) - Change Calf Pain</title>
        <description>Change in calf pain as captured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ). A 5 point Likert scale scoring ranges from 1) No Difficulty, 2) Slight Difficulty, 3) Some Difficulty, 4) Much Difficulty, and 5) Great Difficulty. The scores are determined by dividing the score by the maximum possible score and then multiplying by 100. The score ranges from 0-100 with lower scores indicating greater pain.</description>

        <title>Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) - Change in WIQ Distance Score</title>
        <description>Change in distance score as captured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) distance score subscale. The degree of difficulty in the walking of specific distances is ranked on a 0 to 4 Likert scale, in which 0 represents the inability to walk the distance and 4 represents no difficulty. A Likert scale is an ordinal scale of consecutive, equidistant, numerical values (ie, 0 to 4). The distances assessed in the WIQ range from walking indoors around the home to walking 5 blocks (1500 feet). The items on the subscale are weighted according to the difficulty of walking. The distance score is determined by dividing the total weighted score by the greatest possible weighted score and multiplying by 100. Scores range from 0-100.</description>

Zero represents the inability to walk the specified speed, and 4 represents no difficulty. The items on the subscale are weighted according to the difficulty of the task.

This scale item asks the subject to describe the degree of difficulty climbing one, two, or three flights of stairs in the past week. A flight of stairs is defined as 14 steps. A 5 point Likert scale scoring ranges from 1) No Difficulty, 2) Slight Difficulty, 3) Some Difficulty, 4) Much Difficulty, 5) Unable to Do, or 6) Didn Do for Other Reasons. The items on the subscale are weighted according to the difficulty of the task.

          <description>Change in stairs score as captured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) stairs subscale. This scale item asks the subject to describe the degree of difficulty climbing one, two, or three flights of stairs in the past week. A flight of stairs is defined as 14 steps. A 5 point Likert scale scoring ranges from 1) No Difficulty, 2) Slight Difficulty, 3) Some Difficulty, 4) Much Difficulty, 5) Unable to Do, or 6) Didn Do for Other Reasons. The items on the subscale are weighted according to the difficulty of the task. The stairs score is determined by dividing the total weighted score by the greatest possible weighted score and multiplying by 100. Scores range from 0-100.</description>
          <population>Four people in the nebivolol group and 1 person in the metoprolol group did not complete the items in the &quot;Stairs&quot; WIQ subscale therefore they were excluded from the analysis. One person in the metoprolol succinate group withdrew consent before the end of the study so they were also excluded from the final analysis.</population>
