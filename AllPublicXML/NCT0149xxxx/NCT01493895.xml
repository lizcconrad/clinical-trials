    <textblock>
      For centuries, light has been a well-known and effective healing method. In the beginning of
      the 20th century there was a first attempt to condense light energy and distribute it in
      higher levels, a use that was successfully applied on many soldiers wounded in the Second
      World War. The laser, which is based on the quantum phenomenon of stimulated emission, was
      first demonstrated in the beginning of the 1960s and immediately received many applications
      in all areas of medicine.Many different studies were carried out in the past decade trying to
      assess the effect of laser therapy on properties of healing wounds. This study aim to assess
      the efficacy and safety of Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) in the treatment of non-healing
      diabetic foot ulcers.

    <description>All treatments will be carried out by trained study caregivers that will give standard treatment to all the participants under their care.
Every treatment will consist of the following steps:
A thorough rinse with an antiseptic soap (Septal scrub) with a stream of warm water.
Drying of the foot with an absorbable disposable paper towel. Using clean latex gloves the caregiver will beam the ulcer with LLLT 808, B-cure laser machine in the following method.</description>

    <description>From the day of entering the study, ulcers will be treated twice daily regardless of the treatment that was used until then.
All treatments will be carried out by trained study caregivers that will give standard treatment to all the participants under their care.
Every treatment will consist of the following steps:
A thorough rinse with an antiseptic soap (Septal scrub) with a stream of warm water.
Drying of the foot with an absorbable disposable paper towel. Using clean latex gloves the caregiver will beam the ulcer with LLLT 808, B-cure laser machine in the following method.
The part of the laser machine from which the laser beam is radiating - the beam guard, will be cleaned with a disposable swab of 70% alcohol. The cleaning will be performed while the machine is pointing downwards.</description>
