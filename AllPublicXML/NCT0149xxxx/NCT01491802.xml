  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary information from our laboratory indicated that even patients with milder chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can have significant physiological derangements which
      become more pronounced during exercise, leading to intolerable dyspnea at lower levels of
      ventilation than in health. This study will explore pathophysiological mechanisms of dyspnea
      and activity limitation in GOLD stage II COPD and will determine if there is a sound
      physiological rationale for the use of dual long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA)/long-acting
      muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) therapy (GSK573719/ GW642444 Inhalation Powder) versus LAMA
      alone (GSK573719) as treatment for dyspnea and exercise intolerance in this subpopulation.
      Objectives of this study are to determine if: 1) neuromechanical uncoupling of the
      respiratory system contributes to exertional dyspnea in milder COPD, and 2) treatment with
      LABA/LAMA improves dyspnea and exercise endurance compared with LAMA by improving
      neuromechanical coupling. The investigators hypothesize that: 1) dyspnea is related to
      excessive dynamic lung hyperinflation, tidal volume restriction and increased ratio of
      central respiratory neural drive to tidal volume displacement, a measure of neuromechanical
      uncoupling of the respiratory system, and 2) LABA/LAMA will improve dyspnea and exercise
      endurance, which will be explained by partial reversal of the above mechanical abnormalities.
      The investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blind crossover study and compare the
      effects of once-daily LABA/LAMA over 4-weeks with LAMA on dyspnea, exercise endurance and
      ventilatory mechanics in GOLD stage II COPD.

    <measure>Exertional Dyspnea Intensity at Isotime Exercise.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Intensity of dyspnea (defined as breathing discomfort) at a standardized time (isotime) during constant work rate exercise tests as measured by the modified 10-point Borg scale. A rating of 0 represents no dyspnea up to a maximum of 10: a smaller rating is therefore an improvement. Isotime was defined as the highest exercise time in minutes completed in both post-treatment tests.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Intensity rating (modified 10-point Borg scale) measured at a standardized time (isotime) during constant work rate exercise tests. A rating of 0 represents no &quot;unpleasantness of breathing&quot; up to a maximum of 10. An improvement would be noted as a decrease in the Borg scale rating. Isotime was defined as the highest exercise time in minutes common to both post-treatment tests.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>EMGdi was measured during constant work rate exercise tests via a multipair-electrode esophageal catheter. EMGdi expressed as a percentage of its maximum is used as an index of inspiratory neural drive.
