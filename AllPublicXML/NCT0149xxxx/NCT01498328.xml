  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether adding an experimental vaccine
      called rindopepimut (also known as CDX-110) to the commonly used drug bevacizumab can improve
      progression free survival (slowing the growth of tumors) of patients with relapsed EGFRvIII
      positive glioblastoma.

      This Phase II study will enroll patients into three groups. Group 1 are patients who have
      never been treated with bevacizumab. These patients will be randomly assigned to receive
      either rindopepimut/GM-CSF or KLH, each along with bevacizumab. Treatment assignment for
      Group 1 will be blinded. Group 2 and Group 2C patients are those who are refractory to
      bevacizumab (experienced recurrence or progression of glioblastoma while on bevacizumab or
      within 2 months of discontinuing bevacizumab). These patients will all receive
      rindopepimut/GM-CSF along with bevacizumab. Patients will be treated until disease
      progression or intolerance and all patients will be followed for survival. Patients may be
      treated with other therapies that are not part of the study after discontinuing treatment
      with the study vaccine.
