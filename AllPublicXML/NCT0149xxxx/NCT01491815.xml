  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international (Nordic) trial designed to compare the safety and efficacy of active
      conventional therapy (ACT) and three biologic treatments in subjects with early rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA). The global aim of this study is to assess and compare

        1. the proportion of subjects who achieve remission with ACT versus three different
           biologic therapies (Certolizumab-pegol, Abatacept or Tocilizumab)

        2. two alternative de-escalation strategies in patients who respond to first-line therapy.
