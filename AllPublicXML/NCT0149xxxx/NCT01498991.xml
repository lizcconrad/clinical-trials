  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury
      (SCI) who remain unable to walk normally 1 year after their SCIs are able to sense and move
      the affected legs better after 10-13 weeks of treatment with a new robotic therapy device.

      The hypothesis is that using the AMES device on the legs of chronic subjects with incomplete
      SCI will result in improved strength, sensation in the legs, and improved functional gait in
      the treated limbs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) affects over 200,000 people in the USA, with several
      thousand new injuries each year. Most recovery, following SCI, occurs in the six months
      following surgery. Further recovery after 12 months is unusual.

      In this study 10 subjects, more than 1 year post injury, will be enrolled to test the safety
      and efficacy of a new type of robotic therapy device known as the AMES device. The aim of
      this Phase I/II study is to investigate the use of assisted movement and enhanced sensation
      (AMES) technology in the rehabilitation of the legs of participants with incomplete SCI.

    <description>The AMES device rotates the ankle over a range of 30 degrees while vibrators stimulate the tendons attached to muscles that move the leg. Each participant will receive treatment of both lower extremities. Treatment of the 2 legs will be scheduled to run in the same session. The subject's task is to assist the motion of the device. The AMES treatment device couples assisted movement and tendon vibration (enhanced sensation) in 30 treatments which will each run approximately 40 minutes (20 minutes on the right leg and 20 minutes on the left leg).</description>
