  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will determine whether people with high muscle mitochondrial capacity
      produce higher amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on consuming high fat /high glycemic
      diet and thus exhibit elevated cellular oxidative damage. The investigators previously found
      that Asian Indian immigrants have high mitochondrial capacity in spite of severe insulin
      resistance. Somalians are another new immigrant population with rapidly increasing prevalence
      of diabetes. Both of these groups traditionally consume low caloric density diets, and the
      investigators hypothesize that when these groups are exposed to high-calorie Western diets,
      they exhibit increased oxidative stress, oxidative damage, and insulin resistance. The
      investigators will compare Somalians and NE Americans who are matched for age, BMI, and sex.
      The investigators will measure ROS production in skeletal muscle following high fat/high
      glycemic diet vs. healthy diet. The investigators will compare the oxidative damage to
      proteins, DNA, and lipids in these two populations following 10 days of high fat/high
      glycemic index diet in comparison with low fat diet. The investigators will determine if
      elevated levels of oxidative damage in Somali immigrant populations is accompanied by high
      mitochondrial capacity, higher ROS-emitting potential, and lower insulin sensitivity than NE.
      The proposed study will be performed utilizing the state-of-the-art proteomic and metabolomic
      methods many of which were recently developed in our laboratory. The investigators expect the
      results from this study to provide seminal insights into the underlying mechanism of insulin
      resistance and type 2 diabetes, in addition to demonstrating mechanisms by which a functional
      proteome is maintained in vivo.
