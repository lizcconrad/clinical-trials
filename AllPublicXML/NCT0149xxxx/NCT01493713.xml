      The purpose of this study is to to evaluate the correlation of overall objective response
      according to RECIST v1.1. criteria evaluated by conventional imaging techniques, morphologic
      response by CT, and histopathologic response in patients with resectable hepatic metastasis
      secondary to colorectal cancer treated with bevacizumab in combination with XELOX.
