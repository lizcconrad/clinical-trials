  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 3 clinical trial is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of
      BioThrax anthrax vaccine in healthy adults following 3 doses of BioThrax. Results of this
      study will be used to support a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) indication for BioThrax.

      This study will be conducted in the United States (U.S.), in 200 healthy male and female
      volunteer subjects ages 18 to 65 years.

      The duration of study participation for each individual subject will be approximately 128
      days (4.25 months), including a screening period of approximately 28 days followed by 100
      days on study.

      BioThrax® (also called Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed or AVA) is the only FDA-licensed vaccine for
      the prevention of anthrax infection. This study will evaluate the immunogenicity of the
      vaccine using a post-exposure vaccination schedule. Correlations will be drawn to
      immunogenicity and survival data from animal models to demonstrate that BioThrax® can elicit
      a protective immune response for PEP.

    <description>Injection site reactions (warmth, tenderness, itching, pain, arm motion limitation, redness, lump, swelling, and bruise) were evaluated by using a web-enabled subject diary. Subjects assessed the severity of warmth, tenderness, itching, pain, arm motion limitation, lump, and bruise as absent, mild, moderate, or severe based on the degree of interference with daily activities. Severity of redness and swelling were based on the diameter of the affected area. Severe injection site reactions were recorded as adverse events by the investigator site staff after confirmation with the subject.</description>

        <title>Incidence of Injection Site Reactions by Severity (Mild, Moderate, Severe) From Subject Diary Cards</title>
        <description>Injection site reactions (warmth, tenderness, itching, pain, arm motion limitation, redness, lump, swelling, and bruise) were evaluated by using a web-enabled subject diary. Subjects assessed the severity of warmth, tenderness, itching, pain, arm motion limitation, lump, and bruise as absent, mild, moderate, or severe based on the degree of interference with daily activities. Severity of redness and swelling were based on the diameter of the affected area. Severe injection site reactions were recorded as adverse events by the investigator site staff after confirmation with the subject.</description>
        <time_frame>Web-enabled diaries were completed for 7 days after each of three injections (Days 0, 14, and 28).</time_frame>
        <population>The reporting group was subjects who had any diary data available during the 7-day-post-vaccination period (i.e., n=196, n=196, and n=193, for the1st, 2nd, and 3rd post-vaccination periods, respectively).</population>

        <title>Percentage of Injection Site Reactions by Severity (Mild, Moderate, Severe) From Subject Diary Cards</title>
        <description>Injection site reactions (warmth, tenderness, itching, pain, arm motion limitation, redness, lump, swelling, and bruise) were evaluated by using a web-enabled subject diary. Subjects assessed the severity of warmth, tenderness, itching, pain, arm motion limitation, lump, and bruise as absent, mild, moderate, or severe based on the degree of interference with daily activities. Severity of redness and swelling were based on the diameter of the affected area. Severe injection site reactions were recorded as adverse events by the investigator site staff after confirmation with the subject.</description>

        <title>Incidence of Systemic Reactions by Severity (Mild, Moderate, Severe) From Subject Diary Cards</title>
        <description>Systemic reactions (fatigue/ tiredness, muscle ache, headache, and fever) were evaluated by using a web-enabled subject diary. Subjects assessed severity as absent, mild, moderate, or severe based on the degree of interference with daily activities. Severity of fever was assessed using a grading scale. Severe systemic reactions were to be recorded as adverse events by the investigator site staff after confirmation with the subject.</description>
        <time_frame>Web-enabled diaries were completed for 7 days after each of three injections (Days 0, 14, and 28).</time_frame>
        <population>The reporting group was subjects who had any diary data available during the 7-day-post-vaccination period (i.e., n=196, n=196, and n=193, for the1st, 2nd, and 3rd post-vaccination periods, respectively).</population>

        <description>Systemic reactions (fatigue/ tiredness, muscle ache, headache, and fever) were evaluated by using a web-enabled subject diary. Subjects assessed severity as absent, mild, moderate, or severe based on the degree of interference with daily activities. Severity of fever was assessed using a grading scale. Severe systemic reactions were to be recorded as adverse events by the investigator site staff after confirmation with the subject.</description>
