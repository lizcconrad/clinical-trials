  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the investigators can do some tests on tissue from the
      area of the ablation. The investigators want to know if a test can help predict whether the
      ablation worked.

      The treated tumor is normally evaluated with CT. The CT shows signs of treated tumor(s) in
      the area treated by ablation. However, cancer cells may begin to grow in or near the treated
      area. The CT scan cannot tell us if the cells are new cancer cells or if they are healthy
      liver cells that just look different because of the ablation. The test the investigators will
      study should be able to tell us the difference.

    <description>will be measured according to EASL and RECIST.

    <description>will be measured as the time from the date of first objective response until the first measurement of progression as determined by the central readers using the EASL criteria. Dynamic Liver CT scans, preferably including the liver triphasic examination will be conducted at each follow-up visit until progression.</description>

    <description>The selected patients will undergo CT guided percutaneous ablation. The use of multi-tined electrode is encouraged, unless tumor location requires the use of an internally cooled needle electrode to eliminate injury to an adjacent vital structure or the operator prefers to use an internally cooled electrode for a specific reason.</description>

    <intervention_name>CT guided percutaneous ablation</intervention_name>
    <description>Depending on tumor size and location, we will direct a core biopsy needle in the ablated tumor using post-ablation dynamic Liver CT guidance, preferably including liver triphasic examination. The obtained tissue will be detached, collected and submitted to our molecular cytology laboratory. All specimens will be submitted fresh to our molecular cytology laboratory for immediate analysis in order to classify them as viable tumor (V) or apoptotic cells/coagulation necrosis (CN). CT will be performed within 24 hours of the ablation to demonstrate the ablation defect, representing the area of coagulation necrosis. This CT will be used for targeting the ablated tumor for biopsy. All patients will undergo CT again, approximately within 4-8 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) of percutaneous ablation to evaluate for CN in the target tumor or any sign of residual tissue enhancement, representing incomplete treatment.</description>
