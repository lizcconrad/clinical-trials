    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot clinical trial is to evaluate the feasibility of using the
      investigational implant (INFUSE® Bone Graft and MASTERGRAFT® Granules with the CD HORIZON®
      Spinal System) as a method of facilitating spinal fusion in patients with symptomatic
      degenerative disc disease.
