      In this study, the investigators would like to assess how intravesical BCG schedules after
      immunization of non muscle invasive bladder patients with the recMAGE-A3 protein, together
      with adjuvant AS15 (recMAGE-A3 + AS15 ASCI), may enhance innate and vaccine-specific T cell
      responses both systemically and locally in the bladder.
