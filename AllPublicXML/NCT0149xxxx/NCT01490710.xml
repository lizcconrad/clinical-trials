  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite spectacular advances since the 90s mechanical ventilation used in intensive care
      units are amply associated with cardio-respiratory complications: nosocomial pneumonia, lung
      parenchyma lesions induced by ventilation, hemodynamic instability and ultimately to a
      significant morbidity and mortality.

      NAVA (Neurally Adjusted Assist Ventilation) ventilatory support, provides synchronous
      support, proportionate to patient's respiratory efforts. More &quot;physiological&quot;, this mode
      would decline its efficacy on patient hemodynamic response. However, to date, no study has
      focused on hemodynamic impact of NAVA. This is precisely the purpose of NAVADYN11 study,
      which aims to assess NAVA efficacy on cardiac index in pediatric intensive care unit.
