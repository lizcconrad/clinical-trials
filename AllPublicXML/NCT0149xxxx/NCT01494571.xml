    <textblock>
      The PharmaJet needle-free injection system is a consistent approach to delivering injectates
      into the dermal layer of the human skin for the purpose of vaccination or medication
      delivery.

      Up to 400 children, ages 2 months through 14 years

        1. To assess measures of injection performance, including estimates of injection
           completeness by collecting residual surface moisture with filter paper that will be
           circled with indelible ink; the volume will be compared to a reference set of moisture
           recordings.

        2. To document completeness of injections; completeness is defined as &lt;10% of 0.1 ml volume
           remaining on the skin surface immediately after injection. Measurement of the bleb size
           following injection will recorded in millimeters.

        3. To ensure device is well received by subjects. Subject's response to the injection will
           be noted by the subject and/or family members after the procedure for up to 48 hours.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants and children between ages 2 months and 14 years

          -  Outpatient, expected to go home day of surgery

          -  Written consent and assent when appropriate

          -  Willing to complete and return pain diary (postcard) after 48 hours

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presently have skin rash at the intended injection site

          -  Have a history of use of any topical or systemic medications at the intended injection
             site that could have potentially altered the normal physical properties of the skin
             (i.e. atrophy from chronic steroid use, thinning of the skin from topical or systemic
             retinoids).

          -  Have a permanent physical change in the skin at the intended injection site, such as
             burns, scars or prior radiation therapy.

          -  Skin disorders that may predispose them to develop skin lesions at sites of trauma.

          -  Present use of any blood thinning medications.

          -  In the 10-11 year old cohort, none of the participants can have started puberty.
