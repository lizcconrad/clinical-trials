  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib dose escalation study of dovitinib given in combination with either
      gemcitabine plus cisplatin or carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients
      with advanced solid tumors, for whom treatment with gemcitabine plus cisplatin or carboplatin
      would otherwise be warranted, will be enrolled. The dose of dovitinib will be escalated in
      successive cohorts using standard &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation rules. Patients will continue
      treatment, in the absence of prohibitive toxicity, until disease progression. The study will
      define the recommended phase II dose of these combination regimens.

      This is a phase Ib study of dovitinib given in combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin or
      carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors. This study will utilize standard 3+3 dose
      escalation rules to define the recommended phase II dose. Dose escalation will proceed
      independently in the two cohorts (cisplatin cohort: gemcitabine + cisplatin + dovitinib;
      carboplatin cohort: gemcitabine + carboplatin + dovitinib). Patients will receive treatment
      for up to 6 cycles, in the absence of toxicity, until disease progression

      Primary Objective:

      To determine the recommended phase II dose of dovitinib given in combination with gemcitabine
      plus cisplatin or carboplatin.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the response rate to treatment as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
           Tumors (RECIST)

        -  To determine the toxicity of treatment at per the Common Terminology for Adverse Events
           (CTCAE v4)

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of dovitinib in combination with gemcitabine plus
           cisplatin or carboplatin.

    <description>A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be performed after every 2 cycles (or sooner if there is evidence of disease progression) while on combination therapy until disease progression (eg, after cycle 2, after cycle 4, and after cycle 6). Response to treatment will be determined using RECIST.</description>
