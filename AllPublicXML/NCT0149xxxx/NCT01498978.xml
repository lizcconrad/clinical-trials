  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ipilimumab works when given together with androgen
      suppression therapy in treating patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer that has
      spread to other parts of the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, can block tumor
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumors to grow and spread. Others find
      tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Androgen can cause
      the growth of prostate cancer. Androgen deprivation therapy may stop the adrenal glands from
      making androgen. Giving ipilimumab together with androgen suppression therapy may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Proportion of patients who achieve an undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (=&lt; 0.2
      ng/ml) after initiation of ipilimumab therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Time to PSA progression. II. Time to progression by any measure. III. Maximum percentage
      of PSA reduction in each patient. IV. Number of patients with immune related adverse events
      (IRAEs) and correlation of these with complete PSA response, time to progression, and T cell
      measurements.

      V. Measures of T cell response to therapy with flow cytometry. VI. Response in measurable
      disease by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

      VII. Time to death from any cause. VIII. To examine correlative biomarkers and their
      relationship to clinical outcomes. Potential biomarkers include, but are not limited to
      C-reactive protein (CRP), insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and -2, or follicle stimulating
      hormone (FSH).

      XV. Bank samples for future molecular correlative studies, biomarker, or other studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients without progression then receive maintenance ipilimumab IV once every 3
      months for 4 additional doses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5
      years.

        <description>Immune related adverse event (IRAE) is defined as any adverse event associated with drug exposure and consistent with an immune-mediated event. PSA (prostate-specific antigen) Progression is defined as a PSA increase of &gt;= 25% and at least 2 ng/mL from Baseline, or Nadir PSA Achieved, confirmed by a second measurement at least three weeks later.
The correlation between IRAEs and clinical outcomes will be evaluated using logistic regression for binary endpoints and Cox regression for the time to event outcomes. Due to sample size, regression is not feasible. Instead, correlation will be assessed by Fishers Exact test of association.</description>

        <description>Immune related adverse event (IRAE) is defined as any adverse event associated with drug exposure and consistent with an immune-mediated event.
The correlation between IRAEs and clinical outcomes will be evaluated using logistic regression for binary endpoints and Cox regression for the time to event outcomes. Due to sample size, regression is not feasible. Instead, correlation will be assessed by Fishers Exact test of association.</description>

          <description>Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients without progression then receive maintenance ipilimumab IV once every 3 months for 4 additional doses.
