      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether weekly Vinorelbine treatment can shrink
      or slow the growth of pediatric low-grade gliomas that have either returned or are continuing
      to grow.

      Vinorelbine is a semi-synthetic vinca alkaloid that has recently generated interest in
      patients with pediatric low-grade glioma. It has been specifically synthesized to broaden its
      therapeutic spectrum and decrease the neurotoxicity associated with related agents.

      Different treatments exist for children with progressive or recurrent low-grade glioma. Each
      has variable efficacy at slowing or reversing growth, and exploration continues into finding
      better-tolerated, more effective treatments.

      Vinorelbine has recently generated interest in stabilizing some pediatric low-grade gliomas.
      It has been fairly well tolerated in both adult and pediatric studies that have examined its
      use in other tumors.

      Objective: To test the efficacy of Vinorelbine in children with pediatric low-grade glioma
      that has returned or continues to grow.

      In this trial, Vinorelbine will be given intravenously once a week for 6 weeks followed by a
      2 week rest (6 of every 8 weeks) for one year. The patients will then be followed for 60
      months. Progression free survival is the primary outcome and defined as the none of the
      following: greater a 20% increase in the sun of the longest diameter of the target lesion, or
      a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: &lt; 18 years

          -  Tumor: Progressive or recurrent low grade glioma, WHO grade 1 or 2 who have failed at
             least one form of 'conventional' non-surgical therapy

          -  Histologic confirmation is required with the exception of optic pathway and brain stem
             gliomas. Patients are not required to have a re-operation at time of recurrence.

          -  Patients with disseminated disease are eligible.

          -  Children with neuro-fibromatosis and optic pathway or brainstem tumors are eligible
             but must have definitive radiologic or clinical evidence of progression

          -  Patients must have evidence of measureable disease

          -  Performance status: Karnofsky or Lansky performance status of &gt;50%

          -  Organ Function:

          -  Adequate bone marrow function (ANC&gt;1000/mm3, platelet count of &gt;75,000/mm3, and
             hemoglobin &gt; 8gm/dL) prior to starting therapy. Hemoglobin may be supported by
             transfusion

          -  Adequate liver function (SGPT/ALT&lt;2.5 times ULN and bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times ULN) prior
             to starting therapy

          -  Prior therapy:

          -  May have had treatment including surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy for any number
             of relapses prior to enrollment

          -  Patients must have received their last fraction of radiotherapy &gt;12 weeks prior to
             starting therapy

          -  Previous Vincristine or Vinblastine exposure is allowable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No other significant medical illness that in the investigators' opinion cannot be
             adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or would compromise the patient's
             ability to tolerate this therapy

          -  Any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer), unless in complete remission and
             off of all therapy for that disease for a minimum of 3 years.

          -  Patients of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breast-feeding (vinorelbine
             is a pregnancy category D, no data on excretion in breastmilk)

          -  Patients of childbearing or fathering potential must practice adequate contraception
