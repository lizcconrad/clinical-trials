  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A standard treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer is standard photon radiation in
      combination with the chemotherapy drug, capecitabine. In this research study the
      investigators are using standard photon radiation or a different type of radiation therapy
      called proton beam radiation and adding hydroxychloroquine to be used in combination with
      capecitabine.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to determine if proton or photon beam
      radiation in combination with hydroxychloroquine and capecitabine is effective in controlling
      your cancer growth.

      Subjects will be treated in cycles of 28 days. Hydroxychloroquine will be taken orally, daily
      until the day before surgery and will resume after surgery until study end.

      Capecitabine will be taken orally, daily. Proton or photon radiation treatment will start on
      Week 2 and will be delivered daily (5 days in a row, but not weekends or holidays). Radiation
      treatment will be give on an outpatient basis at the Francis H. Burr Proton Center or the
      Clark Center for Radiation Oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital.

      The following tests will be performed weekly: physical exam, routine blood tests, optional
      blood tests and an eye exam every 3 months while taking hydroxychloroquine.

      Subjects will have surgery (any time between Weeks 5 to 9) and after surgery resume taking
      hydroxychloroquine. Subjects will have a follow up visit every 3 months which will include:
      physical exam, routine blood tests, eye exam, and tumor assessment by chest and
      abdominal-pelvic CT scan or MRI (every 6 months for the first 2 years and yearly for years
      3-5).
