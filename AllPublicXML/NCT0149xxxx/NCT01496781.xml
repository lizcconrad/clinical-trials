  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) has been widely used as a diagnostic and treatment
      techniques of gastrointestinal small lesions. Para-procedure bleeding is one of the common
      complication following EMR. Several endoscopic hemostasis methods are currently in use
      including metallic hemoclip. EndoClot® absorbable polysaccharide hemostat (PAPH) as a new
      hemostasis material was previously used for surgical hemostasis, but the therapeutic effect
      and safety in endoscopic application remains unknown. This randomized controlled study has
      been designed to compare PAPH with metallic hemoclip in their hemostatic effect of
      intra-procedure bleeding control and rebleeding prevention during and after EMR.

    <measure>Hemostasis rate after EMR</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to half an hour immediately after EMR procedure to ensure successful management is achieved.</time_frame>
    <description>Initial hemostatsis was observed endoscopically immediately after application of hemoclip or Endoclot. Complete hemostatsis is ensured. Endoscopic combined hemostasis or emergency surgery would be applied if severe bleeding occurred and endoscopic management fails</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mucosal healing after EMR</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Colonoscopy will be repeated 1 month after EMR procedure to observe if application of Endoclot will delay the musosal healing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time taken to achieve hemostasis</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to half an hour immediately after EMR procedure to ensure successful management is achieved.</time_frame>
    <description>The time taken to achieve hemostasis is recorded immediately after EMR procedure to reflect the technical difficulty of hemostasis measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rebleeding rate after EMR procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Rebleeding rate up to 1 week was obtained by clinical manifestations such as melana; decreased hemoglobin &gt; 20g/L; hemodynamic instability or active bleeding from mucosal defect under endoscope.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>gastrointestinal tract obstruction</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Gastrointestinal tract obstruction has been previously reported as a possible adverse effect of hemostats, therefore it was observed in the current study.</description>
