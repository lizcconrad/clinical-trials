      This is a Phase 1 study during which patients with low or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic
      syndromes (MDS) will receive investigational study drug ARRY-614.

      This study has 2 parts. In the first part, patients will receive increasing doses of study
      drug in order to achieve the highest dose of the study drug possible that will not cause
      unacceptable side effects. Approximately 50 patients from the US will be enrolled in Part 1
      (Completed).

      In the second part of the study, patients will receive the best dose of study drug determined
      from the first part of the study and will be followed to see what side effects and
      effectiveness the study drug has, if any, in treating the cancer. Approximately 30 patients
      from the US will be enrolled in Part 2 (Completed).
