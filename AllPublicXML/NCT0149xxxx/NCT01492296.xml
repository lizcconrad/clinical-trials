  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is widely used in the clinical practice. An empty
      stomach is required to ensure quality and safety. For this reason, endoscopy is
      conventionally performed after 8 or more hours of fasting, which is potentially related to
      discomfort to the patients. In recent studies, surgical cholecystectomy has been described to
      be safe after two hours of fasting on liquids. The aim of this study is to assess safety,
      quality and comfort of upper GI endoscopy after two hours of fasting.
