  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate, in a randomised control trial (RCT), the
      effectiveness of group-based, trauma-focused Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (TF-CBT) in reducing
      psychological distress in former child soldiers and other war-affected children in the
      Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To the best of the author's knowledge this is the first group-based mental health or
      psychosocial intervention developed specifically for psychologically distressed former child
      soldiers. While CBT is the modality with most empirical evidence for treating war-affected
      young people, this is the first evaluation with child soldiers specifically.

      Former child soldiers and war affected 'street boys' (aged 13-17) in eastern DRC, will be
      screened for symptoms of psychological distress and then randomly assigned to either a
      treatment group or a waiting-list control. The treatment groups will receive a 15-session
      manualised, culturally-adapted, TF-CBT intervention. This includes psycho-education,
      relaxation, affect modulation, cognitive processing and constructing a trauma narrative.
      After treatment and post-testing, the waiting-list controls then begin their intervention.
