      This trial will comprehensively evaluate the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in cancer
      survivors between 9 and 26 years of age by (1) determining the prevalence of HPV vaccine
      initiation among young cancer survivors, and (2) determining the immune response to and
      safety/tolerability of the quadrivalent and nonavalent HPV vaccine in young cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Using a cross-sectional survey approach, estimate the prevalence of HPV vaccine
      non-initiation: a) Examine sociodemographic, behavioral, and medical determinants of HPV
      vaccine non-initiation.

      II. Using a single-arm, phase II, open-label, prospective longitudinal trial design, to
      evaluate the 3-dose HPV quadrivalent (HPV4) and nonavalent (HPV9) vaccine series and measure
      the following endpoints: a) Determine immunogenicity following the third and final vaccine
      dose; b) Identify clinical/host factors influencing immunogenicity; c) Determine the
      safety/tolerability of the HPV vaccine in cancer survivors.

      III. Evaluate the persistence of antibody response at 2 years post vaccine initiation and
      identify clinical/host factors influencing response persistence.

      OUTLINE:

      AIM 1 (SURVEY): Patients (ages 18-26 years) or their parents (for patients ages 9-17 years)
      complete a survey regarding the patient's HPV vaccination status, knowledge of HPV-related
      disease, and factors important in making decisions regarding vaccination.

      AIM 2 (VACCINE EVALUATION): Patients not previously immunized against HPV receive
      quadrivalent human papillomavirus recombinant vaccine (HPV-6, -11, -16, -18, for patients
      enrolled on or before 3/1/16) or the nonavalent human papillomavirus recombinant vaccine
      (HPV-6, -11, -16, -18, -31, -33, -45, -52, -58, for patients enrolled after 3/1/16)
      intramuscularly on day 1, at 8-12 weeks, and at 24-32 weeks.
