  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized multi-center study to evaluate intraoperative
      neuromonitoring results in subjects who undergo eXtreme Lateral Interbody Fusion (XLIF)
      surgery at any number of levels inclusive of L4-5.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will present with degenerative conditions in the lumbar spine that are amenable to
      surgical treatment and will be screened prior to study enrollment. Subjects will undergo
      neuromonitoring during the XLIF operation, as per standard care. They will then be
      re-evaluated immediately after surgery and at the first standard postoperative follow-up
      visit (6 weeks) to assess for presence of new neural deficit. If a new neural deficit is
      identified, the patient will be followed per the Investigator's standard follow-up schedule
      until symptoms have resolved (or are deemed permanent).

      A total of 300 subjects will be enrolled in this study from multiple centers. The subjects
      will have degenerative conditions of the lumbar spine with planned treatment including XLIF
      surgery. The following eligibility criteria are designed to identify existing clinic patients
      for whom study under this protocol is considered appropriate. All subjects must meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria below in order to be considered for enrollment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Persistent back and/or leg pain unresponsive to conservative treatment for at least
             six (6) months, unless surgical treatment is clinically indicated earlier

          -  Indicated for extreme lateral interbody fusion at any number of levels inclusive of
             L4-5

          -  At least 18 years of age at the date of written informed consent

          -  Able to undergo surgery based on physical exam, medical history and surgeon judgment

          -  Willing and able to return for post-treatment exams according to the follow-up called
             for in the protocol

          -  Signed and dated informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

             claim is allowed if it is not contested)

          -  Patient has an underlying neurological disease or neurological deficit that is not
             associated with the condition for which he/she is seeking surgical intervention (e.g.,
             diabetic peripheral neuropathy)

          -  Patient is participating in another clinical study that would confound study data
