      Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of invasive candidiasis in critically ill patients in
      Saudi Arabia is not well studied. This observational study objectives include to determine
      the epidemiology, risk factors and outcomes of invasive Candida infection in critically ill
      patients in Saudi Arabia.

        All adult patients (&gt; 18 years) admitted to the ICUs of these centers will be evaluated for
        the occurrence of Candida infection and followed to discharge or death in ICU. The duration
        of the study will be 12 months. Also patients who had invasive candidiasis within 72 hours
        of ICU admission will be included.

          -  develop invasive candidiasis as per prespecified definitions during ICU stay

          -  In addition, patients who had invasive candidiasis within 72 hours of ICU admission
             will be included

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of invasive candidiasis (definite or probable) more than 72 hours before ICU
             admission.
