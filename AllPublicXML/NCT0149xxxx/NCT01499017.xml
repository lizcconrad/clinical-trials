      The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single oral doses of PF-06291874 in healthy
      volunteers. The trial was terminated on Jan 9, 2012, due to undesired pharmacokinetic
      properties. The decision to terminate the trial was not based on any safety or efficacy
      concerns.
