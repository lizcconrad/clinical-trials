    <textblock>
      Switching from intravenous application of antiinfective agents to oral therapy is often
      performed late including high costs and risk of complications. This study will investigate
      the impact of displayed reminders in the electronic patient chart after 60h of intravenous
      therapy with an antiinfective agent.

      Switching from intravenous application of antiinfective agents to oral therapy is often
      performed late including high costs, risk of complications as well as higher workload on
      nursing. This study will investigate the impact of displayed reminders in the electronic
      patient chart after 60h of intravenous therapy with an antiinfective agent.
