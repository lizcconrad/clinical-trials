  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of RG7667 in healthy volunteers. Subjects will be randomized in cohorts to
      receive either single/multiple doses of RG7667 intravenously or placebo. Anticipated time on
      study treatment is up to 57 days with a 12-week follow-up.
