    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study will assess the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of RO5509554 in participants with advanced solid tumors
      which are not amenable to standard treatment. In Part I (Dose Escalation), multiple ascending
      doses of RO5509554 will be administered as monotherapy in participants with solid tumors.
      Participants with locally advanced and/or metastatic ovarian (including fallopian tube) and
      breast carcinoma will receive multiple ascending doses of RO5509554 in combination with
      paclitaxel. In Part II (Expansion Cohort), RO5509554 will be administered as monotherapy to
      participants with locally advanced and/or metastatic Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis
      (PVNS)/Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor (TGCT), soft tissue sarcoma or malignant mesothelioma,
      ovarian (including fallopian tube), endometrial or breast cancer and pancreatic cancer.
      Participants with Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)/neu negative breast cancer
      will receive RO5509554 in combination with paclitaxel. Anticipated time on study treatment is
      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or participant refusal, whichever
      occurs first.

RO5509554 will be escalated as monotherapy in approximately 6 cohorts with dose increments between cohorts of up to 100 percent (%).

The starting dose for RO5509554 in combination with paclitaxel will be 2 dose levels below to that of the highest dose of monotherapy RO5509554. Escalation of RO5509554 in combination with QW paclitaxel will start in a standard 3 + 3 design until MTD/OBD as combination dose is reached. If the initial combination is not tolerated, further cohorts will be dosed with the same dose of paclitaxel and lower dose of RO5509554. If insufficient safety, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data have been collected at the MTD/OBD, up to an additional 4 participants may be enrolled at that dose level.</description>
