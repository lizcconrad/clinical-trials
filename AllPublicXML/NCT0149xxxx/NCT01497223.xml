      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the rate of therapeutic cure of the
      combination treatment of MGCD290 and fluconazole as compared to that of fluconazole alone at
      Test of Cure Visit for patients with moderate to severe vulvovaginal candidiasis.

      MGCD290 is a novel antifungal agent targeting the Hos2 enzyme in fungi. MGCD290 was shown to
      potentiate and broaden the spectrum of activity of azole antifungal agents in vitro,
      especially fluconazole. MGCD290 taken together with fluconazole was observed to be safe in
      healthy volunteer studies. The current study is evaluating both the efficacy and safety of
      the combination treatment in subjects with moderate to severe vulvovaginal candidiasis.
