  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serum proteomics is a very useful tool to identify various disease. The purpose of the
      present study was to find differential proteins among patient with normal, SIRS, sepsis,
      severe sepsis, death and to screen potential biomarkers for their dynamic changes. Serum
      proteins were identified by iTRAQ labeling and LC-MS/MS. The bioinformatics analysis was
      performed with the Mascot software and the International Protein Index (IPI) and the Gene
      Ontology (GO) Database and KEGG pathway Database. The differentially expressed proteins were
      verified by Western blot by another sample collected from clinical.
