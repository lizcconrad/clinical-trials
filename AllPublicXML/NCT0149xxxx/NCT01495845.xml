  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of pharmacogenomics testing in a
      community pharmacy using clopidogrel as an example. The investigators hypothesize that this
      testing is feasible in this setting.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine if the study is feasible, we will examine the change in patient perception of
      pharmacogenomics testing (before and after the study), the percentage of patients interested
      in this service, the response rate of providers to pharmacist recommendations, the pharmacist
      time requirement, and reimbursement rate for pharmacist services.

    <description>Patients must come to the pharmacy for all visits. At the 1st visit, the patient will provide consent, a complete list of medications, a complete pre-study questionnaire, a copy of their insurance card, and a buccal swab (collected by the pharmacist). The swab will be sent to the testing facility for genotypic testing of CYP2C19. Upon receipt of the results of the results, the pharmacist will propose an intervention to the prescriber based on the patient's indication for clopidogrel and the identification of certain genetic variations atCYP2C19. All patients will be asked to return to the pharmacy for explanation of the results and implementation of any changes approved by the prescriber and to complete a follow-up questionnaire. After the visit to explain the results of testing, the patient's insurance will be billed electronically for a medication therapy management visit; patients without insurance will not be billed. Patients may opt out of billing to insurance at any time.</description>
