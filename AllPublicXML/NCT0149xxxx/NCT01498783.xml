  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study to investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics of weekly
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU) administered as a bolus dose in children and young adults with
      recurrent or refractory ependymoma. The results from this study will inform a subsequent
      phase II St. Jude investigator-initiated trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initial 5-FU dosage will be 500 mg/m^2 administered on day 1 of course 1. We plan to
      treat a maximum of 3 cohorts of research participants (dosage levels - 0, 1, and 2) with
      escalating doses of 5-FU. A cycle is defined as 42 days. The first 6 weeks of therapy will
      constitute the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period.

      Primary objective

        -  To investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics (plasma and cerebrospinal fluid) of
           weekly bolus dose 5-FU in children and young adults with recurrent/refractory ependymoma

        -  To study the safety of 500 mg/m^2 weekly bolus dose 5-FU in less-heavily pre-treated
           children and young adults with recurrent/refractory ependymoma.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To document and describe toxicities associated with 5-FU administered on a weekly bolus
           schedule

        -  To document preliminary antitumor activity in participants with recurrent or refractory
           ependymoma treated with 5-FU

        -  To assess the feasibility of measuring expression level of Thymidylate Synthetase (TYMS)
           in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor samples using the Quantigene assay

        -  To evaluate the association between specific genetic polymorphisms (e.g., DPYD) and the
           pharmacokinetics of 5-FU

             obtained at either initial diagnosis or at time of recurrence prior to registration.

          -  Participants may have had two prior systemic anti-cancer chemotherapy regimens,
             including any chemotherapy, biologic modifiers or small molecules. These may have been
             given either before or after irradiation.

          -  Chemotherapy: Participants must have received their last dose of known
             myelosuppressive anticancer chemotherapy at least four weeks prior to study
             registration or at least six weeks if nitrosurea. At least two weeks must have lapsed
             if participants received lower dose oral etoposide (50 mg/m^2) without experiencing

             products).

          -  Biologic agent: Participant must have recovered from any toxicity potentially related
             to the agent and received their last dose of the biologic agent ≥ 7 days prior to
             study registration. For biologic agents that have a prolonged half-life, the
             appropriate interval since last treatment should be discussed with the PI prior to
             registration.

          -  Monoclonal antibody treatment: At least three half-lives must have elapsed prior to
             registration. Such participants should be discussed with the PI prior to registration

          -  XRT: No more than two prior radiation regimens. For participants who have had prior
             irradiation for treatment of their ependymoma. XRT must be:

               -  ≥ 6 months prior to registration if treated with craniospinal irradiation (≥ 18
                  Gy)

               -  ≥ 4 weeks prior to registration if treated with focal irradiation to the primary
                  tumor

                  metastatic sites

          -  Bone marrow or stem cell transplant: Participant must be ≥ 3 months since high dose
             chemotherapy and peripheral blood stem cell rescue prior to registration

             decreasing dose for at least 1 week prior to registration.

          -  Growth factors: Participants must be off all colony forming growth factors(s) for at
             least 1 week prior to registration (e.g. filgrastim, sargramostim, erythropoietin) and

             investigator's opinion cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy, or
             that would compromise the participant's ability to tolerate therapy, impair the
             evaluation of side effects related to this treatment, or alter drug metabolism

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             within 7 days prior to study entry.

          -  Participants of child bearing potential must agree to use an effective contraceptive
