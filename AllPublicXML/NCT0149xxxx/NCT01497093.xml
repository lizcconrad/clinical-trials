  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pomalidomide in
      combination with bortezomib and low-dose dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed or
      refractory multiple myeloma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A 3 + 3 design will be utilized to determine the MTD for POM + IV BTZ + LD-DEX combination
      treatment in a 21-day treatment cycle. DLT will be assessed to determine MTD during the first
      treatment cycle. Once the MTD is determined or the maximum planned dose (MPD) is reached
      without reaching MTD for POM + IV BTZ + LD-DEX, a cohort of 6 additional subjects will be
      treated at this MTD/MPD level to further confirm the safety and assess preliminary efficacy.
      An additional cohort of subjects will be enrolled to explore the safety for the combination
      of POM + BTZ + LD-DEX when using SQ BTZ. Subject in this cohort will receive POM + BTZ +
      LD-DEX at the MTD/MPD level per the MTD determination part of the study, except, the BTZ will
      be administered subcutaneously (SQ) instead of intravenously (IV). In, Protocol Amendment #4,
      the number of subject enrolled to be enrolled into the exploratory SQ BTZ cohort was
      increased from 6 to 12.
