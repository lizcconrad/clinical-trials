    <textblock>
      This research study is studying biomarkers in tissue samples from younger patients with Wilms
      tumor. Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors
      predict how patients respond to treatment

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages is related to
      clinicopathological factors in Wilms tumor (tumor stage, presence of vascular invasion, tumor
      progression, and survival).

      OUTLINE:

      Paraffin-embedded specimens are analyzed for macrophage markers. Results of each sample are
      then compared with patient's tumor stage, presence of vascular invasion, tumor progression,
      and survival.
