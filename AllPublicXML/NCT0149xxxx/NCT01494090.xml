  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Statins (or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) have largely proven their efficacy in the primary
      and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Many clinical and experimental studies
      support also a potential beneficial effect of statin therapy on venous thromboembolism (VTE).
      Patients with hip fracture are at high risk of VTE and cardiovascular events.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and the tolerance of a statin
      (rosuvastatin) in hip fracture surgery on the occurrence of venous and atherothrombotic
      events and the global mortality at six months.

      Subjects aged 60 years or over who are scheduled to undergo surgery for fracture of the upper
      portion of the femur (hip fracture) are eligible to participate to this multicentre,
      randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial. They will receive either rosuvastatin (5
      or 20 mg) or placebo for 6 months. The primary efficacy outcome is the incidence of an
      adjudicated composite of non fatal VTE, acute coronary syndrome, non fatal stroke, other
      acute ischemic arterial event, or all-cause death.

      Assuming a endpoint frequency of 20% in the control group, we calculated that 1200 patients
      will be required for the study to have 80% power to detect a 30% reduction in the relative
      risk with rosuvastatin (with a two-sided alpha level of 5%).

      The investigators assumed that rosuvastatin could have a positive benefit-risk ratio in
      patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery for hip fracture, by reducing vascular events and
      global mortality at six months.
