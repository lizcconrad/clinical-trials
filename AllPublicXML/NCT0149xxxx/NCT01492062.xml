      You are invited to participate in a research study for the development of an artificial
      pancreas. An artificial pancreas uses a program which takes information from a continuous
      blood glucose monitor and uses that information to tell an insulin infusion pump how much
      insulin to deliver. The primary purpose of this study is to gain experience with insulin
      delivery algorithms or programs program (algorithm) provides the best regulation of glucose
      levels so that there are no severe low blood glucose reactions and blood glucose levels are
      generally between 70 to 180 mg/dl.

      You are invited to participate in a research study for the development of an artificial
      pancreas. An artificial pancreas uses a program which takes information from a continuous
      blood glucose monitor and uses that information to tell an insulin infusion pump how much
      insulin to deliver. The primary purpose of this study is to gain experience with insulin
      delivery algorithms or programs program (algorithm) provides the best regulation of glucose
      levels so that there are no severe low blood glucose reactions and blood glucose levels are
      generally between 70 to 180 mg/dl. If the system is working properly, you would not need to
      enter the amount of food you were eating, give an insulin bolus, or change your basal rates
      while wearing the device. You would need to periodically check to be sure the continuous
      glucose sensor was functioning properly and you would need to respond to alarms that might
      occur if your blood glucose was too high, too low, or the glucose sensor or pump were not
      working well. In addition to this the investigators will also gain experience with insulin
      delivery algorithms to minimize the number of glucose readings which are above or below
      target. It is our intention to modify the algorithms during these studies.

      In this study the investigators plan to use a commercially available insulin infusion pump
      (OmniPod) to deliver lispro (Humalog) insulin. The investigators will use Navigator
      continuous glucose sensors both to monitor glucose levels (sensor 1) and provide the glucose
      concentration for the closed loop algorithm (sensor 2). The signal from the second Navigator
      will be sent by serial cable to a computer which will be at the patient's bedside. A control
      algorithm will reside on the computer, and the amount of insulin to be delivered will be
      transmitted to the OmniPod Personal Device Manager which will then send a radiofrequency (rf)
      signal to the Omnipod pump residing on the subject. A health care provider will be in
      attendance and monitoring discrete blood glucose levels (YSI, GlucoScout, or HemoCue
      measurements) at least every 30 minutes. While the Navigator and Omnipod are commercially
      available they will be used in this study as part of an investigational system while you are
      in the hospital, an investigational system is one that is not approved for use by the FDA.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Eligibility

        To be eligible for the study, all subjects must meet the following criteria:

          1. Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and using daily insulin therapy for at least one
             year. The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is based on the investigator's judgment;
             Cpeptide level and antibody determinations are not needed.

          2. Age 21 years to less than 45.0 years

          3. Subject has used a downloadable insulin pump for at least 3 months

          4. Subject understands the study protocol and agrees to comply with it

          5. Informed Consent Form signed

          6. A Personal Home computer with internet access (must have access to a PC for uploading,
             not a Mac).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible for the study:

          1. The presence of a significant medical disorder that in the judgment of the
             investigator will affect the wearing of the sensors or the completion of any aspect of
             the protocol.

          2. The presence of any of the following diseases:

               -  Asthma if treated with systemic or inhaled corticosteroids in the last 6 months

                  disease do not exclude subjects from enrollment

          3. Inpatient psychiatric treatment in the past 6 months

          4. Current use of oral/inhaled glucocorticoids or other medications, which in the
