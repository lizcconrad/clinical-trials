  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The initial aesthetic and functional conditions are recorded with the help of the Breast
      Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale (BCTOS),an international validated questionnaire, and the
      Breast Cancer Conservative Treatment - cosmetic results (BCCT.core) validated computer
      software, allowing for comparison. Determination of the initial quality of life is measured
      with the European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life
      Questionnaire number C30-BR23 (EORTC QoL C30-BR23).

      Patients then undergo surgical treatment according to institutional protocols. Following
      conventional marking of the orientation of the specimen, it is measured by an analytical
      scale.

      Histological examination of the specimen will record the largest diameters, and parameters of
      the lymph nodes, according to the institutional protocol.

      On the 4th week following surgery, assuming that wound healing is completed, patients' data
      are again recorded in BCTOS, BCCT.core and EORTC QoL C30-BR23. A third set of data are gained
      after completion of adjuvant radiotherapy, on the 8th postoperative month. Magnetic resonance
      imaging is performed to assess the volume of the contralateral breast.

      Tumor - breast volume ratio is calculated, and matched up with cosmetic results in each
      quadrant, threshold value in the quadrants, above of which it is not advisable to perform
      conventional breast conserving surgery due to poor outcomes.

    <measure>Primary outcome is the determination of the critical tumor / breast volume ratio in each quadrant, above of which number breast conserving surgery could not offer adequate cosmetic and functional results.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Data of eligible patients are recorded by the study physicians on a locally developed questionnaire. Digital photos are taken of each patient producing a frontal and two side views. Images are processed by the BCCT.core software (Breast Cancer Conservation Treatment. cosmetic results). Magnetic resonance imaging is implemented and used to calculate breast volume with the help of Amira 5.1 software (Visage Imaging GmbH)trial version.
Excised tumor is measured by a validated analytical scale.</description>
