  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive, fibrosing parenchymal lung
           disease with unknown etiology. The prevalence of IPF is estimated between 2-29 cases per
           100,000 in general population with median survival rates of 2-5 years from time of
           diagnosed.

        -  Dyspnea and chronic dry cough are the prominent symptoms in those patients which cause
           to impaired functional capacity and quality of life (QOL).

        -  Drug therapy usually is ineffective approach, what makes a call for an effective
           treatment.

        -  Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) had been founded as safe and effective treatment in
           increasing functional capacity, decrease symptoms and improve QOL mainly among Chronic
           Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). However, recently growing evidence also supports
           the efficiency of PR in IPF patients.

        -  The Aim of the suggested study is to examine the effect of exercise training (ET) at
           ambulatory pulmonary rehabilitation among IPF patients.

        -  The investigators hypothesize that ET at PR program will increase functional capacity,
           will decrease level of dyspnea and improve QOL in IPF patients.

        -  Patients and Methods:

        -  40 IPF patients males and females (aged 30-90 years old) will be recruiting to this
           study. After clinical assessment they will be randomly allocated to PR group n=20 or to
           Control group n=20.

        -  All patients will undergo a clinical assessment including medical history, risk factors
           for IPF and physical examination. On the first meeting at baseline and within one week
           post intervention (PR) the following measurements will be made: dyspnea score, QOL and
           physical activity level questionnaires. In addition, anthropometric measurements,
           echocardiography, blood samples, pulmonary function tests, cardiopulmonary exercise
           test, battery of functional test and 6 minute walk test (6MWT).

        -  The PR group will participate in 12 weeks of supervised group's ET program. The training
           program will be consisted two 6 week blocks of 60 min exercise bout twice a week. In the
           first block the patients will perform aerobic interval training with treadmill walking,
           cycling, and step climbing. In the second block, subjects will perform longer periods of
           continuous aerobic exercise, with resistance training by step climbing, unsupported
           arm/leg exercises with and without dumbbells (0.5-1 kg), and supporting body weight over
           a chair. Pulmonary function test and 6MWT will be also performed after completing first
           6 week block. The control group will be assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks without
           participating in PR program.
