  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years hip resurfacing has become a very popular alternative treatment to total hip
      replacement for the treatment of hip arthritis. This procedure has become particularly common
      in the young patient with arthritis because of perceived benefits in terms of functional
      outcome. However, it has recently become apparent that hip resurfacing is associated with a
      range of adverse events, not typically seen in patients with conventional hip replacement.
      These include hip fracture, and failure of bone to grow onto the fixation surfaces of the
      implant. It has also become apparent that hip resurfacing results in the release of high
      concentrations of dissolved metals in the bloodstream, such as cobalt and chromium. Whilst
      small concentrations of these metals are essential for normal body functions, such as making
      red blood cells, in high concentrations their effects can be toxic to many cells and organs
      of the body, such as bone, the brain, heart, liver and kidneys, as well as disturbing
      hormones and blood cholesterol levels. Whilst several studies have documented levels of these
      metal ions of 440 times normal levels in hip resurfacing patients, there are no studies that
      have examined whether these levels are having a toxic effect on the various organ systems of
      the body (with the exception of renal function). In this study we plan to explore whether
      there are differences in bone mineral density, accumulation of metal ions in the brain, and
      other solid organs, heart and hormonal function between subjects who have had a hip
      resurfacing 5 or more years previously compared to an individually matched group of subjects
      after conventional hip replacement.

      This is a cross sectional survey in patients who have had hip resurfacing (MOMHR) and
      subjects who have received a conventional hip replacement (THA) using a metal on plastic or
      ceramic bearing. Participants in this study will be identified by orthopaedic surgeons from
      their operating database. An invitation letter will be sent out to the potential participants
      with an accompanying information sheet and a reply slip. If there is no response then one
      further letter will be sent out. Those patients who respond to say that they are interested
      in taking part in the study will then be telephoned by the study team and screened for
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. If they are eligible and willing to take part after discussions
      with the investigator, an appointment will be made for them to attend to give informed
      consent. Participants will be requested not to eat or drink on the morning that they attend
      for this visit.

      There will be an opportunity at this visit for further discussion and explanation of the
      study requirements with the Investigator before consent is given.

      Once consent has been given, the following procedures will be carried out at this visit
      (Visit 1):

        1. Venous blood will be taken by venepuncture (60 mL, approx 4 tablespoons, will be taken)
           after which the participant will be able to eat breakfast (which will be provided).

        2. A urine based pregnancy test will be used in women of child bearing age to exclude
           pregnant women

        3. Participants will complete the Oxford Hip questionnaire, the EQ5D questionnaire and a
           record of medical history and concomitant medicines under supervision of the student
           investigator or an experienced research nurse.

        4. Whole body bone mineral density assessments will be made using an Hologic Discovery bone
           densitometer. This will take approximately 10 minutes in total and will be carried out
           by an experienced research bone density technician

        5. An electrocardiogram and an echocardiogram will be performed by an experienced
           cardiotechnician and later analysed by a Consultant Cardiologist

        6. Participants will be given a container and instructions to collect a 24 hour urine
           sample. This will be returned at the second visit

        7. An appointment will be made for the participant to attend for a second visit to the
           Royal Hallamshire Hospital.

      At visit 2 the following procedures will be carried out:

        1. Neuropsychological assessments and questionnaires and visual acuity measurement using a
           Snellen chart.

        2. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain using a 3.0T Phillips Intera MRI scanner.

        3. MRI of the liver spleen and kidneys using the 3.0T Phillips Intera MRI scanner. Clinical
           reports will be prepared for all clinical investigations and normal findings will be
           related to the patient by letter.

      Abnormal findings will be reported to the GP and patient with advice for any action as
      necessary.
