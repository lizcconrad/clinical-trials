      Primary objective To evaluate the efficacy of Acarbose added on top of Metformin and
      Sitagliptin that were combinedly administered to subjects with type-II diabetes, along with
      placebos.

      Secondary objectives

        1. To compare a Metformin-Sitagliptin combination and a Sitagliptin-Acarbose combination in
           efficacy

        2. To evaluate the 6-month efficacy of Acarbose added on top of the Metformin-Sitagliptin
           combination

      1) Primary Endpoint With changes in HbA1c measured at the baseline and the 16th week,
      descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum value, maximum value and
      95% confidence interval) should be worked out. HbA1c, measured at the baseline, should be
      included in covariates, and a comparison should be made between Group-1 and Group-2 with the
      analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).

      2) Secondary Endpoints

        1. Changes in CGMS, mixed meal tolerance test (active GLP-1, total GLP-1, GIP and insulin)
           and oxidative stress markers (8-OHdG, nitro tyrosine and CML) in Group-1 and Group-2:

           With the values measured at the baseline and the 16th week, mean, standard deviation,
           median, minimum value and maximum value should be calculated. To analyze the difference
           of two groups, perform an ANCOVA with baseline value as a covariate.

        2. Changes in HbA1c, FPG and PPG in Group-1 and Group-2:

           With the values measured at the baseline, the 16th week and the 24th week and at the
           16th week and the 24th week, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum value and maximum
           value should be calculated. To analyze the difference of two groups, perform an ANCOVA
           with baseline value as a covariate.

        3. Changes in HbA1c, FPG and PPG in Group-1 and Group-3:

           With the values measured at the baseline, the 16th week and the 24th week and at the
           16th week and the 24th week, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum value and maximum
           value should be calculated. To analyze the difference of two groups, perform an ANCOVA
           with baseline value as a covariate.

        4. Changes in SMBG in Group-1 and Group-2 and in Group-1 and Group-3:

           With the values measured at the 4th week, the 16th week and the 24th week and at the
           16th week and the 24th week, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum value and maximum
           value should be calculated. To analyze the difference of two groups, perform an ANCOVA
           with baseline value(4wk) as a covariate.

        5. Changes in 1,5-AG in Group-1 and Group-2 and in Group-1 and Group-3:

      With the values measured at the 16th week, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum value
      and maximum value should be calculated. To analyze the difference of two groups, perform an
      ANCOVA with baseline value as a covariate.
