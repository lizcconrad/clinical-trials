  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, phase Ib/ II study (two parts) with patients
      that have locally advanced or metastatic HER2 negative breast cancer. The first part (phase
      Ib) will investigate the MTD / Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of the combination therapy of
      BEZ235 twice daily (b.i.d.) and weekly paclitaxel using a Bayesian model. When MTD/ RP2D is
      established the second part (phase II) will start. Phase II will evaluate the efficacy and
      the safety of weekly paclitaxel alone compared to weekly paclitaxel plus BEZ235 bid.

    <description>DLT is defined as treatment-related toxicity (classified according Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4) occurring during the first 28 treatment days and meeting specific protocol-predefined criteria.
The information will be integrated in a Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).</description>

    <description>PFS is defined as the time from start of treatment to objective tumor progression or death from any cause. Radiological assessments will be performed every 8 weeks.</description>

    <description>Doses of oral BEZ235 (BID), supplied as 200mg, 300mg or 400mg in SDS sachets, together with standard weekly paclitaxel at a fixed dose (80mg/m²) during 1h by i.v. in infusion.
The paclitaxel infusion will be given in the morning and directly thereafter the BEZ235 dose will be given.
BEZ235 doses will be escalated in cohorts of 3 to 6 patients guided by an adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control until MTD/RP2D has been established. The initial dose level for the first cohort will be 200mg (BID), and then based on the Bayesian model the dose may be escalated to 300mg, 400mg, 500mg or 600mg for the next cohorts.</description>
