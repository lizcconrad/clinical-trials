    <textblock>
      This double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing patient-reported pain and
      pain medication/narcotic use between patients randomized to treatment (bupivacaine) or
      placebo (saline) delivered via pain pump to the mastectomy site. Candidates will have chosen
      to have a mastectomy on one side immediately followed with tissue expander placement breast
      reconstruction.

      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to bupivacaine- (treatment) or saline-(placebo) filled
      percutaneously-placed pain pumps; neither the participants nor the study staff will know
      participants' treatment. Data on patient-perceived pain and pain medication use will be
      collected before surgery, during surgery, and after surgery on Days 1, 2, 3, 7, and 90, and
      at Years 2 and 4 by phone.

      The investigators hypothesize that patients randomized to the treatment (bupivacaine) group
      will have significantly lower pain scores and use less pain medicine than patients who
      receive placebo during the first 90 days following their surgery. The Year 2 and Year 4
      follow-ups are included as tertiary endpoints to capture differences in chronic pain, and
      patients will be asked to complete the same questionnaires as at the Day 90 follow up.

      Double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing patient-reported pain and pain
      medication/narcotic use between patients randomized to treatment (bupivacaine) or placebo
      (saline) delivered via pain pump to the mastectomy site. Candidates will have elected to
      undergo unilateral post-mastectomy immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction.
      Participants meeting inclusion criteria will be enrolled and baseline data collection
      completed prior to randomization and surgery.

      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to bupivacaine- (treatment) or saline-(placebo) filled
      percutaneously-placed pain pumps in a double-blinded design. Patient-specific surgical
      details will be recorded intraoperatively. Following the surgery, post-operative pain, pain
      medication/narcotic use, and assessment for adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events
      (SAEs) will be assessed on Days 1, 2, and 3. A clinic visit occurs on Day 7 when the pain
      pump will be removed and additional data collected (updated medical history, pain
      medication/narcotic use, AEs/SAEs, and study questionnaires). A Pain Pump Questionnaire will
      be completed to obtain the patient's assessment of the usability of the pain pump.

      Long-term quality-of-life/health outcomes assessments will be done on post-operative Day 90
      (±14 days), Year 2 (±14 days), and Year 4 (±14 days). The Year 2 and Year 4 follow-ups are
      included as tertiary endpoints to capture differences in chronic pain, and patients will be
      asked to complete the same questionnaires as at the Day 90 follow up.

    <description>The Symbios GOPump is the Food and Drug Administration-approved delivery device used to infuse the bupivacaine. The pump is attached to catheters placed in the patient's breast reconstruction site. A 10cm long 16-guage needle is provided to aid insertion of the catheter into the patient. The entire catheter will pass through the bore of the introducer needle. A 60cc syringe is used to fill the Symbios GOPump through the fill port. After filling the 60cc syringe with up to 300cc of 0.5% bupivacaine, the syringe is attached to the port and the medication injected into the infusion pump. The steady-flow pressure regulator maintains a constant 6 psi pressure in the outflow chamber ensuring a uniform flow of medication through each catheter inserted into the Symbios GOPump.</description>
