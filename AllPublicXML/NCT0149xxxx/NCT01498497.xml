    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is the long-term follow-up of glucocorticosteroid-related adverse
      events and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) suppression in subjects after
      discontinuation of study drug received in the PR-021 study (Safety and Tolerability Study of
      Oral EUR-1100 to Treat Eosinophilic Esophagitis). The study will also provide the opportunity
      to better understand the natural course of eosinophilic esophagitis and define the treatment
      modalities of eosinophilic esophagitis with EUR-1100, such as the need for chronic
      maintenance or intermittent treatment.

      All subjects who complete PR-021 will be offered the opportunity to participate in this
      study. The duration of this follow-up study is six months, during which subjects will visit
      the clinic for safety evaluation and clinical symptom assessment at the screening, Week 8,
      Week 16, and Week 24 visits. Additional phone visits will occur at Week 4, Week 12, and Week
      20.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject completed full participation in Study PR-021 (Subjects discontinued
             prematurely from PR-021 due to HPA axis suppression will be eligible for study PR-022)

          -  Written informed consent (parent or legal guardian must sign when applicable) and
             assent form, if required

          -  Willing and able to adhere to all study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects already requiring medications or procedures for the treatment of EoE at the
             time of enrollment into the follow-up study, such as systemic (oral or parenteral) or
             inhaled corticosteroids, esophageal dilation, Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) and/or
             dietary restrictions; in the case of subjects already on PPIs and /or dietary
             restrictions during Study PR-021, only subjects requiring an increase in dosage of
             PPIs and/or new dietary restrictions because of worsening of symptoms will be excluded

          -  Any physical, mental, or social condition, history or concurrent illness or laboratory
             abnormality that, in the investigator's judgment, might interfere with study
             procedures or the ability of the subject to adhere to and complete the study

          -  Contraindication to esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) or esophageal biopsy or narrowing
             of the esophagus precluding EGD

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding
