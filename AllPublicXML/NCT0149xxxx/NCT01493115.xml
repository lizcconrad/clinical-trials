      Primary Objective:

      To compare the pharmacodynamic properties of two different doses of a new insulin glargine
      formulation with 0.4 U/kg Lantus®

      Secondary Objective:

      To compare the pharmacokinetic properties of two different doses of a new insulin glargine
      formulation with 0.4 U/kg Lantus® To assess the safety and tolerability of a new insulin
      glargine formulation

          -  Participation in a trial with any investigational drug during the past 4 months

          -  Symptoms of a clinically significant illness in the 3 months before the study, which,
             according to the investigator's opinion, could interfere with the purposes of the
             study

          -  Regular use of any medication other than insulins in the last month before study start
             with the exception of thyroid hormones, lipid-lowering and antihypertensive drugs,
             and, if female, with the exception of hormonal contraception or menopausal hormone
             replacement therapy; any vaccination within the last 28 days

          -  Known hypersensitivity to insulin glargine or excipients of the study drug

          -  Any history or presence of deep leg vein thrombosis or a frequent appearance of deep
             leg vein thrombosis in first degree relatives (parents, siblings or children)

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
