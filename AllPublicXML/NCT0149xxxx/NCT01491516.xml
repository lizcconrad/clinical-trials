    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of the implant ( TELAMON P™
      Implant/INFUSE Bone Graft System used in conjunction with the CD HORIZON® Spinal System) as a
      method of facilitating lumbar spinal fusion utilizing a posterior surgical approach in
      patients with symptomatic degenerative disc disease. The safety and effectiveness of the
      implant will be evaluated.

               -  decreased disc height;

               -  thickening of ligamentous tissue;

               -  disc degeneration or herniation; and/or

               -  facet joint degeneration.

          2. Has preoperative Oswestry score &gt;= 30.

          3. Has preoperative back pain score of &gt;= 25 based on the Preoperative Back and Leg Pain
             Questionnaire (intensity and duration).

          4. Has no greater than Grade 1 spondylolisthesis utilizing Meyerding's Classification
             (Meyerding, HW, 1932).

          5. Requires fusion of a single level disc space from L 1 to S 1.

          6. Is at least 18 years of age, inclusive, at the time of surgery.

          7. Has not responded to non-operative treatment for a period of 6 months.

          8. If of child-bearing potential, patient is non-pregnant, non-nursing, and agrees to not
             get pregnant for 1 year following surgery.

          9. Is willing and able to comply with the study plan and sign the Patient Informed
             Consent Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has primary diagnosis of a spinal disorder other than degenerative disc disease with
