  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Getting to the hospital quickly is the key to treating stroke. African Americans suffer more
      strokes with worse outcomes and receive stroke treatments less often than European Americans.
      This project will work to reduce these health disparities by creating and testing the
      feasibility of a peer-led faith-based behavioral intervention in an African American
      community with a goal to increase calls to 911 so stroke patients can be treated quickly.

    <measure>Mean Change in Behavioral Intent to Call 911</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week elapsed between a pretest before 1st workshop and post-test at the end of 2nd workshop</time_frame>
    <description>The pre-test is conducted one week prior to the post-test. A higher score indicates greater behavioral intent. Behavioral intent is measured on a scale of 0 - 8, where 0 indicates no correct answers in responses to scenarios, and 8 indicates appropriate responses (calling 911 every time it is appropriate) to the scenarios presented.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Stroke Recognition</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week elapsed between a pretest before 1st workshop and post-test at the end of 2nd workshop</time_frame>
    <description>Stroke recognition was scored on a 0 - 9 point scale where 0 represents no correct answers regarding 9 scenarios and 9 represents perfect stroke recognition.</description>

    <measure>Perception of Social Norms Clustered Within Churches Across Multiple Time Points</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week between pretest before 1st workshop and post-test at the end of 2nd workshop and 1 month till the delayed post test</time_frame>
    <description>Perception of social norms is measured by the odds ratio of the responses to questions of participant agreement with others' influence to calling 911 if he/she were to see a stroke. Odds ratios measure the odds of responses, so higher odds ratios suggest greater odds of the positive change in social norms in the post-test compared to the pre-test. Questions: 1) Most people would call 911 if they were to see a stroke. 2) My family would want me to call 911 if I were to see a stroke. Given that participants within each church are more alike than participants between churches and the multiple time points, hierarchical models were used. Specifically, multilevel mixed-effects ordered logistic regression models with a fixed church-level intercept and a random participant level intercept were used to explore change between baseline and immediate post-test and baseline and delayed post-test social norms after accounting for the participants' church.</description>

    <measure>Perception of Self-efficacy Clustered Within Churches Across Multiple Time Points</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week between pretest before 1st workshop and post-test at the end of 2nd workshop and 1 month till the delayed post test</time_frame>
    <description>Perception of self-efficacy is measured by the odds ratios of the responses to questions of participant confidence in being able to identify and respond appropriately to a stroke. Odds ratios measure the odds of responses, so higher odds ratios suggest greater odds of positive self-efficacy change in the post-test compared to the pretest. Questions asking about self-efficacy were:1) I would be able to tell if someone is having a stroke and 2) I know what to do if I saw someone having a stroke. Given that participants within each church are more alike than participants between churches and multiple time points hierarchical models were used. Specifically, multilevel mixed-effects ordered logistic regression models with a fixed church-level intercept and a random participant level intercept were used to explore change between baseline and immediate post-test and baseline and delayed posttest self-efficacy after accounting for the participants' church.</description>

    <measure>Perception of Stroke Attitude Clustered Within Churches Across Multiple Time Points</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week between pretest before 1st workshop and post-test at the end of 2nd workshop and 1 month till the delayed post test</time_frame>
    <description>Stroke attitude is measured by the odds ratio of participant's positive perception of calling 911 for stroke. Odds ratios measure the odds of responses, so higher odds ratios suggest greater odds of stroke attitude change in the post-test compared to pre-test. Stroke attitude questioners were: Q1) If I were to see signs of a stroke, calling 911 would be... (range &quot;extremely pleasant&quot; to &quot;very unpleasant); and Q2) If a person has signs of a stroke, calling 911 right away could be... (range &quot;very helpful&quot; to &quot;very harmful). Given that participants within each church are more alike than participants between churches and multiple time points, hierarchical models were used. Specifically, multilevel mixed-effects ordered logistic regression models with a fixed church-level intercept and a random participant level intercept were used to explore change between baseline and immediate post-test and baseline and delayed post-test stroke attitude after accounting for the participants' church.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        To meet participant eligibility criteria, individuals must be 18 years of age or older
        (adult intervention) or between 10-17 years of age (youth intervention), a resident of the
        Flint or greater Flint community, and English speaking.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        We will attempt to exclude those who cannot read English because they will not be able to
        benefit from the intervention materials. These criteria will be confirmed during assessment
        procedures prior to enrollment.

        <title>Perception of Social Norms Clustered Within Churches Across Multiple Time Points</title>
        <description>Perception of social norms is measured by the odds ratio of the responses to questions of participant agreement with others' influence to calling 911 if he/she were to see a stroke. Odds ratios measure the odds of responses, so higher odds ratios suggest greater odds of the positive change in social norms in the post-test compared to the pre-test. Questions: 1) Most people would call 911 if they were to see a stroke. 2) My family would want me to call 911 if I were to see a stroke. Given that participants within each church are more alike than participants between churches and the multiple time points, hierarchical models were used. Specifically, multilevel mixed-effects ordered logistic regression models with a fixed church-level intercept and a random participant level intercept were used to explore change between baseline and immediate post-test and baseline and delayed post-test social norms after accounting for the participants’ church.</description>

Odds ratios measure the odds of responses, so higher odds ratios suggest greater odds of positive self-efficacy change in the post-test compared to the pretest.

        <title>Perception of Stroke Attitude Clustered Within Churches Across Multiple Time Points</title>
        <description>Stroke attitude is measured by the odds ratio of participant’s positive perception of calling 911 for stroke. Odds ratios measure the odds of responses, so higher odds ratios suggest greater odds of stroke attitude change in the post-test compared to pre-test. Stroke attitude questioners were: Q1) If I were to see signs of a stroke, calling 911 would be... (range &quot;extremely pleasant&quot; to &quot;very unpleasant); and Q2) If a person has signs of a stroke, calling 911 right away could be... (range &quot;very helpful&quot; to &quot;very harmful). Given that participants within each church are more alike than participants between churches and multiple time points, hierarchical models were used. Specifically, multilevel mixed-effects ordered logistic regression models with a fixed church-level intercept and a random participant level intercept were used to explore change between baseline and immediate post-test and baseline and delayed post-test stroke attitude after accounting for the participants’ church.</description>
