      The Problem Distal radius fractures (DRF) are common and result in a variable amount of
      disability. The investigators have completed considerable work in developing tools that
      measure impairment and disability after DRF . The investigators initial studies indicate that
      the associated disablement process is multifactorial and variable with only 25% of the
      resultant disability predicted by baseline patient and injury characteristics. The
      investigators see DRF as a signal event where some people are at-risk of transitioning from
      an active lifestyle to inactivity and subsequent health risks. The investigators recent data
      confirms variable participation following a DRF. The traditional focus in
      orthopedic/rehabilitative approaches to DRF fracture management has been localized to the
      wrist, largely ignoring this potential transition and its health impacts. The investigators
      will initiate a line of investigation that will profile the at-risk older adult who presents
      with a DRF with the ultimate goal of accurate identification and prevention of adverse
      activity transitions (active to inactive). In this study the investigators will identify the
      extent of the problem by quantifying changes in activity/participation and its short-term
      health impacts. The investigators will also identify the risk factors present at time of
      injury that predict a loss of mobility/activity/participation. This work has the potential to
      identify tools and/or clinical prediction rules that identify at-risk individuals at a
      critical time where early intervention might most easily prevent adverse outcomes associated
      with inactivity.
