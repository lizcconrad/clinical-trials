  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Baska mask is a new supraglottic airway device . The investigators would like to assess
      its performance in setting in which the current standard - LMA device - is being used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our group has performed a number of studies on novel airway devices. In this study we would
      like to evaluate a new supraglottic airway named Baska mask. We would like to monitor certain
      parameters (time to and ease of insertion, failure rate, seal pressures, complications etc)
      as regarding the performance and safety profile of this device. This is a descriptive case
      series of patients undergoing airway management under general anaesthesia.
