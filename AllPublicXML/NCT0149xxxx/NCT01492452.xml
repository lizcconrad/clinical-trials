    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial. The population consisted of parents of children
      undergoing cardiac surgery from December 2010 to April 2011. We included parents aged over 18
      years, and the following were considered exclusion criteria: inability to understand and/or
      answer the questions for any reason, parents of children undergoing surgery for insertion of
      the pacemaker and defibrillator, surgical death and not take up the case. 22 parents in the
      intervention group were randomized and received standardized guidelines for nursing and 22
      parents participated in the control group received the guidelines and routine of the
      institution. Anxiety was assessed using the STAI State-Trait Inventory in the preoperative
      period and 48 hours after surgery the child.

    <description>22 parents in the intervention group were randomized and received standardized guidelines for nursing:The guidelines took around an hour and involved pre-operative care such as bathing with detergent solution, pre-anesthetic administration (as prescribed), preoperative fasting (as prescribed), clothing, hygiene care and nail oral. They were also provided information on the endotracheal tube, tubes, catheters, epicardial pacemaker wires and electrodes to be used in the perioperative period and which remain for some period after surgery, as well as possible complications.</description>
