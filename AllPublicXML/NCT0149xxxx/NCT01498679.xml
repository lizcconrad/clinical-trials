      This will be a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, multi-centre
      study. At Visit 1 (Screening Visit) subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none
      of the exclusion criteria will enter a two week run-in period. Subjects will remain on their
      current ICS therapy throughout the run-in period. At the end of the run-in period (Visit 2)
      subjects meeting the Randomisation criteria will enter a 12 week treatment period and receive
      one of the two following treatments: 1) FF/VI (100/25mcg) administered once daily in the
      evening via a Novel Dry Powder Inhaler (NDPI) 2) Placebo administered once daily in the
      evening via a NDPI In addition, all subjects will be supplied with albuterol/salbutamol
      inhalation aerosol to be used as required to treat asthma symptoms.

      Subjects who have not met the randomisation criteria at Visit 2 will be withdrawn from the
      study.

      Subjects meeting the randomisation criteria will be randomized to one of the two treatment
      groups and will attend the clinic for 3 on-treatment visits at Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 8
      (Visit 4) and Week 12 (Visit 5). Subjects will receive treatment for 12 weeks. A Follow-up
      Visit or phone call (Visit 6) will take place 1 week after completing study medication. All
      clinic visits will take place in the morning. Subjects will participate in the study for a
      maximum of 15 weeks (Screening to Follow-up inclusive). A subject is regarded to have
      completed the study if they complete all phases of the study (Screening, treatment,
      Follow-up).

    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1-12 (up to Day 84)</time_frame>
    <description>Peak Expiratory Flow is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily diary prior to the randomization of the participant. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value of the averaged daily PM PEF over the 12-week Treatment Period minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

    <description>PEF is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily diary prior to the randomization of the participant. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value of the averaged daily AM PEF over the 12-week Treatment Period minus the Baseline value. A Repeated Measures analysis adjusted for Baseline, region, sex, age, treatment, week, week by Baseline interaction, and week by treatment interaction was used.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1-12 (up to Day 84)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of inhalations of rescue albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol (medication used to relieve symptoms immediately) used during the day and night was recorded by the participants in a daily diary. A 24-hour period in which a participant's responses to both the morning and evening assessments indicated no use of rescue medication was considered as rescue free. Participants who were rescue free for 24-hour periods during the 12-week Treatment Period were assessed. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily diary prior to the randomization of the participant. Change from Baseline is calculated as the average value during the 12-week Treatment Period minus the value at Baseline. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1-12 (up to Day 84)</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma symptoms were recorded in a daily diary by the participants every day in the morning and evening before taking any rescue or study medication and before PEF measurement. A 24-hour period in which a participant's responses to both the morning and evening assessments indicated no symptoms was considered as symptom free. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily diary prior to the randomization of the participant. Participants who were symptom free for 24-hour periods during the 12-week Treatment Period were assessed. Change from Baseline is calculated as the average value during the 12-week Treatment Period minus the value at Baseline. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The AQLQ is a disease-specific, self-administered quality of life questionnaire developed to evaluate the impact of asthma treatments on the quality of life of asthma sufferers. The AQLQ contains 32 items in 4 domains: activity limitation (11 items), symptoms (12 items), emotional function (5 items), and environmental stimuli (4 items). The 32 items of the questionnaire are averaged to produce one overall quality of life score. The response format consists of a 7-point scale, where a value of 1 indicates &quot;total impairment&quot; and a value of 7 indicates &quot;no impairment.&quot; Change from Baseline was calculated as the Week 12 value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 311 participants were randomized to treatment. However, 4 participants were randomized in error and did not receive any study treatment. These participants were not included in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population, which was comprised of all participants randomized to treatment who received &gt;=1 dose of trial medication.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>At screening, participants who met all of the inclusion criteria entered a 2-week Run-in Period. Participants continued on inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy throughout the Run-in Period. At the end of the Run-in Period, participants meeting the randomization criteria entered a 12-week Treatment Period and received one of the two treatments.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Peak Expiratory Flow is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily diary prior to the randomization of the participant. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value of the averaged daily PM PEF over the 12-week Treatment Period minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Daily Morning (AM) PEF Averaged Over the 12-week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>PEF is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily diary prior to the randomization of the participant. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value of the averaged daily AM PEF over the 12-week Treatment Period minus the Baseline value. A Repeated Measures analysis adjusted for Baseline, region, sex, age, treatment, week, week by Baseline interaction, and week by treatment interaction was used.</description>

        <description>The number of inhalations of rescue albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol (medication used to relieve symptoms immediately) used during the day and night was recorded by the participants in a daily diary. A 24-hour period in which a participant’s responses to both the morning and evening assessments indicated no use of rescue medication was considered as rescue free. Participants who were rescue free for 24-hour periods during the 12-week Treatment Period were assessed. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily diary prior to the randomization of the participant. Change from Baseline is calculated as the average value during the 12-week Treatment Period minus the value at Baseline.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The AQLQ is a disease-specific, self-administered quality of life questionnaire developed to evaluate the impact of asthma treatments on the quality of life of asthma sufferers. The AQLQ contains 32 items in 4 domains: activity limitation (11 items), symptoms (12 items), emotional function (5 items), and environmental stimuli (4 items). The 32 items of the questionnaire are averaged to produce one overall quality of life score. The response format consists of a 7-point scale, where a value of 1 indicates “total impairment” and a value of 7 indicates “no impairment.” Change from Baseline was calculated as the Week 12 value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>
