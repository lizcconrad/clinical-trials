  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is a physiological state considered essential for health and human survival. The
      prevalence of chronic sleep restriction has increased in modern society, as well as the
      effects of the same health concerns about various aspects, including the physiological and
      neurobehavioral. The objective of this study is to identify the neurobehavioral and
      physiological responses of healthy men with different needs of total sleep time (TST)
      submitted to chronic sleep restriction. Participants in this study will be 30 male
      volunteers, aged between 20 and 35 years, divided into three groups: Group 1 (n = 10) with
      TST ≤ 6 hours (h), Group 2 (n = 10) with TST ≥ 9h and Group 3 (n = 10): TST with between 7
      and 8h. The TST will be established by the constant and continuous use of actigraphy for 10
      days prior to the onset of the experimental protocol. All volunteers will undergo medical and
      polysomnography (PSG) examination to detect the presence or not of changes in sleep as well
      as other health problem that prevents their participation in the study. The experimental
      protocol consists of a basal night of sleep, five consecutive nights of chronic sleep
      restriction to 25% of TST in the beginning night and a night of recovery, which will be
      allowed to sleep the sleep pattern. Each night will have PSG monitoring and when wake up in
      each day, the volunteer will undergo tests to assess the physiological and neurobehavioral
      variables. The significance level will be 5% (p ≤ 0.05).
