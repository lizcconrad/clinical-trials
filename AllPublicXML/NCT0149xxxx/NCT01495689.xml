  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the most harmful and quitting smoking is very difficult. Despite
      quitting, it is very difficult to stay quit for long term. In Ottawa the investigators are
      very lucky to have designed and developed the Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation (&quot;Ottawa
      Model&quot;). This project is an end result of pain staking research. The Ottawa Model has been
      implemented very successfully to the hospitalized patients and has shown very promising
      results of higher quitting rates.

      Our objective is to modify the Ottawa Model to suit the needs of patients attending
      out-patient respirology clinics. The investigators aim to apply the modified Ottawa Model
      along with the SmartCard to the adult smokers who attend the investigators out-patient
      Respirology clinic at the Ottawa Hospital.

      The investigators aim to train a nurse in clinical aspects and implementation of the
      protocols related to the Ottawa Model. The trained nurse will contact the smokers attending
      the clinic. Those subjects willing to participate in this study will be divided in to two
      groups. One group of subjects will get counseling and SmartCard on the day of the clinic and
      follow-up phone calls. The SmartCard is worth $110 toward the purchase of quit smoking
      medications (i.e. nicotine patch/gum, varenicline, or bupropion). The subjects can re-deem
      the card at the investigators hospital pharmacy. Those in the control group will be
      followed-up as the investigators are currently doing i.e. with standard smoking cessation
      counseling from the clinic physician and the nurse, +/- prescription for smoking cessation
      aids without access to the study nurse and the extra counseling or SmartCard. The
      investigators aim to find increased quitting rates in the group getting on-site access to the
      smoking cessation aids with the Smartcard and counseling.

      There are no studies implementing the Ottawa Model along with the SmartCard in out-patient
      respirology setting so far. The Ottawa Model has proven to be very successful in the
      in-patient subjects. Thus, the investigators believe, the investigators can modify the Ottawa
      Model and make it fit the out-patient Respirology setting and increase the quitting rates.

      Design: Parallel group randomized control trial Method: All adult current smokers attending
      respirology clinic at the Ottawa General Hospital will be approached to participate.
      Concealed random allocation will be done if the subject is willing and signed the written
      informed consent. Experimental arm will receive counseling on site enrollment in the Ottawa
      Model of Smoking Cessation which includes IVR automated telephone follow-up and will receive
      a SmartCard worth $110 towards purchase of smoking cessation aids. Usual care arm will
      receive current usual care in our clinic i.e. strong physician advice, +/- prescription for
      smoking cessation aids if requested or willing.

      As a priori, a third arm was added to the parent study entitled, &quot;A PILOT IMPLEMENTATION OF
      BUDDHIST MINDFULNESS TRAINING COMBINED WITH THE OTTAWA MODEL FOR SMOKING CESSATION IN AN
      OUT-PATIENT RESPIROLOGY CLINIC SETTING&quot;. For this arm, research ethics board approval was
      sought and 10 participants were approached.

At the 26 week follow-up, all patients who report being abstinent from smoking will have their smoking status confirmed by measurement of a CO sample.

          <description>The primary outcome will be measured at 26 weeks: (1) bio-chemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinence; and (2) self reported continuous abstinence since randomization. Participants who will not be available for follow-up will be considered smokers. At the 26 week follow-up, all patients who report being abstinent from smoking will have their smoking status confirmed by measurement of a CO sample. If any CO will be &gt;10 ppm, the subject will be considered a smoker.</description>
