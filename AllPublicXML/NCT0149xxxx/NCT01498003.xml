    <textblock>
      Periprocedural myonecrosis or infarction are associated with short, intermediate, and long
      term adverse outcomes. Previous study indicated 12.6% of patients suffered a peri-procedural
      CK-MB rise by overlapping use of drug-eluting stents for long coronary lesions. Here the
      investigators hypothesize that peri-procedural use of tirofiban could reduce the occurrence
      of periprocedural infarciton in elective patients with long coronary lesions treated by
      overlapping use of drug-eluting stents.

      According to the results of 12.6% occurrence of peri-procedural myocardial infarction after
      long stent implantation by previous report[International Journal of Cardiology 2009;134:
      231-237], the investigator hypothesize the 50% reduction of peri-procedural MI by using
      tirofiban. Three hundred and sixty-nine patients in each group are needed to reach 80% of
      power with α 0.05.
