  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study seeks to continue Connect to Protect® (C2P) community mobilization efforts
      that have developed coalitions that plan for and bring about structural changes for purposes
      of reducing HIV incidence and prevalence among youth in targeted communities at nine sites.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Earlier phases of C2P have been outlined in ATN Protocols 016a, 016b, 040/040b. The C2P
      community mobilization model entails: determining a geographic area and population of focus
      for the coalitions to prioritize their planning and action (accomplished in an earlier phase
      of C2P); coalitions establishing a shared vision and mission; development of a strategic plan
      focused on structural changes to reduce risks associated with HIV; process documentation; and
      feedback as technical assistance to the coalitions. The National Coordinating Center (NCC),
      operating under the direction of the Protocol Chair, provides guidance, training, technical
      assistance and feedback to coalitions.

      This protocol continues the C2P mobilization effort and includes enhanced strategic planning
      activities to assist the coalitions in identifying necessary and relevant structural changes.
      The evaluation of C2P includes both process evaluation (i.e., documentation of coalition
      actions and achievements of structural changes; and outcome evaluation to qualitatively
      assess (via Key Informant (KI) interviews) if and how C2P efforts, including completed
      structural changes, have influenced the risk environment within each community. In addition,
      local health surveillance data and HIV testing data will be used to evaluate changes in HIV
      testing patterns and HIV/Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) morbidity among youth.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the extent to which C2P activities influence elements of the community that affect HIV-related risk prevention, testing, treatment and linkage to healthcare among youth aged 12-24 years and represent intermediate outcomes for this study.</measure>
    <time_frame>End of year 5 (study completion)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment will include evaluation across three primary intermediate outcome areas:
Achievement of SCOs (programs, policies, practices) that target increased levels of HIV-related prevention, testing, and linkage to healthcare.
Increased community capacity and social capital to address HIV-related prevention, testing, and linkage to healthcare.
Increasing levels of sustainability across the HIV continuum of care (CoC) including prevention, testing, and linkage to healthcare activities initiated or influenced by C2P, including programs, policies, and new relationships between people or organizations.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Examine how attributes of the SCOs relate to intermediate outcomes in order to provide guidance and recommendations to policy makers.</measure>
    <time_frame>End of year 5 (study completion)</time_frame>
    <description>Attributes that will be analyzed include:
Change strategy (e.g., information provision, policy change, relationship formation, program creation).
Sector(s) where change occurs.
Distal vs. proximal causes targeted.
Youth population affected by change (e.g., universal, selected or indicated). In addition, strategies associated with SCO achievement (e.g., creating linkages, honest brokering, strategic partnering, etc.) will be examined for trends and associations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
