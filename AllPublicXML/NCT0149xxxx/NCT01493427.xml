      The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of TRAVATAN® Solution
      without benzalkonium chloride (BAK) in patients previously on latanoprost 0.005% or
      bimatoprost 0.01% ophthalmic solution monotherapy.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. A higher IOP can be a greater risk for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage). A more negative change indicates a greater amount of improvement. One eye was chosen as the study eye, and only data from the study eye were used for the efficacy analysis.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma in at least one eye.

          -  Be on either latanoprost 0.005% or bimatoprost 0.01% ophthalmic solution monotherapy
             (including BAK-containing generics) for at least four weeks prior to Screening visit.

          -  Would benefit from a switch to TRAVATAN® Solution without BAK containing Polyquad®
             Preservative due to tolerability issues, in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  IOP considered to be safe (in the opinion of the investigator), in both eyes, in such
             a way that assured clinical stability of vision and the optic nerve throughout the
             study period.

          -  Willing to discontinue the use of all other ocular hypotensive medications prior to
             receiving the study medication for the entire course of the study.

          -  Best corrected Snellen visual acuity of 6/60 (20/200, 1.0 LogMAR) or better in each
             eye

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known medical history of allergy, hypersensitivity, or poor tolerance to any component
             of the preparations to be used in this study deemed clinically significant in the
             opinion of the Principal Investigator.

          -  Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry in either eye.

          -  Severe dry eye or related which has been or currently is being treated with the use of
             punctal plugs, punctal cautery, Restasis®, or topical ocular corticosteroids.

          -  Any clinically significant, serious, or severe medical condition.

          -  Intraocular conventional surgery or laser surgery in either eye less than three months
             prior to Screening Visit.

          -  Risk of visual field or visual acuity worsening as a consequence of participation in
             the study, in the investigator's best judgment.

          -  Progressive retinal or optic nerve disease from any cause.

          -  Women who are pregnant, lactating.

          -  Women not using reliable means of birth control.

          -  Use of any systemic medication known to affect IOP which has not been on stable course
             for at least 7 days prior to Screening Visit.

          -  Any clinically significant, serious, or severe medical condition.

          -  Participation in any other investigational study within 30 days of Screening Visit.

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.

One eye was chosen as the study eye, and only data from the study eye were used for the efficacy analysis.</description>
