  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Recently, human, animal and epidemiological studies suggested that camel milk has
      a hypoglycaemic activity. However, a mechanism and reasons for this activity have not been
      sufficiently studied. Therefore, a study on a glycaemic and insulinaemic responses of regular
      camel milk and camel milk powder is needed.

      Objective: To explore the glycaemic and insulinaemic responses of regular camel milk and
      camel milk powder in healthy adults.

      Study design: In a randomised, single-blind and cross over design, two hour post prandial
      glucose and insulin responses of 4 treatments (regular camel milk, camel milk powder, regular
      cow milk and glucose) will be measured . Those treatments will be consumed in a portion that
      contained 25g available carbohydrate. Finger-prick capillary blood samples will be taken at
      fasting, and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 minutes after ingestion of the test product.
      Venepunctures will be taken at fasting, 30 and 75 minutes after ingestion of the test
      product. The measurements will be conducted on 4 separate days with at least 2 days wash out.

      Study population: 20 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 35 years, with BMI between 18.5 to 25
      kg/m2.

      Intervention: The treatments are regular camel milk, camel milk powder, regular cow milk and
      glucose. These are standardized to 600ml containing 25g available carbohydrate.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Main parameters are postprandial blood glucose and insulin
      responses. Secondary parameters: amino acid composition and glycemic index.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: This intervention is non-therapeutic to the subjects. The risk associated with
      participation is negligible and the burden can be considered low. Before subjects are able to
      participate in this study they will have to fill out a brief questionnaire, and have their
      fasting blood glucose measured, in order to ensure they fit the inclusion criteria of the
      study. Once entering the study, each subject will have to visit the research centre 4 times
      for the postprandial tests. On each measurement day, each subject will be required to have
      fasted for at least ten hours before (an overnight fast). Each subject will have 7
      finger-prick blood samples and 3 venapunctures taken during each visit. A maximum amount of
      50 ml blood is drawn per day.
