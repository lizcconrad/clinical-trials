  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Some cancer treatments collect a patient s own blood cells to use as specialized
      cancer-fighting cells. Collected white blood cells known as PBL (peripheral blood
      lymphocytes) can use to isolate special cells that can fight tumors. Before treatment with
      PBL, chemotherapy is given to destroy existing white blood cells so that the new cells can
      survive and attack the tumors. After PBL treatment, aldesleukin is given to help the new
      cells grow. Researchers want to see if special white blood cells that recognize a specific
      protein that is present in melanoma cells (melanoma antigen recognized by T cells (MART)) can
      cause tumors to shrink. These white blood cells will be tested with and without aldesleukin.

      Objectives:

        -  To test the safety and effectiveness of white blood cells that target MART in the
           treatment of melanoma.

        -  To test white blood cells that target MART with and without aldesleukin.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have melanoma that has not responded to standard
      treatments.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. Blood and urine
           samples will be taken. Imaging studies such as x-rays or magnetic resonance imaging
           scans will be performed.

        -  Participants will provide white blood cells through leukapheresis. Researchers will
           attempt to isolate white blood cells that recognize MART

        -  Seven days before the start of treatment, participants will have chemotherapy.

        -  After the last dose of chemotherapy, participants will receive the MART reactive PBL
           cells. Filgrastim doses will also be given to help white blood cell counts return to
           normal. Participants will have frequent blood tests.

        -  Participants who are able to have aldesleukin treatment will start within 24 hours after
           receiving the MART reactive PBL cells. Treatment will continue for up to 5 days.

        -  Participants may have an optional tumor or lymph node biopsy to study the effects of
           treatment.

        -  If the tumor continues to grow after MART PBL treatment, participants may have one more
           round of cell collection and treatment.

        -  Participants will have followup visits for up to 6 months after receiving the MART
           reactive PBL treatment.

      Background:

        -  TIL transfer studies in patients with metastatic melanoma following lymphodepletion have
           resulted in 50 percent objective response rates with a 10-15 percent rate of complete
           responses. Despite these important clinical findings, adoptive cell transfer has not
           become widely available for patient treatment. Significant obstacles to this therapy are
           the need for invasive surgery and the inability of some patients to tolerate high dose
           aldesleukin. Further, the specific characteristics of the T cells that are responsible
           for the therapeutic effect of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) are unknown, thus,
           resulting in significant treatment variability.

        -  Pre-clinical and correlative clinical studies of adoptive immunotherapy have suggested
           putative favorable characteristics for transferred lymphocytes, such as, high avidity
           for the target antigen, limited in vitro stimulation, and high expression of CD27+.
           However, these characteristics have not been prospectively evaluated in human clinical
           trials.

        -  We have developed a novel non invasive T cell isolation strategy using the heteroclitic
           MART-1:26-35(27L) peptide for in vitro sensitization of human PBL and high throughput
           quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) screening to rapidly isolate antigen
           specific cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) + T cells from the cluster of
           differentiation 4 (CD4) + T cell depleted peripheral blood repertoire. These isolated T
           cells possess the above mentioned favorable characteristics and recognize the native
           MART-1:27-35 epitope, an abundantly expressed melanoma antigen presented by human
           leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A A serotype group (HLA-A2) on the tumor surface.

        -  The current proposed transfer of these select MART-1:27-35 reactive lymphocytes in
           conjunction with a lymphodepleting preparative regimen with or without high dose
           aldesleukin would represent a novel therapeutic option for patients with advanced
           melanoma and provide a desperately needed option for patients who are not medically
           eligible for aldesleukin treatment.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine whether MART-1:27-35 reactive lymphocytes infused with or without the
           administration of high-dose aldesleukin may result in clinical tumor regression in
           patients with metastatic melanoma receiving a non-myeloablative lymphoid depleting
           preparative regimen.

        -  To evaluate the safety of the treatment in patients receiving the non-myeloablative
           conditioning regimen and cell transfer with or without the administration of high-dose
           aldesleukin

        -  To determine the survival in patients, of infused cells following the administration of
           the non-myeloablative regimen, using analysis of the sequence of the variable region of
           the T cell receptor or flow cytometry (fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)).

      Eligibility:

      -Patients with refractory metastatic melanoma who are greater than or equal to 18 years of
      age, are HLA-A2+, who have MART-1:27-35 reactive peripheral blood lymphocytes available and
      are physically able to tolerate non-myeloablative chemotherapy. Patients must be refractory
      to prior high dose aldesleukin treatment if they are medically eligible to receive it.
      Patients who can tolerate high-dose aldesleukin will receive it with cell infusion; those who
      cannot tolerate high-dose aldesleukin due to medical comorbidities or refuse high-dose
      aldesleukin will receive cell infusion without aldesleukin.

      Design:

        -  Patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen
           consisting of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day X 2 days intravenous (IV)), fludarabine (25
           mg/m^2/day IV X 5 days).

        -  Patients will receive intravenous adoptive transfer of MART-1:27-35 reactive peripheral
           blood lymphocytes (minimum 1 X 10^8 and up to a maximum of 3 X 10^11 lymphocytes)
           followed by high-dose intravenous (IV) aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg/dose every 8 hours for
           up to 15 doses) or no aldesleukin if they are not medically eligible to receive it.

        -  A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be conducted 4-6 weeks after the last
           dose of aldesleukin in the aldesleukin arm and 4-6 weeks after the cell administration
           in the no aldesleukin arm. Patients will be enrolled into two cohorts. The cohort
           receiving high-dose aldesleukin will be conducted using a small optimal two-stage Phase
           II design, initially 19 patients will be enrolled, and if 4 or more of the first 19
           patients have a clinical response ((partial response ) PR or (complete response) CR),
           accrual will continue to 33 patients, targeting a 35 percent goal for objective
           response. For the cohort who will not receive aldesleukin, the study will be conducted
           as a Minimax two stage phase II trial. Initially 12 evaluable patients will be enrolled
           to this cohort, and if 1 or more the first 12 have a response, then accrual would
           continue until a total of 21 patients, targeting a 20 percent goal for objective
           response.

    <description>Complete response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10mm. Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study) or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

        <description>Complete response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10mm. Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study) or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>
