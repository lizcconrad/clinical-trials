      The long-term goal of this research is to increase safe driving among novice teen drivers by
      increasing the quantity, quality and diversity of driving practice while accompanied by an
      adult. In order to achieve the long term goal of the study, the investigators have developed
      a web-based intervention program known as Teen Driving Plan (TDP) intended to support high
      quality driving practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motor vehicle crashes remain the number one cause of death among teens in the United States.
      Teen drivers (ages 16 to 19) are four times more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than
      adult drivers (ages 25 to 69). Inexperience is a fundamental factor in the high crash rate
      for novice teens. Safe and skilled driving is a complex task that involves behaviors (e.g.,
      skills and actions) that vary and become increasingly challenging with increasing speed,
      unsafe road conditions and other hazards of the driving environment. Because teens are at
      their lowest lifetime risk of crashing when accompanied by an adult, adult-supervised
      practice provides a safe way for teens to gain needed experience under a variety of driving
      conditions. Unfortunately, few teens receive sufficient quantity, quality and diversity of
      adult-supervised practice prior to licensure.

      The objective of the proposed research is to compare how the driving training process and the
      results of that training process differ between a group of young learning permit holders in
      families that have access to TDP (the intervention group) from the training process and the
      results of that process in an otherwise similar group of teens in families with no TDP access
      (the control group). The investigators hypothesize that teens given access to TDP will
      demonstrate greater competence and safety in a standardized on-road driving assessment than
      teens with no TDP access.

    <description>The primary outcome was driving performance as measured by the teens completion of the standardized and validated ODA 24 weeks after enrollment. Certified professional driving evaluators blinded to randomization status terminated the ODA if they determined that the teen could not safely complete it. Criteria for termination included: (1) a driver action or inaction requiring evaluator intervention to prevent a collision; (2) a driving task requiring assistance from the evaluator to be performed safely; (3) violation of a traffic law; (4) evasive action needed by another vehicle or a pedestrian to avoid a collision; or (5) a subjective assessment by the evaluator that the teenager could not continue safely. We examined the teens ability to complete the ODA as measured by the number of terminations.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>From December 2011 to August 2012, participants were recruited from 5 sources: (1) local high schools; (2) The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) primary care practices; (3) local licensing centers; (4) community events; and (5) targeted ads in online venues. Fliers, letters, and ads describing the study were distributed via these channels.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A subset of the teens were assigned to complete the On Road Driving (ODA) assessment. Study participation lasted from 6-36 months based on licensure status - all dyads participated in the study for 6 months, after which participation continued until teens obtained their junior driver’s license (up to a max of 36 months from enrollment).</pre_assignment_details>

        <type>Primary</type>
        <title>Late Driving Performance in On-road Assessment (ODA) Test</title>
        <description>The primary outcome was driving performance as measured by the teens completion of the standardized and validated ODA 24 weeks after enrollment. Certified professional driving evaluators blinded to randomization status terminated the ODA if they determined that the teen could not safely complete it. Criteria for termination included: (1) a driver action or inaction requiring evaluator intervention to prevent a collision; (2) a driving task requiring assistance from the evaluator to be performed safely; (3) violation of a traffic law; (4) evasive action needed by another vehicle or a pedestrian to avoid a collision; or (5) a subjective assessment by the evaluator that the teenager could not continue safely. We examined the teens ability to complete the ODA as measured by the number of terminations.</description>
        <time_frame>24 weeks after enrollment</time_frame>
        <population>512 teen-parent dyads were eligible and agreed to participate. Of these, 217 teens were scheduled to complete the ODA (128 were randomized to Teen Driving Plan (TDP), 89 to Usual Practice). Participant attrition over the time of the study resulted in 151 teens (86 TDP and 65 control) completing the 24-week ODA.</population>
