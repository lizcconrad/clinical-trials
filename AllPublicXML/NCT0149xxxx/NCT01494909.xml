  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is a significant problem in children and adults with Cystic fibrosis (CF). An
      impaired intestinal digestion and absorption capacity is one of the main factors responsible
      for the malnutrition in CF. This impairment starts early in life, leading to malnutrition,
      muscle weakness, impaired immune and lung function associated with poor prognosis. As low BMI
      and body weight is strongly associated with morbidity and mortality, a reduction in weight
      loss in CF and its manifestations would save the healthcare system substantially per year.
      Simple methods to measure the digested portions and utilization of nutrients and the
      effectiveness of pancreatic enzyme preparations and medications in CF are not available.
      Developing a panel of methods to accurately measure gut digestion, absorption and function
      will lead to studies optimizing nutritional regimen and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy
      in CF. Furthermore, it will provide detailed insight in the disease and age related
      mechanisms of gut dysfunction in CF. Finally, it will provide required information that will
      lead to implement new strategies to improve gut health in order to enhance nutritional
      status, quality of life and survival.

      The hypothesis is that intestinal macronutrient digestion, absorption and function in CF can
      be quantified by an innovative panel of methods using stable isotopes. With this panel of
      methods, information can be obtained on the effect of disease progression on lipid, protein
      and glucose digestion and absorption and on gut function in CF as well as in other diseases
      and conditions characterized by a compromised gut. Furthermore, the optimal nutritional
      regimen and pancreatic enzyme therapy if applicable can be evaluated in these diseases. In
      the present study the investigators will study: 1. Pediatric patients with CF at Arkansas
      Children's Hospital; 2. Adult patients with CF at University of Arkansas for Medical
      Sciences. 3. Healthy control subjects. Diagnosis of CF is made based on universal diagnostic
      criteria. All CF patients are characterized by abnormal lipid digestion based on clinical and
      or laboratory (72 hour fat analysis or fecal elastase measurement) diagnosis, and requiring
      pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, and no presence of unstable metabolic diseases.
      Additional criteria for the CF pediatric inpatients are: admitted to ACH for treatment of
      exacerbations of CF disease, clinically stable. The CF outpatients are stable outpatients
      with pancreatic insufficiency.
