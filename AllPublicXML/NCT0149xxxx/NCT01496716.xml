      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between hip
      arthroplasty patients' preoperative weight and the patients quality of life and the clinical
      effect one year postoperatively.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-36</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured 1 week before surgery and 12 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>A patient reported outcome (PRO). The questionnaire is a tool for measuring health status. The form is used to measure the patient's view of his own health by scoring standardized responses to standardized questions. The schedule consists of 36 questions representing eight health concepts.</description>

    <time_frame>Measured 1 week before surgery and 12 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Hip - specific patient-reported outcome that measures the patient's own assessment of hip problems and related problems. The schedule consists of 42 questions representing 5 strands.</description>

    <measure>Body composition</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured 1 week before surgery and 12 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) can measure total body bone mineral density and obtain accurate measurements of body tissue composition (muscle mass and fat mass). By measuring the body's muscle mass, fat mass and bone mineral density, one can estimate total body fat percentage.</description>
