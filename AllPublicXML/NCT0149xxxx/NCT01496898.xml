      The goal of this study is to examine changes in the bacterial ecology and inflammatory
      markers of the female genital tract with levonorgestrel intrauterine device placement.

      The specific research objectives of this project include:

        1. Characterization of vaginal, cervical and uterine bacterial species and communities
           prior to and after LNG IUD placement using bacterial DNA microarray analysis. Samples
           will be collected up to 1 week before and 2 months after IUD insertion.

        2. Characterization of vaginal, cervical and uterine inflammatory cytokine milieu prior to
           and after LNG IUD placement using human RNA microarray analysis. Samples will be
           analyzed from up to one day before and three weeks after IUD insertion.

        3. Establish a tissue bank of vaginal, cervical and uterine specimens for future research.

      A total of 648 samples will be collected from 12 participants for bacterial species and human
      cytokine analysis in 9 collection visits. Specimens will be collected up to one week prior to
      IUD insertion and two months after IUD insertion. Vaginal and cervical specimens will be
      collected using FLOQSwabsÂ® (Copan) to maximize bacterial DNA sample collection. Uterine
      samples will be collected by uterine irrigation with sterile saline using an embryo
      replacement catheter.
