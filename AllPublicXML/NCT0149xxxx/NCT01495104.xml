    <textblock>
      This open-label, fixed-sequence, two-period study will assess the effect of multiple dose
      valproate on the pharmacokinetics of RO4917838 at steady state and vice versa in healthy male
      volunteers. In Period 1, subjects will receive valproate for 5 days. After a washout period
      of 5 days to 2 weeks, subjects will receive, in Period 2, RO4917838 for 15 days with
      concomitant valproate on Days 11-15. Anticipated time on study is up to 12 weeks.
