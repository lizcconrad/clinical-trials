    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the implant (INFUSE™ BONE GRAFT/CORNERSTONE-SR™
      Allograft Ring/ATLANTIS™ Anterior Cervical Plate system) as a method of facilitating spinal
      fusion in patients with cervical symptomatic degenerative disc disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Cervical disc disease defined as: intractable radiculopathy and/or myelopathy with at
             least one of the following items producing symptomatic nerve root and/or spinal cord
             compression which is documented by diagnostic imaging procedures:

               -  herniated disc;

               -  osteophyte formation;

               -  decreased disc height;

               -  thickening of ligamentous tissue;

               -  disc degeneration; and/or

               -  facet joint degeneration.

          2. Has preoperative Neck Disability Index score &gt; 30;

          3. Has single cervical disc disease level requiring fusion from C2 to C7;

          4. No previous surgical intervention at the involved fusion level;

          5. Unresponsive to nonoperative treatment for approximately six weeks or has the presence
             of progressive symptoms or signs of nerve root or spinal cord compression in face of
             continued nonoperative management;

          6. Is at least 18 years of age, inclusive at time of surgery;

          7. If of child-bearing potential, patient is non-pregnant, non-nursing, and agrees to use
             adequate contraception for 1 year following surgery;

          8. Is willing and able to comply with study plan and sign the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has cervical spinal condition requiring surgical treatment other than symptomatic
             cervical disc disease at the involved level.

          2. Has a condition which requires postoperative medications that interfere with fusion,
             such as steroids or prolonged non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs excluding routine
             perioperative anti-inflammatory drugs. This does not include low dose aspirin for
             prophylactic anticoagulation.

          3. Has been previously diagnosed with osteopenia, or osteomalacia.

          4. Has any of the following that may be associated with a diagnosis of osteoporosis (if
             &quot;Yes&quot; to any of the below risk factors, a DEXA Scan will be required to determine

             If the level of BMD is a T score of -3.5 or a T score of -2.5 with vertebral crush
             fracture, the patient is excluded from the study.

          5. Has presence of active malignancy or prior history of malignancy, except for basal
             cell carcinoma of the skin.

          6. Has overt or active bacterial infection, either local or systemic.

          7. Has a documented titanium alloy allergy or intolerance.

          8. Is mentally incompetent. If questionable, obtain psychiatric consult.

          9. Is a prisoner.

         10. Is an alcohol and/or drug abuser as defined by currently undergoing treatment for
             alcohol and/or drug usage.

         11. Has received drugs which may interfere with bone metabolism within two weeks prior to
             the planned date of spinal fusion surgery (e.g., steroids or methotrexate), excluding
             routine perioperative anti-inflammatory drugs.

         12. Has a history of autoimmune disease (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus or Dermatomyositis).

         13. Has a history of exposure to injectable collagen implants.

         14. Has a history of hypersensitivity to protein pharmaceuticals (monoclonal antibodies or
             gamma globulins) or collagen.

         15. Has received treatment with an investigational therapy within 28 days prior to
             implantation surgery or such treatment is planned during the 16 weeks following
             rhBMP-2/ACS implantation.

         16. Has received any previous exposure to any/all BMP's of either human or animal
             extraction.
