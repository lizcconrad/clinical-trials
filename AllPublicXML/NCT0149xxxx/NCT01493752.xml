  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diets rich in fruit and vegetables reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks, however the
      exact cause of this beneficial effect is uncertain. Evidence suggests that certain
      vegetables, including beetroot and the green leafy vegetables, possess high inorganic nitrate
      concentrations. The investigators recent evidence suggests that inorganic nitrate provides a
      source of gas called nitric oxide in the body that exerts a number of beneficial effects upon
      the heart and blood vessels . The investigators have previously shown that beetroot juice
      ingestion improves blood vessel (vascular endothelial) and platelet function in healthy
      volunteers. Studies by the investigators show that these effects are due to conversion of
      nitrate to nitrite by symbiotic (helpful) bacteria (located on the tongue) and subsequent
      conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide in blood vessels. The investigators now wish to explore
      whether dietary nitrate, via its beneficial effects on platelets and blood vessels, might
      improve indices of atherosclerotic disease progression in high risk individuals
      (hypercholesterolemics). Recruits will have high cholesterol and no known atherosclerosis and
      will not yet be on any anti-cholesterol medications. Volunteers will consume a daily dose of
      beetroot juice or placebo nitrate-free juice for six weeks. Vascular function will be
      assessed using non-invasive techniques at the beginning and at the end of the study using
      ultrasound measurement of flow mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery in the arm
      and pulse wave analysis (PWA) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) to measure arterial compliance.
      To assess impact on platelet function, blood samples will also be taken at the start and at
      the end of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants will be between 18-80 years of age.

          2. They will be largely newly diagnosed patients with hypercholesterolemia (total serum
             cholesterol&gt;6.0mmol/L or any elevation of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol or
             triglycerides with a QRISK 2 score &gt;15%).

          3. We will include patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. These patients in general
             will either be managed in primary care alone or will attend the clinic following
             referral from general practitioners for further investigation following routine health
             tests.

          4. In addition, patients who have been referred due to inability to tolerate statin
             treatment will be included.

          5. They will be recruited into the study if they are interested in taking part in
             research, do not have any exclusion criteria on screening and give their written
             informed consent.

        Hypercholesterolemics will be screened by taking a medical history and physical
        examination, blood pressure measurement and urine sample taken to check for diabetes. The
        subject will continue his/her usual diet and exercise regime prior to diagnosis of
        hypercholesterolemia for purposes of this study. They will not be taking any additional
        vitamin or food supplements for the duration of the study.
