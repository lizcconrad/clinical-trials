    <textblock>
      This trial will find the best dose of mifepristone when given together with nab-paclitaxel
      (Abraxane) based on the side effects of the two drugs in patients with advanced breast
      cancer.

      Patients will be randomized to receive nab-paclitaxel with or without mifepristone during the
      first treatment cycle. After the first cycle, all patients will receive nab-paclitaxel with
      mifepristone until their disease worsens or they experience an unacceptable side effect.

      This study will test up to 4 doses of mifepristone in combination with nab-paclitaxel. The
      study will first test the lowest dose in a small group of patients and if they do not have
      bad side effects, higher doses will be tested.

    <description>Patients will receive mifepristone and nab-paclitaxel in 28-day treatment cycles. Patients receive mifepristone once a day by mouth on days 0, 1, 7, 8, 14, and 15 and nab-paclitaxel by intravenous infusion (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment cycles are repeated every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable side effects.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have metastatic (stage IV) or unresectable (cannot be removed by
             surgery) stage III breast cancer

          -  Patients must have evaluable disease

          -  Patients may have received adjuvant chemotherapy and up to four prior chemotherapy
             regimens for metastatic or locally recurrent disease and cannot have received prior

          -  Patients who are estrogen receptor (ER)- and/or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive
             must have developed metastatic disease while on adjuvant hormonal therapy or have
