  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and performance in normal therapeutic
      use of the Artiste System in comparison to standard manual administration of dermal fillers.
      Subjects are recruited from the investigator's practice and randomized to receive treatment
      with the Artiste System on either the left or right nasolabial fold, the contralateral fold
      to be treated with standard manual injections. Treatments occur in a single session to
      achieve optimal cosmetic results (OCR) balanced on both sides. Investigators are encouraged
      to use a variety of types and brands of dermal fillers, recruiting subjects for the study as
      necessary. Safety and performance evaluations will be made through a combination of clinical
      observations, questionnaires for the subject and for the Treating Investigator, and
      spontaneous reports of adverse events. There are 6 required study visits: Screening, Day 1
      (Treatment Day), Day 3, Day 8, Day 15, and Day 29.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, evaluator-blind, bilateral, controlled, multicenter study. Subjects are
      to be recruited from the investigator's practice and randomized to receive treatment with the
      Artiste System on either the left or right nasolabial fold, the contralateral fold to be
      treated with standard manual injections. Treatments will occur in a single session to achieve
      optimal cosmetic results (OCR) balanced on both sides. There are no specific requirements
      with respect to the type or brand of dermal filler to be used, but the investigators will be
      encouraged to use a variety of types and brands in the context of the study, recruiting
      subjects for the study as necessary. Safety and performance evaluations will be made through
      a combination of clinical observations (by a Blinded Evaluator distinct from the Treating
      Investigator), questionnaires for the subject and for the Treating Investigator, and
      spontaneous reports of adverse events. There will be a total of 6 required study visits:
      Screening, Day 1 (Treatment Day), Day 3, Day 8, Day 15, and Day 29.
