  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to provide evidence for its fermentability of a dietary fiber
      and to collect information regarding potential health opportunities for glucose control as
      well as tolerability when being consumed over 7 days.

    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a randomized, 2-arm, treatment-controlled, within-subjects, 8-hour
      postprandial crossover study, utilizing a multiple sampling paradigm to evaluate
      fermentability and potential health opportunities for glucose control of a dietary fiber
      (FCHO) in healthy non-obese men and women. The study will include 2 - 8 h assessments
      following consumption of the FCHO drink or a placebo drink and will follow with a 7 day
      feeding period to assess tolerability.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The fermentation action of a dietary fiber (FCHO) provided in a breakfast test meal in relatively healthy non-obese men and women</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>FCHO will be incorporated in a breakfast meal and compared to the same meal without the FCHO. Subjects will be served a breakfast meal with FCHO or without FCHO in a randomly assigned sequence on two separate occasions (visit 1 and visit 2) under fasting conditions.
Hydrogen (H2) from breath will be measured before the breakfast test meal (baseline/fasting) and every hour: at 1hr, 2hr, 3hr, 4hr, 5hr, 6 hr, 7hr, and 8hr.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The changes in postprandial glucose concentrations after consuming test meals with FCHO drink compared to placebo drink</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>FCHO will be incorporated in a breakfast meal and compared to the same meal without the FCHO. Subjects will be served a breakfast meal with FCHO or without FCHO in a randomly assigned sequence on two separate occasions (visit 1 and visit 2) under fasting conditions.
Blood glucose will be measured before (fasting/baseline) and after breakfast test meal intake for 4hrs: 0, 30 min, 60 min, 120 min, and 240 min and then again after the light lunch meal at 30, 60, 90, 120 post lunch.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The tolerability of treatments over 7 days</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>After the in-lab study day (visit 1 and visit 2), subjects will go home with the test beverage packs to be consumed daily for 7 days. Subjects will maintain diaries to ensure daily consumption and on day 7 will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire related to gastrointestinal experiences during the week. Identical procedures will take place after both study days, except the assigned treatment will differ.</description>
