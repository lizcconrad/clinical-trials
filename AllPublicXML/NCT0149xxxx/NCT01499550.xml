  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On the basis of different studies the long term oxygen treatment is deemed to be routine
      treatment in patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at
      appearance of hypoxaemia. Non invasive ventilation (NIV) is the treatment of choice in
      hypercapnic COPD patients with respiratory acidosis at acute respiratory decompensation.
      Several prospective randomized studies have shown a reduction of acute mortality as result.
      But everyday practice shows that COPD patients with chronic hypercapnia hardly accustom
      oneself to nocturnal ventilation. Reasons are not known yet, but substantial pulmonary
      overinflation or the appearance of depressions or rather anxiety disorders are possible
      causes. On the other hand patients may not notice any subjective improvement of symptoms and
      won't accept the burden of a tight fitting mask during the night. The aim of the present
      study is to determine the effect on gas exchange of a nocturnal transnasal application of an
      oxygen-enriched gaseous mixture via nasal cannula and the subjective acceptance. This is
      compared to a nocturnal transnasal application of oxygen alone in randomized order for at
      least 6 hours each night.

      Thirty hypercapnic COPD GOLD IV patients (PCO2 &gt; 50 mmHg) will be included. The two night
      Polysomnographies (PSG) will be evaluated with special attention to nasal flow measurements,
      breathing effort, oxygen saturation and an additional transcutaneous PCO2 measurement. At
      begin and end of each measurement night a capillary blood gas analysis is made.

    <description>During the study nights the patients PCO2 value is measured transcutaneous as well as by capillary blood gas analyses (BGA) in the evening and in the morning. The differences in PCO2 values of the morning BGA will be compared, a PCO2 decrease is supposed to be assessed under TNI treatment.</description>

    <description>The alternative breathing support with TNI supplies COPD patients with 20L/min of warm humidified air. This method may be applicable to wash out the dead space between glottis and nasal opening. Pre-investigations have shown that 45 minutes of TNI during daytime reduced PCO2 and respiratory rate compared to application of oxygen alone.Transcutaneous PCO2 is measured over night. A capillary blood gas analysis (BGA) is carried out at beginning and end of each measurement night.</description>
