        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, for which endocrine
             therapy is indicated

          -  Has a current tumour, nodule and metastasis (TNM) staging within 12 weeks prior to
             treatment start and, if clinically indicated a bone scan

          -  Has a PSA level meeting one of these criteria:

               1. For treatment-naïve patients: Screening PSA level should be ≥2 ng/mL.

               2. For patients with recurrence after radical prostatectomy: Patients should have a
                  serum PSA increase of ≥0.2 ng/mL from the previous test on two consecutive
                  measurements

               3. For patients with recurrence after radiotherapy or cryotherapy: Patients should
                  have a serum PSA (two measurements) to be &gt;2 ng/mL higher than a previously
                  confirmed PSA nadir

          -  Has a screening serum testosterone level above the lower limit of normal range in an
             elderly male population, globally defined as &gt;150 ng/dL

          -  Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of ≤2

          -  Has a life expectancy of at least one year

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has had previous or is currently under hormonal management of prostate cancer

          -  Is considered to be a candidate for curative therapy i.e. radical prostatectomy or
             radiotherapy during the trial period

          -  Has a history of bilateral orchiectomy, adrenalectomy, or hypophysectomy

          -  Has a marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTcF interval (e.g. repeated demonstration of
             a QTcF interval &gt;450 ms)

          -  Has a history of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes ventricular arrhythmias (e.g.
             heart failure, hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Has a previous history or presence of another malignancy, other than prostate

          -  Currently receiving chronic treatment with intramuscular medication injected into the
             ventrogluteal or dorsogluteal muscle

          -  Has received an investigational drug within the last 28 days preceding the Screening
             Visit or longer if considered to possibly influence the outcome of the current trial
