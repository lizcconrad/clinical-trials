  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress has been linked to chronic health problems, particularly diseases involving
      inflammation-mediated tissue injury and organ failure. Accordingly, it is not surprising that
      mind/body interventions are advocated for treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. One
      such candidate disease is ulcerative colitis (UC) because: (1) UC is a life-long, relapsing,
      disabling inflammatory disorder of the intestine that lacks a non-toxic, efficacious
      treatment; (2) the therapeutic goal is to improve quality of life by ameliorating disabling
      symptoms and preventing disease progression by preventing disease flare-up, (3) stress
      triggers UC flare-up by modifying intestinal function and inflammatory processes,
      highlighting the potential therapeutic benefit of reducing physiological stress responses.
      The purpose of this study is to see if either of two 8-week mind/body medicine courses has an
      effect in reducing stress and affecting the course and severity of UC. Both have been shown
      to benefit other aspects of health and well-being.

    <description>The subject of each course is Mind/Body medicine. One course is learning about the mind and the body through experiences. The other is learning about the mind and the body through experiences. Both courses will follow the same format, meeting once every week, for a total of 8 weeks, for roughly 2 hours per class. You will be provided with a schedule of the weekly classes, which will occur on the same day every week, at the same time. Weekly sessions will be run by a teacher and will include other participants in the class. . You will also be given homework assignments that are intended to reinforce what you learn in the program. The assignments will require up to 45 minutes, 6 days/week. Following the 6th class, and before the 7th class, there is a voluntary Â½ day Saturday program. Participation in this program is optional. You are expected to continue to incorporate what you learned in the class in your daily routine after you are done with the classes.</description>
