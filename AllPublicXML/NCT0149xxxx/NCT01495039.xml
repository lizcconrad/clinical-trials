  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose. Oral chemoprophylaxis has been advocated to reduce the incidence of Candida
      colonization and infection. However, Candida prophylaxis in intensive care unit (ICU) is
      still a matter of debate.

      Methods. Randomized, single-center trial studying single drug (nystatin) versus control in
      surgical ICU patients. Multiple-site testing for fungi were performed in each patient at ICU
      admission (T0) and subsequently every 3 days (T3, T6, T9…). The primary evaluation criterion
      was the time course of colonization index (CI) during ICU stay.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple-site testing for fungi included: tracheal secretions, pharingael swab, stomach
      contents, rectal swab, groin skin fold swab, urine, and blood. These tests will be performed
      in each patient at ICU admission (T0) and subsequently every 3 days throughout the ICU stay
      (T3, T6, T9…), as routine in our ICU.The specimens were placed in a dry medium and taken to
      the Mycology Laboratory. Group assignment was not indicated on specimens, the mycologists
      were therefore blinded to treatment allocation.

      Each specimen was directly microscopically examined and cultured on Sabouraud media.

    <description>Fungal colonization will be defined as either the presence of the same yeast on one or more of the six distinct body sites tested (blood sample excepted), or on two consecutive specimens from the same body site. Candida Colonisation index (C.I.)was defined as the ratio of the number of distinct body sites colonised with genotypically identical strains of Candida spp (blood excepted) over the total number of sites tested.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary evaluation criterion will be the occurrence of a fungal infection during the ICU stay</measure>
    <time_frame>At 15 day from ICU admission</time_frame>
    <description>Fungal infection will be defined as either the presence of a candidemia or the identification of Candida spp. in a normally sterile body site associated with a severe sepsis with negative tests for bacteria or other causes.</description>
