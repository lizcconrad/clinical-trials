      OBJECTIVES: Main objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of plasma rich in growth factors
      (PRGF) in the treatment of patients with venous ulcers. Secondary objective: To evaluate the
      safety of plasma rich in growth factors in treating patients with venous ulcers. DESIGN:
      Randomized, open clinical trial in parallel groups, controlled with conventional treatment.

      SAMPLE: Over age patients, of primary care centers of Vitoria, with at least one venous
      ulcers of 6 or more weeks of evolution and 0.5-6 cm of diameter. INTERVENTION: 1-Experimental
      group: Autologous PRGF administrated once a week (day 1) + conventional treatment
      administrated twice a week (days 1 and 4)for 12 weeks of treatment, but in those cases where
      there has been no complete healing in this period, patients will continue the same management
      protocol to get it. 2-Control group: Conventional treatment twice a week (days 1 and 4)for 12
      weeks of treatment.

      Conventional treatment includes: Cleaning and debridement of the wound, the application of
      corresponding dressing, and using of antibiotic if necessary in each visit.

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:The primary outcome analysis was done by logistic regression. The crude
      model and the adjusted model (for confounding variables)will be built. The healing time of
      ulcers (in days) were analyzed using the Kaplan Meier survival analysis and the corresponding
      comparison using the log rank test.

      An open, randomized, of parallel groups, and controlled clinical trial. Patients will be
      allocated on first come to one of the two treatment groups using a block random sequence
      generated by computer that will remain hidden from the researchers and patients until
      allocation.

      Experimental group: PRGF together with the corresponding dressing according to annex IV.

      Control group: Corresponding dressing according to annex IV.

      Both groups will be submitted to a cleaning, debridement, occlusive dressing and use of
      antibiotic if necessary in each visit.

      After signing consent form, and previously of randomization, patients will be submitted to a
      blood extraction where it will be determinate: Albumine (in g/dl), Hemoglobin (in g/dl),
      Hematocrit (in %), Creatinine (in mg/dl). If patients have data collected through previous
      analysis performed until 30 days before, it will not be necessary a new extraction.

      Patients will be also submitted to an initial valuation of:

        -  medical antecedents: history of chronic venous insufficiency, previous medical
           treatments.

        -  general state: dependence grade through Barthel index, mobility, ankle arm index.

        -  ulcer characteristics:exudate, sing of location of ulcer, antiquity of ulcer,
           tunneling,infection, pain through a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).

        -  Anthropometric characteristics; Weight, height and Body Mass Index (BMI).

      Patients will go to the physician's consult every fours days (on Monday or Tuesday and
      Thursday or Friday). When one ulcer is closed, patient will go to physician's consult to
      confirm that it remains closed at seven and fifteen days.

      In both intervention and control groups, the bad evolution of ulcer with deterioration at
      least during four consecutive weeks, will obligate to ask a preferred inter-consultation with
      Vascular Surgery Service.

      In each visit the following variables will be measured:

        -  Wound surface (in cm2) measured through PUSH scale (Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing)
           belonging to GNEAUPP group (National Group to study and advice about pressure ulcers and
           chronic wounds). This variable will be measured in each visit.

        -  Safety variable: Pruritus (Yes/No), Pain (through VAS scale), Sings of infection
           (Yes/No).

      If patient experience one adverse effect which according to judgment of nurse precludes its
      continuation into the study, the nurse will communicate it to physician who will discharge
      from study if it is necessary.

      All this will be collected in Case Report Form (CRF).
