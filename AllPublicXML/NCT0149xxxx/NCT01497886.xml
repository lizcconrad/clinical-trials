  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the abundance of stroke education materials available, studies continue to reveal
      severe deficiencies in stroke literacy (knowledge of symptoms, urgent action, and prevention
      measures). Expensive mass media stroke education campaigns are not sustainable for this
      purpose, particularly in economically disadvantaged populations. Instead, the investigators
      propose to intervene in school classrooms with children aged 9 to 11 years, to teach the five
      cardinal stroke symptoms, the correct course of action when they occur, and to highlight the
      potential therapeutic benefit of early hospital arrival, with the intent that the children
      will then educate their parents. To help accomplish this, the investigators have developed a
      program called Hip Hop Stroke (HHS), which is comprised of rap songs and two animated musical
      cartoons that incorporate stroke knowledge.

      Hypotheses:

      Hypothesis 1. No differences in baseline knowledge will exist between the parents assigned to
      the intervention and control arms or between the children assigned to the intervention and
      control arms.

      Hypothesis 2. Children in the intervention arm will demonstrate greater knowledge immediately
      after and at three months after the intervention concerning stroke symptom identification and
      response compared to those in the control arm.

      Hypothesis 3. Compared to students in the Control condition, children in the intervention arm
      will be more likely to communicate stroke information to their parents (assessed at 1-week
      follow-up).

      Hypothesis 4. In homes in which such communication has been enacted, parents in schools
      assigned to the intervention arm will demonstrate greater ability to name the symptoms of
      stroke and appropriate action, compared to their baseline knowledge, at 1 week and at 3
      months follow-up, compared to parents in the control arm.

      Significance: Stroke is the leading cause of serious long-term adult disability in the U.S.
      and third leading cause of death, and has a 2-fold greater incidence in Blacks compared to
      the majority Americans. Thrombolytic revascularization treatment administered within a
      maximum of 3 hours from symptom onset reduces morbidity, mortality and cost3Í¾ however, only
      3% of patients arrive at the hospital within 3 hours,4 mostly due to the public's lack of
      knowledge concerning stroke symptoms, and the appropriate response when they are recognized,
      which is to call 911. The investigators propose to reduce these delays using a novel
      behavioral intervention to improve symptom recognition and response in a high-risk, minority,
      economically disadvantaged population. Despite the abundance of stroke education materials
      available, studies continue to reveal severe deficiencies in stroke literacy (knowledge of
      symptoms, urgent action, and prevention measures). Expensive mass media stroke education
      campaigns are not sustainable for this purpose, particularly in economically disadvantaged
      populations. Instead, the investigators propose to intervene in school classrooms with
      children aged 9 to 11 years, to teach the five cardinal stroke symptoms, the correct course
      of action when they occur, and to highlight the potential therapeutic benefit of early
      hospital arrival, with the intent that the children will then educate their parents. To help
      accomplish this, the investigators have developed a program called Hip Hop Stroke (HHS),
      which is comprised of rap songs and two animated musical cartoons that incorporate stroke
      knowledge.

      Innovation: Targeting children to intervene with their parents has been rarely and
      sporadically attempted in various content areas, but the interventions have used traditional
      teaching methods that do not engage the children, and little success has been reported. In
      contrast, the HHS intervention was designed in collaboration with school-aged children,
      children's education television/media experts, as well as public health experts, school
      principals, and neurologists. As a result, not only is the targeting of children for this
      purpose an important innovation, but so is the careful development of materials designed to
      appeal to them. Moreover, the investigators note that utilizing children as a &quot;transmission
      vector&quot; for carrying out interventions aimed at their parents has the potential to serve as
      the basis for intervention in any number of other areas, for example, medication adherence,
      healthy eating and weight loss, treatment of diabetes, and so on.

      Thus, the significance of the proposed trial addresses the public health problem under study
      stroke symptom identification and response as well as development and refinement of a more
      general model of intervention.

      Primary Aims. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with
      two arms: HHS Intervention and control, in 14 public schools in New York City, to evaluate
      the effect of the HHS intervention on:

        1. The children's' ability to name the cardinal symptoms of stroke, and the recommended
           action, at three months following end of the intervention. (This will provide a
           replication of our first trial).

        2. The likelihood that children exposed to the HHS intervention will communicate, or
           attempt to communicate, the content to one or more persons in their household.

        3. In homes in which such communication has occurred, the parent's ability to name the
           cardinal symptoms of stroke, and the recommended action, at 1 week and 3-months
           following end of the intervention. Secondary Aim: The average annual age-adjusted stroke
           incidence rate among Blacks in New York City (northern Manhattan) at age &gt; 20, per
           100,000 persons is 223, double the rate seen in whites. Although the incidence of stroke
           is high, it is beyond the scope of this trial to provide sufficient statistical power to
           assess the effect of the intervention on the interval between recognition (whether self
           or otherwise) and arrival at the emergency room. However, we will collect follow-up data
           (minimum 2year) to observe the trend.
