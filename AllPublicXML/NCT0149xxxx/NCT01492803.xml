    <textblock>
      This is a double masked randomized placebo-controlled trial to examine if once daily
      probiotic therapy will lower serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels and immune activation
      among HIV-infected youth. The study will enroll two cohorts: (1) a cohort of subjects who are
      not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) and have absolute CD4 T-cell count greater than
      350 cells/ul and quantitative HIV-1 plasma RNA (viral load) less than 50,000 copies/ml; and
      (2) a cohort of subjects who are receiving ART and have absolute CD4 T-cell count greater
      than 350 cells/ul and and quantitative HIV-1 plasma RNA (viral load) less than 400 copies/ml.
