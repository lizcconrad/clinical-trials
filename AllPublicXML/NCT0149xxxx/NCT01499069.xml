  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nerve growth factor (NGF), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in
      urine were reported to increase in patients with overactive bladder (OAB). Also,
      administration of the anti-muscarinic agent was reported to decrease urinary NGF and ATP.

      The investigators aimed to explore the value of the urinary NGF, PGE2 and ATP as biomarker
      for predicting the treatment responsiveness and symptom relapse in OAB patients. So, the
      patients can be categorized into responder or non- responder and relapse or non-relapse
      groups. Ultimately, they can receive individualized treatments.

          -  Verified by 3-day bladder diary as below

               -  Urgency episode of 2 or over 2 times/24 hours (defined as a level of 3 to 5 in a
                  5 point urgency scale at baseline)

               -  Urinary frequency of 8 or over 8 times/24 hours

          -  Symptom duration of 3 or over 3 months.

          -  Ability and willingness to correctly complete the micturition diary and questionnaire

          -  Capable of understanding and having signed the informed consent form after full
             discussion of the research nature of the treatment and its risks and benefits

        Exclusion Criteria:

             reference ranges for serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST [SGOT]),
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT [SGPT]), alkaline phosphatase or creatinine

          -  Any condition that is a contraindication for anticholinergic treatment, including
