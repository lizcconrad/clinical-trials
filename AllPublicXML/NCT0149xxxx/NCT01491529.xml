    <description>The modified AIMS is a scale used to assess dyskinesia. It focuses on six different parts of the body and rates abnormal movements from 0 (absence of dyskinesia to 4 (severe) (maximal score, 24).
Change from baseline to Week 12 will be analyzed using the mixed effect repeated measures model (MMRM) including treatment, pooled center, week, treatment by week interaction as fixed effects and baseline total score as covariate with an unstructured covariance structure.</description>

    <measure>The change in total score and sub-score of UDysRS Parts I, II, III, and IV from baseline to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The UDysRS captures dyskinesia and has 4 parts: I: Historical Disability of On-Dyskinesia impact (max 44 pts); II: Historical Disability of Off-Dystonia impact (max 16 pts); III: Objective Impairment dyskinesia (max 28 pts); IV: Objective Disability based on Part III activities (max 16 pts). Higher scores mean greater severity.

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The LFADLDS assesses the degree of dyskinesia interfering with activities of daily living. Specific definitions for severity rating codes (range, 0-4 for each task) will be provided for reproducibility of results. A higher score indicates more severe impairment. A patient and caregiver version of the revised LFADLDS will be used in this study.

Change from baseline will be rated on a 7-point, Likert-type scale where 1 = markedly improved, 2 = moderately improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = unchanged, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = moderately worse, and 7 = markedly worse.
The CGIC score at week 12 last observation carried forward (LOCF) will be analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group, pooled center, and baseline CGIS (Clinical Global Impression of Severity) score as factors.</description>
