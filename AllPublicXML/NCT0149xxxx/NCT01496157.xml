  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate a radiolabeled urea-based small molecule inhibitor
      of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), [18F]DCFBC (DCFBC), as a PET imaging biomarker
      of prostate cancer detection and aggressiveness at initial diagnosis. PSMA is a well
      characterized histological marker of prostate cancer tumor aggressiveness but a quantitative
      non-invasive method for PSMA detection and monitoring is not currently available. Development
      of such an imaging biomarker would be useful to differentiate indolent from aggressive
      prostate cancer phenotypes and allow for selection of appropriate risk adaptive therapies.
      The investigators preliminary first-in-human studies demonstrate high specific DCFBC uptake
      in metastatic prostate cancer and feasibility for prostate cancer imaging. The investigators
      propose to study patients initially diagnosed with biopsy-positive prostate cancer to
      determine if DCFBC uptake and location by PET imaging will be positively correlated with
      prostate cancer by prostatectomy tissue step-section analysis. DCFBC uptake at sites of
      suspected metastatic disease will be compared to conventional imaging modalities (CT, bone
      scan) and biopsy results when available. In addition, DCFBC-PET uptake quantification will be
      compared with expression levels of PSMA and other prostate cancer relevant markers (PSA,
      Ki-67, TMPRSS2-ERG) by prostate tissue immunohistochemistry analysis and compared with
      clinical prognostic markers (PSA, Gleason score, clinical stage, Partin tables derived
      prediction of pathologic stage).
