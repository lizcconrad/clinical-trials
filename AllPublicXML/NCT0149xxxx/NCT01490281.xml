      Background The Al-Andalus physical activity intervention study is a randomised control trial
      to investigate the effectiveness of a land- and water-based exercise intervention for
      reducing the overall impact of fibromyalgia (primary outcome), and for improving tenderness
      and pain-related measures, body composition, functional capacity, physical activity and
      sedentary behaviour, fatigue, sleep quality, health-related quality of life, and cognitive
      function (secondary outcomes) in women with fibromyalgia.

      Methods One hundred eighty women with fibromyalgia (age range: 35-65 years) will be recruited
      from local associations of fibromyalgia patients in Andaluc√≠a (Southern Spain). Patients will
      be randomly assigned to a usual care (control) group (n=60), a water-based exercise
      intervention group (n=60) or a land-based exercise intervention group (n=60). Participants in
      the usual care group will receive general physical activity guidelines and participants
      allocated in the intervention groups will attend three non-consecutive training sessions (60
      minutes each) per week during 24 weeks. Both exercise interventions will consist of aerobic,
      muscular strength and flexibility exercises.

      Discussion The investigators study attempts to reduce the impact of fibromyalgia and improve
      patients' health status by implementing two types of exercise interventions. Results from
      this study will help to assess the efficacy of exercise interventions for the treatment of
      fibromyalgia. If the interventions would be effective, this study will provide low-cost and
      feasible alternatives for health professionals in the management of fibromyalgia. Results
      from the Al-Andalus physical activity intervention will help to better understand the
      potential of regular physical activity for improving the well-being of women with
      fibromyalgia.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall impact of fibromyalgia</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed over 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be assessed with the fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). FIQ is a self-administered questionnaire, comprising 10 subscales of disabilities and symptoms (physical function, work missed day, job ability, feel good, pain, fatigue, sleep, stiffness, anxiety and depression) and has been validated for Spanish fibromyalgia patients. The total scores range from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating greater effect of the condition on the person's life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tenderness</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed over 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A total of 18 tender points will be assessed according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria for classification of fibromyalgia using a standard pressure algometer (FPK 20; Effegi, Alfonsine, Italy). The tender point count, total count of positive tender points, will be recorded for each participant. The algometer score will be calculated as the sum of the minimum pain-pressure values obtained for each tender point.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual analogic scale for pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed over 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analogic scale for pain. This is a simple assessment tool consisting of a 10 cm line with 0 on one end, representing no pain, and 10 on the other, representing the worst pain ever experienced, which a patient marks to indicate the severity of her pain in the present moment. This scale will also be administered before and after each session during the intervention, to assess the acute effect of exercise on pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed over 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It assesses three factors: rumination, magnification and helplessness associated to pain. It includes 13 items measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time). Higher scores indicate a greater tendency to catastrophize pain symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body composition</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed over 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Weight and height will be measured, body mass index [weight (kg)/height(m2)] will be calculated, and skeletal muscle mass, total body water and fat free mass will be estimated with bioelectrical impedance analysis (InBody R20; Biospace, Gateshead, UK).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed over 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' functional capacity will be assessed by field-based fitness tests following the standardised Functional Senior Fitness Test Battery</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed over 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory will be used to measure fatigue severity, and comprises five subscales: general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced activity, and reduced motivation.</description>

    <measure>Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed over 24 weeks</time_frame>
