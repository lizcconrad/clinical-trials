      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JNS020QD in patients with
      moderate to severe chronic pain who switched from opioid analgesics, as well as the safety
      and efficacy of long-term treatment (52 weeks) after switching to JNS020QD.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JNS020QD in
      patients with moderate to severe chronic pain who are switching from opioid analgesics. It
      will also evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment (52 weeks) after switching
      to JNS020QD. The study will enroll patients with moderate to severe chronic pain which is
      adequately controlled with a regular treatment with an opioid analgesic agent other than the
      study drug because these patients are considered appropriate to investigate the conversion
      ratio in switching from JNS020QD to other opioid analgesics, and to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of the study drug. This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the
      intervention), uncontrolled (the study does not involve a control treatment), multicenter
      study. This study consists of Screening period (1 to 2 weeks), Period I (3-week titration
      period+ 1-week maintenance period), Period II (48 weeks long-term treatment period), tapering
      period (if required, 0 to 6 weeks), and follow-up period (1 week). JNS020QD is a transdermal
      system in which fentanyl base is incorporated directly into a single layer of
      pressure-sensitive high polymerized adhesive, and is changed once a day (every 24 hours).
      JNS020QD is available in 5 formulations containing fentanyl 0.84 mg, 1.7 mg, 3.4 mg, 5 mg, or
      6.7 mg per system.. The study drug patch will be applied to the breast, abdomen, upper arm,
      femoral region, etc. exchanged daily and for consecutive 52 weeks.

    <description>During weeks 1-3, initial doses of 0.84 mg, 1.7 mg, 3.4 mg, or 5 mg can be increased until individual optimal dose (up to maximum 20.1 mg) is determined. The optimal dose will be administered during the maintenance period (1 week), followed by a long-term treatment (48 weeks) period, where the dose will be adjusted (escalated or reduced) in consideration of the efficacy of the study, and the condition of adverse events. The patches are applied on the skin and exchanged daily (every 24 hours) for consecutive 52 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic pain that requires opioid analgesics and that has persisted for 12 weeks or
             longer before giving the consent

          -  Patients who received any of the following opioid analgesics at a stable dose for the
             treatment of chronic pain for 7 days or longer before giving the consent (excluding
             rescue dose): oral codeine phosphate; oral morphine hydrochloride; fentanyl
             transdermal; combination tablet of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen;
             buprenorphine transdermal patch

          -  Patients who received 2 or less rescue doses per day during the 7 days before giving
             consent

          -  Patients whose mean pain intensity throughout the day of giving the consent is 45 mm
             or less on the visual analogue scale (VAS)

          -  Male and female patients surgically sterile, abstinent, or practicing an effective

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other painful conditions which may interfere with the efficacy evaluation (eg bone
             fracture, rheumatoid arthritis)

          -  Major surgery within 30 days before screening, or not fully recovered from surgery, or
