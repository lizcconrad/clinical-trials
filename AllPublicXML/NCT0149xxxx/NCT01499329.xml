      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and performance of the balloon-expandable
      Zeus CC (Rontis AG) stent for the treatment of Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC)
      A, B, C and D iliac lesions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is older than 18 years

          2. Patient must sign a written informed consent form that is approved by the ethics
             committee prior to index-procedure

          3. Patient must be compliant with all follow-up visits

          4. Patient suffers from intermittent claudication (Rutherford 1-3) or critical limb
             ischemia (Rutherford 4 and 5)

          5. Patient's life expectancy is more than 2 years

          6. Patient has iliac atherosclerotic de novo lesion(s) type A, B, C &amp; D according to
             TASC-II classification

          7. Target vessel diameter is between 5 and 9 mm

          8. Target lesion has a baseline diameter stenosis of more than 50%

          9. Patient has sufficient infra-inguinal run-off with at least a patent common femoral
             artery and deep femoral artery (both &lt;50% stenosis)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has a life expectancy of less than 2 years

          2. Patient is refusing to be compliant with all follow-up visits

          3. Patient suffers from acute limb ischemia, defined as any sudden decrease in limb
             perfusion causing a potential threat to limb viability.

          4. Patient is intolerant to anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin,
             heparin, clopidogrel or ticlopidine drug therapy

          5. Patient has already been treated with a stent in the ipsilateral target vessel

          6. Patient suffered tissue loss in the target extremities, defined as Rutherford 6

          7. Patient is already enrolled in this or another investigational device study

          8. Patient had a coronary intervention within the last 60 days before enrolment into this
             study or there is a planned coronary intervention within 60 days of enrolment into
             this study

          9. Use of alternative therapy (e.g. atherectomy, cutting balloon, laser, radiation
             therapy) as part of the index-procedure

         10. Any planned surgical intervention within 30 days of the index-procedure

         11. Patient has an abdominal aortic aneurysm that is likely to require repair within the
             next 2 years.

         12. Patient has no sufficient infra-inguinal run-off (&gt;50% stenosis). Patient inclusion is
             only possible if revascularization (endovascular or surgical) is performed in the same
             procedure with a peroperative angiographic control yielding &lt;30% stenosis.

         13. Target lesion is a restenotic lesion.

         14. Target lesion is adjacent an aneurysm.

         15. Target vessel perforation with documented contrast extravasation during
             index-procedure prior to stent placement.
