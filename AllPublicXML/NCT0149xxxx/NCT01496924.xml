  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an association between increased risk of oropharyngeal dysphagia and artificial
      ventilation through endotracheal tube, followed by tracheostomy. The aim of the present study
      is to analyze the outcomes of an early swallowing rehabilitation program of dysphagic
      tracheostomized patients under mechanical ventilation at the intensive care unit.

    <textblock>
      This prospective study will be conduct in seven intensive care units of the university public
      hospital Inclusion criteria are: patients under mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy for
      at least 48 hours, appropriate level of consciousness (Glasgow coma scale ≥ 11), hemodynamic
      stability without need for vasoactive drugs; minimum mechanical ventilation parameters
      characterized by: pressure support ventilation (PSV) ≤ 20 cm H2O, positive end-expiratory
      pressure (PEEP) ≤ 8 cm H2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ≤ 50 and respiratory rate ≤ 30
      inspirations per minute. Primary exclusion criteria are: patients who underwent surgery with
      resection of structures of oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and/or esophagus; nasal fracture or
      skull base fracture preventing otorhinolaryngological exam; possible surgical treatment after
      ICU admission with no reasonable time for carrying out the planned intervention; degenerative
      diseases characterized by outbreaks and remissions; past history of oropharyngeal dysphagia,
      previous speech therapy, excessive amount of thick tracheal secretion requiring frequent
      tracheal suctioning, end-stage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tracheoesophageal
      fistula, allergy to dyes, and low survival expectancy.

      The study consist of three stages: (1) sample selection with a test of the speaking valve and
      initial assessments, (2) swallowing rehabilitation and (3) post-treatment reassessments.
      Clinical assessments will be performed by speech-pathologists and otorhinolaryngologists with
      patients under mechanical ventilation. Subsequently, patients with dysphagia will be
      submitted to a rehabilitation program with standardized intervention, followed by a new
      assessment of abnormalities. The efficacy of swallowing treatment will be assessed by
      comparing the scores before and after treatment. Paired Student's test or Wilcoxon-test will
      be applied, according to data distribution. Categorical variables will be expressed as number
      and percentage and analyzed through McNemar test. All p-values will be two-sided and a
      p-value &lt; 0.05 considered statistically significant.
