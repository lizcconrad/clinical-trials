  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Organs of the gastrointestinal tract include the mouth, throat, stomach, intestines, and
      anus. Patients with scleroderma often have GIT disorders. GIT disorders can be severely
      debilitating and even life-threatening. Some problems associated with GIT disorders may
      include heartburn, loss of voice or hoarseness, ulcers (open sores), difficulty swallowing,
      constipation, diarrhea, malabsorption (impaired absorption of nutrients from the GI tract),
      diminished peristalsis (decreased in the wavelike motion in the muscles of the intestines),
      and the inability to control your bowel movements.

      Probiotics are the &quot;good bacteria&quot; normally found in your digestive tract. Our group is
      looking at whether or not taking daily probiotics (lactobacillus) can help alleviate some of
      these symptoms in scleroderma patients that have GIT disorders.
