    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a treat-to-range automated insulin management system
      using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and subcutaneous insulin pump infusion in
      individuals with type 1 diabetes.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a closed-loop
      &quot;treat-to-range&quot; (TTR) system in an inpatient clinical research center setting. The TTR
      system only effects insulin delivery when the glucose is projected to be above or below
      specified target ranges. These initial studies will assess the safety of this algorithm
      (mathematical equation) under the extreme conditions of a missed meal insulin bolus and meal
      over-insulinization. This is a &quot;hybrid&quot; system, which allows the research team to deliver
      insulin boluses manually with the TTR controller only becoming active when blood glucose
      levels are projected to be out of the specified range.

    <description>Subjects will arrive in the morning and the TTR controller (Medtronic) will be initialized, and then they will give their usual premeal insulin bolus for breakfast. At lunch, they will either have a low glycemic index meal or a high glycemic index meal and the meal bolus will be omitted. The device will be turned off before dinner, they will have their usual insulin bolus for dinner, eat dinner, and then be discharged to home. On another admission, they will receive an insulin dose before lunch which will be 120% of their usual insulin bolus.</description>

          <description>The intervention will consist of using the TTR controller (Medtronic) for post-prandial glucose control following high and low glycemic meals
TTR controller (Medtronic): Subjects will arrive in the morning and the TTR controller (Medtronic) will be initialized, and then they will give their usual premeal insulin bolus for breakfast. At lunch, they will either have a low glycemic index meal or a high glycemic index meal and the meal bolus will be omitted. The device will be turned off before dinner, they will have their usual insulin bolus for dinner, eat dinner, and then be discharged to home. On another admission, they will receive an insulin dose before lunch which will be 120% of their usual insulin bolus.</description>
