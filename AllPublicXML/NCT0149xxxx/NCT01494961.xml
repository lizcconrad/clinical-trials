    <textblock>
      ANRS 12127 Prenahtest is an intervention trial conducted in four countries (Cameroon,
      Dominican Republic, Georgia and India), where pregnant women are randomized during prenatal
      care to receive either standard post-test HIV counseling, or an innovative intervention
      called couple-oriented post-test HIV counseling (COC).

      The aim of the COC intervention is to empower women to communicate with her male partner
      about HIV, and HIV testing in particular, and encourage him to return for HIV testing and/or
      couple HIV counseling (where both couple members are counseled together).

      Prenahtest is the first randomised trial testing a prenatal intervention to increase partner
      HIV testing.

    <description>COC is an individual behavioural intervention, strengthening standard post-test HIV counselling delivered to pregnant women after prenatal HIV testing. COC was based on the assumption that developing women's communication skills and self-efficacy during HIV counselling would enable them to discuss HIV and sexual issues with their partners, and yield tangible effects on partner HIV testing. The structure of the COC intervention was adapted from a WHO PMTCT counselling manual and was described in a COC manual, which was used to train the COC counsellors and could also be used during the counselling session. Tested during the pilot phase of the trial, COC was shown to be feasible and acceptable in the four study sites.</description>
