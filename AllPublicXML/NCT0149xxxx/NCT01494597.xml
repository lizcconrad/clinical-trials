    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of multiple doses of isavuconazole on the
      pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine in healthy adult subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled to receive a single dose of cyclosporine on Day 1 followed by a
      10-day wash-out period (time from cyclosporine dosing to isavuconazole dosing). On Days 11
      and 12, isavuconazole will be dosed three times daily (TID). On Days 13 through 18,
      isavuconazole will be administered once daily (QD). All subjects will be administered a
      single dose of cyclosporine on Day 15. Subjects will be confined in the study center from Day
      -1 until Day 5 and from Day 10 until Day 19.

      A follow up visit will be scheduled approximately 7 ± 2 days after final dosing of
      isavuconazole.

      Blood and urine samples will be taken at various times during the study.
