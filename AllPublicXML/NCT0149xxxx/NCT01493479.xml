  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      90Y Ibritumomab tiuxetan (zevalin) has demonstrated consistently high response rates in
      patients who have received previous treatment for lymphoma. More than two-thirds of the
      patients who achieve CR go on to experience durable remissions lasting for years. Despite
      these highly promising clinical results with radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in relapsed follicular
      lymphoma there is very little data using RIT in previously untreated follicular lymphoma. The
      objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two fractions of Zevalin in
      patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma in a Phase II study.

    <description>All patients receive 2 x iv infusions of 250 mg/m2 Rituximab given 7-8 days apart prior to each zevalin infusion. The 2nd rituximab infusion is given immediately prior to Zevalin.
In addition patients with greater than 20% bone marrow involvement at screening receive rituximab pretreatment prior to entering the main treatment phase of the trial, consisting of 4 x weekly iv doses of rituximab(375 mg/m2). This is followed by a repeat bone marrow biopsy, bone marrow involvement must have fallen to &lt;= 20% to enter the main treatment phase of the trial.</description>
