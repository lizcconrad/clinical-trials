  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 clinical trial randomizes patients with BRAF mutant melanoma to either (1)
      standard of care (SOC) - BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in combination with MEK inhibitor
      cobimetinib; or, (2) SOC plus bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody that suppresses new blood
      vessel formation and can stimulate the immune system. Previous clinical studies in melanoma
      have shown that bevacizumab may improve clinical benefit (progression free survival) if
      combined with ipilimumab or abraxane. Preclinical studies suggest that VEGF increase plays a
      role in resistance to BRAF inhibitors. This randomized study will ask whether the addition of
      bevacizumab to targeted therapy SOC in BRAF mutant melanoma can improve response rates and
      clinical benefit. Patients may have received no therapy for advanced disease or up to 2 prior
      therapies, excluding BRAF and MEK inhibitors.

      In this study, the drugs being used are vemurafenib, cobimetinib, and bevacizumab.
      Vemurafenib has been approved by the FDA for treatment of patients with advanced melanoma
      that harbors a BRAF mutation. However, vemurafenib in combination with cobimetinib has not
      been approved by the FDA for the treatment of cancer. Bevacizumab has been approved by the
      FDA for use in combination with first line chemotherapies for treatment of patients with
      colorectal, breast and lung cancer. Bevacizumab has not been approved for use in patients
      with metastatic melanoma.

      Vemurafenib and cobimetinib attack different proteins that cause cancer cells to grow.
      Vemurafenib works by blocking a protein called B-RAF. Researchers have found that a large
      number of melanomas have mutations (changes) in the BRAF gene. The BRAF gene codes for a
      protein called B-RAF, which is involved in sending signals in cells that can lead to cell
      growth. Research has determined that mutations in the BRAF gene at the V600 position cause a
      change in the B-RAF protein that can drive the growth and spread of melanoma cells.
      Vemurafenib works by preventing these altered B-RAF proteins from working, and thereby may
      block the growth and spread of cancer cells in patients with melanoma. Cobimetinib works by
      blocking a protein called MEK. MEK has been known to promote growth in cancer that carries
      either a mutation in the BRAF or KRAS genes. The vemurafenib/cobimetinib combination has been
      used in prior clinical studies. Information from those other research studies suggests that
      these drugs can shrink melanoma tumors in the majority of patients and slow tumor growth as
      compared to standard chemotherapy. Another drug to block the BRAF and MEK proteins was
      recently approved by the FDA in the treatment of patients with B-RAFV600 mutant melanoma. The
      researchers want to see if using vemurafenib and cobimetinib together will work in a similar
      way to treat malignant melanoma.

      Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (a type of protein that is normally made by
      the immune system to help defend the body from infection and cancer) produced by using
      recombinant DNA technology. Bevacizumab is an antibody directed against vascular endothelial
      growth factor or VEGF. VEGF is a potent, specific growth factor with a well-defined role in
      normal and abnormal blood vessel formation. It is present in a wide variety of normal
      tissues, but is produced in excess by most solid cancers (tumors). In the setting of cancer,
      VEGF promotes the growth of blood vessels that bring nutrients to tumor cells. Its expression
      by the tumor has been associated with worse outcome in patients with a number of tumors types
      including melanoma. In laboratory experiments, bevacizumab inhibits the growth of several
      different types of human cancer cells by blocking the effects of VEGF.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine the effectiveness of using the study drugs
      vemurafenib, cobimetinib, and bevacizumab together relative to vemurafenib and cobimetinib
      alone. This study will investigate whether using both study drugs lengthens the amount of
      time before participants' melanoma worsens, increases the number of people whose melanoma
      responds to treatment and what the side effects are of using the drugs together rather than
      separately.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histological or cytological confirmed melanoma that is metastatic
             or unresectable stage IIIc and clearly progressive.

          2. Patients must have melanoma that is documented to contain a BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K
             mutation by a FDA-approved test.

          3. Age &gt;= 18 years.

          4. Women must not be pregnant due to the fact that the effects of vemurafenib,
             cobimetinib, and/or bevacizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
             reason and because antiangiogenic agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in
             this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence; defined in Appendix G) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant while participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately.

          5. All females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within 2
             weeks prior to registration to rule out pregnancy. A female of childbearing potential
             is any woman, regardless of sexual orientation or whether they have undergone tubal
             ligation, who meets the following criteria: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or
             bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24
             consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive
             months).

          6. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with bevacizumab, cobimetinib, and vemurafenib,
             female participants who are breastfeeding must agree to discontinue nursing prior to
             Day 1 of the study.

          7. Patients must have measurable disease as defined in Section 10.1 (cutaneous lesions
             measuring at least 1 cm will be considered measurable). Baseline CT or MRI scans of
             measurable disease sites must be performed within 4 weeks of study entry.

          8. Patients must have discontinued immunotherapy or other systemic therapy including
             investigational agents at least 4 weeks prior to entering the study and have recovered
             from adverse events due to those agents. Patients must agree to not receive any other
             investigational agents during study participation.

          9. Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

         10. Patients must have the following baseline laboratory values:

               1. White Blood Count &gt; 3,000/mm3

               3. Platelet Count &gt; 100,000/mm3

               4. Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or serum creatinine
                  clearance (CrCl)&gt; 40ml/min (CrCl= Wt (kg) x (140-age)*/72 x Cr. level, *female x
                  0.85)

               5. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) / alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 3 x ULN (&lt; 5
                  x ULN for patients with documented liver metastases)

             informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients may not have received more than 2 prior systemic treatment regimens for
             distant metastatic disease. The following prior therapy is permitted in either the

         10. Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with bone marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with bevacizumab, vemurafenib and cobimetinib.
