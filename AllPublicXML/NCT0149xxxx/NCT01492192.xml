  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to look at 2 new methods of scanning and see
      whether they can help researchers predict which tumours will respond to drugs that attack
      tumour blood supply.

    <description>Fluciclatide (GE Healthcare) (AH111585) is a small cyclic peptide containing the RGD tripeptide (figure 1), which preferentially binds with high affinity to α¬vβ3 integrins that are up-regulated in angiogenesis.
The IMP is supplied as a solution for injection, 400 MBq at the reference date and time. Participants will receive one injection of the imaging agent at this dose on 3 occasions</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients should have advanced or metastatic RCC confirmed by histological diagnosis

          2. Patients considered suitable for therapy with TKI for RCC according to responsible
             clinician

          3. Measurable tumour according to RECIST v1.1 criteria

          4. Standard staging CT scan performed within 28 days of first research scan

          5. The patient has not received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery or any other
             treatment against cancer within 4 weeks prior to recruitment

          6. Age ≥18 years

          7. Adequate renal function (creatinine &lt;1.25xULN)

          8. Patient is able to tolerate and comply with scanning procedure

          9. Patient is not lactating or pregnant

         10. Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition which
             in the opinion of the Investigator may potentially hamper compliance with the study
             protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions should be discussed with the patient
             before registration in the trial

         11. Able and willing to give informed consent
