      The main purpose of the protocol is to collect and evaluate performance data after patients
      undergoing various interventional endoscopy procedures performed at H. H. Chao Comprehensive
      Digestive Disease Center (CDDC).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In general, the outcome data includes clinical management, hospitalization, and
      complications; to determine costs associated with endoscopy procedures; to determine
      performance data including technical success, procedure time, rate of repeat interventions;
      to compare endoscopy performance and outcome data collected at University of California,
      Irvine (UCI) and results from other institutions previously published in the literature.
      Additional parameters might be collected for specific interventional endoscopy procedures.
