  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study describing the real-life antipsychotic treatment during the
      hospitalisation of the patients due to acute psychotic episode.

      In this NIS subject's data will be collected at one visit at the moment of discharge from the
      hospital.

      The results of the study would help to characterise the discrepancy between current clinical
      practice and treatment guidelines, indicating that atypical antipsychotics are preferable and
      should be used in monotherapy during acute psychotic episodes in subjects with schizophrenia.
      Available evidence have revealed a frequent use of first-generation antipsychotics,
      polypharmacy, intramuscular route of administration and use of atypical antipsychotics in
      doses lower than recommended in registered summary of product characteristics.
