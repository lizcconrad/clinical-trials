  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of
      DS-5565 compared to placebo (inactive substance) and pregabalin in diabetic subjects with
      DPN.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) affects up to 50% of patients who have diabetes for at
      least 25 years. Up to 26% of all patients with DPN experience neuropathic pain. DPN pain
      contributes to sleep disorders, depression, and anxiety, which together may have an impact on
      a patient's well-being and quality of life.

      There are currently several drugs used to treat painful DPN. For example, Lyrica®
      (pregabalin) is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat
      neuropathic pain associated with DPN and is commonly prescribed. The dosage of the
      FDA-approved drugs is limited by side-effects such as dizziness, sleepiness, weight gain and
      swelling of the hands, legs, and feet. As a result, many patients suffering from DPN pain do
      not get satisfactory pain relief.

             associated with DPN

         14. Skin conditions that could alter sensation

             to DPN

         16. Abuse of prescription medications, street drugs or alcohol (including alcohol
             dependence) within the last 1 year
