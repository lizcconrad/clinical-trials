      Combining nimotuzumab to gefitinib may not only potentiate cellular cytotoxicity, but may
      also assist in overcoming inherent or acquired resistance to gefitinib alone.

    <textblock>
      Reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as gefitinib, were shown to be
      effective in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, patients almost
      invariably develop resistance to TKIs and have disease progression. Nimotuzumab is a
      humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the EGFR.

      Combining nimotuzumab to gefitinib may not only potentiate cellular cytotoxicity, but may
      also assist in overcoming inherent or acquired resistance to gefitinib alone.
