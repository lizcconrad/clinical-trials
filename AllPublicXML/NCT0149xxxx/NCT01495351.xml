  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of PARP inhibitor (ABT-888) with a proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib) have
      demonstrated significant anti-myeloma effects in preclinical lab and animal studies. The goal
      of this phase I trial is to evaluate in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma
      the safety, toxicity profile and tolerability of ABT-888 (Veliparib) administered on a
      schedule including twice daily oral dosing for 14 days followed by 1 week rest in combination
      with standard dosing of Bortezomib.

      This is a dose-finding / dose escalation phase I trial of ABT-888 (Veliparib) in combination
      with Bortezomib and Dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
      ABT-888 is given orally (PO) twice daily (every 12 hours) for 14 days in a 21 days cycle.

      First dose to be given within 1 hour of Bortezomib on day 1. Planned starting dose is 20 mg
      PO every 12 hours. Starting dose escalation is planned until an MTD is reached.

    <measure>Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ABT-888.</measure>
    <time_frame>21 Day Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>Study follows a modified dose escalation scheme with a 3+3 design (3 to 6 patients per dose level or cohort). Only the ABT-888 dose will be escalated with a maximum dose of ABT-888 of 100 mg PO BID. If &gt;1 out 6 patients at any dose level suffer dose limiting toxicity, then dose escalation is stopped, and this dose is declared as MTD. 3 additional patients will be entered at the next lowest dose level. The recommended phase 2 dose is defined as the dose level with ≤ 1 out of 6 patients experiencing DLTs at the highest dose level below the MTD.</description>

    <time_frame>21 Day Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>All adverse events, including DLTs, are graded according to the NCI CTCAE, v4.0. A DLT is defined as any grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity, or any grade 4 hematologic toxicity, considered by the investigator to be related to the study drugs and occurring during Days 1-22 of Cycle 1.</description>

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Gene expression profiling is performed at baseline and compared between responders versus non-responders in order to identify a &quot;treatment response signature&quot;. 2.5 mg of RNA will be extracted from plasma cells sorted from pre-treatment (D1, cycle 1) (n=20) and post-treatment (D11, cycle 1) (n=20) bone marrow aspirates collected from patients treated in the extension cohort. cRNAs will be hybridized onto the U133 Plus 2.0 gene chips and raw data files acquired using Affymetrix Microarray Suite version 5.1 software and analyzed with the Partek Genomics Suite v6.4.</description>

    <description>Poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) levels are measured in sorted CD138+ plasma cells from pre-ABT-888 treatment on day 1 cycle1, as well as post ABT-888 treatment (within 4-6 hours) on days 4 and 11. PAR levels will be measured by standardized ELISA assays (HT PARP in vivo Pharmacodynamic Assay II™, Trevigen).</description>
