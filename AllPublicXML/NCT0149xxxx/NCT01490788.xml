  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very low dose (VLD) cyclobenzaprine at bedtime has shown promise as a treatment for
      fibromyalgia, but the chemistry of cyclobenzaprine requires new formulation technology for
      bedtime use. The present trial is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of TNX-102
      2.4 mg (a new formulation of cyclobenzaprine designed to result in increased dosage precision
      and decreased potential for morning grogginess) and to compare the bio-availability of
      TNX-102 2.4 mg and cyclobenzaprine 5 mg tablets under fasting or fed conditions.

      Very low dose (VLD) cyclobenzaprine at bedtime has shown promise as a treatment for
      fibromyalgia, but the chemistry of cyclobenzaprine requires new formulation technology for
      bedtime use. Employing a proprietary mixture of approved lipids with cyclobenzaprine,
      TNX-102, is designed to provide predictable absorption of cyclobenzaprine and to result in
      increased dosage precision and decreased potential for morning grogginess.

      As a first step in the development of TNX-102 in the treatment of fibromyalgia, the present
      single-center, randomized, open-label, single-dose, three-way-crossover trial is designed to
      assess the safety and tolerability of TNX-102 2.4 mg (a dose based on the results of a
      previous Phase 2a, proof-of-concept study - VPI-CY-0001.1) and to compare the rate and extent
      of absorption of TNX-102 2.4 mg and cyclobenzaprine 5 mg tablets under fasting or fed
      conditions.
