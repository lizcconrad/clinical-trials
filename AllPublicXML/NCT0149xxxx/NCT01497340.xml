  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the evolution of the infant's weight before delayed cord clamping (2 minutes after
      birth) as an indirect measure of the volume of placental transfusion in a group of healthy
      and fullterm newborns, placed at the level of the introitus versus another group placed on
      the abdomen of the mother.

    <textblock>
      Pilot study. Randomized controlled trial not blind, in one center. Informed consent will be
      obtained during pregnancy or admittance and previous to birth.

      Hypothesis: Placing the infant on the maternal abdomen without cord clamping during the first
      2 minutes after birth does not change significantly the transfusion volume as compared to
      infants whose cord is clamped after 2 minutes but who are placed at the level of the
      introitus

      Term newborns by vaginal delivery and without complications with cord clamping at 2 minutes
      after birth. Weight differences will be evaluated when positioning the infant at the level of
      the introitus or on the maternal abdominal-thoracic level (at or over placental level).

      Study subjects will be assigned to two groups, both with delayed clamping,according to a
      sequence of random numbers generated by computer. The assignment will be done through opaque,
      sealed, easy opening envelopes, opening the envelope at the moment the mother enters the
      delivery room. Both parents and obstetric group will be then informed about which group the
      infant will be assigned to.

      In both groups: The newborn will be immediately placed on a scale, previously set at the
      level of the maternal introitus to record his/her weight.

      Group 1: Clamping at level of introitus: The infant will be held by the neonatologist at
      introitus level,immediately after the initial weight Group 2: Clamping on Maternal Abdomen:
      The newborn will be placed on the abdomen of the mother immediately after the first weight
      measurement.

      In both groups:A plastic clamp will be put at approximately 1cm from the cutaneous insertion
      of the umbilical cord at 120 seconds after birth and then a new Weight will be obteined after
      clamping.
