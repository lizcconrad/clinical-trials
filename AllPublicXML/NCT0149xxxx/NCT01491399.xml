        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Cervical disc disease defined as: intractable radiculopathy and/or myelopathy with at
             least one of the following items producing symptomatic nerve root and/or spinal cord
             compression which is documented by diagnostic imaging procedures:

               -  herniated disc;

               -  osteophyte formation;

               -  decreased disc height;

               -  thickening of ligamentous tissue;

             the planned date of spinal fusion surgery (e.g., steroids or methotrexate), excluding
             routine perioperative anti-inflammatory drugs.

         11. Has a history of autoimmune disease (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus or Dermatomyositis).

         14. Has received treatment with an investigational therapy within 28 days prior to
             implantation surgery or such treatment is planned during the 16 weeks following
             rhBMP-2/ACS implantation.

         15. Has received any previous exposure to any/all BMP's of either human or animal
             extraction.

         16. Has a history of allergy to bovine products or a history of anaphylaxis.

         17. Has history of endocrine or metabolic disorder known to affect osteogenesis (e.g.,
             Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy, Ehlers- Danlos syndrome, or osteogenesis
             imperfecta).

         18. Has a condition which requires postoperative medications that interfere with fusion,
             such as steroids, excluding routine perioperative anti-inflammatory drugs.
