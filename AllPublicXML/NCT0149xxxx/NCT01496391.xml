  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iodine-123 labelled ortho-Iodohippuric Acid ([I-123]-OIH) was used in the early 1970's as a
      kidney imaging agent or tracer that &quot;lights-up&quot; inside your body when scanned, but over the
      years its use has declined. The most commonly used tracer is Technetium-99m labelled
      Mercaptoacetyltriglycine ([Tc-99m]-Mertiatide or [Tc-99m]-MAG3). However, long-term shortages
      may threaten the supply of the radioactive substance Tc-99m in Canada and the world. As a
      result of such shortages, there is a need to identify other types of tracers that can be used
      for imaging. [I-123]-OIH may be an alternative.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the diagnostic performance characteristics of
      [I-123]-OIH in comparison to [Tc-99m]-MAG3.

      This study is being conducted to compare two imaging agents (tracers): [I-123]-OIH and
      [Tc-99m]-MAG3 using gamma camera imaging in participants with different levels of kidney
      function. Gamma camera imaging is a non-invasive nuclear scan that is used to look at organs
      and tissues inside the body. An imaging agent or tracer is a radioactive chemical
      intravenously injected into your body which lights up cells, tissues and organs. The study
      will evaluate the safety of a single injection of [I-123]-OIH and compare the imaging results
      and the calculated renal function values (using blood tests) to those of [Tc-99m]-MAG3 . 90
      participants are required to complete this study.

        Participants will be recruited from both healthy subjects (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/minute/1.73m^2)
        being assessed as potential renal donors and patients having suspected renal impairment
        (eGFR &lt;60 mL/minute/1.73m^2). Severity of disease will be determined based on estimated
        glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) derived from serum creatinine concentration.
