      Study Design:

      This is a single institution pilot study to recruit 4 patients with operable pancreatic
      cancer scheduled for a pancreatectomy and 4 age/sex matched normal controls. Both groups will
      receive a single oral dose of radiolabeled MelQx followed by serial blood draws over an 8
      hour period and urine collections over a 24 hour period. In addition, normal pancreatic
      tissue and normal small bowel tissue will be collected by Tissue Procurement from resected
      (waste) tissue at the time of pancreatectomy on the 4 pancreatic cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is not a therapeutic trial. It is an etiologic investigation of meat-borne carcinogens
      and possible role in pancreatic cancer.
