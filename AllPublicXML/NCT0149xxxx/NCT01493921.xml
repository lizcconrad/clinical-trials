      Studies of SR-T100 gel and its clinical relevance in the treatment of AK, providing adequate
      measured outcomes for skin lesion treatment. In addition to the high complete response rate
      (90.0%) as compared with the conventional therapy, the most significant result was that no
      undesirable side effects were associated with the use of SR-T100 gel. The result also shows
      approximately 80% of study subjects had a complete response in phase II clinical trial
      conducted in Taiwan; hence, result from our study model suggested SR-T100 gel offers
      beneficial therapeutic values in treatment of AK is harmless to the skin as well as high
      tolerance level displayed by majority of patients.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate a clinically significant outcome
      involving SR-T100 topical gel developed against skin lesions such as AK. Furthermore,
      evaluation of SR-T100 efficacy &amp; tolerability in treating AK lesions are developed as
      secondary objective in this clinical study. Patients with at least two clinically visible,
      discrete, non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic AK lesions on the arms, shoulder, chest, face
      and or scalp and at least one lesion of greater than or equal to 4mm in diameter within a
      total of 25 cm squared contiguous or non-contiguous treatment are expected to be enrolled.
      Candidate pool is then divided into two groups with random assignments of treatment group or
      placebo group. This randomization scheme will be generated by biostatistics and produced by a
      computer software program that incorporates a standard procedure for generating random
      probabilities. Study procedures include laboratory testings, analytical readings as well as
      clinical assessment practices for treatment efficacy and safety evaluations.
