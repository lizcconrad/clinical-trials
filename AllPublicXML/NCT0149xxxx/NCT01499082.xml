      Primary Objective:

        -  To compare the efficacy of insulin glargine new formulation and Lantus in terms of

           type 2 diabetes mellitus

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the efficacy of insulin glargine new formulation and Lantus in terms of
           occurrence of nocturnal Hypoglycemia

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With At Least One Severe and/or Confirmed Nocturnal Hypoglycemia From Start of Week 9 to Month 6 Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 9 Up to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Nocturnal hypoglycemia was hypoglycemia that occurred between 00:00 and 05:59 hours (clock time), regardless the participant was awake or woke up because of the event. Severe hypoglycemia was an event that required assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Confirmed hypoglycemia was an event associated with plasma glucose less than or equal to (&lt;=) 3.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) (70 milligram per deciliter [mg/dL]).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Pre-injection SMPG was measured within 30 minutes prior to the injection of the study drug. Average was assessed by the mean of at least 3 SMPG calculated over the 7 days preceding the assessment visit.</description>

    <measure>Change in Treatment Satisfaction Score Using The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQs) From Baseline to Month 6 Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>DTSQ is a validated measure to assess how satisfied participants with diabetes are with their treatment and how they perceive hyper- and hypoglycemia. It consists of 8 questions which are answered on a Likert scale from 0 to 6. DTSQ treatment satisfaction score is the sum of question 1 and 4-8 scores and ranges between 0 and 36, where higher scores indicate more treatment satisfaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Hypoglycemia (All and Nocturnal) Events From Baseline up to Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Hypoglycemia events were Severe hypoglycemia (an event that required assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions); Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (typical symptoms of hypoglycemia with plasma glucose level of &lt;=3.9 mmol/L [70 mg/dL]); Asymptomatic hypoglycemia (no typical symptoms of hypoglycemia but plasma glucose level &lt;=3.9 mmol/L); Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia (an event during which symptoms of hypoglycemia were not accompanied by a plasma glucose determination, but was presumably caused by a plasma glucose level &lt;=3.9 mmol/L, symptoms treated with oral carbohydrate without a test of plasma glucose); Relative hypoglycemia (an event during which the person with diabetes reported any of the typical symptoms of hypoglycemia, and interpreted the symptoms as indicative of hypoglycemia, but plasma glucose level &gt;3.9 mmol/L); Severe and/or confirmed a hypoglycemia (plasma glucose &lt;=3.9 mmol/L).</description>

          <description>Nocturnal hypoglycemia was hypoglycemia that occurred between 00:00 and 05:59 hours (clock time), regardless the participant was awake or woke up because of the event. Severe hypoglycemia was an event that required assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Confirmed hypoglycemia was an event associated with plasma glucose less than or equal to (&lt;=) 3.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) (70 milligram per deciliter [mg/dL]).</description>

        <description>DTSQ is a validated measure to assess how satisfied participants with diabetes are with their treatment and how they perceive hyper- and hypoglycemia. It consists of 8 questions which are answered on a Likert scale from 0 to 6. DTSQ treatment satisfaction score is the sum of question 1 and 4-8 scores and ranges between 0 and 36, where higher scores indicate more treatment satisfaction.</description>
