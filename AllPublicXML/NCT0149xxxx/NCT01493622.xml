    <textblock>
      Immune-related disorders have been hypothesized as etiological factors in
      schizophrenia.Minocycline is a second-generation tetracycline that exerts anti-inflammatory
      and antimicrobial effects while having a distinct neuroprotective profile.This study was
      performed as a double-blind, placebocontrolled,randomized evaluation of Second generation
      antipsychotics(SGA) and minocycline versus SGA and placebo.
