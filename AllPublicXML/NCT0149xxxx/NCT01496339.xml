      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the treatment of human menstrual
      blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells which would be applied to diabetes patients is safe and
      effective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is chronic metabolic diease caused by absent or rejection insulin from
      pancreatic b cells.The traditional treatment strategies for diabetes are daily injections
      with insulin and transplantation of islets from cadaver. However, daily injuection is very
      inconvenient and there is a shortage of organs and life long immunosuppression. Therefore,
      such therapy can be offered to a very limited number of patients only. MSC-based therapeutic
      intervention has become an emerging strategy for the replacement of injured tissues. MSCs
      also have been noted to possess immunomodulatory effects in vivo. Thus, their potential for
      clinical use as a cell-based therapy should be focused and observation.
