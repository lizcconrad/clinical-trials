      Primary Objective:

      - To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of cabazitaxel by assessing objective tumor response
      rate (ORR) at the recommended dose (RD) when administered as a single agent every 3 weeks in
      patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma who have failed prior chemotherapy regimens

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the RD of cabazitaxel when administered as a single agent every 3 weeks

        -  To evaluate safety of cabazitaxel when administered as a single agent every 3 weeks

        -  To estimate the overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS)

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of cabazitaxel in part 1

      Patients will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient's
      refusal of further study treatment. All patients will be followed during and after the study
      treatment until death or the end of study, whichever comes first.
