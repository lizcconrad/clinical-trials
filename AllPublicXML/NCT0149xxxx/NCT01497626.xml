    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with an advanced type of cancer for which no curative treatment
      exists.

      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of the combination of the study
      drugs, lapatinib and bortezomib. Lapatinib is a drug that targets two proteins important for
      the growth of cancer cells known as HER1 (EGFR) and HER2. By inhibiting these proteins,
      lapatinib can inhibit cancer cell growth and even lead to their death. Lapatinib is an oral
      pill given by mouth once every day. Lapatinib is approved by the FDA for patients with breast
      cancer.

      Bortezomib is a drug that targets a part of cancer cells known as the proteosome. By
      inhibiting the proteosome, bortezomib can inhibit cancer cell growth and even lead to their
      death. Bortezomib is given intravenously, once a week, 2 out of every 3 weeks. Bortezomib is
      approved by the FDA for patients with multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma.

      This research is being done because it is not known if the combination of lapatinib and
      bortezomib will work better than lapatinib or bortezomib alone, although in the lab and in
      animal studies the combination of the two drugs was much more effective than either drug
      alone.

      As part of this study biopsies will be taken of patients' tumors before any treatment, after
      starting lapatinib alone, and after receiving both lapatinib and bortezomib. Investigators
      want to study what markers inside tumors may relate to how well these two medications work.
      These biopsies are required as part of the study.
