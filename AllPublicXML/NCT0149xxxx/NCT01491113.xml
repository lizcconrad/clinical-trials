      This is a human pharmacology, single-dose study to investigate the pharmacokinetics of orally
      administered Levetiracetam (LEV) in Japanese subjects with normal renal function and in
      Japanese subjects with various degrees of impaired renal function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the plasma and urine PK of Levetiracetam
      (ucb L059) and its metabolite (ucb L057) after a single dose of LEV 250 mg or LEV 500 mg in
      Japanese subjects with normal renal function and in Japanese subjects with various degrees of
      renal impairment.

Dialysis: 44 h to 48 h after the first dose (Day 3)
Dialysis: 92 h to 96 h after the first dose (Day 5)
Dialysis: 140 h after the first dose (Day 7)
Safety assessments and blood samplings were conducted until Day 7. Safety follow-up assessments were performed on Day 10.
Blood samples for Pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis: Predose (Baseline), and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 30, 44*, 44.25*, 44.5*, 45*, 46*, 47*, 48*, 49, 49.5, 50, 51, 53, 55, 57, 61, 73, 92, 96, 120, 140 hours post first dosing.
