    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetic dose escalation Phase II study of DFA-02 in patients undergoing colorectal
      surgery to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of DFA-02.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite antibiotic prophylaxis and improvements in surgical techniques, surgical site
      infections (SSI) still occur. DFA-02 is a novel bioresorbable modified release gel containing
      both gentamicin and vancomycin to be applied during surgical incision closure for the
      prevention of surgical site infections (SSIs) in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.

          3. BMI 25-40, inclusive;

          4. Scheduled to undergo nonemergent colorectal surgery involving a laparotomy incision of
             7 cm or greater (hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery is allowed). List of eligible
             procedures: left, right or transverse colectomy, segmental/sleeve left colon
             resection, total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis, total abdominal
             colectomy with ileostomy, total abdominal proctocolectomy, low anterior resection,
             sigmoid resection, non-emergent Hartmann's procedure, colotomy with polypectomy distal
             to hepatic flexure, colostomy takedown through laparotomy (not peristomal) incision,

             antibiotics or the excipients of the study products (soy bean products or sesame oil);

          2. Emergency surgery (urgent surgery is allowed if informed consent is obtained and the
             study procedures can be performed);

          3. Significant concomitant surgical procedure (Note: concomitant appendectomy,
             cholecystectomy, oophorectomy, and liver biopsy/wedge resection are allowed);

          4. Prior laparotomy within the last 60 days of this planned procedure;

          5. Planned second laparotomy or colorectal surgical procedure (e.g. colostomy or
             ileostomy takedown) within 30 days of this planned first procedure;

          6. Expectation that a surgical drain will be placed;

          7. Preoperative sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock;

          8. Abdominal wall infection/surgical site infection from previous laparotomy/laparoscopy
             or for any reason;

          9. Active systemic infection or systemic (oral or intravenous) antibiotic therapy within
             the 1 week prior to the date of surgery other than specified preoperative
             antimicrobial prophylaxis (Note: single dose antibiotic therapy for dental or other
             minor procedures is allowed as is the use of oral non-absorbable antibiotics for
             preoperative bowel decontamination);

         10. Requirement for gentamicin or vancomycin preoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis (Note:
             systemic antibiotic therapy within 72 hours after surgery with gentamicin or
             vancomycin must be avoided and any systemic antibiotic therapy during that time should
             be discussed with the Coordinating Center PI or Medical Monitor);

         11. Requirement for concomitant use or use during the 30 days prior to Day 1 of any
             prescription or OTC drug that would interfere with the study or place the patient at
             undue risk. Concurrent systemic or topical use of other potentially neurotoxic,
             nephrotoxic, and/or ototoxic drugs, such as gentamicin, cisplatin, cephaloridine,

             vancomycin, ethacrynic acid, furosemide, and viomycin, should be avoided;

             closure of the skin;

         13. Ongoing treatment (e.g. chemotherapy, radiation) for non-colorectal cancer;

         14. History of significant drug or alcohol abuse within the past year;

         18. Patients who are immunocompromised including but not limited to systemic
             corticosteroid use or chemotherapy/radiation during the 30 days prior to surgery,
             organ transplantation, or HIV infection (Note: inhaled corticosteroids are not
             exclusionary and single dose use of corticosteroids to prevent PONV is allowed.);

         19. Any clinically meaningful hearing loss (from Medical History);

         20. Clinically exclusionary results on clinical laboratory, ECG, or physical examination
             including but not limited to positive hepatitis B or C or HIV;

         21. Pregnant or lactating, or if of childbearing potential not practicing a birth control

         22. Refusal to accept medically indicated blood products;

         23. Participation within 30 days before the start of this study in any experimental drug
             or device study, or currently participating in a study in which the administration of
             investigational drug or device within 60 days is anticipated;

         24. Patients with anterior abdominal wall mesh that is not planned to be completely
             removed during the planned procedure;

         25. Unable to participate in the study for any reason in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator;

         26. Postsurgical life expectancy of less than 30 days, in the Investigator's or Sponsor's
             opinion;

         27. Expected discharge from the hospital less than 3 days after surgery.
