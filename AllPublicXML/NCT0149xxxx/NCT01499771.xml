    <textblock>
      This study assessed the relative bioavailability of 80 mg Atorvastatin Calcium Tablets
      (containing atorvastatin calcium equivalent to 80 mg atorvastatin) manufactured by OHM
      Laboratories, Inc., USA (A subsidiary of Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals., USA) compared to that of
      80 mg LIPITOR® Tablets (containing atorvastatin calcium equivalent to 80 mg atorvastatin)
      distributed by Parke Davis, Division of Pfizer Inc., USA following a single oral dose (1 x 80
      mg tablet) in healthy adult subjects when administered under fed conditions.

    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence,
      single-dose crossover bioequivalence study under fed conditions. The total duration of the
      study, screening through study exit, was approximately 8 weeks with at least a 14-day washout
      period between doses. At study check-in, the subjects reported to the clinical site at least
      36 hours prior to Day 1 dosing and were required to stay for 24 hours after Day 1 dosing.
      Blood sample collections were obtained within 90 minutes prior to dosing (0 hour) and after
      dose administration at 0.333, 0.667, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 8,
      10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 hours. A total of 25 blood samples were collected per
      study period for a total of 50 samples or 150 mL total volume.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Informed of the nature of the study, had agreed to, and was able to read, review, and
             sign the informed consent document prior to Period I dosing. The informed consent
             document was written in English, therefore the volunteer must have had the ability to
             read and communicate in English.

          2. Completed the screening process within four weeks prior to Period I dosing.

          3. Healthy male or female, 18 years of age or older at the time of dosing.

          4. Body mass index (BMI) between 18 - 32 kg/m2, inclusive, and weighed at least 110 lbs.

          5. Generally healthy as documented by medical history, physical examination (including
             but not limited to an evaluation of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory,
             and central nervous systems), vital sign assessments, 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory
             assessments, and by general observations. Any abnormalities/deviations from the
             acceptable range that might have been considered clinically relevant by the study
             physician or investigator were evaluated as individual cases, documented in study
             files, and agreed upon by the principal investigator (or sub-investigator) prior to
             enrolling the subject in this study.

          6. Female subjects were:

                  hysterectomy) or the Essure® Procedure].

        Fe Female subjects that were surgically sterile were to provide documentation of the

             clinical investigator(s).

          3. Clinical laboratory test values outside the accepted range and when confirmed on
             re-examination was deemed to be clinically significant.

          4. When confirmed upon additional testing, demonstrates a reactive screen for hepatitis B

             allergies.

          9. Reported a history of drug or alcohol addiction or abuse within the past year.

         10. Reported donating blood within 28 days prior to Period I dosing. All subjects were to
             be advised not to donate blood for four weeks after completing the study.

         11. Reported donating plasma (e.g. plasmapheresis) within 14 days prior to Period I
             dosing. All subjects were to be advised not to donate plasma for four 12. weeks after
             completing the study.

        13. Reported an intolerance of direct venipuncture. 14. Reported difficulty fasting or
        consuming standardized meals. 15. Reported difficulty swallowing tables or capsules whole.
        16. Pregnant, lactating, breastfeeding, or intended to become pregnant over the course of
