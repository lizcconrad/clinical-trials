  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to find the safe dose and best dosing schedule of olaparib to give
      in combination with cisplatin based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced
      head and neck cancer. The dose decided on in this part of the study will become the
      recommended dose for the randomised Phase II trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalating Phase I/II trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of the
      addition of olaparib to CRT in high risk locally advanced human papillomavirus (HPV) negative
      Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (HNSCC). A fixed dose of weekly cisplatin and
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) will be used, with doses of olaparib escalating
      for consecutive days and both dose level and duration will be increased through each cohort.

      This Phase I trial will assess how olaparib, a poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor is
      tolerated when added to standard chemoradiotherapy treatment.

      Patients will be recruited from sites in the UK only.

      A placebo controlled, randomised Phase II trial will follow once the recommended dose and
      schedule of olaparib has been established.
