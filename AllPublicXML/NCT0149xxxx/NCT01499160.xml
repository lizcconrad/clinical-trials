  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About a third of patients with breast cancer are usually treated by hormone pills called
      tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. Aromatase inhibitors are drugs that stop female hormone
      production. Female hormone or estrogen is an important hormone for the growth of breast
      cancer cells. Letrozole is one of the aromatase inhibitors that is approved by the FDA and
      has been used to treat breast cancer since 1997. However, hormone pills usually work for
      about 6-10 months in most patients. Later on, breast cancer will start to grow again. This
      condition when hormone pills or endocrine therapy no longer work is called &quot;endocrine
      resistant&quot; breast cancer. The scientists here at University of Maryland have discovered how
      these cancer cells can become resistant to hormone pills. In our laboratory tests, the
      investigators found that lapatinib and everolimus can reverse this resistance and make
      letrozole work again. However, it is not known if the drugs can reverse the resistance in
      humans.

      The purpose of this study is to find out whether the combination of letrozole, lapatinib, and
      everolimus is effective in women with breast cancer when hormone pills no longer work.

      Lapatinib is an anti-cancer drug that is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA). It is the standard of care for the treatment of a particular type of breast cancer
      called human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. HER2 is a
      protein involved in the growth of some cancer cells. This study will also include patients
      with HER2-negative breast cancer. This means that the cancer cells in these patients do not
      depend on the HER2 protein. The use of lapatinib in these patients is considered
      experimental.

      Everolimus is also an anti-cancer drug that is approved by the FDA for kidney cancer. Initial
      studies in mice and later studies in women with breast cancer have shown that everolimus may
      also slow the growth of breast cancer. The use of everolimus is experimental in this study.

      This is a single-institution clinical trial. Patients will be stratified according to the
      HER2 status:

      Group 1: HER2-positive in the tumor tissue Group 2: HER2 negative in the tumor tissue

      In the first part of the study, all of the patients will receive the combination of lapatinib
      1,500 mg/day and letrozole 2.5 mg/day. We do not expect any significant toxicity from this
      combination since the previous study of lapatinib and letrozole showed that this combination
      is safe with no grade 3-4 toxicities observed. Restaging scans (CT scan, MRI, or bone scan)
      will be obtained after every 12 weeks of treatment. In those patients who progress from any
      group, everolimus 5 mg/day will be added to letrozole and lapatinib will be reduced to 1,250
      mg/day as per the SWOG phase I study of lapatinib and everolimus. The outcome of each group
      will continue to be assessed separately. We do not expect to see additional serious toxicity
      from adding everolimus to the combination of lapatinib and letrozole. All of the treatment
      will be continued until disease progression.

Clinical benefit rate is defined as complete response+partial response+ stable disease. All participants will be treated with the combination of letrozole and lapatinib.

        <title>Clinical Benefit Rate of Patients Treated With the Combination of Letrozole and Lapatinib and Then After Progression, Treated With Everolimus, Letrozole and Lapatinib.</title>
        <description>Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progression, as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression.
Clinical benefit rate is defined as complete response+partial response+ stable disease. All participants will be treated with the combination of letrozole and lapatinib. Once the participant progresses on this regimen, the participant will be treated with everolimus, letrozole and lapatinib until they progress.</description>

In the first part of the study, all of the patients will receive the combination of lapatinib 1,500 mg/day and letrozole 2.5 mg/day. Restaging scans (CT scan, MRI, or bone scan) will be obtained after every 12 weeks of treatment. In those patients who progress from any group, everolimus 5 mg/day will be added to letrozole and lapatinib will be reduced to 1,250 mg/day as per the SWOG phase I study of lapatinib and everolimus.
letrozole: Drug is are to be taken orally. 2.5 mg once daily
lapatinib: Drug is to be taken orally. 1,500 mg once daily in the first part of the study and then 1,250 mg once daily in the second part of the study (after initial progression)
