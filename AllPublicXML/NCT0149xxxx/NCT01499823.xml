  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to assess whether a new method of quantifying
      therapy-associated hemodynamic alterations based on DCE MR imaging may help to distinguish
      pseudoprogression from true progression in patients with high grade glioma, who received
      CCRT.

    <textblock>
      Combination temozolomide and radiation significantly prolongs survival compared with
      radiation alone and has become standard treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Response
      assessment in GBM is difficult as a result of the frequent occurrence of early imaging
      changes indistinguishable from tumor progression, termed pseudoprogression. The majority of
      patients remain clinically stable. It is often unclear whether current therapy should be
      maintained or second-line therapy initiated. The incidence of pseudoprogression after
      concurrent chemoradiation is15%to 30%. A potential mechanism of pseudoprogression is that
      radiation-induced vascular changes may lead to focal transient increase in gadolinium
      enhancement. Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MR imaging provides a noninvasive means for
      quantifying tumor vascular properties.
