  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will develop, deliver and evaluate a solar powered tablet-based individual
      and group focused HIV/STI prevention intervention with internally displaced women in Leogane,
      Haiti. Internally displaced women will be trained as community health workers to deliver the
      HIV/STI prevention intervention to other internally displaced women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will develop and field test a multi-component intervention that includes (1) solar-powered
      tablets with brief video-based educational messages and (2) 6 weekly peer-group sessions. The
      tablet will be programmed to analyze the data and to indicate incorrect HIV knowledge
      responses so the community health worker can immediately provide correct responses. This
      intervention involves 6 weekly women's health meetings that will cover a variety of issues
      pertinent to women's sexual health: HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, interpersonal
      relationships, communication and decision making, mental health and coping, creating social
      change.
