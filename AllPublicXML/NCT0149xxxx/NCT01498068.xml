    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of
      telaprevir administered as 750 mg every 8 hours (q8h) in combination with pegylated
      interferon (Peg-IFN)-alfa-2a and ribavirin (RBV) in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced
      Russian participants with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all persons know the study drug assignment), multicenter study in
      treatment-naïve (participant did not receive any previous treatment for the treatment of
      hepatitis C) and treatment-experienced (participant did receive previous treatment for
      hepatitis C) Russian participants with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C. After a screening
      period of approximately 4 weeks, participants will be treated for 12 weeks with telaprevir
      750 mg every 8 hours in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV followed by 12 or 36 weeks
      of treatment with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV alone depending on their liver disease status,
      response to previous treatment and individual virologic response during treatment in this
      study. After the treatment period, there is a follow-up phase of at least 12 weeks.
