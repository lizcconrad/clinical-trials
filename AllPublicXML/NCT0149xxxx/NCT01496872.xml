  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two prominent osteopathic physician researchers have studied cranial somatic dysfunction in
      newborns. Dr Viola Frymann published a paper in 1966 on the presence of somatic dysfunction
      involving 1250 infants. Dr. Jane Carreiro evaluated 1600 newborns in 1993 for cranial somatic
      dysfunction. This observational study is intended to continue their work in exploring the
      presence of cranial somatic dysfunction in newborns. The hypothesis is that there is an
      increased incidence of somatic dysfunction in newborns birthed by primigravid women and in
      newborns who experienced a longer second stage of labor.

      100 newborns will be assessed for somatic dysfunction of the head, cervical, lumbar, and
      sacral areas. These findings will be compared to the findings of a standard newborn physical
      exam and the newborn and maternal history. These records will be reviewed for maternal age,
      parity, gravity, anesthesia during labor, and estimated gestational age. Birth history and
      initial newborn assessments will be reviewed for labor augmentation, duration of labor,
      length of second stage of labor, presence of instrumental delivery(vacuum extraction, forceps
      delivery, etc.), multiple birth, and presentation at delivery (breech, transverse, or
      compound presentation). The purpose of the study is to quantify the presence of somatic
      dysfunction in the newborn. We will assess any relationships between the identified somatic
      dysfunctions and factors present in the mother's and newborn's medical history.

    <time_frame>Newborns were examined between 6 an 72 hours postnatal</time_frame>
    <description>Healthy newborns ages 6 to 72 hours postnatal were physically examined and assessed for somatic dysfunction including asymmetry and motion restriction of the cranium, cervical, lumbar, and sacral regions. Total somatic dysfunction identified was summarized in a somatic dysfunction severity scale (SDSS) by assigning one point for each identified findings. SDSS could range from 0 (no somatic dysfunction) to 34 (all somatic dysfunctions assessed were present). Findings were compared to maternal, newborn, and delivery characteristics. Descriptive analyses and comparisons between the initial newborn assessment and research physical examination were performed.</description>
