      The main purpose of this study is to examine whether changes in biomarkers during exercise
      are related to coronary artery disease demonstrated by coronary angiography or
      echocardiography.

      Chest pain/discomfort is a common patient complaint in patients referred to outpatient
      clinics and emergency departments. The initial goal of evaluation is to exclude potential
      life threatening conditions like coronary artery disease. Exercise stress testing is a widely
      available non-invasive test in patients with chest pain and suspected coronary artery
      disease. However, the sensitivity and specificity of the test is relatively low. Exercise
      seems to cause an increase in the secretion of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and
      myocardial ischemia may lead to an even more pronounced increase. Investigators aim to
      examine whether changes in bloodborne biomarkers such as NT-pro-BNP during exercise may
      improve the accuracy of exercise stress testing in patients with chest pain/discomfort and a
      clinical suspicion of coronary artery disease. Also, investigators aim to examine whether
      changes in biomarkers during exercise are related to cardiac disease demonstrated by
      echocardiography.

      It is known that sudden heavy physical load can trigger myocardial infarction, especially in
      untrained individuals. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and may partly be
      related to changes in inflammation and haemostasis in patients with coronary artery disease.
      By measuring markers of inflammation and haemostasis during exercise stress testing,
      investigators hope to gain new insights into mechanisms responsible for exercise-related
      myocardial infarction.

      Investigators also aim to do a follow-up study to investigate whether results of the initial
      examinations can relate to future risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
