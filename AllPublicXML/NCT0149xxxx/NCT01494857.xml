  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical benefit and tolerability of adalimumab, a
      fully human monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor α (TNF- α), in patients with
      ulcerative colitis (UC) naive to treatment with biologics.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the two primary forms of idiopathic inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Recent studies have shown that TNF- α may play a major role in the
      etiopathogenesis of UC, justifying the use of anti-TNF-α therapies. Adalimumab is an
      immunoglobulin G1 that specifically binds to TNF-α, and neutralizes its function; it also
      modulates the biological response, induced and regulated by TNF-α.

      Conventional UC therapy quite commonly does not bring satisfactory results; therefore,
      interest in new treatment methods has been growing recently. Biological therapy is a highly
      promising prospect, since it enables to discontinue the use of glucocorticosteroids and
      immunosuppressives or their dose reduction, shortens the hospitalization period, allows to
      avoid surgical treatment, extends the clinical response, the remission period and improves
      the patient's quality of life.

      Thus, the present study assesses the clinical response of active ulcerative colitis to
      adalimumab treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female ≥ 18 years of age.

          2. Diagnosis of ulcerative colitis for greater than 90 days prior to Baseline.

          3. Diagnosis of active UC confirmed by colonoscopy with biopsy or flexible sigmoidoscopy
             with biopsy during the Screening Period, with exclusion of infection.

          4. Active UC with a Mayo score of 6 to 12 points and endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3 points,
             despite concurrent treatment with at least 1 of the following (oral corticosteroids or
             immunosuppressants or both as defined below):

               -  Stable oral corticosteroid dose (prednisone dose of &gt;= 20 mg/day or equivalent)
                  for at least 14 days prior to Baseline or stable oral corticosteroid dose
                  (prednisone of &lt; 20 mg/day) for at least 40 days prior to Baseline, and/or

               -  At least a consecutive 90 day course of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6 MP)
                  prior to Baseline, with a dose of azathioprine &gt;= 1.5 mg/kg/day or 6 MP &gt;= 1
                  mg/kg/day (rounded to the nearest available tablet formulation), or a dose that
                  is the highest tolerated by the participant (e.g., due to leukopenia, elevated
                  liver enzymes, nausea) during that time. Participant was to be on a stable dose
                  for at least 28 days prior to Baseline.

          5. Concurrent therapy was not required for participants who were previously treated with
             corticosteroids or immunosuppressants (azathioprine or 6-MP) during the previous 5
             years and, in the judgment of the investigator, have failed to respond to or could not
             tolerate their treatment.

          6. Has to be able to self-administer subcutaneous injections or has caregiver who can
             reliably administer subcutaneous injections.
