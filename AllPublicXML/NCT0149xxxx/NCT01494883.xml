  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is to examine the (cost)effectiveness of mindfulness based
      stress reduction (MBSR) in comparison with treatment as usual for patients with lung cancer
      and their partners.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Receiving a diagnosis of cancer is a major cause of distress and is usually characterized by
      anxiety and depression. Compared to patients with other cancer diagnoses, patients with lung
      cancer report higher levels of distress, which probably can be explained by the poor
      prognosis. At the time of diagnosis, lung cancer is often locally or systematically advanced
      and 5-year survival is only 15 percent.

      Mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) is a recently developed psychological intervention
      that appears to be promising in terms of reducing psychological distress in cancer patients.
      It consists of 8 weekly group sessions in which formal and informal mindfulness practices are
      practiced. As most of the earlier studies have been conducted in patients with breast cancer,
      it is important to examine the effectiveness of this approach in patients with other types of
      cancer, such as lung cancer. Furthermore, a diagnosis of cancer is not only highly
      distressing for the patient but also for the partner and family.

      In this study, the (cost)effectiveness of MBSR compared with treatment as usual will be
      investigated in 110 patients with lung cancer and 110 partners.
