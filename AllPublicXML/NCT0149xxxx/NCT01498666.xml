  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present clinical trial will examine the use of L. reuteri Protectis in children with
      functional abdominal pain. The aim of the study is to evaluate the use of L. reuteri
      Protectis on pain (severity and frequency) in children of 8-14 years old and with diagnosis
      of functional abdominal pain (FAP).

      Subject will be asked to consume a tablet every day for 4 weeks. Supplementation will be
      stopped after 4 weeks, and the subjects will be followed up for an additional 4 weeks. The
      subjects will complete a diary to record frequency and intensity of pain, use of medication,
      deviation from the usual diet, physical activities, and absence from school and other
      activities. Gastrointestinal symptoms are assessed.

    <time_frame>56 days</time_frame>
    <description>Pain frequency measured by subject diary and expressed as area under the curve, comparing L. reuteri protectis vs. placebo over the initial 2 weeks of the supplementation period. Pain severity measured by the face score system by Wong-Baker at day 14, 28 and 56 (follow up) vs baseline, and area under the curve for weeks 1-4 and 1-2. Treatment success, defined as â‰¥ 50% reduction in pain frequency in weeks 1-4. Reduction in days of absence from school. Parents' absence from work. Need of rescue medication.</description>
