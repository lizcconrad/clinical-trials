  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research is being done to look at the benefits of a recreational and therapeutic program
      for people with spinal cord injury using the VSail-Access sailing simulator.

    <textblock>
      The VSail-Access is the first sailing simulator available for people with disabilities. The
      VSail-Access simulator is a variation on the VSail where the cockpit is fitted with a seat.
      The VSail simulator is a generic sailboat cockpit powered by a pneumatic ram and custom
      designed software. The sailor sails the simulator around virtual courses displayed on a
      computer screen in the same way as a real sailboat on water. Electronic sensors provide real
      time feedback to match the movements of the virtual sailboat displayed on the screen with
      those of the simulator. Sailors can select wind strength and conditions to suit their
      ability.

      Adults with spinal cord injury may take part in this study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>ASIA Exam</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This is a routine test performed for people with spinal cord injury. The ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) exam assesses motor function at 10 key muscles in the body and light touch and pinprick sensation at 28 key points on each side of the body. It is also used to classify injury level and severity. This test will be performed on all subjects.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spinal Cord Injury Quality of Life Questionnaire (SCI QL-23</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 6 weeks and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a routine test performed for people with spinal cord injury. The SCI QL-23 is a 23-item health-related quality of life questionnaire. The subject will read the questionnaire and answer the questions; if needed ,assistance will be provided to record the answers on the form. The SCI QL-23 questionnaire will be used for all subjects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Reach Test, Level of Trunk Activation Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 6 weeks and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Two different assessments of how you are able to use your trunk will be performed. This test is performed by patient reaching forward as far as they can while seated in their wheelchair.This test will assess the activation of trunk muscle by asking the patient to perform a sit-up from the supine position</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grasp/Pinch test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a routine test performed for people with spinal cord injury. This is a standard test used to assess strength of grasp and lateral pinch. The Jamar dynamometer will be used to assess grasp and lateral pinch. This test will be performed on all subjects.</description>

    <measure>Sailing Ability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 6 weeks and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a routine test performed for people involved in a training program. This questionnaire will assess the subject's views about sailing, as well as the subject's perceived sailing abilities.</description>

    <description>You will be transferred to the VSail cockpit and secured. Following the trainer's instruction, you will sail the simulator around virtual courses displayed on a computer screen, using a joystick to control the rudder angle and a mainsheet to control the set of the sail. You will do this for 1 hour.</description>
