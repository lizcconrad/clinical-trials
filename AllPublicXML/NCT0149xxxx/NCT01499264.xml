    <textblock>
      Evaluation of clinical efficacy of my skin (hydrogel and polyurethane film) plus best
      practice clinical care in subjects with burn injuries with particular regard to: 1) Wound
      healing (complete reepithelialization), 2) the patient's pain. In the context of the study
      will be collected secondary outcomes related to type of lesion and its clinical evolution
      through the analysis of the items in the scale of the PSST.
