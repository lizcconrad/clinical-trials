  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in muscle protein synthesis from baseline to 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at week 0 (baseline) and week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will determine the rate of incorporation of stable isotope amino acid tracers in skeletal muscle protein on average resting muscle protein synthesis rate (% new muscle protein per hour) and will be performed at baseline and 16 weeks after caloric restriction or control diet.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in insulin sensitivity from 0 (baseline) and 16 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at week 0 (baseline) and week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will determine insulin sensitivity at week 0 (baseline) and 16 weeks into caloric restriction or control diet. The measurement is made by hyperinsulimic euglycemic clamp and reported as μmol per kilogram of fat free mass of infused glucose needed to maintain glycemia.</description>
