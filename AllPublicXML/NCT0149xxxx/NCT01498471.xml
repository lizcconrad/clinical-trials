      This study is designed to evaluate the accuracy of the National Institute for Health and
      Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline 'red flags' to identify patients at high risk of short
      term serious outcome when presenting in the emergency department (ED) with Transient Loss of
      Consciousness (TLoC). Red flags were defined as ECG abnormality, history or physical signs of
      heart failure, TLoC during exercise, family history of sudden cardiac death at an age &lt; 40
      years and/or an inherited cardiac condition, new or unexplained breathlessness, heart murmur,
      absence of prodromal symptoms in any patient aged &gt; 65 years.
