    <textblock>
      It is the aim of the study to compare the effects of 6 weeks of either high-intensity
      interval training (HIT; carried out at correctly assessed 85-95% of maximal heart rate),
      pyramid, or continuous endurance training, on changes of physical exercise capacity in
      cardiac patients.

      The three exercise arms (isocaloric) are composed as follows:

      Endurance training (n=15): 31min at 65-75% HRmax; HIT (n=15): 4x4min intervals at 85-95%
      HRmax divided by 3x3min of active recovery at 60-70% HRmax, making it a total of 25min;
      Pyramids (n=15): One Pyramid consists of 8 one-minute blocks. Those are grouped starting with
      one block of 70-75% HRmax, followed by one block at 75-80% HRmax and another one at 80-85%
      HRmax. The top of the pyramid are 2 blocks of 85-90% HRmax. Intensity is lowered afterwards
      with one block at 80-85% HRmax, followed by one block at 75-80% HRmax and last one at 70-75%
      HRmax. Two more pyramids follow, each divided by 2min of active recovery at 65-70% HRmax,
      making it a total of 28min.

      All protocols are initiated by 5min of warm-up and end with 5min of cool-down, both at 60-70%
      HRpeak.

      Primary Outcome: Individual maximum power output in watt (Pmax). Secondary Outcome: Change of
      power output in watt at lactate thresholds at 2 and 4 mmol/l.
