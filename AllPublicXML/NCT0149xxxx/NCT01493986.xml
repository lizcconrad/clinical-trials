  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic LA toxicity is an important complication of regional anesthesia. Lowering the LA
      dose is one of the strategies to reduce this risk. For upper limb blocks it is well
      documented that ultrasound guidance allows a significant lower dose of LA for interscalene
      and axillary blocks than with guidance by peripheral nerve stimulation. However, a
      corresponding difference has not yet been found for supraclavicular and infraclavicular
      blocks. The aim of the present study is to define the minimum effective volume of ropivacaine
      7.5 mg/ml when using the LSIB method.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The blocks will be performed as previously described, by an anesthesiologist with LSIB
      expertise. The lateral, medial and posterior cords are the target of infra-clavicular
      brachial plexus blocks. During a prescan we will record if they can be visualized by
      ultrasound and indicate their positions periarterially. The deep location of the cords may
      hamper their identification, especially that of the medial cord. We describe the cord
      positions with reference to the short-axis (cross-sectional) view of the axillary artery,
      which is compared to a clockface having 12 o'clock ventrally. In a former MRI study it was
      found that the cords were usually located in a sector from 3-11 o'clock (the 3-11 sector) and
      within a distance of 2 cm from the midaxis of the axillary artery. The point closest to the
      cords was at 8 o'clock, immediately outside the arterial wall. Point of needle insertion is
      at the intersection between the lower edge of the clavicle and the medial surface of the
      coracoid process. We direct the needle tip to the 8 o'clock position and observe the spread
      of LA from this position. On demand we adjust the needle position to secure a complete fill
      of the 3-11 sector with LA (multiple injections).

      The block needle has an electrical cable. Prior to LA injections we test if a minimal
      electric output (0.2 mA/0.1 msec duration) elicits a motor response. If such a response is
      obtained, the needle is withdrawn (in steps of 1 mm), until the motor response disappears.
      This is to reduce the risk of intraneural injection.
