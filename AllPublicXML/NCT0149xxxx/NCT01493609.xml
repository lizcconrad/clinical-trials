  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CLICK-EAST research project is an investigation of the efficacy of a computer based
      learning programme which aims to teach the fundamental components of social attention to
      young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). &quot;Social attention&quot; describes the process
      of choosing to look at or listen to social information in the world, normally in preference
      to any other available information. Social information normally refers to people: for
      example, we notice human voices more than birdsong or traffic noise, even if the latter is
      louder. As a rule, children with ASD are less likely to prioritise this kind of social
      information. This is thought to have a significant effect on their development and behaviour.
      For example, a child who doesn't listen to what his parents say may be very slow to learn
      language, and may also fail to follow important instructions. Our goal is to create a new
      learning programme, in the form of an enjoyable computer game, which encourages children to
      practise the skills of looking at and listening to people, despite the presence of
      distracting information. The investigators will develop the game with the input of an
      advisory group of parents and teachers of children with ASD as well as some young adults with
      an ASD diagnosis. Then they will perform a trial of the game with a group of preschoolers
      with ASD and their families, in order to determine whether the game is having a positive
      effect on the children's abilities.

    <description>The primary outcome measure is the ADOS-C. The primary outcome will be: Is there a difference in ADOS-C composite score for children receiving the intervention compared to a treatment as usual control group? The ADOS-C is a detailed observation of social behaviours coded from the videoed interaction that takes place during the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule assessment.</description>
