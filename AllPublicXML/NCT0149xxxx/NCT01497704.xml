  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will be divided into two parts: Part 1 will evaluate the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of three doses of YN968D1 after a single administration followed by a 28-Day
      continuous course of therapy; Part 2 will evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy in an
      open-label administration of YN968D1 at the MTD or a maximum of 750 mg. All subjects in Part
      1 and Part 2 of this study will be permitted to continue therapy with only safety monitoring
      and bimonthly assessments for progression, if the product is well tolerated and the subject
      has stable disease or better. Up to 72 subjects will be enrolled in this clinical trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 will include a sequential evaluation of 3 subjects per cohort; cohort 1 at a dose of
      100 mg YN968D1, followed by a cohorts 2, 3 and 4 at doses of 250 mg, 500 mg and 750 mg
      respectively. Initially, each subject will receive one dose of YN968D1 followed by a 7-Day
      observation period, during which single dose PK assessments and safety monitoring will be
      performed. If the initial dose is well tolerated, the subject will return on Day 8 and
      receive 28-Days of continuous YN968D1 oral administration daily. Each subject will
      subsequently be assessed for safety and disease progression on Day 35±2 and steady state
      pharmacokinetic sampling will be obtained. Patients may continue on therapy for an additional
      28-Day cycles without dose interruption if the therapy is well tolerated. Efficacy
      assessments (biomarkers) and disease progression (RECIST imaging) will be assessed every two
      28-Day cycles. The subjects will be assessed for safety for at least 28-Days after the last
      dose of YN968D1.

      For Part 1 of this study, a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) event is defined as any of the
      following events that are assessed by the Investigator as probably or possibly related to
      YN968D1 and occur during or after the initial dose on Day 1 through Day 35 of the first cycle
      of therapy.

        -  CTCAE Grade 4 event

        -  Grade 3 febrile neutropenia (&lt;1,000 neutrophils/mL)

        -  Grade 3 hematologic toxicity with duration &gt; 7 days

        -  Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity (except for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea that continues
           despite optimal medical management)

      If a DLT is experienced in any cohort, the cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects. If two (2)
      DLTs are experienced in any cohort, the study will be paused until the safety events are
      evaluated and discussed with the FDA to determine if the trial may continue.

      Part 2 of this study will include up to 30 subjects. Each subject will receive a 750 mg dose
      or the maximum tolerated dose of YN968D1 from part 1 of the study for continuous 28-Day
      cycles of therapy. If a subject experiences an intolerable side effect a dose reduction or a
      dose interruption for up to 7-Days is allowed at the discretion of the investigator. Subjects
      will be evaluated for RECIST (version 1.1) response at the end of the second cycle of therapy
      on Day 56±3 of the Part 2 study. Safety reporting will be continued for 28-Days from the last
      dose of study medication.

      All subjects in Part 1 and 2 of this trial will be eligible to continue therapy provided they
      have a least stable disease or better and are, in the opinion of the investigator, adequately
      tolerating treatment with YN968D1.

    <description>The primary endpoint is evaluation of safety during the first 28-day cycle of therapy following the initiation of multiple dosing of YN968D1. The safety variables to be evaluated in this study are adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs (specifically including blood pressure), clinical laboratory evaluations including serum chemistry, hematology (including RBC morphology and reticulocyte count), and urinalysis (with detailed sediment analysis, proteinuria, and 24-hour urine for collection for creatinine clearance and protein), and electrocardiograms (ECGs) in triplicate.</description>

    <description>In Part 1 of this study, full PK profiles of YN968D1 will be obtained following administration of a single oral dose of YN968D1 on Day 1, and at steady state on Day 35±2. In Part 2 of this study, PK sampling will include a pre-dose and at the 4±1 hour time point on the first day of dosing in the first 28-Day cycle of therapy, and pre-dose on days 2, 7, 14 and 28 of the first 28-Day cycle of therapy</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumor Biomarkers for Specific Tumor Types</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 28-Days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary Pharmacodynamic endpoints will include specific serum tumor markers for the target cancer, levels of endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and detection of EC-derived molecules such as sVEGFR-1, sVEGFR-2, sVEGFR-3, sTie-2 and VCAM-1, as well as PIGF. These biomarkers will be measured at baseline and at the end of every two 28-Day cycles of therapy. For patients that continue on repeat 28-Day cycles after the primary evaluation period, biomarkerts will be assessed after each two 28-Day cycles of therapy.</description>

    <description>Anti-tumoral efficacy will be assessed by best radiographic response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v 1.1) at baseline (Day -14 to -1) and at the end of two 28-Day cycles of therapy (Part 1 - Day 35±2; or Part 2 56±2 Days). For patients that continue on repeat 28-Day cycles after the primary evaluation period, progression will be assessed after each two 28-Day cycles of therapy.</description>
