    <textblock>
      There is little data published on the long term durability of infliximab in pediatric
      patients. In particular a focus on durable remission, frequency of dose/frequency change and
      switch within class. Moreover 10 years of safety experience is rarely reported in children.

      The overall objective is to evaluate the persistence of infliximab as well as dosing
      strategies in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and safety of infliximab
      Regarding persistence of infliximab the investigators will be focusing on the proportion of
      patients who continue to have a durable response or remission to infliximab.

      The investigators will be assessing this by measuring the frequency of dose escalation,
      proportion of patients needing frequency change and proportion of patients switched to
      adalimumab or certolizumab.

      Safety outcomes will focus on frequency of malignancies, infections and immunogenecity
