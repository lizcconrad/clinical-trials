    <time_frame>Screening and Day 7 of Titration 3 (Day 21)</time_frame>
    <description>A post void residual (PVR) bladder ultrasound was carried out as a measure of bladder function. PVR was clinically indicated following the occurrence of adverse events relating to the lower urinary tract (e.g., micturition difficulties, including urinary hesitancy or urinary retention). These assessments were also repeated following drug withdrawal following such events. A prompt follow-up PVR was recommended if a high score was obtained from a participant on the Pediatric Lower Urinary Tract Symptom scale (the PLUTS scale is a clinician-rated scale used to assess lower urinary tract symptoms, including urinary retention) and if the clinician felt that the participant was at risk or had symptoms of urinary retention. PVR was measured at Day 7 of Titration 3 (600 mg/day). Baseline is defined as the Screening visit.</description>

        <title>The Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve Over the Dosing Interval (AUC[0-tau]) Following Oral Administration of Ezogabine/Retigabine</title>
        <description>The steady state pharmacokinetic profile following oral administration of ezogabine/retigabine included determining the area under the curve over the dosing interval (AUC[0-tau]). The area under the plasma concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (AUC[0-tau]) was determined using the linear trapezoidal rule for increasing concentrations and the logarithmic trapezoidal rule for decreasing concentrations. Blood samples were collected at pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-dose on Day 7, Day 21, and Day 35 to estimate AUC(0-tau).</description>

The dipstick was a strip used to detect the presence or absence of these parameters in the urine sample. The dipstick test provides results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results can be read as negative (Neg), Trace, and 80, indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. Urinalysis parameters were assessed at Titration 1 (T1; 300 mg/day), Titration 2 (T2; 450 mg/day), Titration 3 (T3; 600 mg/day), Titration 4 (T4; 750 mg/day), and Titration 5 (T5; 900 mg/day).</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in 28-day Seizure Frequency Rate</title>
        <description>Participants or their caregivers recorded the number of seizures experienced by the participant, by seizure type (e.g., simple partial seizure [seizure that affects only a small region of the brain; consciousness is unaffected], complex partial seizure [seizure associated with unilateral cerebral hemisphere involvement and causing impairment of awareness or responsiveness], etc.), as well as by duration of episodes of innumerable seizure activity, in their daily diaries during all phases of this study. Percent change from baseline is defined as 100 * (rate in a given period minus the baseline rate) / (baseline rate). baseline seizures are defined as those seizures that occurred after Screening and before the start of the treatment. Post-baseline seizures are defined as those seizures that occurred from the start of the treatment until the start of Follow-up. Seizure frequency rate was computed as: 28 * (number of seizures during given period / number of days in given period).</description>

        <description>An ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc intervals) was used. Measurements were taken 7 days after each up-titration (Day 7 for 300 mg/day dose; Day 14 for up-titration to 450 mg/day dose; Day 21 for up-titration to 600 mg/day dose; Day 28 for up-titration to 750 mg/day dose; Day 35 for up-titration to 900 mg/day dose). ECG parameters were assessed at Titration 1 (T1; 300 mg/day): Day 1 pre-dose, Day 1 at 3 hours (h), pre-dose, and 3 h post-dose. Titration 2 (T2; 450 mg/day): Day 7. Titration 3 (T3; 600 mg/day): pre-dose and 3 h post-dose. Titration 3 Dose Held (T3DH): pre-dose. Titration 4 (T4; 750 mg/day): Day 7. Titration 5 (T5; 900 mg/day): pre-dose and 3 h post-dose. The number of participants with abnormal (Abn) clinically significant (CS) and not clinically significant (NCS) ECG findings was recorded. The investigator determined if an ECG finding was CS or NCS.</description>

          <description>An ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc intervals) was used. Measurements were taken 7 days after each up-titration (Day 7 for 300 mg/day dose; Day 14 for up-titration to 450 mg/day dose; Day 21 for up-titration to 600 mg/day dose; Day 28 for up-titration to 750 mg/day dose; Day 35 for up-titration to 900 mg/day dose). ECG parameters were assessed at Titration 1 (T1; 300 mg/day): Day 1 pre-dose, Day 1 at 3 hours (h), pre-dose, and 3 h post-dose. Titration 2 (T2; 450 mg/day): Day 7. Titration 3 (T3; 600 mg/day): pre-dose and 3 h post-dose. Titration 3 Dose Held (T3DH): pre-dose. Titration 4 (T4; 750 mg/day): Day 7. Titration 5 (T5; 900 mg/day): pre-dose and 3 h post-dose. The number of participants with abnormal (Abn) clinically significant (CS) and not clinically significant (NCS) ECG findings was recorded. The investigator determined if an ECG finding was CS or NCS.</description>
          <population>All Subjects Population. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X, X, X, X in the category titles). Different participants may have been analyzed at different time points, so the overall number of participants analyzed reflects everyone in the All Subjects Population.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Vital sign assessment included the measurement of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at Titration 1 (T1; 300 mg/day): Day 1 pre-dose, Day 1 at 3 hours (h), Day 7 pre-dose, and 3 h post dose. Titration 2 (T2; 450 mg/day): Day 7. Titration 3 (T3; 600 mg/day): Day 21 pre-dose and 3 h post-dose. Titration 3 Dose Held (T3DH): pre-dose. Titration 4 (T4; 750 mg/day): Day 7. Titration 5 (T5; 900 mg/day): Day 35 pre-dose and 3 h post-dose. Measurements were taken 7 days after each up-titration (Day 7 for 300 mg/day dose; Day 14 for up-titration to 450 mg/day dose; Day 21 for up-titration to 600 mg/day dose; Day 28 for up-titration to 750 mg/day dose; Day 35 for up-titration to 900 mg/day dose). Change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the individual post-dose values. Baseline is defined as as the Day 1 pre-dose value.</description>

        <description>Vital sign assessment included heart rate measurement and was assessed at Titration 1 (T1; 300 mg/day): Day 1 pre-dose, Day 1 at 3 hours (h), pre-dose and 3 h post-dose. Titration 2 (T2; 450 mg/day): Day 7. Titration 3 (T3; 600 mg/day): pre-dose and 3 h post-dose. Titration 3 Dose Held (T3DH): pre-dose. Titration 4 (T4; 750 mg/day): Day 7. Titration 5 (T5; 900 mg/day): pre-dose and 3 h post-dose. Measurements were taken 7 days after each up-titration (Day 7 for 300 mg/day dose; Day 14 for up-titration to 450 mg/day dose; Day 21 for up-titration to 600 mg/day dose; Day 28 for up-titration to 750 mg/day dose; Day 35 for up-titration to 900 mg/day dose). Change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the individual post-dose values. Baseline is defined as as the Day 1 pre-dose value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Post Void Residual Ultrasound at Day 21</title>
        <description>A post void residual (PVR) bladder ultrasound was carried out as a measure of bladder function. PVR was clinically indicated following the occurrence of adverse events relating to the lower urinary tract (e.g., micturition difficulties, including urinary hesitancy or urinary retention). These assessments were also repeated following drug withdrawal following such events. A prompt follow-up PVR was recommended if a high score was obtained from a participant on the Pediatric Lower Urinary Tract Symptom scale (the PLUTS scale is a clinician-rated scale used to assess lower urinary tract symptoms, including urinary retention) and if the clinician felt that the participant was at risk or had symptoms of urinary retention. PVR was measured at Day 7 of Titration 3 (600 mg/day). Baseline is defined as the Screening visit.</description>

        <description>Abnormal Central Nervous System (CNS) symptoms were assessed by a full and brief neurological examination. A full neurological examination included assessment of mental status, cranial nerves, gait, coordination, sensation, speech/language, muscle strength, muscle tone, and reflexes. A brief neurological examination included assessment of mental status, cranial nerves, gait, coordination, reflexes, and speech/language. Neurological parameters assessed were memory impairment, impaired intellect, decreased attention, psychomotor slowing, decreased muscle strength, hpertonia, somnolence, right and left bicpes, right and left brachioradialis, right and left knee, right and left ankle, and right and left planter response. Neurological examination was performed at Day 7 of Titration 3 (600 mg/day).</description>
