      Study objectives are to compare

        -  influenza antibody levels in infant sera and maternal colostrum or breast milk at
           delivery, 2, and 6 months women who receive influenza immunization in early pregnancy,
           late pregnancy, or no influenza immunization during pregnancy and their infants

      Study hypotheses are that infants born to pregnant women who receive influenza immunization
      in late pregnancy will have

        -  higher levels and a longer serum influenza antibody duration in sera (hemagglutination
           inhibition (HAI) titers) and colostrum/breast milk (influenza-specific IgA and IgG by
           enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) than infants of women immunized in early
           pregnancy or not immunized

             mother or infant

          -  multiple gestation

          -  antenatal or postnatal detection at delivery of any major birth defect in the infant
