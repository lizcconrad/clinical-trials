    <textblock>
      Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) is a cell surface receptor
      expressed on neutrophils and monocytes. TREM-1 acts to amplify inflammation and serves as a
      critical mediator of inflammatory response in the context of sepsis. Blocking of TREM-1 can
      protect against sepsis in mice. This study was designed to investigate whether TREM-1 genomic
      variations were associated with the prognosis of sepsis. We sequenced 30 sepsis patients with
      TREM-1 gene of four exons by PCR sequencing. When analyzing the results of sequencing, we
      found two gene polymorphisms located in exon-2 and exon-4, respectively. Compare with the
      NCBI dbSNP and Hapmap database, one polymorphisms located in exon-2 is non-synonymous
      variation rs2234237（Ser25Thr）, the other one located in exon-4 is synonymous variation
      rs2234246. Two common polymorphisms (rs2234237,rs2234246) within the TREM-1 gene were
      detected in 80 patients with severe sepsis and in 80 healthy control subjects. This study was
      explored that whether or not polymorphisms detected within the TREM-1 gene may play a major
      role in the predisposition to prognosis of sepsis in a Chinese Han cohort.
