  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to learn more about how different surgery procedures bring back the
      eating pathway after removing the stomach in patients with stomach cancer. If the surgeon has
      decided that some, or all, of the patient's stomach must be removed the surgeon must create a
      new way to allow food to travel from the mouth to the intestines. Some patients develop
      problems because they are missing their stomach, such as lack of hunger, bloating, cramping,
      and heartburn.

      The surgeons at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center are conducting a study to determine if
      a change in surgery can help reduce these symptoms.

      The most common method of creating a way for food is called a &quot;Roux-en-Y&quot;, in which one part
      of the intestine is connected with the end of the esophagus (the swallowing tube) in the
      abdomen, and another connection is made between the intestines lower down.

      The change in surgery involves creating a pouch from a part of the intestines to replace the
      stomach.

      This study will compare the effects, good and/or bad, of gastric pouch reconstruction with
      the usual reconstruction to see if the pouch makes you feel better overall.

      This type of surgery has been used by some surgeons for many years and is known to be safe,
      but it is not known if it reduces symptoms or improves nutrition compared with the usual
      surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient 18 years of age or older

          -  Pathologically confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma at MSKCC (biopsy may be performed at
             other institutions but slides must be confirmed at MSKCC, as is routine care at our
             institution)

          -  No evidence of metastases(a)

          -  Total gastrectomy performed(b)

          -  Pouch reconstruction is technically feasible(c)

               -  Patients will be registered and consent obtained, if the surgeon believes there
                  is no evidence of metastases. If metastatic disease is identified at the time of
                  operation, the patient will not be randomized.

               -  Patients will be conditionally enrolled, and consent obtained, if the surgeon
                  believes the patient may need a total gastrectomy at the time of operation. If a
                  total gastrectomy is not performed, the patient will not be randomized.

               -  Patients will be excluded if, at the time of surgery, the surgeon feels that
                  creation of a pouch is not technically feasible. This may be due to prior
                  abdominal surgery, anatomic variants, or anything else at the surgeon's
                  discretion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not expected to be able to provide follow-up over 2 years (due to geographic or other
             limitations)

          -  Not able to complete HRQOL instruments on their own (non-English speaking or physical
             status)
