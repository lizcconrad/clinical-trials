  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of dovitinib lactate when given
      together with gemcitabine hydrochloride and capecitabine in treating patients with advanced
      or metastatic solid tumors or advanced pancreatic cancer. Dovitinib lactate may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and capecitabine, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving dovitinib lactate together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor
      cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of dovitinib
      (dovitinib lactate) when administered concurrently with gemcitabine (gemcitabine
      hydrochloride) and capecitabine in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

      II. To characterize the safety profile of dovitinib, gemcitabine and capecitabine combination
      in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of dovitinib, capecitabine, gemcitabine and
      their metabolites when administered concurrently in patients with advanced solid
      malignancies.

      II. To determine the preliminary efficacy of the study combination in patients with advanced
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas or biliary tract.

      III. To explore serum and tumor biomarkers predictive of efficacy to the study combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dovitinib lactate.

      Patients receive dovitinib lactate orally (PO) on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19, gemcitabine
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and capecitabine PO twice
      daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then every 3
      months for 1 year.
