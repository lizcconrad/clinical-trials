  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PUMA is an observational, multicentre, multinational, cross-sectional study with primary care
      physicians (primary care, general and family physicians). Participants will be selected
      sequentially among patients at risk for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) who
      attend primary care consultation (primary care, general and family physicians). The inclusion
      visit will be a regularly scheduled or spontaneous consultation for patients, and this
      appointment with the physician will not depend on the study. During the appointment, data
      will be collected from the patient and the physician.

    <description>PUMA Questionnaire: Based on the PLATINO questionnaire. Applied to patients to describe different aspects potentially related to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) such as: respiratory symptoms, smoking, respiratory medication, health care resources usage, comorbidieties, etc., as well as the registration of procedures (spirometry and oximetry) carried out and anthropometric data.</description>

    <measure>FEV1 spirometry measures.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and visit 2 up to 4 weeks after baseline (if applicable)</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the volume of air expelled from the lungs in 1 second.
The second visit will be scheduled only for those patients who do not meet criteria for deferring spirometry.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire based on the patient's personal medical history at the site. Its application will be subject to the existence of a prior medical history for the patient at site. If the patient has no prior medical history at site, then this questionnaire will not apply.</description>

    <description>Ratio of Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (volume of air expelled from the lungs in 1 second) by the Forced Vital Capacity (FVC, the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out after full inspiration) is a spirometric measure (lung function test) used to demonstrate airway obstruction.
The second visit will be scheduled only for those patients who do not meet criteria for deferring spirometry.</description>
