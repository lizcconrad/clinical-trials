  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad treatment with a new
      combination of drugs, cyclophosphamide, topotecan, and bevacizumab has on the patient and
      their cancer.

      The medications, cyclophosphamide and topotecan, are standard drugs often used together for
      the treatment of cancer in children with either Ewing's sarcoma or neuroblastoma.

      Bevacizumab is an experimental drug called an antibody that targets a protein important in
      the growth of cancer cells called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is made by
      tumor and other surrounding cells to help make blood vessels needed for the growth and spread
      of cancer cells in the body. The way that bevacizumab works is to stop the cancer cells from
      making their own blood supply, causing the tumor to stop growing bigger or from spreading. In
      adult clinical trials, bevacizumab has shown promising anti-cancer activity in patients with
      cancer of the colon/rectum (colorectal) and breast. It has been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for use in patients with colorectal cancer but not in cancers found in
      children. Bevacizumab has been tested in early clinical studies in children and has been
      shown to be safe.

      Other goals of this study will include research tests designed to test the following changes
      in the patient or their cancer: to see how the body handles and breaks down bevacizumab
      (pharmacokinetics), to look at changes in proteins in the blood that may affect the way the
      cancer responds to the combination (angiogenic profile, angiogenesis associated serum
      biomarkers), to look at changes in genes that may affect how the cancer responds to treatment
      with this combination of medications (metabolic signature), and to monitor the effects of
      changes in the way the body grows and develops before and after bevacizumab is given.

    <description>The treatment schedule for this study will consist of a 21-day cycle. Dose modification will only occur with administration of the investigational agent, bevacizumab. The schedule of administration is summarized as follows. Administration of bevacizumab will precede the administration of the cyclophosphamide and topotecan by 3 days (Day - 3) to allow for vascular stabilization prior to initiation of chemotherapy. The chemotherapy backbone will consist of cyclophosphamide and topotecan administered as follows: cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2/day IV over 30 minutes ± 5 minutes on Days 0-4 followed by topotecan 0.75 mg/m2/day IV over 30 minutes ± 5 minutes on Day 0-4 of every cycle. The dosing of cyclophosphamide and topotecan will be fixed.</description>
