  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study to define the optimal rehabilitation for clients with full thickness
      rotator cuff reconstruction, with two goals: 1. Finding the optimal physical therapy dosage
      in enhancing post-operative outcomes of shoulder pain, shoulder joint range of motion,
      shoulder muscle strength, upper extremity function; and 2. Finding the effect of aquatic
      physical therapy in enhancing the post-operative outcomes.

      Measurement devices:

      Biodex: Biodex system is a muscle strength testing and rehabilitation instrument used in the
      testing and rehabilitation services for shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee and ankle. Modes of
      operation for exercise and testing include isokinetic, passive, isometric, isotonic, and
      reactive eccentric. Patients are tested for their muscle performance for the required number
      of repetitions in the required mode. The muscle performance is measured by calculating the
      average peak torque (in Nm) and analyzed across the group of patients.

      Goniometer: A manual devise used to measure joint range of motion. Visual Analogue Scale: A
      scale with 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain, and 10 being severe pain.

      Measurement procedure:

      All the subjects posted for surgery will be tested prior to and again 6 weeks following
      surgery for:

      Shoulder Pain is measured using a visual analog scale. Shoulder Range of motion is measured
      using a standard goniometer. Shoulder Muscle performances are measured using Biodex.

    <description>2. Standard physical therapy program PLUS aquatic physical therapy: The above PLUS a aquatic physical therapy program which will be conducted twice weekly for 10 weeks and will include a 40-50 minute hydrotherapy session emphasizing range of motion and light resistive exercises of the arm, primarily focusing on the shoulder. The program will start with general mobility of the other upper limb joints to allow time for preconditioning of the painful shoulder. Shoulder exercises will emphasize flexion, rotation and abduction and a slow transition from pain-free range to the restricted range of motion to maximize the effectiveness of the heat and buoyancy.</description>
