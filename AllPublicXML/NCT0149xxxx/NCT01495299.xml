    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between intraocular pressure (IOP)
      fluctuations of glaucoma patients as recorded with an IOP-sensing contact lens (SENSIMED
      Triggerfish®), during two 24-hour periods, before and after cataract surgery. This device has
      previously been investigated and shown to be safe and well tolerated.
