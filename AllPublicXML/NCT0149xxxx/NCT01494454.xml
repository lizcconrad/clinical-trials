    <description>Fusion is defined as:
Evidence of bridging trabecular bone.
No evidence of motion as defined by: a. No more than 3mm difference in translation on the lateral flexion/extension radiographs as determined by superimposing the two views, one upon the other; b. Less than 5° difference in angular motion between flexion and extension as seen on the lateral flexion/extension radiographs;
Absence of radiolucent lines completely through the fusion mass.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain/Disability Status</measure>
    <time_frame>24 month</time_frame>
    <description>The self-administered Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire will be used. Success for each individual patient will be defined as pain/disability improvement postoperatively according to the following definition: Preoperative Score - Postoperative Score &gt;= 15</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurological status</measure>
    <time_frame>24 month</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological status will be assessed preoperatively and postoperatively using a comprehensive neurological status scale. Neurological status is based on four types of measurements (sections): motor, sensory, reflexes and straight leg raise.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Has degenerative disc disease as noted by back pain of discogenic origin, with or
             without leg pain, with degeneration of the disc confirmed by patient history ( e.g.,
             pain [leg, back, or symptoms in the sciatic nerve distribution], function deficit
             and/or neurological deficit and radiographic studies (e.g., CT, MRl, X-Ray, etc.) to
             include one or more of the following:

               -  instability (defined as angular motion &gt;=5° translation &gt;= 4mm, based on Flex/Ext
                  radiographs);

               -  osteophyte formation;

               -  decreased disc height;

         17. Has a history of hypersensitivity to protein pharmaceuticals (monoclonal antibodies or
             gamma globulins).

         18. Has received treatment with an investigational therapy within 28 days prior to
             implantation surgery or such treatment is planned during the 16 weeks following
             rhBMP-2/BCP implantation.

         19. Has received any previous exposure to any/all BMP's of either human or animal
