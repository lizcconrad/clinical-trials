  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, it was planned to randomize 226 participants. However, only 178 participants
      were randomized during a timeframe of 2 years and 8 months. Therefore, the study was
      terminated due to slow enrollment and low participant compliance to the physical training
      schedule.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Fatigue as Measured by the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (mFIS ).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The mFIS provides an assessment of the effects of fatigue in terms of physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning. It is a 21-item, structured, self-report questionnaire that generally can be completed with little or no intervention from an interviewer. The mFIS score ranged from 0 (not tired) to 84 (tired). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life as Measured by the Hamburg Quality of Life Questionnaire in Multiple Sclerosis (HAQUAMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamburg Quality of Life Questionnaire in Multiple Sclerosis (HAQUAMS) consists of 44 items, 28 of which are the basis for computation of five subscale scores reflecting major dimensions of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in MS: Fatigue/Thinking (4 items), Mobility lower limb (5 items), Mobility upper limb (5 items), Social function (6 items) and Mood (eight items). Subscales and total score range from 1 to 5, with high scores indicating a lower quality of life. In this study, the total score and following 3 subscales: fatigue/thinking, mobility lower limb and mobility upper limb only were analyzed. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Depression as Measured by the Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II) is a 21-item self-report instrument intended to assess the existence and severity of symptoms of depression as listed in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition. Each of the 21 items corresponding to a symptom of depression is summed to give a single score for the BDI-II. There is a four-point scale for each item ranging from 0 to 3. The total score ranges from 0 - 63. Total score of 0-13 is considered minimal range, 14-19 is mild, 20-28 is moderate, and 29-63 is severe. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <description>Fingolimod as baseline immunomodulatory multiple sclerosis treatment was prescribed as per clinical practice. During phase 1, participants randomized to this arm had an introductory group session, hosted by a sports therapist. The individual training schedule was comprised of strength exercises twice a week for 30-45 minutes and endurance training once a week for 20-60 minutes for 6 months. The participants documented each training session thoroughly via the web-based application (duration, type of exercises, number of repetitions and sets, perceived exertion). A standard course of corticosteroids (methylprednisolone) on an inpatient or outpatient basis was allowed for treatment of relapses as clinically warranted. Steroid treatment consisted of 3-5 days and up to 1,000 mg methylprednisolone/day. After 6 months, Phase 2, the same Phase 1 regimen applied.</description>

    <intervention_name>Physical exercise</intervention_name>
    <description>Strength training exercises are performed against own body weight or with training aids like elastic rubber bands or gym balls. All exercises are home-based. To increase balance and core stability, a subset of exercises is performed on shaky ground and/or one-legged. Exercise intensity, duration and frequency are individually assigned by a sports therapist. For each muscle group, a set of exercises of increasing difficulty allows for individual and progressive training adaption. Therapists can choose from an exercise database of approximately 150 different strength exercises with different graduation.</description>

          <description>Fingolimod as baseline immunomodulatory multiple sclerosis treatment was prescribed as per clinical practice. During phase 1, participants randomized to this arm had an introductory group session, hosted by a sports therapist. The individual training schedule was comprised of strength exercises twice a week for 30-45 minutes and endurance training once a week for 20-60 minutes for 6 months. The participants documented each training session thoroughly via the web-based application (duration, type of exercises, number of repetitions and sets, perceived exertion). A standard course of corticosteroids (methylprednisolone) on an inpatient or outpatient basis was allowed for treatment of relapses as clinically warranted. Steroid treatment consisted of 3-5 days and up to 1,000 mg methylprednisolone/day. After 6 months, Phase 2, the same Phase 1 regimen applied.</description>

During phase 1, participants randomized to this arm had an introductory group session, hosted by a sports therapist. The individual training schedule was comprised of strength exercises twice a week for 30-45 minutes and endurance training once a week for 20-60 minutes for 6 months. The participants documented each training session thoroughly via the web-based application (duration, type of exercises, number of repetitions and sets, perceived exertion). A standard course of corticosteroids (methylprednisolone) on an inpatient or outpatient basis was allowed for treatment of relapses as clinically warranted. Steroid treatment consisted of 3-5 days and up to 1,000 mg methylprednisolone/day. After 6 months, Phase 2, the same Phase 1 regimen applied.</description>

            <description>Fingolimod as baseline immunomodulatory multiple sclerosis treatment was prescribed as per clinical practice. During phase 1, participants randomized to this arm had an introductory group session, hosted by a sports therapist. The individual training schedule was comprised of strength exercises twice a week for 30-45 minutes and endurance training once a week for 20-60 minutes for 6 months. The participants documented each training session thoroughly via the web-based application (duration, type of exercises, number of repetitions and sets, perceived exertion). A standard course of corticosteroids (methylprednisolone) on an inpatient or outpatient basis was allowed for treatment of relapses as clinically warranted. Steroid treatment consisted of 3-5 days and up to 1,000 mg methylprednisolone/day. After 6 months, Phase 2, the same Phase 1 regimen applied.</description>

        <description>The Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II) is a 21-item self-report instrument intended to assess the existence and severity of symptoms of depression as listed in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition. Each of the 21 items corresponding to a symptom of depression is summed to give a single score for the BDI-II. There is a four-point scale for each item ranging from 0 to 3. The total score ranges from 0 - 63. Total score of 0-13 is considered minimal range, 14-19 is mild, 20-28 is moderate, and 29-63 is severe.
