  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a certain cell type (the CD49d+ neutrophil) is
      associated with the presence or development of allergic disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A specific subset of neutrophils (CD49d+) will be recruited to the nasal tissue of
      individuals with allergic disease, and that these cells will also be found in the peripheral
      blood of allergic subjects. Normal subjects (those without atopy) and those treated for
      atopic disease will lack the presence of these cells.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Increase in percentage of CD49d expressing neutrophils in nasal lavage post allergen challenge.</measure>
    <time_frame>1month</time_frame>
    <description>Nasal lavage on atopic and non-atopic adult subjects will be performed at baseline and following an allergen challenge. The frequency of CD49d expressing neutrophils in the lavage fluid will be determined by flow cytometry analysis, and the change in this frequency will be correlated with atopic status and allergen challenge. This is an observational study, procedures performed are not intended to impact the outcome of the individual participants.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in immune cell numbers in the nasal lavage following allergen challenge</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The numbers of neutrophils, CD49d+ neutrophils, lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages in the nasal lavage will be determined before and after allergen challenge. The outcome will be correlation of these changes with allergy status and any clinical symptoms of the allergen challenge (i.e., sneezing).</description>
