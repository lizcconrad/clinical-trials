  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is directed at decreasing home environmental tobacco smoking (ETS) exposure with a
      novel approach of adoption of home smoking restrictions. This will be done by providing the
      cohabitating smoker and non-smoker with biomarker feedback documenting exposure to ETS. The
      intent is to identify an intervention strategy(ies) to reduce ETS exposure.

      This is a two-group interventional trial targeting cohabitating smokers and non-smokers.
      Participants will be randomized to the control condition or biomarker feedback group.

    <description>Received self-help brochure and biomarker feedback from urine collected from non-smoking adult in home. Outcome criteria categorized into 3 areas: establishment of a complete ban (defined as no one allowed to smoke anywhere, ever), some restrictions (smoking allowed in some places or some time), and no restrictions (smoking permitted anywhere, no rules).</description>
