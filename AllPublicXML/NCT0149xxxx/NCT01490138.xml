  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive fungal infection (IFI) is a disease usually occurred in the patients with
      compromised immune condition, such as acute leukemia, allogeneic stem cell transplantation or
      long term immune suppression treatment with the incidence increasing over last decades. Given
      the introduction of numerous anti-fungal agents and great advance has been made in recent
      years, IFI is still a dangerous disease with high mortality.

      Early diagnosis of IFI is still a problem challenging the physicians. Serum tests of
      β-D-Glucan are introduced to the diagnosis of IFI, which have the advantage of easy
      application. However, the value of this test in the monitoring of antifungal treatment
      remains unclear.

      The investigators perform this study to evaluate the correlation of the serum test results of
      β-D-Glucan test with the treatment response during the anti-fungal treatment, and hope to see
      that the results of serial serum tests are good predictive markers for treatment response.

      This is a single center, open-label study. The duration of the study will be 2 years. The
      number of targeted subjects will be 50 (in 2 years). We estimate that on average, the
      treatment duration is 4-8 weeks. Serum Glucan levels will be measured 2 times per week until
      the recovery of the infection or treatment end.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with proven or probable IFI and immunocompromised because of hematopoietic-cell
        transplantation (HSCT) or chemotherapy, and have positive results for serum Glucan tests
        will be included in the study.

        Patients must satisfy all the following criteria before entering the study :

          1. Episode of proven or probable IFI, diagnosed according to the EORTC/MSG definitions;

          2. Immunocompromised because of HSCT or chemotherapy for malignant hematopathy;

          3. ≥ 2 consecutive positive serum glucan level, using a threshold for positivity of ≥ 60
             ng/L, at the start of antifungal therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        If the fungal infection of the patient is excluded or confirmed to be a specific pathogen
        other than fungi before the enrollment/during the study period, he or she will be
        excluded/withdrew from the study.
