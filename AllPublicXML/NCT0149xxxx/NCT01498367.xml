  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate whether patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus can be followed by simplified,
      centralized and large scale tele-monitoring of blood glucose levels and blood pressure, and
      whether this intervention produces health and economic benefits when introduced without major
      changes to the existing organization of a large tertiary care center.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to examine the clinical and financial effects and the patients'
      perception and satisfaction of home telemedicine support system for diabetes management
      versus standard (usual) care. In the intervention group the patients will be provided with a
      blood glucose meter and a mobile phone and their data will be transferred via the mobile to
      the regional database and will be assessed by the allocated care team. Appropriate counseling
      on treatment and symptoms or problems related to diabetes will also be provided.

      Measurements of HbA1c will be taken to assess glycaemic control while the dietary and the
      exercise habits will be assessed by the use of questionnaires. In addition the patients'
      satisfaction from the use of the telemedicine service will be studied. A Cost-Effective
      Analysis and Cost Utility Analysis will be applied to evaluate the tele-health service
      compared with the usual care from the health and social perspective. The effect of the
      tele-health service in the organization structure of the outpatient hospital department will
      be evaluated with a qualitative study.

    <description>Participants in the control group receive usual care. Usual care consists of regular visits to the specialist when required. In the occasion of the visit, HbA1c and glucose measurements are performed and the current oral or insulin therapy is modified if necessary. Patients also receive basic education in the management of diabetes.</description>

    <description>Patients will have one educational visit to set up the system and explain how it works. Patients will download their measurements from their tele-glucose meter to their mobile phone and the data will be transferred to the regional database. The care team (a nurse specially trained and the allocated physician) will regularly access the patient's home diary, and will provide the appropriate counselling and medication changes as frequently as necessary. In addition to blood glucose measurements, routine questions about symptoms and eventual difficulties related to diabetes as well as diabetic management will be routinely captured and reported.</description>
