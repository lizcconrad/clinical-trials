  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for perioperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is based on the observation
      that anemia is an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality after cardiac
      operations. However, transfusions have been associated with high rates of morbidity and
      mortality in critically ill patients, and some recent studies have shown worse outcomes,
      including increased occurrence of renal failure and infection, as well as respiratory,
      cardiac, and neurological complications, in transfused compared with non transfused patients
      after cardiac surgery. On the basis of past clinical observations, some authors have
      suggested that hematocrit should be maintained at around 30% and hemoglobin concentration at
      10 g/dL. Recently, however, this hemoglobin threshold has been reconsidered because of
      recognized risks associated with transfusion and greater appreciation of the importance of
      individual physiological responses to anemia. In a comparative trial of 428 patients
      undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft(CABG) surgery, Bracey et al reported that
      reducing the hemoglobin trigger to 8 g/dL did not adversely affect patient outcomes and
      resulted in lower costs. An important multicenter Canadian Study by Hebert et al that
      included a large number of critically ill patients revealed that A restrictive strategy of
      red-cell transfusion (hemoglobin concentration maintained between 7.0and 9.0g/dL) is at least
      as effective as and possibly superior to a liberal transfusion (hemoglobin concentration
      between 10 and 12 g/dL) strategy in critically ill patients, with the possible exception of
      patients with acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina, in terms of reducing organ
      dysfunction and mortality.

      The investigators would like to determine whether a restrictive strategy of red-cell
      transfusion and a liberal strategy produce equivalent results in orthopedic-oncology patients
      undergoing surgery.

    <description>This transfusion policy holds to any time from the start of surgery until discharge. The physicians caring for the patient will be instructed to administer transfusion, one unit at a time, and to measure the patient's hemoglobin concentration after each unit is transfused. In both groups, no further units will be given if the goal hemoglobin was obtained (7.5 g per deciliter for the restrictive arm and 10.0 g per deciliter for the liberal one). All other management decisions are left to the discretion of the patients' physicians. Attending physicians can administer RBC transfusions outside the rules of the protocol (i.e more than 1 unit at a time, without determining pre-transfusion hemoglobin) if severe acute bleeding occurs or other forms of circulatory shock.</description>
