      The Biorepository for Caris Life Sciences is designed for the purpose of making quality
      biospecimens and associated clinical data available for research studies related to advancing
      precision medicine and improving care for patients.

      The Caris Biorepository is a repository of prospectively collected biological specimens and
      associated clinical and demographic data gathered from multiple sources to be stored, used
      and shared for research. Caris Life Sciences will maintain the data and specimens and will
      control access to and use of the information and specimens by multiple individuals for
      multiple purposes which may evolve over time.

      The Caris Biorepository is an effort toward defining the future of medicine incorporating the
      discoveries of the genomic era by providing physicians, researchers and scientists access to
      quality human specimens and data aimed at improving human health and fighting disease. This
      will be accomplished through acquiring and sharing valuable biospecimen information and
      clinical outcomes in a collaborative, secure environment. The Caris Biorepository will bridge
      the gap and correlate human specimens with clinical and specimen data valuable to multiple
      and varying entities interested in advancing science with precision medicine by targeting
      disease treatments.

      The objective of this project is to develop and implement a state-of-the-science
      Biorepository that ensures molecular integrity and clinical relevance of human biospecimens
      used in research and clinical medicine. The Caris Biorepository will also provide vital
      biospecimens and data to internal researchers and external research collaborators such as
      government, academia and industry collaborators for the use of drug development discoveries,
      clinically relevant research trials, publications and posters, and the implementation of
      future healthcare policies. This project may also impact characterization of trends in
      practice patterns and their relation to patient outcomes as well as the economic implications
      of differing evaluation, treatment and management paradigms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Capacity to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Due to the complexity of state and federal requirements governing the participation of
             prisoners in research, prisoners-patients will not be approached for participation in
             the Caris Biorepository.

          -  Minor subjects will not be included in the Caris Biorepository, as it is possible
             biospecimens and data may be stored beyond the time limitations of assent and it may
             be impracticable to re-consent these subjects once they become adults.

          -  Individuals who lack the capacity to give informed consent
