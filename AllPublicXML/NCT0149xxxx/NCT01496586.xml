      Background:

      - Many service members have reported feeling tired, a loss of motivation, mood changes, and
      problems working with others after they have a concussion during deployment. These problems
      may lead to problems with their job and relationships. This study hopes to figure out what
      parts of the brain may be affected in people with these problems after a concussion.

      Objectives:

      - To learn more about the problems that may occur after service members have a concussion
      during deployment and return home.

      Eligibility:

        -  Service members or veterans between 18 and 40 years of age who have had a mild traumatic
           brain injury (concussion) in the past 6 months.

        -  Companions (at least 18 years of age) of the service members will also be included in
           this study. Companions will have interacted with the service member at least 1 hour a
           week since deployment.

      Design:

        -  Service members will have 1 week of tests at the National Institutes of Health Clinical
           Center. Companions will have 2 days of tests at the Center.

        -  Each day, service members will have 4 or 8 hours of tests. Tests will include a medical
           history and physical exam, neuropsychological tests and imaging studies. The tests will
           ask about fatigue, stress, mood, pain, daily activities, and family support. The imaging
           studies will measure brain function at rest and during activity.

        -  Companions will have a medical history and physical exam. They will also complete
           several questionnaires about themselves as well as the service member/veteran. The tests
           will ask about fatigue, stress, mood, pain, daily activities, and family support.

      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to determine the behavioral-anatomical
      relationships that underlie fatigue and amotivation following mild traumatic brain injury in
      deployed military service members. The specific aims are to 1) determine the neural
      correlates of fatigue, and 2) assess how fatigue and social cognition relate to social
      outcomes including employment, community integration and participation in social activities.
      The theory we will test is that fatigue in this population is the result of subtle changes in
      frontal cortical and subcortical structures.

      Study Design: Observational, natural history study.

      Populations: 1) Individuals who have sustained a mild traumatic brain injury as a service
      member deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation
      New Dawn, and who continue to experience symptoms more than 6 months after injury, and 2)
      Companions of individuals from the first group.

      Outcome Measures: We will seek statistical associations between fatigue measures and brain
      morphometric and white matter diffusion measurements obtained by MRI as well as task and
      resting state fMRI.
