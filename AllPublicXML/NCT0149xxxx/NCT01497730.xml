  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This post-marketing investigation will evaluate the functional knee performance of Subjects
      who have undergone primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Data from Subjects who receive one
      of four contemporary knee configurations from different manufacturers will be pooled to
      establish a contemporary dataset.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the functional performance as measured by
      the activities of daily living (ADL) sub-score of the Knee Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score
      (KOOS) patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire of primary TKA at minimum one year
      post-operation. This will be carried out for all four implant configurations. The final
      endpoint is a 2-year evaluation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a prospective, single arm stratified, multi-center investigation.

      Approximately 20 study sites, worldwide, will enroll 840 patients (840 knees). Each study
      site is expected to enroll approximately 42 patients (42 knees). Cohort reallocation is
      permitted. There will be no control group. Eight hundred forty (840) Subjects will be
      stratified into 4 subgroups of 210: fixed bearing cruciate retaining (FB CR), fixed bearing
      posterior stabilized (FB PS), rotating platform cruciate retaining (RP CR), and rotating
      platform posterior stabilized (RP PS).

      Treatment assignment in this study is not randomized. Each site will only enroll patients in
      one of the four knee configuration sub-groups most commonly used as their standard of care.

    <description>The primary endpoint will be measuerd before surgery and out to a minimum of 1 year after surgery. The KOOS is a patient self-administered questionnaire that consists of 42 questions. The KOOS consists of 5 subscales; pain, other symptoms, activities of daily living (ADL), sport and recreational function and knee-related quality of life. Each question has 5 Likert-like response options. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.</description>

    <description>The Pre and Post-Surgical Patient's Knee Implant Performance (PKIP) questionnaire is a patient self-administered questionnaire that consists of 25 questions relating to the patient's awareness of their knee. Questions include the patient's self-confidence about the current status of their knee performance, stability, and overall satisfaction. Each question has a 5, 6 or 10 Likert- like response option.</description>
