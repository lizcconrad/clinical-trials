  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, Phase 1 study to assess the safety and tolerability of
      macitentan in combination with dose-dense temozolomide in adult patients with recurrent
      glioblastoma or gliosarcoma. The study is composed of three parts. A Phase 1 Dose Escalation
      Period with a traditional 3+3 design will determine the maximum tolerated dose of macitentan
      in combination with dose-dense temozolomide. A Phase 1b Period will expand the safety and
      tolerability data of two doses of macitentan and dose-dense temozolomide selected from the
      Dose Escalation Period and explore efficacy. An Ancillary Study will further evaluate the
      effects of macitentan on biomarkers in brain tumor tissue.

      The study is planned to have a minimum duration of 12 months. The study will end when all
      patients (excluding those prematurely withdrawn or lost to follow-up) in each part of the
      study have completed a visit at month 12 and 30 days of safety follow-up.
