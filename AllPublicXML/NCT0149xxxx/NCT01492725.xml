    <textblock>
      Patients presenting to the emergency department with acute ischaemic stroke, who are eligible
      for standard intravenous tPA therapy within 4.5 hours of stroke onset will be assessed for
      &quot;dual target&quot; major vessel occlusion and mismatch to determine their eligibility for
      randomisation into the trial. If the patient gives informed consent they will be randomised
      50:50 using central computerised allocation to intra-arterial clot retrieval after IV tPA or
      IV tPA alone. The trial is prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE)
      design.

          2. Patient, family member or legally responsible person depending on local ethics
             requirements has given informed consent
