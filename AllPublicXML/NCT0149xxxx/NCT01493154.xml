    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety of an HPV DNA vaccine after it is injected into your muscle
      using an electroporation device (TriGridTM Delivery System made by Ichor Medical Systems),
      and will test the ability of the vaccine to help your body's immune system to recognize
      HPV-infected and associated cancer cells. In addition to giving the vaccine using an
      electroporation device, we are giving the vaccine in combination with an immunomodulatory
      agent to further enhance immune responses against HPV-infected and associated cancer cells.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the
             head and neck or unknown primary with level II/III (jugulodigastric) nodal involvement

             oropharyngeal carcinoma).
