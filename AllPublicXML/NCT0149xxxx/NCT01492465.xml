        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has provided written informed consent

          -  Men and women between the ages of 18 and 65, inclusive at the time of randomization

          -  Women must be of documented non-reproductive potential (ie, postmenopausal [see
             definition below]; OR history of hysterectomy; OR history of bilateral tubal ligation;
             OR history of bilateral oophorectomy).

          -  Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes

          -  HbA1c ≥ 6.5% and ≤ 10%

          -  Fasting C-peptide value ≥ 0.8 ng/mL

          -  Men must agree for the duration of the study and continuing for 4 weeks after the dose
             of study drug, to practice a highly effective method of birth control. Highly
             effective methods of birth control include sexual abstinence, vasectomy or a condom
             with spermicide (men) in combination with either barrier methods, hormonal birth
             control or IUD (women).

          -  Men must agree to not donate sperm for the duration of the study and continuing for 4
             weeks after the dose of study drug.

          -  Body mass index between ≥ 25.0 kg/m2 and ≤ 40.0 kg/m2 at screening

          -  Negative screening test for alcohol and potential drugs of abuse at screening and day
             -2, unless medication is prescribed by a physician and approved by the principal
             investigator and Amgen medical monitor

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Men with partners who are pregnant at the time of screening or men with partners who
             plan to become pregnant during the study

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding History or evidence of a clinically
             significant disorder, condition or disease that, in the opinion of the principal
             investigator or Amgen medical monitor would pose a risk to subject safety or interfere
             with the study evaluation, procedures or completion

          -  Evidence or history at screening of diabetic complications with significant end-organ
             damage, eg, proliferative retinopathy and/or macular edema, creatinine clearance &lt; 60
             mL/min/1.73m2 (calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula), or
             macroalbuminuria (ie, ≥ +1 proteinuria on urinalysis), diabetic neuropathy complicated
             by neuropathic ulcers, or severe autonomic neuropathy with gastroparesis, chronic
             diarrhea, or hypoglycemic unawareness

          -  Significant cardiac disease, including but not limited to evidence or history of
             coronary artery disease, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, known arrhythmias
             of ventricular etiology, unexplained syncope or syncope/seizures related to arrhythmia

          -  Positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies, hepatitis B surface
             antigen (Hbs Ag), or hepatitis C virus antibodies

          -  An unstable medical condition, defined as having been hospitalized within 28 days
             before day -1, major surgery within 6 months before day -1, or otherwise unstable in
             the judgment of the investigator (eg, risk of complications or adverse events
             unrelated to study participation)
