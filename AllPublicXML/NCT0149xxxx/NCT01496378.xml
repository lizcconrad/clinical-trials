  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of problem-solving
      skills training (PSST) to reduce distress and increase coping abilities among parents of
      youth with chronic pain. We hypothesize that parents will complete the PSST intervention and
      will find it to be an acceptable and satisfactory treatment. We also hypothesize that parents
      who receive PSST will have less distress and better coping skills than parents who receive
      standard care, and that children of parents who receive PSST will have better physical and
      emotional functioning than children of parents who receive standard care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain affects 25-40% of children and adolescents, and results in significantly lower
      quality of life for these youth. Parents play an important role in how their children cope
      with chronic pain, and can also experience their own distress related to their child's
      illness. Parental psychological distress is widely recognized to be associated with poorer
      child adjustment. However, no interventions have been developed specifically to treat
      psychological distress in parents of children with chronic pain. Problem-solving skills
      training (PSST) has been shown to result in significant reductions in parental distress among
      caregivers of children with other types of chronic illness such as cancer. The purpose of
      this study is to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of PSST for parents of youth
      with chronic pain.

    <description>Parent report of problem solving skills will be assessed using the Social Problem Solving Skills Inventory-Revised, which includes 52 items consisting of 5 scales that measure 2 different problem orientation dimensions (Positive and Negative) and three different problem-solving proper dimensions (Irrational Problem-Solving, Impulsivity/Carelessness Style, and Avoidance style).</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, immediately post-treatment, 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Parents will complete the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) to assess parental depressive symptoms. The BDI-II is a 21-item measure that assesses the cognitive, affective, and behavioral components of depressive symptoms in adults.</description>

    <measure>Change in anxiety and depressive symptoms from baseline to immediately post-treatment and 3-month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, immediately post-treatment, 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Parents will complete the Profile of Mood States (POMS) to assess parent anxiety and depressive symptoms. The POMS is a 30-item measure that asks about feelings over the previous week. Six affective states are assessed: tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility, vigor-activity, fatigue-inertia, and confusion-bewilderment. These subscales are combined to form a total POMS score.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, post-treatment, 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Parents will complete the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form(PSI-SF) to assess parenting stress. The PSI-SF is a 36-item questionnaire that assesses parental distress, parent-child dysfunctional interactions, and difficulty parenting.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, post-treatment, 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Children will complete the Bath Adolescent Pain Questionnaire (BAPQ), a 61-item measure that measures the impact of pain on child physical and emotional functioning. The BAPQ was developed specifically for children with chronic pain. Subscales measuring children's depression and physical functioning will be used in analyses.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, immediately post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Parents will complete the Bath Adolescent Pain Questionnaire-Parent Impact to assess changes in functioning and behavior associated with parenting an adolescent with chronic pain. This is a 62-item scale. Two subscales will be used in analyses: child-related catastrophizing and parental behavior.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment expectancies</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Parents will complete a 10-item treatment expectancies questionnaire to rate the likelihood that treatment will lead to symptom improvement on a 5-point rating scale (0=&quot;not at all likely&quot; to 4=&quot;extremely likely&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief symptom inventory</measure>

    <description>In addition to standard medical care, parents in the problem-solving skills training group will receive 8 sessions (1 hour each) of individual problem-solving therapy over 8 weeks. Caregivers will be asked to complete the first training session and at least 3 subsequent sessions in person at their local treatment facility (Seattle Children's Hospital or Oregon Health and Science University). Remaining sessions will be completed via telephone.</description>

    <description>Parents will receive 8, 1-hour sessions of individual problem-solving therapy over 8 weeks. Caregivers will complete the first training session and at least 3 subsequent sessions in person. Remaining sessions will be completed via telephone. In session 1, parents will be introduced to the PSST program and a rationale and explanation for problem solving strategies will be provided. During sessions 2-8, parents will identify a problem that they wish to work on. The therapist will use the primary cognitive-behavioral strategies of modeling, behavioral rehearsal, performance feedback, and generalization of skills in the process of teaching problem solving skills to parents. Parents will complete homework assignments to practice using the problem-solving skills in real-life situations</description>
