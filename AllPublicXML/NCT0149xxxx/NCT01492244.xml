  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Blank&quot; has designed a medical diagnostic system in the form of an unvalidated online
      questionnaire and drawing tool used to describe and identify the location of knee pain,
      respectively. A component of the survey includes the patient inputting their diagnosis as the
      etiology of their knee pain. Dr. Ivo Dinov's team has used the data from 100,000 patient
      surveys to construct a probabilistic model to diagnose those who fill out the questionnaire
      and knee pain map but do not have a diagnosis. However, the validity of the online survey and
      the accuracy of the probabilistic model has not been confirmed in patients with known
      diagnoses. Therefore, the purpose of this study will be to recruit patients with knee pain at
      UCLA orthopedic clinics to complete the online survey which will then be applied to the
      probabilistic model to output possible diagnoses. The results will be compared to the actual
      diagnosis assigned to that patient in the clinic. If validated, the online survey may serve
      as a tool for diagnostic and research purposes.

    <measure>The ability of the UCLA modeling software to predict diagnosis based on questionnaire answers</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>UCLA has developed modeling software that may be accurate at predicting diagnoses depending on the answers given by patients to an online questionnaire and knee pain drawing map. The accuracy of the software has not been tested or validated. This study will determine the accuracy of this software by comparing UCLA orthopedic surgeon input diagnosis to that output by the modeling software following completion of the questionnaire by study participants.</description>

    <measure>Accuracy of patient input diagnosis compared to orthopedic surgeon diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>One Year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients may inaccurately input &quot;known diagnoses&quot; into the online questionnaire because they were diagnosed inaccurately by their doctor, input the wrong diagnosis into the questionnaire by accident, or were never diagnosed with a condition but they input a diagnosis. Therefore, because the modeling software is contingent on accurate patient input diagnoses, determining if patients accurately input their diagnoses into the questionnaire by comparing surgeon input diagnosis to patient input diagnosis may be helpful in elucidating modeling inaccuracy.</description>
