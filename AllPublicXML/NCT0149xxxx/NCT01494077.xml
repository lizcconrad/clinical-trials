  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research project is to determine if pancreatic cyst fluid can be diluted
      and provide an accurate Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) level. The investigators hypothesis is
      that pancreatic cyst fluid obtained by EUS-FNA can be diluted effectively and accurately for
      the measurement of CEA levels.

    <textblock>
      Potential subjects will be identified based on the indication of a pancreatic cyst requiring
      EUS-FNA. The procedure will be performed as usual per standard protocol with EUS-FNA of the
      cyst. Once the fluid is aspirated, it will be measured and if the fluid volume is 2.25 mL or
      greater than the patient will be included in the study.

      A micropipette will be used to ensure exact volumes are measured. The first 1 mL of cystic
      fluid will be sent to the lab for regular CEA analysis, per standard protocol. The remaining
      fluid, which would usually be discarded, will then be used for the study. The micropipette
      will be used to mix 0.75 mL of cyst fluid with 0.25 mL of normal saline (designated sample
      #2). Next, 0.5 mL of cyst fluid will be mixed with 0.5 mL of normal saline for the next study
      sample (designated sample #3). These two study samples will be sent to the lab separately
      using de-identified information, and these values will not be part of the patient's medical
      record and will not affect clinical management or decision-making. The study samples will be
      given a unique identifier that will not have any patient identification. The unique
      identifier will allow the study researchers to link the values to the correct patient by
      using a password protected program that cannot be accessed by the public.

      This study will not require any additional patient participation, and will not impact the
      length of the procedure. The only additional time will be from the study researchers and the
      EUS technologists diluting the samples, which will not affect the procedure time itself. If a
      single patient has more than one cyst, each cyst can be included in the study separately. No
      additional photographs, videos or data other than the standard data for the procedure will be
      produced.

        Patients who are already scheduled for EUS-FNA of a pancreatic cyst at the H.H. Chao
        Comprehensive Digestive Disease Center at UC Irvine Medical Center. The procedure will be
        performed as usual per standard of care protocol with EUS-FNA of the cyst. Once the fluid
        is aspirated, it will be measured and if the fluid volume is 2.25 mL or greater than the
        patient will be included in the study.
