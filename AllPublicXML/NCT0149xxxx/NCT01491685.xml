      This is an observational study comparing microcirculation of pregnant to non-pregnant women.
      &quot;Microcirculation&quot; means blood flow to the extremely small blood vessels in one's body.
      During pregnancy the amount of blood in a woman's body increases. The body responds to this
      increase by pumping more blood through the heart and narrowing the size of blood vessels.

      There are many types of blood vessels that have different roles in the body. Larger blood
      vessels. Transport blood to and from body organs like the brain and liver. Small vessels
      (microcirculation)distributes blood to the organ tissues. The microcirculation can change
      blood flow and blood pressure. Microcirculation is involved in delivering oxygen and
      nutrients to your body, removing waste products, and regulating body temperature.

      The investigators current understanding of the microcirculation in pregnant women is limited.
      There is a device available that can measure microcirculation. It is known as Sidestream Dark
      Field (SDF) imaging. It is a special type of camera that captures pictures of the
      microcirculation. In this study the investigators will compare the microcirculation, as seen
      with SDF imaging, of pregnant women to non-pregnant women. By improving the investigators
      understanding of maternal microcirculation the investigators are adding to the knowledge of
      how the pregnant body works. The investigators hope to then translate this knowledge into
      further studies to improve maternal and fetal outcomes through prevention and treatment of
      maternal low blood pressure caused by spinal anesthesia.

      The objectives of this observational trial are; to compare the sublingual microcirculation of
      pregnant subjects to that of comparable non-pregnant volunteers; to evaluate the usefulness
      of a non-invasive technology, SDF imaging in pregnant and non-pregnant subjects.

      By improving our understanding of maternal microcirculation we not only add to the knowledge
      of maternal physiology, we hope to then translate this knowledge into further studies to
      improve maternal and fetal clinical outcomes through prevention and treatment of maternal
      hypotension especially in relation to spinal anesthesia.
