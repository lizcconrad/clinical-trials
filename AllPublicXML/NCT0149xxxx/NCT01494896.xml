    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how inhaled treprostinil sodium (Tyvaso) affects the
      amount of air and blood that reach the alveoli, or tiy air sacs, in the lungs of patients
      with Group 1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension with concomitant Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease (COPD).

      In patients with severe COPD where the FEV1 is 50% or less than predicted, emphysema and
      obliterating bronchiolitis presenting a &quot;ceiling&quot; to any improvement in function that can be
      achieved by therapies that dilate the airways or lessen inflammation. Such severe COPD is
      commonly associated with pulmonary hypertension at rest or during exercise. Although hypoxia
      has been classically considered to be the major pathogenic mechanism of pulmonary
      hypertension in COPD and oxygen has been the mainstay of therapy, other mechanisms may play
      important roles. Indeed, endothelial dysfunction can be observed in patients with mild to
      moderate COPD who do not have hypoxemia and in smokers with normal lung function. In
      addition, long-term oxygen therapy does not generally result in resolution of the pulmonary
      hypertension. A key question that remains is whether the newer therapies for pulmonary
      arterial hypertension (PAH) could improve pulmonary hypertension and therefore exercise
      tolerance in COPD.

      Unfortunately the use of non-selective pulmonary vasodilator therapy in oral, intravenous or
      subcutaneous form for PAH patients who have unrelated concomitant COPD, is known to cause
      worsening gas exchange and intensification of symptoms despite a decrease in pulmonary
      vascular resistance and arterial pressures.

      We hypothesize that an inhaled pulmonary vasodilator may not worsen ventilation-perfusion
      mismatching by selectively vasodilating well ventilated areas in PAH patients with
      concomitant COPD and in fact may improve ventilation perfusion matching leading to
      preservation or improvement of oxygenation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a diagnosis of PAH confirmed by right heart catheterization within the
             last 12 months (defined by mean pulmonary artery pressure of greater than or equal to
             25 with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or left ventricular end-diastolic pressure
             of less than or equal to 15).

          -  Subject is being initiated on inhaled treprostinil for treatment of PAH.

          -  Subject between 18 and 80 years of age at screening with a diagnosis of COPD confirmed
             by spirometry within the last 6 months showing FEV1 &gt; 40% predicted and FEV/FVC of &lt;
             70.

          -  Baseline 6-minute walk distance &gt; 150 meters.

          -  Subject has not been on any approved therapy for their PH for the last 90 days.

          -  If subject is being treated with conventional therapy for COPD, they must be receiving
             a fixed regimen of these therapies for tat least 30 days prior to Baseline.

          -  Previous echocardiography with evidence of normal left systolic and diastolic
             ventricular function, and absence of any clinically significant left sided heart
             disease.

             Baseline.

             pulmonary veno-occlusive disease or other than those accepted as part of the inclusion
             criteria or has had any atrial septostomy.
