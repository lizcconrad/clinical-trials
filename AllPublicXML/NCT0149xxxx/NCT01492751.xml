    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the three most established
      primary treatments for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer (radical
      prostatectomy, external-beam radiotherapy, and prostate brachytherapy) at short, mid and
      long-term follow-up. The primary aim is assessing Quality of Life impact of treatments' side
      effects. As secondary objectives biochemical disease-free survival, overall survival, and
      prostate cancer-specific survival will be also assessed.

      Primary Objective:

      To assess the Quality of Life impact of treatments' side effects (radical prostatectomy,
      external beam radiotherapy and prostate brachytherapy) on patients with localized prostate
      cancer at short, mid and long-term follow-up.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess biochemical disease-free survival by treatment and risk group, at mid and
           long-term follow-up.

        -  To assess overall survival by treatment and risk group, at mid and long-term follow-up.

        -  To assess prostate cancer-specific survival by treatment and risk group, at long-term
           follow-up.

        -  To assess disease-free survival by treatment and risk group, at long-term follow-up.

        -  To assess perceived general health and cancer-specific quality of life by treatment and
           risk group, at short, mid and long-term follow-up.

        -  To calculate the resource use and cost of the three primary treatments.

        -  To assess preferences with direct and indirect methods.

      Outline:

      This is a prospective observational study of a cohort with clinically localized prostate
      cancer treated with either radical retropubic prostatectomy, three-dimensional external-beam
      radiotherapy, or interstitial brachytherapy.

      Participants are consecutively recruited in 10 Spanish hospital departments (located in five
      autonomous communities). Patients eligible for inclusion were those in stage T1 or T2,
      treated in one of the participating centers and without previous prostate transurethral
      resection. Patients are staged according to the 1992 American Joint Committee on Cancer
      clinical staging guidelines using a directed history and physical examination. The decision
      regarding treatment is made jointly by patients and health professionals.

      Demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline are recorded at clinical sites and
      include age, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), Gleason grading, prostate volume, risk group
      and use of neoadjuvant hormonal treatment. According tho the national health guidelines
      participants are visited every 6-12 months after treatment.

      Quality of Life questionnaires are administered centrally by telephone interview before
      treatment and during follow-up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment the first year, then
      annually until 10 years, and every 5 years thereafter. Quality of Life evaluations are
      gathered using computer-assisted telephone administration and include: (1) the Expanded
      Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), specifically designed to measure the impact of the
      different treatments; (2) SF-36 Health Survey Questionnaire; (3) Functional Assessment of
      cancer Therapy, General and Prostate specific (FACT-G and FACT-P, respectively); (4)
      International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS); and (5) International Index of Erectile Function
      (IIES).

      A total of 120 patients was calculated to be required in each treatment group to detect
      between-treatment group differences of 5-points on the urinary irritative-obstructive score
      of the EPIC questionnaire given a standard deviation of 18.99 and a statistical power of at
      least 80% at a significance level of 5%, with an expected loss to follow-up of 10%. The
      analyst is blinded to treatment assignation.

    <description>The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is a prostate cancer specific questionnaire constructed by expanding the UCLA-PCI to assess function and bother in the 4 domains: Urinary, Bowel, Sexual, and Hormonal.For each domain a summary score is constructed. In addition, two urinary scales that distinguish irritative/obstructive symptoms and incontinence are developed by the authors of the questionnaire. The 50 EPIC items are answered on a 5-point Likert scale and these are transformed linearly to obtain scores ranging from 0-100, with higher scores indicating better Quality of Life.</description>

    <intervention_name>Radical retropubic prostatectomy surgery</intervention_name>
    <description>The surgery group underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy. The surgery is performed by a technique based on a modification of the radical retropubic prostatectomy described by Walsh. The prostatectomy is performed in retrograde way, preserving the neurovascular bundles if feasible, controlling the vessels with titanium clips, and avoiding any kind of coagulation to decrease the risk of neurovascular bundle damage. The bladder neck may be preserved on surgeon criteria. Lymph node dissection is rarely performed due to the extremely low risk of metastatic involvement in this subset of patients. The operative time is about 2 to 3 hours and required hospital stay. The patient has a urinary catheter placed for 1 to 3 weeks to facilitate bladder emptying.</description>

    <intervention_name>External beam radiotherapy</intervention_name>
    <description>External beam radiation is carried out with the 3D conformal technique. Patients are treated in a supine position by immobilizing feet and legs. Data from a computed tomography (CT) scan performed with the patient in the treatment position were entered into a 3D treatment-planning system to outline prostate, bladder, and rectum on each slice. Seminal vesicles and regional lymphatics are also contoured if a high risk of involvement was suspected. Applied margins are used to calculate prostate planning target volume (PTV). Custom blocking with Cerrobend blocks or multileaf collimators are designed using beam's eye view, and additional margins were adjusted to provide a minimum dose of 95% to the prostate PTV. Treatment is delivered in 1.8 to 2.0 Gy daily fractions, 5 days per week. Off-line setup control is assessed weekly by comparing orthogonal portal images with the corresponding digitally reconstructed radiographs.</description>

    <intervention_name>Prostate Brachytherapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Brachytherapy is performed by pre-planned procedure. Under epidural anaesthesia, the patient is placed in the lithotomy position (forced lithotomy position larger prostate volumes) and, after probing the patient, the best prostate spatial location is searched, proceeding then to prepare the sterile field and bladder catheterization. A prostate volumetry with a three-dimensional reconstruction is performed and automatically transferred to the scheduler, which processes the images and outlines the prostate, urethra and rectum in each of the sections. In LDR prostate brachytherapy, the prostate gland corresponds to the PTV. The standard dose for 100% isodose is 145 Gy according to the TG-T43 for I-125 sources. Dosimetry calculation of the automatically prescribed dosage is then estimated, with a final manual optimization.</description>
