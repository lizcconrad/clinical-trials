  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an incurable disorder with a poor prognosis.
      Carfilzomib is a novel proteasome inhibitor with activity in this setting. Panobinostat is a
      pan-deacetylase inhibitor which has shown synergistic cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo with
      proteasome inhibitors. The combination should enhance the activity of both agents against
      myeloma cells. In Phase I, the optimal doses of the combination of carfilzomib and
      panobinostat will be determined. Assuming this combination is feasible, the Phase II portion
      will proceed using the doses determined in Phase I.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this open-label, non-randomized Phase I/II study, a maximum of 4 planned dose levels of
      carfilzomib and panobinostat were evaluated to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to
      administer. The MTD was not reached so patients in Phase II received treatment at dose level
      4 to further assess efficacy. Response to treatment was evaluated after each 4-week cycle.
      Those having an objective response or stable disease are continuing treatment until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

      As the MTD in the 4 planned dose levels were not reached, a parallel Phase I study was
      initiated to examine additional dose levels using a traditional 3+3 design. If these dose
      levels are tolerable, then more patients will be recruited into an expansion cohort to assess
      efficacy at the new dose level(s).
