    <textblock>
      Patients will be receiving a stem cell transplant as treatment for their disease. As part of
      the stem cell transplant, patients will be given very strong doses of chemotherapy, which
      will kill all their existing stem cells.

      A close relative of the patient will be identified, whose stem cells are not a perfect match
      for the patient's, but can be used. This type of transplant is called &quot;allogeneic&quot;, meaning
      that the cells are from a donor. With this type of donor who is not a perfect match, there is
      typically an increased risk of developing GvHD, and a longer delay in the recovery of the
      immune system. Seventy to ninety percent of people who receive unchanged marrow or stem cells
      from this type of donor will develop severe GvHD.

      GvHD is a serious and sometimes fatal side-effect of stem cell transplant. GvHD occurs when
      the new donor cells (graft) recognize that the body tissues of the patient (host) are
      different from those of the donor. When this happens, cells in the graft may attack the host
      organs, primarily the skin, liver and intestines, causing severe rashes, diarrhea, liver
      disease, and even death. GvHD is caused by a type of immune cell in the graft called T cells.

      While this stem cell selection procedure will reduce the risk of GvHD, it will also result in
      slower recovery of the patient's immune system. As the immune system is responsible for
      fighting infections in your body, a longer recovery time after a transplant means that the
      patient may be at increased risk for infections which can become life-threatening. In some
      patients, the immune system can also fight leukemia cells and reduce the risk of relapse.

      In this study, investigators are trying to see whether they can make special T cells in the
      laboratory that can be given to the patient to help their immune system recover faster. As a
      safety measure, we want to &quot;program&quot; the T cells so that if, after they have been given to
      the patient, they start to cause GvHD, we can destroy them (&quot;suicide gene&quot;).

      Investigators will obtain T cells from a donor, culture them in the laboratory, and then
      introduce the &quot;suicide gene&quot; which makes the cells sensitive to a specific drug called
      AP1903. If the specially modified T cells begin to cause GvHD, the investigators can kill the
      cells by administering AP1903 to the patient. We have had encouraging results in a previous
      study regarding the effective elimination of T cells causing GvHD in vitro, whilst sparing a
      sufficient number of T cells to fight infection and potentially cancer.

      More specifically, T cells made to carry a gene called iCasp9 can be killed when they
      encounter the drug AP1903. To get the iCasp9 gene into T cells, we insert it using a virus
      called a retrovirus that has been made for this study. The drug (AP1903) that will be used to
      &quot;activate&quot; the iCasp9 is an experimental drug that has been tested in a study in normal
      donors with no bad side-effects. We hope we can use this drug to kill the T cells. Other
      drugs that kill or damage T cells have helped GvHD in many studies, but with a more profound
      reduction of immune defense. However, if the patient develops significant GvHD, they will
      also receive standard therapy for this complication, in addition to the experimental drug.

      The major purpose of this study is to find a safe and effective dose of &quot;iCasp9&quot; T cells that
      can be given to patients who receive an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Another important
      purpose of this study is to find out whether these special T cells can help the patient's
      immune system recover faster after the transplant than they would have otherwise.

      If the patient is doing well after the stem cell transplant, and does not have severe GvHD,
      s/he will be eligible to receive the special &quot;iCasp9&quot; T cells from Day 30 to 90 after
      transplant. The specially selected and treated T cells will be given by vein (IV) once.

      This is a dose escalation study. This means that at the beginning, patients will be started
      on the lowest dose (1 of 5 different levels) of T cells. Once that dose schedule proves safe,
      the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose. This process will continue until
      all 5 dose levels are studied. If the side-effects are too severe, the dose will be lowered
      or the T cell injections will be stopped.

      If the patient develops GvHD after being given the specially treated T cells, we will
      prescribe AP1903, which has been shown to kill cells carrying the iCasp9 gene. This drug will
      be given as a 2-hour IV infusion.

      We will continue to follow the patient weekly in the bone marrow transplant clinic for the
      first month after the infusion, to check for side-effects of the treatment and for GvHD. The
      patient will have the standard tests performed that all patients have after transplant, even
      when not receiving special T cells.
