  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new surgical
      checklist in the setting of sinus surgery for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and
      to measure the frequency of compliance by surgical personnel at OHSU with specific daily
      safety protocols before and after introduction of the checklist. The investigators
      hypothesized that the use of an ESS specific surgical checklist will improve the frequency of
      compliance by surgical personnel at OHSU to internal safety concerns and protocols.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 200 unidentified, non-randomized endoscopic sinus surgery cases will be observed
      and reviewed by research personnel (T.L.S, J.C.) within the Oregon Sinus Center, located
      within the Center for Health and Healing on the South Waterfront Campus of OHSU, under the
      direction of Timothy L. Smith, MD, MPH (PI). The first 100 surgical cases will be evaluated
      as &quot;pre-intervention&quot; cases by research personnel while the second 100 surgical cases will be
      evaluated as &quot;post-intervention&quot; cases after the introduction and discussion of the surgical
      checklist to operating room staff.
