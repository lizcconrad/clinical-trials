  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a pilot study to investigate the use of belatacept (BMS) therapy in kidney
      transplant patients who have a MAPI score of greater than or equal to 8. The MAPI (Maryland
      Aggregate Pathology Index) score is a preimplantation donor scoring system which has five
      histopathological parameters that impact long-term kidney outcomes. Many kidney transplant
      recipients use calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) as one of their anti-rejection medi cations.
      Kidney function may be affected by anti-rejection medications known as calcineurin inhibitors
      (CNIs). Sometimes CNIs can lead to toxicities and eventually loss of the kidney or episodes
      of chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN). Avoiding CNI immunosuppression and using belatacept
      therapy (BMS) instead, may be associated with improved kidney transplant outcomes.

    <description>To evaluate renal function in Belatacept treated recipients of intermediate risk MAPI score allografts in terms of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, calculated using the MDRD formula) assessed at 12 months. The 12 month eGFR will be compared to existing cohorts of calcineurin inhibitor treated patients with MAPI scores above 8.</description>

    <description>Secondary objectives include the MAPI score at 3 and 12 months. The MAPI score change compared to baseline in the study group will be important in comparison to existing cohorts of calcineurin inhibitor treated patients, to determine whether calcineurin free-regimens are associated with both functional and histologic differences as compared to calcineurin based therapies.</description>
