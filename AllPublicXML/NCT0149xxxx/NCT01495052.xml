  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary modification is of great essential for the prevention and treatment of type 2
      diabetes mellitus. Common oat (Avena sativa L.) and its products showed a great potential
      benefits on NCDs including type 2 diabetes mellitus. But data about such effects of naked oat
      (Avena nuda L.) is still unavailable. The investigators aimed to examine the effects of
      organic naked oat with whole germ (ONOG) plus diet on patients with type 2 diabetes.

      After a pre-study with healthy adults, a randomized, single-blinded, multi-arm parallel trial
      of 30 days would be carried out in adults of 50-65 years old with type 2 diabetes.
      Participants would be randomly assigned to one of the four following groups: usual care group
      (only basic health advice, no other interventions), diet group (systematic education,
      structured dietary), 50g-ONOG plus diet group (all the interventions of diet group plus
      replacement of 50g ONOG per day) and 100g-ONOG plus diet group. A regular follow-up for years
      would be carried out to predict the long-term effects of ONOG plus diet intervention on
      patients with type 2 diabetes.

      The investigators hypothesized that ONOG combined with diet would have better effects on
      glycaemia and insulin resistance control in addition to those yielded by diet or usual care.
