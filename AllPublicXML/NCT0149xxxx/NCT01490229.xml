    <textblock>
      Pharmacologic alternatives in statin-intolerant patients include ezetimibe and nutraceuticals
      (i.e. compounds derived from foods with cholesterol lowering actions). The investigators will
      compare the efficacy and tolerability of ezetimibe versus a nutraceutical-based protocol in
      statin-intolerant patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention.

      Background

      Treatment with statins has a class I indication after percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI), but is often discontinued by patients due to side effects.

      Pharmacologic alternatives shown to be useful after PCI include ezetimibe and nutraceuticals
      (i.e. compounds derived from foods with cholesterol lowering actions).

      It remains unknown, however, which of these two therapeutic approaches is more effective
      after PCI.

      Purpose

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of ezetimibe
      versus a nutraceutical-based protocol in statin-intolerant patients treated with percutaneous
      coronary intervention.
