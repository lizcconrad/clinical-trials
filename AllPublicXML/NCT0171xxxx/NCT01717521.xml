    <textblock>
      Researchers at the UW are doing this study to find out if a commonly used anesthetic affects
      patients Analgesia Nociception Index (level of pain relief) during abdominal hysterectomy
      under general anesthesia.

      The investigators will administer routine anesthesia care including Ketamine, a commonly used
      anesthetic, during the patients surgery. During the patients surgery, the investigators will
      monitor the patients level of pain relief using the PhysioDoloris monitor, which monitors the
      routinely used EKG monitor. Though not yet FDA approved, the PhysioDoloris is completely
      non-invasive and collects data from the EKG monitor.
