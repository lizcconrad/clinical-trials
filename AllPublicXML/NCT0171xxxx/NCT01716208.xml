  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that many patients with lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)have
      low levels of complement. Several drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for use in this cancer. However, these drugs are often used as
      combination therapies which means two or more drugs are part of the treatment. Many people,
      especially elderly patients, cannot put up with the use of multiple drugs because of the side
      effects.

      The main purpose of this study is to see if patients respond to therapy with human plasma
      (known as fresh frozen plasma or FFP) and ofatumumab. Another purpose of the study is to find
      out if this therapy will increase chances of getting rid of leukemia. This study will also
      look at the levels of complement in your blood. The levels of complement may allow better
      understanding of whether increasing the levels of complement by giving FFP may help control
      leukemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vast majority of patients with CLL are elderly and often they cannot tolerate standard
      multi-agent chemotherapeutic or biochemotherapeutic approaches. Based on this, less toxic and
      more effective treatment options are needed.

      Ofatumumab has proven to be effective in patients with relapsed and/or refractory CLL.
      Previous studies have shown that ofatumumab is more effective than rituximab at activating
      complement and utilizing complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).

      This study will investigate treating relapsed/refractory CLL patients with FFP in combination
      with ofatumumab. The hypothesis is that patients with CLL have low complement levels and when
      they get treated with humanized antibodies like rituximab or ofatumumab these levels drop
      even further. Both these antibodies utilize complement to exert their cytotoxic effect, thus
      we hypothesize that by replacing complement levels with FFP we can enhance the efficacy of
      ofatumumab.

    <description>Complement CH50 is a blood test that helps us determine whether protein abnormalities and deficiencies in the complement system are responsible for any increase in autoimmune activity. Complement C2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the C2 gene. The protein encoded by this gene is part of the classical pathway of complement system.</description>

    <description>Ofatumumab will be infused intravenously on day 1 (300 mg initial dose), followed one week later by 2000 mg weekly for 7 doses, followed 4 weeks later by 2000 mg every 4 weeks for 4 doses. Two units (approximately 200 or 250 ml) of FFP will be administered prior to ofatumumab(with the exception of the first dose). A unit of fresh frozen plasma is approximately 250ml (or half a pint).</description>
