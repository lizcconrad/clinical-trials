    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetic (how the drug concentrations
      change over time) profile of abiraterone acetate 1000 mg when administered as a single dose
      in male participants with impaired renal function compared to individuals with normal renal
      function.

      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) pharmacokinetics study
      evaluating a single dose of abiraterone acetate 1000 mg administered in male participants
      with end-stage renal disease compared to matched-control (matched for age and body mass
      index) participants with normal renal function. There will be approximately 8 participants in
      each cohort (group). The total study duration for each participant will be 36 days.
      Abiraterone acetate 1000 mg will be administered orally (by mouth) as a single dose in the
      fasted state on Day 1. No food will be ingested for 4 hours post-dose. Participants will be
      confined to the clinical research center from the day prior to dosing (Day -1) to Day 5 and
      will return to the clinic on Days 8, 15, and 22 for follow up. Serial pharmacokinetic samples
      will be collected and safety will be monitored throughout the study.
