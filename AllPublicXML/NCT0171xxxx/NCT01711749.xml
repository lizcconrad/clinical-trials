    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, two treatment, two sequences, two periods crossover study,
      using a crossover 2x2 design, where each subject will be randomly assigned to reference or
      test formulation, in order to evaluate if both formulations are bioequivalent.

      The objective of this study is to confirm if two formulations of rosuvastatin calcium 20 mg
      tablets are bioequivalent. Test formulation is rosuvastatin calcium 20 mg tablets -
      manufactured by Laboratorios Phoenix S.A.I.C.F/Argentina for GlaxoSmithKline Brazil Ltda.,
      administration of one single-dose tablet. Reference formulation is rosuvastatin calcium 20 mg
      tablets (Crestor® 20 mg - AstraZeneca do Brasil Ltda.), administration of one single-dose
      tablet. Sixty-four healthy volunteers, of both genders, with age ranging from 18 and 50 years
      old, will receive test or reference formulation under fasting conditions, according to the
      randomization list. In each period, after administration of medication, blood samples are
      collected at the following times: 0:00 (prior to administration), 0:30, 1:00, 1:30, 2:00,
      2:20, 2:40: 3:00, 3:20, 3:40, 4:00, 4:20, 4:40, 5:00, 5:30, 6:00, 7:00, 8:00, 10:00, 12:00,
      24:00, 36:00, 48:00 and 72:00 hours. The comparative bioavailability of formulations is
      evaluated based on relevant pharmacokinetic parameters for statistical comparison. Such
      parameters are obtained directly from the determination of the drug active principle
      plasmatic concentration, based on the application of a non-compartmental pattern for the
      evaluation of these concentrations after the drug oral administration.
