  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goal is to investigate how hormones that control blood sugar, hunger, and stomach
      emptying change with puberty and being overweight. These substances change with a meal.

        -  For this, we need to compare lean and overweight children.

        -  We need to study them before and during puberty.

        -  All children in the study will be tested before and after a liquid meal.

    <description>Too much weight gain can cause changes in the substances that control blood sugar and hunger in the body. Scientists need to compare these substances in lean and overweight children before and during puberty. These substances can be measured before and after a meal in the blood and in the urine. The way your stomach moves food can change your sugar levels. We want to understand how diabetes develops by studying these things. This can help find better ways to prevent and treat diabetes.</description>
