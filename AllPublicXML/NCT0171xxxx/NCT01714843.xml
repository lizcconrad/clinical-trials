      This study is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, comparative
      study to investigate dose-responses of efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of ASP0456 in
      patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) according to the Rome
      III Diagnostic Criteria (2006 revised edition, established by the Rome III Committee) after
      oral administration of ASP0456.
