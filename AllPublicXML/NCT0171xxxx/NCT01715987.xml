  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nucleotide anti-viral analogues, including adefovir and TDF, have demonstrated kidney
      toxicity in HIV/HBV co-infected patients and HBV mono-infected European patients.
      Investigators suspected similar kidney proximal tubular injury can also occur in HBV mono
      infected Asian patients receiving TDF treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety use of ETV and TDF after at
      least 144 weeks of treatment in terms of the effects of renal tubular function as determined
      by (1) 24 hours Urine phosphate (wasting is &gt;1200 mg daily); (2) 24 hours
      β2-microglobulinuria (NL β2-microglobulin level, &lt;1 mg daily); (3) fractional excretion of
      uric acid, and (4) fractional tubular reabsorption of phosphorus.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate:

        1. To evaluate compare the anti-viral effects of both TDF and ETV as determined the
           percentage of patient who achieve HBV DNA levels below 60 IU/mL (by quantitative HBV DNA
           PCR test with lowest level of detection at 60 IU/mL) and ALT normalization by routine
           biochemical test after 144 weeks of treatment.

        2. Serological responses including percentage of patients with HBeAg loss or seroconversion
           and HBsAg loss or seroconversion with TDF and ETV treatment in Asian-American adults
           with CHB infection.

        3. To evaluate the three-year (one year treatment before enrollment and two year treatment
           after enrollment) the percentage of patient with anti-HBV drug resistance of TDF and
           ETV, including genotypic mutations in Asian-American adults with CHB.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18-70 year-old Asian-American male or female patients with HBeAg+ or HBeAg-CHB

          -  On TDF or ETV mono-therapy for 12-24 months, not previously exposed to other oral HBV
             drugs, nor received any type of interferon treatment in the past 12 months

          -  Be willing to participate

          -  Continuation of HBV treatment is medically indicated. That is for HBeAg-positive
             subjects, HBeAg remain positive or HBeAg becomes negative but still has detectable DNA
             by the PCR method; and for HBeAg-negative subjects, HBV DNA is either detectable or
             undetectable by the PCR method

          -  No clinical or virologic evidence of anti-HBV resistance to TDF treatment at the time
             of entering tests

             (140-age in years)(body weight [kg] )/((72)(serum creatinine [mg/dl]) ) [Note:
             multiply estimated rate 0. by 85 for women; use actual body weight]
