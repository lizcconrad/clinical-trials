  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label, single-arm, multi-center phase II trial is to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of novel pan-HER inhibitor, NOV120101 (Poziotinib), as a 2nd line
      monotherapy agent in lung adenocarcinoma patients with acquired resistance to prior EGFR
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acquired resistance to prior EGFR TKIs is considered as &quot;unmet medical need&quot; in clinical
      practice. To evaluate the efficacy of NOV120101 (Poziotinib) as a second-line monotherapeutic
      agent, patients with acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib will be enrolled in this
      study. Subjects will receive NOV120101 (Poziotinib) 16 mg PO once daily until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity development. Progression free survival (PFS) will be
      analyzed as the primary endpoint in this trial. Secondary endpoints including PFS rate at 16
      weeks, ORR and DCR will also be analyzed.
