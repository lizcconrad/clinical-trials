      This study aims to assess the risk of solid organ transplant (SOT) rejection following
      vaccination with Pandemrix™ and/ or seasonal influenza vaccination.

    <textblock>
      Data on the safety of pandemic H1N1 vaccination in transplanted patients is relatively
      limited; to date, although some studies showed transient increases in alloreactivity, there
      is no evidence that H1N1 vaccines caused clinical rejection or organ dysfunction. In
      addition, studies have shown that influenza infection is a known independent risk factors for
      rejection. Considering that transplant recipients are a target population for immunisation
      with future pandemic vaccines, it is important to investigate the risk of rejection following
      vaccination in this patient population.

      Using the self-controlled case series design that allows to control implicitly for potential
      confounding factors, this study aims at investigating the risk of solid organ transplant
      rejection (liver, kidney, lung, heart, pancreas) following vaccination with Pandemrix™ in the
      United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink GP Online Database (CPRD GOLD). Data from
      the Hospital Episodes Statistics database will also be used. The effect of seasonal influenza
      vaccination and of various infections including influenza H1N1 will also be explored.
