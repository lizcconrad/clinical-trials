  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of multiple doses of isavuconazole on the
      pharmacokinetics of prednisolone after single dose administration of prednisone. This study
      will also assess the safety and tolerability of isavuconazole alone and in combination with
      prednisone.
