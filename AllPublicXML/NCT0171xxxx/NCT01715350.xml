    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to perform exploratory evaluation of the treatment effectiveness and
      safety of PM012 Tablet of PuriMED Co., Ltd. at 2 doses in Korean patients with mild to
      moderate dementia of Alzheimer's type. To achieve this, this study aims to compare each dose
      with placebo control for the efficacy and safety to explore the clinically optimal dose of
      PM012 Tablet for therapeutic confirmatory (phase 3) clinical studies.
