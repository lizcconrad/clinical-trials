    <textblock>
      Background: depression during pregnancy is an important problem for public health. It has
      direct consequences for the affected woman, her children and family, and is a strong
      predictor of post-partum depression. In developing countries depression during pregnancy is
      highly common, and usually unrecognized and untreated.

      Aim: to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an intervention delivered by
      nurse assistants in the management of pregnant women with depression in primary care clinics
      that adopt the Family Health Strategy in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

      Method: PROGRAVIDA is a cluster randomized controlled trial with pregnant women with
      depression attending pre-natal care in 12 Primary Care Units with Family Health Program,
      covering an area of 400,000 inhabitants in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The intervention follows a
      stepped-care approach and is delivered by health professionals working at the primary care
      unit responsible by the care of the women. All women from the intervention group receive a
      program based on psycho-education and problem solving techniques, delivered by a nurse
      assistant at the women's homes. The program comprises 8 sessions, 6 during pregnancy and 2
      after delivery. Intensity of depressive symptoms is assessed using the PHQ-9, at the
      beginning of the sessions. Women with severe depression are referred to the family doctor and
      are assessed for the need of antidepressant medication. The control group receives routine
      care. The primary outcome is remission of depressive symptoms 4-months after the inclusion in
      the study. Secondary outcomes include remission of depressive symptoms at 6 months after
      delivery. Women are also assessed for socioeconomic and household characteristics, social
      support and obstetric complications. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the
      intervention will be assessed with intention-to-treat analysis, using the clinical outcome
      and the assessment of quality of life (EQ-5D) four months after inclusion in the trial.

    <textblock>
      Despite the high prevalence of depressive disorders in pregnancy and puerperium and the
      possible negative consequences of these frames for women, children and family, there are
      still very scarce evidence on the effectiveness of interventions of low cost and viable, that
      can be made available on the net of Primary Health Care in Brazil and other middle or low
      income countries.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a depression management
      program, simple and low cost, delivered by nurse assistants, in reducing symptoms of
      depression in pregnant women treated in primary care clinics that adopt the Family Health
      Strategy (FHS) in São Paulo, compared to routine care. We will also assess the
      cost-effectiveness of this intervention.

      We are conducting a community cluster randomized trial with pregnant women with symptoms of
      depression, attending antenatal care in primary care clinics that adopt the FHS in São Paulo.
      Participating clinics (12) were randomly allocated to have their nurse assistants receiving
      training and supervision to perform a program for management of depression among pregnant
      women (experimental group) or to offer routine care (control group).

    <description>The instrument contains 2 parts: a descriptive part that evaluates five domains (mobility, self care, usual activity, discomfort / pain and anxiety / depression). In this section a person assesses the current health on a scale 1-3 (none, moderate and severe). The respondent also makes self-evaluation through visual scale grading their health from 0 (worst possible) to 100 (best possible).</description>
