      Women and Reserve/National (RNG) Veterans are among the fastest growing groups of new VA
      users. While PTSD is prevalent in this group, most women don't access or complete needed
      treatment. This study will investigate OEF/OIF/OND RNG female war Veterans' perceptions,
      preferences, barriers and facilitators to accessing VA mental health (MH) and evidence-based
      PTSD psychotherapy. This information will be used to revise an existing web-based screen that
      educates participants about their unique post-deployment MH conditions. This web-interface
      will then be used to randomly assign women who screen positive for PTSD to either 1) a
      concierge nurse case manager who uses shared decision-making to engage Veterans in EBP or 2)
      usual outreach to determine what engagement approach women prefer. The investigators'
      findings will provide VA leaders with key information to understand and improve access to RNG
      PTSD treatment.

      Women and OEF/OIF/OND Reserve/National Guard (RNG) war Veterans are among the fastest growing
      groups of new VA users. Although PTSD is highly prevalent in this group of Veterans, most
      choose not to seek care for a variety of reasons. Facilitating access to mental health (MH)
      services for RNG OEF/OIF/OND female Veterans with PTSD is challenging and requires new
      approaches to outreach. Such approaches are urgently needed to mediate the severity of
      post-deployment MH conditions, alleviate concerns over MH diagnoses, and interrupt the cycle
      of chronicity found in many with PTSD. This gap between need for and use of VA PTSD services
      suggests that further research is needed to understand specific barriers to VA MH care and VA
      PTSD evidence-based psychotherapy (EBP). A web-based interface tailored to consumer needs has
      the potential to promote active engagement by Veterans in their health care. Considering that
      OEF/OIF combat Veterans enrolled in VA care report a preference to seek readjustment services
      or information over the internet, such an approach may have important advantages for engaging
      this group. Furthermore, evidence indicates that when patients are educated about their
      physical health conditions and treatment alternatives, shared decision-making results in
      increased treatment participation, better adherence to treatment recommendations, and better
      health outcomes. Although highly promising, web-based and shared-decision making approaches
      to facilitating VA MH treatment utilization are in need of further study.

      In Phase 1 of the project, the investigators will use qualitative methods to assess VA
      enrolled PTSD positive OEF/OIF/OND RNG female war Veterans' perceptions, preferences and
      barriers and facilitators to accessing VA MH services and EBP for PTSD. This information will
      be used to refine the investigators' existing web-based interface to better address these
      issues. Satisfaction with the revised interface will then be assessed. Phase 2 will focus on
      comparing the efficacy of two approaches to promoting VHA initiation. Participants who screen
      positive for PTSD on the web interface will be randomly assigned to: 1) Study concierge nurse
      case manager (NCM) facilitated shared decision making to assist with VA MH evaluation and
      treatment; or 2) existing outreach (current standard of care). Follow-up assessments will be
      conducted at 6 and 12 months to determine whether and where participants sought MH care (from
      both VA and non-VA resources).

      This study will provide valuable insights about this population's perceptions of VA MH
      services and of PTSD EBP, as well as their evolving use of VA and other community resources
      to address PTSD and other post-deployment MH needs. Furthermore, it will provide important
      information regarding the efficacy of relatively inexpensive and resource-sparing
      interventions that can be readily implemented within existing and emerging (e.g., Patient
      Alight Care Teams [PACT]) models of VA care delivery. While the proposed web interface and
      shared decision-making intervention are currently directed at RNG women Veterans
      post-deployment, there are clear implications for expansion to other populations and
      health/MH concerns, as well. Findings have important policy implications for several
      operational partners heavily invested in the improved access and delivery of evidence-based
      mental health care for Veterans with PTSD.
