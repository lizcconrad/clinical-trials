  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must have metastatic disease of the esophagus, gastroesophageal junction or
        stomach. Patients with locally recurrent disease who are not deemed eligible for radiation
        are also permitted.

        Histological, cytologic or radiographic documentation of metastatic adenocarcinoma or
        squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, gastroesophageal junction or stomach. Radiologic,
        endoscopic, histologic or cytologic evidence of locally recurrent disease is also
        permitted.

        Patients must be untreated with chemotherapy for metastatic or locally recurrent disease.
        Prior radiation therapy is permitted.

        Patients must have measurable disease as per RECIST 1.1, defined as at least one lesion
        that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded
        for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt;20 mm with conventional
        techniques or as &gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. See Section
        11 for the evaluation of measurable disease.

        Age &gt;18 years and â‰¤ 80 years.

        ECOG performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%, see Appendix A).

        Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

        Patients must have normal organ and marrow function.

        Patients must not have any of the following conditions:

        Recent major surgery, hormonal therapy (other than replacement) or chemotherapy, within 4
        weeks prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from the adverse events
        of treatment.

        History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
        composition to the chemotherapy on this trial.

        Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas
        or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse
        events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

        Patients who are receiving any investigational agents.

        Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of
        their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that
        would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

        History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
        composition to the chemotherapy used in the study.

        Concomitant use of phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates, rifampicin, phenobarbital, or St
        John's Wort; these drugs induce CYP3A and may decrease levels of taxanes. 5-FU is a strong
        CYP2C9 inducer, and concomitant use with carvedilol, celocoxib, fosphenytoin, fluoxetine,
        phenytoin, warfarin and other CYP2C9 substrates should be used with caution.

        Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
        infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, unstable cardiac
        arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
        requirements.

        Pregnant women are excluded from this study because chemotherapy has the potential for
        teratogenic or abortifacient effects.

        HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the
        potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, these
        patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive
        therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
        antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
