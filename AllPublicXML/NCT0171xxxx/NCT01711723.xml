  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In accordance with the recently revised FDA draft renal impairment guidance (March 2010)
      which advises the conduct of renal impairment study in drugs that are not predominately
      eliminated through the renal route, the proposed study will be conducted to formally assess
      the pharmacokinetics (PK) of darapladib in severely renally impaired subjects.

      In this is an open-label, non-randomized study eight subjects with severe renal impairment
      will be recruited along with 8 healthy control subjects matched to the severe renal
      impairment subjects based on gender, body mass index (plus or minus 20%) and age (plus or
      minus 10 years).

      All subjects will receive repeat oral doses of darapladib 160 milligram (mg) for 10
      consecutive days. The pharmacokinetics of darapladib and its metabolites; and safety and
      tolerability will be evaluated.

      All the subjects will be admitted to the clinic on the evening of Day -1. Subjects may check
      out of the clinic on Day 2 after all assessments are complete, but must return to the clinic
      each day (Days 3-8) for dosing and assessments. Subjects will be admitted to the clinic again
      on the evening of Day 9. After the last dose of the study drug, there will be a follow-up
      period which will include 2 visits (Day 20-24 and Day 38-52). The total study duration for
      each subject including the screening, treatment and follow-up periods will be approximately
      11 weeks.
