      STUDY DESIGN

        -  Screening

           − Assessment of the subject's eligibility to participate as determined by the
           inclusion/exclusion criteria.

        -  Biopsy schedule

           - Subjects will be biopsied according to the schedule in Section 7.

        -  Induction

             -  The recommended induction dose of ipilimumab is 3 mg/kg administered intravenously
                over a 90-minute period every 3 weeks for a total of four doses, as tolerated.

             -  Laboratory evaluations should be performed and the results examined before
                administration of each ipilimumab dose.

             -  As durable disease stabilization and/or objective tumor response can be seen after
                early progression before Week 12, it is recommended that, in the absence of
                dose-limiting toxicities (eg, serious immune-mediated adverse reactions), all four
                doses of ipilimumab be administered over the initial 12 weeks even in the setting
                of apparent clinical progression, providing the subject's performance status
                remains stable.

             -  All subjects who enter the induction period, including those who may have
                discontinued treatment for drug-related AEs and/or who have evidence of clinical
                progression during the induction period, should obtain a 12-week tumor assessment.

             -  Based on clinical experience in the ongoing and completed melanoma studies, the
                following recommendations apply for subject management in light of the Week 12 or
                later tumor assessments:

        -  The appearance of new lesions in subjects with other stable or shrinking baseline tumor
           burden may be experiencing clinical benefit and should continue in follow-up and/or
           maintenance therapy before alternative anti-cancer agents are considered. These subjects
           can be seen to have continued tumor shrinkage in follow-up scans.

        -  As long as overall tumor burden is stable or decreasing, subjects should remain in
           follow-up and/or maintenance (see below), even in the presence of new lesions.

        -  Clinical progression warranting alternative anti-cancer treatment should be considered
           only in subjects whose overall tumor burden appears to be substantially increased and/or
           in subjects whose performance status is decreased.

        -  Patients are eligible for retreatment treatments with ipilimumab on this protocol

        -  Follow-up

           − Subjects will be required to attend a follow-up visit within 90 days of the last
           ipilimumab treatment.

        -  Re-treatment

      Patients who received ipilimumab at any dose in a prior/parent study and have met each of the
      following criteria:

        -  Had no unacceptable toxicity requiring ipilimumab discontinuation; OR

        -  Patients who permanently discontinued treatment due to select irAEs as follows:

             1. Reversible autoimmune hepatitis

             2. Medically manageable endocrinopathy

             3. Reversible dermatological toxicity AND

        -  Have experienced documented disease progression after demonstrating expanded clinical
           benefit.

      Expanded clinical benefit is defined as:

        -  Patients whose disease is responding (partial response, complete response); or

        -  Patients whose disease was stable more than or equal to 3 months.

        -  Patients who demonstrated mixed or delayed response.

      The mixed or delayed response is defined as follows:

      Patients with Mixed Response: defined as at least 50% reduction in the bidimensional size of
      one or more non-cystic lesions, even in the presence of any new lesions.

      Patients with Delayed Response: defined as objective response (PR or CR) following
      progressive disease, occurring any time after Week 12 in the prior/parent protocol, in
      patients who have not received therapy with a non ipilimumab anti-cancer agent (approved or
      experimental) between the PD and objective response.

      Patients with select irAEs related to ipilimumab that have completely resolved with
      immunosuppressive therapy or are adequately controlled with hormone therapy, may be
      considered for further re-treatment with ipilimumab under this study, at the time of disease
      progression. The list of completely reversible or medically managed immune-related adverse
      events (irAEs) eligible for consideration are:

        -  Reversible autoimmune hepatitis

        -  Medically managed endocrinopathy

        -  Reversible dermatological toxicity All other irAEs are not considered eligible for
           re-treatment, including, but not limited to, greater or equal Grade 3 colitis or
           diarrhea, or uveitis of any grade.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Willing and able give written informed consent.

          2. Previously untreated (adjuvant interferon is acceptable), and histologically confirmed
             Stage III (unresectable) or Stage IV melanoma with at least 2 metastatic lesions, (one
             amenable to resection that measures over 0.75 cm3 by volume AND another amenable to 3
             X core biopsy OR resection that measures over 0.5 cm3) at study entry AND at least 1
             additional RECIST measurable lesion must be present for study entry, other than the 2
             identified for resection/biopsy, defined as a lesion that can be accurately measured
             in two perpendicular diameters, as per RECIST by CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical
             exam.

          3. Subjects with asymptomatic or previously treated brain metastases are only eligible
             for enrollment provided they have evidence of 30 day stability of the brain metastasis

             used (CT or MRI) at the baseline and 30 day time point. (Systemic steroids should be
             avoided if possible, or the subject should be stable on the lowest clinically
             effective dose of steroids as they may interfere with the activity of ipilimumab if
             administered at the time of the first ipilimumab dose.)

          4. Must be at least 28 days since treatment with surgery or radiation, or immunotherapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Sex and Reproductive Status: a) WOCBP and men of fathering potential who are unwilling
             or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for the entire study and for
             up to 26 weeks after the last dose of investigational product. Adequate contraception
             for women is defined as oral contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives or
             mechanical products such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm,
             condoms, spermicides), abstinence or sterile partner (eg, vasectomy). Adequate
             contraception for men is defined as abstinence, sterile partner, condoms, or
             vasectomy. b) Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          2. Target Disease Exceptions: a) Subjects on any other systemic therapy for cancer,
             including any other experimental treatment. b) Prior treatment with an anti-CTLA-4
             antibody if treatment failure was due to irAEs. If a subject was discontinued from the
             prior anti-CTLA-4 treatment due to an AE or SAE, regardless of the type of event, that
             discontinuation constitutes an exclusion criterion. If irAEs were serious enough to
             require a subject's withdrawal from prior treatment, the subject should be excluded
             from this study. c) Prior treatment with chemotherapy/biochemotherapy/immunotherapy
             for systemic disease for melanoma (prior treatment with IFN-alpha immunotherapy is
             allowed)..

          3. Primary ocular and mucosal melanomas are not allowed.

             documented history of inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and
             Crohn's disease are excluded from this study as are subjects with a history of
             symptomatic disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis
             [scleroderma], Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [eg, Wegener's
             Granulomatosis]). Subjects with motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (eg,
             Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Myasthenia Gravis) are excluded from this study. b) Any
             subject who has a life-threatening condition that requires high-dose
             immunosuppressant(s). c) Presence of known HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection,
             regardless of control on antiviral therapy. d) Subjects with melanoma who have another
             active, concurrent, malignant disease with the exception of subjects with adequately
             treated basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma
             in situ of the cervix.

          5. Other Exclusion Criteria: a) Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated.
             b) Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or
             physical (eg, infectious disease) illness. c) Any underlying medical or psychiatric
             condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could make the administration of
             ipilimumab hazardous or could obscure the interpretation of adverse events. d) Any
             non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases for up to 4
             weeks before or after any dose of ipilimumab, with the exceptions of amantadine and
             flumadine.

          6. Any acute or chronic treatment with warfarin or anti-platelet agent (aspirin is
             allowed up to a dose of 300 mg daily) including clopidogrel. Heparin, low molecular
             weight heparin, any heparinoid are allowed after appropriate cessation (usually 24
             hours prior to induction).

          7. Any known or suspected bleeding diathesis on the basis or personal or family history
             (including diagnoses of von Willebrands disease or other familial factor deficiency).

          8. The risk of the excision involves a significant risk of morbidity or mortality due to
             its size, location or vascularity (at the discretion of the principal investigators).
