             substantial changes in eating habits within 30 days prior to study initiation.

          4. Subjects must not have made a blood donation of one pint or more within 30 days prior
             to study initiation.

          5. Subjects must not have made a plasma donation within 14 days of study initiation.

          6. Participation in a clinical trial within 30 days prior to study initiation.

          7. Use of any over-the-counter (OTC) medication, including vitamins, herbal products, and
             dietary supplements, within 7 days prior to or during the study.
