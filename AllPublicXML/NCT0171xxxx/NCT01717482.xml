      The purpose of this study is to learn whether it is better to receive the drug Metformin with
      standard of care for lung cancer or just standard of care.

      Participants will need to be scheduled to undergo a surgical resection of their lung cancer
      at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. They will be asked to provide a blood sample prior to
      their surgery. Samples of tumor tissue and normal lung tissue will be taken from the samples
      removed during your lung surgery. The tissue will be used to evaluate DNA. A skin biopsy at
      the edge of the incision that has already been made will be done during your surgery. We will
      take the skin and grow skin fibroblasts. Then we will reprogram the skin fibroblasts into
      induced pluripotent cells. You will be &quot;randomized&quot; into one of the study groups to either
      take Metformin for 6 months with your standard of care follow up or to receive standard of
      care follow up.
