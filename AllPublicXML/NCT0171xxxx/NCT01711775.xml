      This single-center, non-randomized, open-label study will assess the pharmacokinetics of
      aleglitazar after administration of single and multiple oral doses in healthy Chinese
      volunteers. Subjects will receive a single oral dose of aleglitazar on Day 1 and repeated
      oral doses once daily from Day 5 to Day 14. Anticipated time on study, including screening
      and a 2-week follow-up, is up to 8 weeks.
