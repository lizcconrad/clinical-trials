      This is a pilot study that aims to develop a lung cancer screening program for workers in
      British Columbia, Canada exposed to asbestos who are at risk of developing lung
      cancer/pleural mesothelioma. This is high risk population is at of respiratory system
      diseases as a result of their occupational exposures. Additionally, knowledge garnered from
      this study will allow us to develop other studies that will further our understanding of
      asbestos related lung cancer and mesothelioma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women or men age 50 to 79 years

          -  history of exposure to asbestos at work and one or more of the following:

               -  lung cancer risk â‰¥2% over 3 years or

               -  asbestosis or pleural plaques on a chest x-ray or

               -  abnormal auto-antibodies level using the EarlyCDT test

          -  Capable of providing informed consent for screening procedures (low dose spiral CT,
             lung function, blood biomarkers).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any medical condition, such as severe heart disease (e.g. unstable angina, chronic
             congestive heart failure), acute or chronic respiratory failure, or any disorder, that
             in the opinion of the physician unlikely to benefit from screening due to shortened
             life-expectancy from co-existing illnesses

          -  Have been previously diagnosed with mesothelioma

          -  Have had other cancer within the past 5 years with the exception of the following
             cancers: non-melanomatous skin cancer,localized prostate cancer, carcinoma in situ
             (CIS) of the cervix, or superficial bladder cancer. Treatment of the exceptions must
             have ended &gt;6 months before registration into this study
