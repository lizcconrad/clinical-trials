      Nerve Transfer surgery can provide improved hand function following cervical spinal cord
      injuries
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current treatment strategies of acute cervical spinal cord injuries remain limited. Treatment
      options that provide meaningful improvements in patient quality of life and long-term
      functional independence will provide a significant public health impact.

      Specific Aim: Measure the efficacy of nerve transfer surgery in the treatment of patients
      with complete cervical spinal cord injuries with no hand function. Optimize the efficiency of
      nerve transfer surgery by evaluating patient outcomes in relation to patient selection and
      optimal timing the the surgery.

      Hypothesis: Peripheral nerve transfers in patients with spinal cord injuries will improve
      hand function and provide improvement in patient quality of life and functional independence.
