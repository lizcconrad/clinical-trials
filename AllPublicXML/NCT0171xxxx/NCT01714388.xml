  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Remifentanil (RMFNT) is a very short active opioid, used for analgesia during general
      anaesthesia and for analgesic and sedative effect in intensive care units (ICU) patients.
      Registration for anesthesia includes bolus dose and continuous infusion, in ICU only infusion
      regimen is allowed. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters of RMFNT results in rapid
      onset and offset of clinical effect, which makes this drug almost ideal in many situations.
      Unfortunately, its vagomimetic influence on cardiac activity may result in decrease of heart
      rate. It may be hypothesized that patients with parasympathetic predominance may be prone to
      more intense parasympathomimetic effect of this opioid. An optimal method for assessment of
      autonomic nervous system activity and assessment of influence of RMFNT on that activity is
      Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis. Parasympathetic predominance is expressed as high
      frequency (HF) power and HF/(LF+HF) (LF-low frequency) ratio in frequency domain and Root
      Mean Square of the Successive Difference (RMSSD), the number of pairs of successive NNs that
      differ by more than 50 ms (NN50), the proportion of NN50 divided by total number of NNs
      (pNN50) in time domain. The aim of this study is to verify the hypothesis that patients with
      predominance of parasympathetic activity are more subject to vagomimetic effect of RMFNT. HRV
      based on 5 minutes electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded before and after bolus dose of RMFNT will
      be analyzed. The occurrence of heart rate decrease will be than compared between patients
      with sympathetic and parasympathetic predominance measured prior to drug injection.
