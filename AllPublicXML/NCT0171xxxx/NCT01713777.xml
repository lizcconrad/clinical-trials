  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has specific rules generic drug
      companies must follow to get a generic copy of a seizure medication approved. Currently, the
      FDA approves generic drugs by requiring studies on normal volunteers who don't have epilepsy
      and who take just one dose of the generic drug followed by a series of blood tests. Some
      people with epilepsy and their physicians have complained about side effects or loss of
      seizure control when taking generic drugs, but no one knows if these complaints are truly
      because of problems with the generic drugs.

      When the FDA tests generic copies of lamotrigine (LTG), the blood levels measured after
      volunteers receive the generic lamotrigine tablets are allowed to fall within a specific
      range. This research will test whether two different manufacturer's generic lamotrigine, that
      fall in different parts of that range, perform in a similar way when given to people with
      epilepsy every day over a several week period. The two products will be called GENERIC A and
      GENERIC B.

      The generic forms of the study drug lamotrigine to be tested in this study are approved by
      the FDA for the treatment of seizures.

      Qualified subjects will be screened and upon fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria and
      signing the informed consent will be enrolled into the study and enter the randomization
      phase (2-30 days). Subjects will be randomized according to a sealed allocation list that
      will be balanced for sequence and provided to each site prior to the first subject
      enrollment. Subjects that withdraw prior to completing the second period will be replaced in
      a randomized manner. The randomization list will be generated by the study statistical group.
      There are four test periods in two sequences for a sequence-randomized study. During two test
      periods subjects will receive twice daily dosing of the &quot;low&quot; generic product and during the
      other two periods subjects will receive twice daily dosing of the &quot;high&quot; generic product.
      Each subject will return at the end of the 14+/-1 day stable dosing period for an in-facility
      12-hour pharmacokinetic (PK) session to collect samples to determine Cmax and AUCs (area
      under curve). Each in-facility pharmacokinetic testing will be separated by a 14+/-1 day
      stable dosing period. A final follow-up phone evaluation will be conducted 12-16 days (target
      14 days) after the last dose of study medication. A single make-up period will be permitted
      if there are issues during any single period. During the study the subjects will continue
      their usual concomitant medications, including AEDs (anti epilepsy drugs), without change.

      Investigators will compare the AED levels as measured by Cmax and AUC in each group using
      average bioequivalence (ABE) and individual bioequivalence (IBE) criteria. Average
      bioequivalence will be established if the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean of
      Cmax and AUCs for the most disparate generic products compared to each other are entirely
      within the 80%-125% range (the FDA criteria for bioequivalence) using the two one-sided
      standard analyses. Otherwise the products will be considered to not be bioequivalent.

      Study Population: Approximately 36 subjects (30 subjects to completion).

      Number of centers: 3 sites enrolling approximately 12 subjects each.

      Duration of study: Approximately 1 year.

          1. 18 years or older.

          2. BMI not less than 18.5 and weight not less than 110 pounds.

          3. Not donated blood within 56 days of the first pharmacokinetic testing.

          4. Agrees not to donate blood at any time during the trial and for 56 days after the
             final PK in-facility admission.

          5. Has had epilepsy for at least one year based on site PIs assessment.

          6. Receiving conventional (not extended release) lamotrigine as an antiepileptic drug in
             twice daily dosing at either 100 mg twice per day, 200 mg twice per day, 300 mg twice
             per day, or 400 mg twice per day.

          7. No changes in AED regimen (lamotrigine or concomitant AED) for at least 28 days prior
             to first pharmacokinetic testing.

          8. Have the ability to understand the informed consent form and be willing to provide
             informed consent.

          9. Willing to remain on same AED regimen through entire study. Subjects will be
             responsible to supply all of their concomitant medications (except for the study
             medication, lamotrigine).

         10. Willing to stay approximately 14 hours in the research facility on four separate
             occasions for pharmacokinetic testing.

         11. Willing to fast overnight and the morning of each of the four pharmacokinetic testing
             sessions.

         12. Willing to have at least 21 blood samples collected during the pharmacokinetic testing
             including the in-facility session and outpatient portion for each period. The
             in-facility blood collections will mainly be performed using an inserted catheter. In
             the event of difficulty with the catheter or by subject preference, samples may be
             drawn by venipuncture. The outpatient portion consists of morning trough levels within
             +/-1 hour of the morning scheduled dose time on the 2 days prior to each research
             facility PK admission drawn by venipuncture for each of the 4 periods. The total
             amount of blood during each PK session will be equal to about 12 teaspoons (58.5
             milliliters). The total amount of blood drawn throughout the entire study will be
             about 62 teaspoons (309.5 milliliters) or less. For reference, this amount is
             approximately two-thirds of the quantity of blood drawn during a standard blood
             donation by the Red Cross.

         13. Willing to completely abstain from alcohol consumption for at least 72-hours prior to
             each PK in-facility admission (that is from 1 day prior to the first outpatient steady
             state level) until after the last sample is drawn for each period. Investigators
             encourage no or minimal alcohol use throughout the study, but alcohol is not
             restricted at other times.

         14. Willing to remain on a consistent regimen of concomitant medications including
             over-the-counter drugs and herbal drugs, if they are being used and deemed to possibly
             affect the metabolism of the study medication.

         15. Willing to not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice through the duration of the
             study.

         16. If a tobacco user, willing to continue with the same pattern of tobacco use except
             that no tobacco use is permitted during the PK facility admissions of approximately 14
             hours (includes all tobacco products).

         17. Willing to complete the subject diary as outlined in the protocol.

         18. Willing to adhere to all other protocol requirements as outlined in the informed
             consent document.

         19. Females must be either of non-childbearing potential (defined as having undergone
             surgical sterilization or postmenopausal (greater than 50 years old and amenorrhea for

                  spermicide)

               2. Hormonal contraceptive treatment (progesterone only agents - use of any agents
                  containing estrogen are an exclusion for the lamotrigine testing)

               3. Intrauterine Device (IUD)

               4. Monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner
