  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  The human T-cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1 causes adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Infection
           does not immediately cause ATL, but it can develop over time. ATL is a rare and
           aggressive type of cancer that disrupts the body s ability to control the HTLV-1 virus.
           It also affects the growth and reproduction of cells infected with the virus.

        -  Ruxolitinib is a drug that has been approved to treat bone marrow disorders. It can
           interfere with the proteins that are important to the development and growth of ATL
           cells. Drugs like ruxolitinib may be able to interrupt important activity in ATL cells.
           Researchers want to see if ruxolitinib can be a safe and effective treatment for ATL.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of ruxolitinib for adult T-cell leukemia.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have ATL caused by HTLV-1.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected. Imaging studies will also be performed.

        -  Participants will take ruxolitinib twice a day for 28 days. They will have blood tests
           on days 1, 14, and 28. These tests will look at the levels of HTLV-1 in the blood.
           Participants will have a final blood test about 2 weeks later. Treatment will also be
           monitored with imaging studies.

        -  Participants who have a partial response during treatment may be able to start taking
           ruxolitinib again after the final blood test. They will continue to take ruxolitinib for
           as long as it is effective and the side effects are not severe.

        -  Participants who have a full response during treatment will take ruxolitinib for 56 more
           days, and then stop treatment. If ATL returns, they may restart treatment and continue
           it for as long as it is effective.

      Background:

        -  Adult T-cell leukemia is a lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the presence of
           CD4/CD25 expressing T cells (IL-2R alpha expressing) in the peripheral blood, in
           lymphoid and other tissues.

        -  In smoldering and chronic ATL the HTLV-1 encoded protein, Tax constitutively activates
           interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-9 and IL-15 autocrine/paracrine systems that in turn activate
           the Janus kinase (JAK)-1/3/STAT5 pathways.

        -  Ruxolitinib a therapeutic agent inhibits cytokine mediated JAK1/2 activation and ex vivo
           proliferation of malignant T cells from patients with ATL.

        -  Ruxolitinib is a potent orally bioavailable JAK1/2 inhibitor.

      Primary Objective:

      - To determine the clinical response rate of patients with smoldering or chronic ATL to
      ruxolitinib when administered at a dose of 20 mg orally twice a day for 28 days.

      Eligibility

        -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years old with pathologically confirmed adult
           T-cell leukemia: smoldering or chronic or previously treated lymphomatous or acute
           subtypes with clinically indolent behavior indicated by lack of significant symptoms and
           treatment free interval of greater than 6 months.

        -  Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease. Patients with &gt; 10% of their PBMCs
           having the characteristic abnormal (i.e., CD3dim, CD4 plus CD25 plus expressing) FACS
           profile for circulating ATL cells will be considered to have measurable disease.

        -  Patients with symptomatic leukemic meningitis, bony or GI tract involvement, serum
           calcium or LDH &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal will be excluded. However patients
           that have both ATL and another HTLV-1 associated disease such as tropical spastic
           paraparesis (HAM/TSP) will be included.

        -  No prior treatment with a JAK inhibitor.

      Design

      - This is a phase II open-label, trial of oral ruxolitinib that will enroll 20 patients with
      smoldering or chronic ATL. The patients will be treated with the standard dosage and schedule
      (20 mg orally twice daily) approved by the FDA for the treatment of Myelofibrosis.

          -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years old with pathologically confirmed adult T-
             cell leukemia: smoldering or chronic adult T- cell leukemia as defined by Shimoyama.
             Patients with previously treated lymphomatous or acute subtypes with clinically
             indolent behavior indicated by lack of significant symptoms and treatment free
             interval of greater than 6 months may also be considered eligible.

          -  Patients must have serum antibodies directed to HTLV-1.

          -  Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease. Patients with &gt; 10% of the PBMCs
             having the characteristic abnormal (i.e., CD3dim, CD4 plus CD25 plus expressing) FACS
             profile for circulating ATL cells will be considered to have evaluable disease.

          -  Patients must have adequate physiologic parameters:

          -  Absolute granulocyte count greater than or equal to 500 K/microL, platelet count
             greater than or equal to 75,000 K/microL and hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10
             g/dL.

          -  Bilirubin and creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times institutional ULN.

          -  AST, ALT less than or equal to 3.0 times institutional ULN.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Score greater than or equal to 70% or ECOG less than or equal 1.

          -  Patients must be able to understand and sign Informed Consent Form.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients previously treated with a JAK inhibitor.

          -  Patients with symptomatic leukemic meningitis, bony or GI tract involvement, serum
             calcium or LDH &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal will be excluded. However,
             patients that have both ATL and another HTLV-1 associated disease such as tropical
             spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) will be included.

          -  Patients who have received high doses of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of
             their ATL within 4 weeks prior to the start of therapy.

          -  Patients who have received any cytotoxic therapy, immunotherapy, antitumor vaccines or
             monoclonal antibodies in the 4 weeks prior to the start of the study.

          -  Life expectancy of less than 3 months.

          -  Documented active bacterial infections, active or chronic hepatitis B with evidence of
             end organ damage or dysfunction, hepatitis C or HTLV-II infection.

          -  - A positive hepatitis B serology indicative of previous immunization (i.e., HBsAb
             positive and HBc Ab negative), or a fully resolved acute hepatitis B infection is not
             an exclusion criterion.

          -  Patients who have untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are not eligible for
             this study because by definition they have a defective immune response and are at much
             higher risk for opportunistic infections due to immune disregulation by both HTLV-1
             and HTLVIII (HIV) viruses. Patients on HIV therapy with undetectable viral loads as
             measured by HIV RNA quantitative real time PCR may be eligible.

          -  Pregnant and breast-feeding patients are not eligible for the study because the
             effects of ruxolitinib on the developing fetus are unknown.

          -  Inability or refusal to practice effective contraception during therapy. Men and women
             of childbearing potential must use an effective method of birth control or abstinence
             during treatment and for 4 months after completion of the treatment.

          -  Patient has significant and/or uncontrolled cardiac, renal, hepatic or other systemic
             disorders or significant psychological conditions at baseline visit that in the
             investigator s judgment would jeopardize subject enrollment or compliance with the
             study procedures.
