      This is a prospective, single-center, pilot clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the
      Ulthera® System to improve jawline definition and submental skin laxity. Changes from
      baseline in the Fitzpatrick Facial Wrinkle Scale and facial pigmentation will be assessed at
      study follow-up visits. Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale scores, patient satisfaction
      questionnaires, and quality of life questionnaires will be obtained.
