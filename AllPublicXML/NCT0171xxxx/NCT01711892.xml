  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) is standard treatment for locally advanced or advanced
      Prostate Cancer (PC).

      The musculoskeletal toxicity associated with ADT is well established, leading to a decrease
      in muscle mass, increased fat percentage, weight gain, sexual dysfunction and increased risk
      of depression, fatigue, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and reduced quality of life.

      Numerous studies have shown an association between physical activity, physical capacity and
      quality of life in cancer patients and recent epidemiological research suggest that regular,
      moderate-intensity physical activity may have a positive effect on survival in men with
      prostate cancer.

      Within exercise physiology there is new evidence pointing to recreational soccer as a unique
      form of intermittent exercise that effectively stimulates aerobic and anaerobic energy
      delivery systems, leading to beneficial musculoskeletal, metabolic and cardiovascular
      adaptations of importance for health.

      It is our overall hypothesis that 12 weeks of recreational soccer training 2-3 times per week
      will improve the health profile of PC patients receiving ADT treatment.
