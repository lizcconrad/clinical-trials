  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychosocial risks are significant in the management of patients with cardiovascular disease
      and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) devices. This is a randomized, controlled,
      clinical study. The hypothesis is that adapted yoga (vs. usual care) will significantly
      reduce psychosocial risks (e.g. anxiety and depression symptoms) and improve the quality of
      life in ICD patients. The specialized, real-time data, collected by the device provides a
      unique look at the electrophysiological parameters of each patient's heart.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All intervention data will be analyzed to determine the statistical significance of the data,
      and to accept or reject the hypothesis. In addition, the researcher will conduct supplemental
      interviews with patients who have lived with the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
      device for at least six months and who are not in the intervention. The qualitative data
      gathered from these interviews will document concepts of illness and healing and general
      beliefs about mind-body interventions.
