  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prospectively evaluate whether use of combined radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and
      percutaneous iodine-125 (125I) seeds implantation results in better survival compared with
      use of RFA alone in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

      This study was local ethical committee approved; all patients gave written informed consent.
      A total of 136 patients were randomly assigned to undergo RFA-125I (n = 68; 42 men, 26 women;
      mean age, 50.7 years; age range, 29-73 years) or RFA alone (n = 68; 47 men, 21 women; mean
      age, 48.9 years; age range, 30-74 years). Patients with viable tumors at computed tomography
      (CT) 4 weeks after treatment received additional treatment. Rates of local tumor progression
      and overall survival were evaluated by using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests, respectively.
      The relative prognostic significance of variables in predicting overall survival and the time
      to tumor recurrence or metastasis were assessed with multivariate Cox proportional hazards
      regression and logistic regression analyses, respectively.

    <description>The primary endpoint was the time to recurrence(TTR) was measured from the date of treatment to the time when the recurrent tumor was first diagnosed. At spiral CT after treatment, residual viable tumor tissue was considered to be present if enhancing areas were seen within the tumor on either arterial phase or portal venous phase images. Depending on the initial random treatment assignment, RFA-125I or RFA alone was repeated. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed if there was uncertainty at CT as to whether residual viable tumor tissue was present.</description>

    <description>For RFA, we used a commercially available system (RF 2000; Radio Therapeutics, Mountain View, Calif) and a needle electrode with a 15-gauge insulated cannula that had 10 hook-shaped expandable electrode tines with a diameter of 3.5 cm at expansion (LeVeen; Radio Therapeutics).The radioactivity per seed ranged from 0.5 to 0.6 millicuries (mCi)</description>

    <description>The 125I seeds (0.8 mm in diameter and 4.5mm in length) were enclosed in a NiTinol capsule (China Institute of Atomic Energy, Beijing). These seeds could produce 27.4-31.5 keV X-ray and 35.5 Kev Î³ ray, with a half-life of 59.6 days. The radioactivity per seed ranged from 0.5 to 0.6 millicuries (mCi).</description>
