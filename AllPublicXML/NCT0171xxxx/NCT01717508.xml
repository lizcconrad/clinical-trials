  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to examine how cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a common
      treatment for adolescent depression, affects brain functioning. Depressed adolescents will
      complete an initial assessment consisting of an interview, questionnaires, computer tasks,
      and an EEG recording. EEG (electroencephalography) measures brain activity by recording the
      electrical activity along the scalp caused by the firing of neurons within the brain. They
      will then complete 12 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy, which will be 50 minutes long
      and held once a week for 12 weeks. Before their third therapy session, participants will
      complete a computer task while EEG data are recorded. After completing the treatment, the
      participants will complete a final assessment, which will include questionnaires, computer
      tasks, and an EEG recording. They will also complete follow-up assessments over the phone 1,
      3, and 6 months after completing the treatment.

      This study will also include healthy control participants. They will complete an initial
      assessment consisting of an interview, questionnaires, computer tasks, and an EEG recording.
      Three weeks later, they will return to complete a behavioral task while EEG data are
      recorded. Twelve weeks after the initial assessment, they will complete a final assessment,
      which will include questionnaires, computer tasks, and an EEG recording.

      The purpose of the study is to examine the impact of individual cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT) for adolescent depression on neural functioning. Specifically, the study will utilize
      Brent and Poling's (1997) cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) manual (Cognitive Therapy
      Treatment Manual for Depressed and Suicidal Youth), and investigators will examine pre- to
      post- neural activity patterns for children and adolescents who receive individual CBT for
      depression. Electroencephalography (EEG) techniques will be utilized to assess
      treatment-related effects on brain activity (i.e., anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex functioning). Neural activity patterns will also be compared to
      non-depressed, healthy controls.
