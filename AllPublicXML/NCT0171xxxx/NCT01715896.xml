  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study is to explore the efficacy of mavrilimumab compared with
      golimumab in the treatment of adult subjects 18-80 years of age with moderate-to-severe
      active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have an inadequate response to one or more conventional
      disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and/or one or two anti-tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) agents (excluding golimumab) for efficacy or safety reasons.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the therapeutic improvements with recent biologic agents approved for rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA), there is still a significant unmet medical need for the treatment of subjects
      with this chronic disease to achieve a faster, more complete response, and higher rates of
      remission. The aim of the current study is to compare the efficacy and safety of a
      subcutaneous dose of mavrilimumab with a marketed treatment for RA (golimumab) in 120 adult
      subjects with moderate-to-severe active RA who have had an inadequate response to one or two
      anti-TNF agents with mavrilimumab. The design of the study was exploratory and not formerly
      statistically powered.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Pulmonary Function Test Values Below Threshold Values Based on Percent Change From Baseline at Day 85 and 169</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 85 and 169</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function testing were performed by spirometry to assess forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced expiratory volume in 6 second (FEV6), forced vital capacity (FVC), and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). FEV1 was the maximal volume of air exhaled in the first second of a forced expiration from a position of full inspiration. FEV6 was the maximal volume of air exhaled in the six second of a forced expiration from a position of full inspiration. FVC was the volume of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. DLCO is a pulmonary function test that measures the partial pressure difference between inspired and expired carbon monoxide. The percentage of predicted values of these pulmonary function tests were calculated based on decreases from baseline and categorized as more than (&gt;) 20% reduction (RD) and absolute value (AV) less than (&lt;) 80% predicted (PR).</description>

        <description>The HAQ-DI: 20-item scale assessing participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arising, eating, hygiene, walking, reaching, grip, and errands/chores over past week. Each item was scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range from 0 to 3; where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty. Participants with change from baseline more than or equal to (&gt;=) 0.25 were reported. The percentage of participants were calculated by logistic regression model method.</description>

          <description>The HAQ-DI: 20-item scale assessing participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arising, eating, hygiene, walking, reaching, grip, and errands/chores over past week. Each item was scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range from 0 to 3; where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty. Participants with change from baseline more than or equal to (&gt;=) 0.25 were reported. The percentage of participants were calculated by logistic regression model method.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and Day 169 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. TEAE and TESAE were reported as per relatedness and severity.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Pulmonary Function Test Values Below Threshold Values Based on Percent Change From Baseline at Day 85 and 169</title>
        <description>Pulmonary function testing were performed by spirometry to assess forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced expiratory volume in 6 second (FEV6), forced vital capacity (FVC), and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). FEV1 was the maximal volume of air exhaled in the first second of a forced expiration from a position of full inspiration. FEV6 was the maximal volume of air exhaled in the six second of a forced expiration from a position of full inspiration. FVC was the volume of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. DLCO is a pulmonary function test that measures the partial pressure difference between inspired and expired carbon monoxide. The percentage of predicted values of these pulmonary function tests were calculated based on decreases from baseline and categorized as more than (&gt;) 20% reduction (RD) and absolute value (AV) less than (&lt;) 80% predicted (PR).</description>

          <description>HAQ-DI: participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item was scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range from 0 to 3; where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>
