    <textblock>
      To evaluate 18F-AV-133 imaging of the pancreas in patients with early type 2 diabetes, late
      type 2 diabetes, subjects with pre-diabetes and in healthy overweight/obese control subjects.
      These subjects will also be evaluated for beta-cell function as measured by the insulin and
      C-peptide response to a challenge with intravenous arginine under basal and glucose enhanced
      conditions.
