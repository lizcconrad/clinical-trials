  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to reduce the length of stay after liver surgery by taking account
      of objective quantitative clinical variables, subjective qualitative clinical variables and
      non clinical variables.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      a new dimension of the activity expected of physicians is to improve the safety of care on
      the one hand and the control of health care costs on the other.

      key measures to help them are the publication of national recommendations, assessment of
      actual practices and the incentive to activity.

      Internationalwide recent and concordant data suggest that

        -  quality and security of care, after an initial improvement, are going to stall

        -  scientific recommendations are rarely validated by an impact analysis and are not
           applied

        -  clinical data collected within an administrative framework are unreliable and too
           generalist

        -  the evaluation, especially in the surgical field, is based on indicators sometimes
           irrelevant and often unclear
