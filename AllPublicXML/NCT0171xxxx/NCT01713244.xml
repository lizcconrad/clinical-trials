  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RFA has become a standard method in the treatment of small HCC(≤2 cm) due to its ease of use,
      safety, cost-effectiveness, and minimal invasiveness. It can ablated and blocked the small
      vessels while destroyed the tumor cell in situ. Surgical resection is the most widely
      accepted treatment for the patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in the Asian
      countries. But the effectiveness of hepatectomy was depressed because of the high recurrence
      rate. The spreading of the cancer cell along the portal vein or the hepatic vein system
      during the operation account for the tumor recurrence. Using RFA to ablate and block the
      small vessels around the tumor before resection will reduce the spreading of the cancer cell.
      Investigators hypothesized that the RFA assisted hepatectomy might result in lower recurrence
      rate than hepatectomy alone in the treatment of advanced HCC. Thus, the purpose of this study
      was to prospectively compare the effects of RFA assisted hepatectomy with hepatectomy alone
      for the treatment of advanced HCC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of HCC confirmed at our hospital.

          2. Intrahepatic tumor count no higher than 3 and a minimum tumor diameter &gt; 3 cm, but no
             more than 8cm.

          3. Liver function of Child-Pugh Class A or B.

          4. Tumors lacked intrahepatic and extrahepatic metastasis.

          5. Tumors had not invaded the portal vein, the hepatic vein trunk or the secondary
             branches.

          6. Indocyanine green retention at 15 minutes (ICG-15) of &lt;10%.

          7. No evidence of coagulopathy: platelet count &gt; 50 × 109/L and a prolonged prothrombin
             time of &lt; 5 seconds.

          8. No other anti-tumor therapy received before the treatment. -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients met the inclusion criteria but declined to participate.

             severe hypersplenism syndrome, or refractory ascites.

          3. Patients whose permanent pathology after treatment suggested metastatic liver cancer
