                  colon neoplasia,or

               2. is aged 55 to 70.

          -  Part A: Subjects need to be without any history of clinically significant

          -  Positive serology for chronic viral hepatitis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at
             screening.

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within the 12 months prior to dosing or evidence of
