             trial medication until the end of Day 21

          -  Participation in a drug trial within 30 days prior to start of trial medication.
             Participation in a trial involving administration of [14C] labeled compound(s) within

          <description>Part A: Subjects were administered with unlabeled pimasertib capsules orally at a single dose of 60 milligram (mg) on Day 1. One hour after administration of the oral unlabeled pimasertib dose, the intravenous (IV) tracer dose of 9 kilobecquerel (kBq) [14C] pimasertib was administered as a bolus injection. On Days 3-21 (except Day 8), subjects received unlabeled pimasertib capsules orally at a dose of 60 mg twice daily (BID). In the morning of Day 8, subjects received 60 mg unlabeled pimasertib capsules spiked with a dose of 2.6 megabecquerel (MBq) (70 microcuries [mcgCi]) of [14C] pimasertib orally. In the evening of Day 8, subjects received the evening dose of 60 mg pimasertib as unlabeled pimasertib capsules orally. Part B : Subjects were administered with 60 mg BID unlabeled pimasertib as oral capsules continuously in cycles of 21 days until progression of the disease, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent by the subject, loss to follow-up or death.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs, TEAEs Leading to Death, and TEAEs Leading to Discontinuation</title>
        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug administration until 30+/-2 days after the last dose of study drug administration that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre treatment state.</description>
        <time_frame>Part A and B: From the first dose of study drug administration until 30+/-2 days after the last dose of study drug administration, assessed up to 18 months</time_frame>
        <population>The safety analysis set included all subjects who received at least one administration of trial medication and have at least one subsequent safety assessment.</population>

            <description>Subjects were administered with unlabeled pimasertib capsules orally at a single dose of 60 milligram (mg) on Day 1. One hour after administration of the oral unlabeled pimasertib dose, the intravenous (IV) tracer dose of 9 kilobecquerel (kBq) [14C] pimasertib was administered as a bolus injection. On Days 3-21 (except Day 8), subjects received unlabeled pimasertib capsules orally at a dose of 60 mg twice daily (BID). In the morning of Day 8, subjects received 60 mg unlabeled pimasertib capsules spiked with a dose of 2.6 megabecquerel (MBq) (70 microcuries [μCi]) of [14C] pimasertib orally. In the evening of Day 8, subjects received the evening dose of 60 mg pimasertib as unlabeled pimasertib capsules orally. Part B : Subjects were administered with 60 mg BID unlabeled pimasertib as oral capsules continuously in cycles of 21 days until progression of the disease, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent by the subject, loss to follow-up or death.</description>
