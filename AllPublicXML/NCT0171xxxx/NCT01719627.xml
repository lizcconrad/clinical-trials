  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a method of preventing HIV infection through the use of
      antiretroviral (ARV) medications before exposure to HIV. This study will assess the potential
      of MVC as a &quot;on demand&quot; pre-exposure prophylaxis, within a strategy for the prevention of HIV
      infection in men who have sex with men (MSM).

    <textblock>
      Several clinical trials are currently under way evaluating the safety and effectiveness of
      ARV-based PrEP for preventing HIV infection. The results of the first efficacy trials of
      ARV-based PrEP showed fewer HIV infections among study participants receiving the study drugs
      compared to those receiving placebo. Although the results are promising, concerns about
      adherence, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity still needs further exploration so new and more
      effective preventive pharmacological approaches should be evaluated. This trial will evaluate
      the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of ex vivo HIV infection of rectal mucosa by the
      CCR5 antagonist drug maraviroc (Selzentry) administered to healthy volunteers. This trial
      will last approximately one year. Twenty-one volunteers will receive MVC 300 mg orally in a
      single dose. Study visits will occur at enrollment and at days 0, 7, 9, 14 and 16. All study
      visits will include a physical examination, blood collection and storage and in the basal
      visit and a day 7 or 9 the participants will undergo a colonoscopy. Ex vivo HIV infectivity
      in rectal mucosa biopsies and plasma/mucosa MVC levels will be evaluated.
