    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis under test is that administration of a CCR2/5 antagonist to subjects
      with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy will result in a reduction in urinary albumin, a
      surrogate for improved glomerular filtration.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of protein in the urine (proteinuria) often implies kidney disease. Protein and creatinine concentrations were obtained from spot urine samples.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) Using the Abbreviated Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Formula at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>eGFR was calculated using the MDRD equation and normalized to 1.73 m^2 body surface area. Age and corresponding creatinine at each visit (Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16) were used to calculate GFR</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in eGFR Using Cystatin Formula at Weeks 12 and 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Serum cystatin C may be a more reliable endogenous marker of GFR than serum creatinine. eGFR was calculated using the Cystatin Formula and normalized to 1.73 m^2 body surface area.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Serum Creatinine at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>Serum creatinine is an indicator of kidney function. Creatinine is a substance formed from the metabolism of creatine, commonly found in blood, urine, and muscle tissue. It is removed from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in urine. Normal adult blood levels of creatinine=45 to 90 micromoles per liter (mcmol/L) for females, 60 to 110 mcmol/L for males, however normal values are age-dependent. Change from baseline=creatinine level at Week 1, 4, 8, 12 or 16 minus baseline level where higher scores represented decreased kidney function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Serum Cystatin C at Weeks 12 and 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Cystatin C is a protein which is mainly used as a biomarker of kidney function. If kidney function and GFR decline, the blood levels of cystatin C rise.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time. As the average amount of plasma glucose increases, the fraction of HbA1c increases in a predictable way.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 16 (follow-up visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The following laboratory parameters were analyzed for abnormalities at any time point mentioned in the timeframe: clinical chemistry (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, phosphate, glucose, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, albumin, calcium, bilirubin [total, direct, and indirect], gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], lactic dehydrogenase [LDH], alkaline phosphatase, creatine phosphokinase [CPK], uric acid, amylase and lipase); hematology (hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell [RBC] count, white blood cell [WBC] count with differential, and platelet count); FSH (for postmenopausal women who had been amenorrheic for less than 2 years prior to screening).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Potentially Clinically Significant Electrocardiogram (ECG) Findings</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 1, 4 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Criteria for potentially clinically important ECG values were defined as: PR interval &gt;=300 milliseconds (msec) or &gt;=25%/50% increase when baseline is &gt;200 msec and ≥50% increase when baseline is less than or equal to (&lt;=)200 msec; QRS interval &gt;=140 msec or &gt;=50% increase from baseline (IFB); QTc &gt;=450 msec or &gt;=30 msec increase; corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt;=450 msec or &gt;=30 msec increase.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 28 days after last study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence without regard to causality in a participant who received study drug. A SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of treatment and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Serum Creatinine at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16</title>
        <description>Serum creatinine is an indicator of kidney function. Creatinine is a substance formed from the metabolism of creatine, commonly found in blood, urine, and muscle tissue. It is removed from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in urine. Normal adult blood levels of creatinine=45 to 90 micromoles per liter (mcmol/L) for females, 60 to 110 mcmol/L for males, however normal values are age-dependent. Change from baseline=creatinine level at Week 1, 4, 8, 12 or 16 minus baseline level where higher scores represented decreased kidney function.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Serum Creatinine at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16</title>
          <description>Serum creatinine is an indicator of kidney function. Creatinine is a substance formed from the metabolism of creatine, commonly found in blood, urine, and muscle tissue. It is removed from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in urine. Normal adult blood levels of creatinine=45 to 90 micromoles per liter (mcmol/L) for females, 60 to 110 mcmol/L for males, however normal values are age-dependent. Change from baseline=creatinine level at Week 1, 4, 8, 12 or 16 minus baseline level where higher scores represented decreased kidney function.</description>
