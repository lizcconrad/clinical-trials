    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to conduct a human trial of [C-11]OMAR, a new PET imaging
      agent for the brain cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1), to determine its pharmacokinetics and
      binding characteristics.

      This is a pilot, 2-part study to assess the kinetics of radioactivity in medically healthy
      subjects, subjects with alcohol dependency (AD), and obese subjects following the intravenous
      administration of the imaging agent [C-11]OMAR.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Are overtly healthy males or females (other than AD or obesity), as determined by
             medical history and physical examination. Males and females with stable medical
             problems that, in the investigator's opinion, will not significantly alter the
             disposition of the drug, will not place the subject at increased risk by participating
             in the study, and will not interfere with interpretation of the data.

          2. Are between the ages of 18 and 65 years, inclusive.

          3. Have clinical laboratory test results within normal reference range for the population
             or investigator site, or results with acceptable deviations that are judged to be not
             clinically significant by the investigator. (Note: specific laboratory tests are
             listed in section 3.4)

          4. Have arterial access sufficient to allow blood sampling as per the protocol.

          5. Are reliable and willing to make themselves available for the duration of the study
             and are willing to follow study procedures.

          6. Have given written informed consent approved by the ethical review board governing the
             site.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Are currently enrolled in, or discontinued within the last [30 days] from, a clinical
             trial involving an off-label use of an investigational drug or device, or are
             concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be
             scientifically or medically compatible with this study.

          2. Current substance abuse (other than AD) including marijuana use, or severe systemic
             disease based on history and physical exam.

          3. Laboratory tests with clinically significant abnormalities or positive urine
             toxicology screen. (Note: specific laboratory tests are listed in section 3.4)

          4. Prior participation in other research protocols in the last year such that radiation
             exposure would exceed the annual limits.

          5. Presence of ferromagnetic metal in the body or heart pacemaker.

          6. Are persons who have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other
             study investigating [C-11]OMAR.

          7. Regularly use known drugs of abuse (other than alcohol) within 30 days of the study
             and/or show positive findings on urinary drug screening.

          8. Show evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or positive human HIV
             antibodies.

          9. Are women with a positive pregnancy test or women who are lactating.

         10. Have a history of head trauma with prolonged loss of consciousness (&gt;10 minutes), or
             any neurological condition including stroke or seizure (excluding a single childhood
             febrile seizure) or a history of migraine headaches

         11. History of adverse drug reactions or intolerance to more than three types of
             systemically administered medications

         12. Have used any prescription medication (except for oral contraceptives or hormone
             replacement therapy) or over-the-counter medication (including herbal remedies or diet
             aids) within 14 days of the imaging session. Multiple vitamins are specifically
             permitted

         13. Have implanted or embedded metal objects or fragments in the head or body that would
             present a risk during the MRI scanning procedure, or have worked with ferrous metals
             either as a vocation or hobby (for example, as a sheet metal worker, welder, or
             machinist) in such a way that might have led to unknown, indwelling metal fragments
             that could cause injury if they moved in response to placement in the magnetic field

         14. Have had exposure to ionizing radiation that in combination with the study tracer
             would result in a cumulative exposure that exceeds recommended exposure limits
