    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to examine the neurophysiology of hypersomnia during sleep and
      wakefulness, to identify biomarkers for excessive sleepiness in neuropsychiatric disorders,
      and pilot acoustical slow wave induction during sleep in patients with hypersomnolence, to
      determine if this decreases daytime sleepiness in these patients. The primary study
      hypotheses are that individuals with hypersomnolence will have reduced slow wave activity
      (SWA) during sleep and increased waking theta/alpha activity during wake in specific brain
      regions. A secondary hypothesis is that acoustical slow wave induction in hypersomnolent
      patients will increase SWA during sleep, reduce theta/alpha activity during wake, and improve
      subjective sleepiness.

    <description>Brief tones (50 millisecond duration) at a frequency of 0.8 and 2 Hz, a rate that approximates the natural cellular oscillations of cortical neurons during sleep, will be played in blocks of 15-20 during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Blocks of active acoustic slow wave induction will be followed by blocks of equal duration without induction, in order to make comparisons between stimulation periods (ON) and no stimulation periods (OFF). Tone intensity will be manually adjusted so as to be above an individual participant's auditory threshold during waking, but still quiet enough as not to awaken the subject from sleep. Sham slow wave induction will consist of auditory tones played prior to sleep, and during sleep of insufficient timing and intensity to alter slow wave activity.</description>

        Subjects will be recruited from the greater Madison, WI area. Hypersomnolent subject groups
        (n=30 in each group) may include unipolar MDD with hypersomnolence, primary hypersomnia
        (idiopathic hypersomnia), bipolar disorder with hypersomnolence, and narcolepsy.
        Non-hypersomnolent comparison groups (n=30 in each group) will include: MDD without
        hypersomnolence, bipolar disorder without hypersomnolence, primary insomnia, and healthy
        controls.
