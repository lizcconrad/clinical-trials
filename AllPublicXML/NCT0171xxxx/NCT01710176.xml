  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized Phase III clinical trial in the setting of localized high-risk soft
      tissue sarcomas (STS). This study will compare a standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy with
      epirubicin plus ifosfamide versus a histology-driven chemotherapy, i.e. a chemotherapy
      tailored to the specific histology within the family of adult STS. Chemotherapy will be
      administered for 3 cycles. There will be five histological groups (representing 80% of STS),
      as follows: leiomyosarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma with hypercellularity (round cell MLPS),
      synovial sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and undifferentiated
      pleomorphic sarcoma. The histology-driven chemotherapy for these groups will be,
      respectively, gemcitabine plus dacarbazine, trabectedin, high-dose ifosfamide, ifosfamide
      plus etoposide, gemcitabine plus docetaxel. Other histological groups will also be included
      and registered, but treated only by standard chemotherapy. Patients who have already
      undergone definitive surgery will receive treatment post-operatively and patients needing a
      re-excision after inadequate surgery will be treated as patients in the two groups, but of
      course will not be evaluable for response. A centralized pathological review will be
      performed. Radiological response will be evaluated according to RECIST and to Choi criteria.
      Pathological response will also be recorded.

      The endpoint will be disease-free survival (DFS) and, secondarily, overall survival (OS) of
      patients receiving standard chemotherapy versus those receiving histotype-tailored
      chemotherapy. Additional aims will be to compare the probability of response of standard vs
      histotype-tailored chemotherapy and to determine the radiological and pathological response
      with standard chemotherapy vs tailored chemotherapy in each different histological group.
      Another aim will be to validate the response (both radiological and pathological) to
      preoperative chemotherapy as a surrogate endpoint for DFS and OS.

      Three hundred patients will be randomized over a 3-years period, from a pool of 400-450
      registered patients.

      Translational research will be performed. Areas of research will include identification and
      validation of the potential predictive markers for each histological subgroups.

      The study is designed to verify the statistical hypothesis that histotype-tailored approach
      is associated, overall, with a 30% reduction in the hazard of relapse. However, in each
      different histological group, the effect of histotype-tailored chemotherapy, as compared to
      standard chemotherapy, can be different. To address this weakness an orthogonal study of
      response to chemotherapy as a surrogate of DFS and OS has been introduced into the trial.
      This study intends to extensively investigate the response (radiological and pathological) to
      preoperative chemotherapy and to validate it as a surrogate endpoint by showing that it
      correlates with disease free survival and overall survival.
