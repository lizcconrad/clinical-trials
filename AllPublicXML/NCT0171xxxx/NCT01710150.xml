    <textblock>
      The purpose is to compare long term occurrence of atrial arrhythmias including atrial
      fibrillation (AF) and thromboembolic complications including cerebrovascular events (CVE) in
      patients with typical atrial flutter (AFLT) undergoing cavo-tricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation
      alone versus CTI ablation combined with pulmonary vein isolation (PVI).

    <textblock>
      Typical Atrial Flutter (AFLT) is a common cardiac arrhythmia. Studies have demonstrated the
      safety and superiority of ablation procedure over antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy. Long
      term freedom from typical AFLT has been consistently shown after successful ablation, but up
      to 30% of these patients can experience new onset of a different arrhythmia i.e., Atrial
      Fibrillation (AF). AF results from triggers in the back of the left upper chamber in the
      heart (left atrium - LA). These triggers typically arise from in and around the opening of
      the 4 veins (pulmonary veins - PVs) that bring blood from the lungs into the heart. The
      highest incidence of AF in patients undergoing ablation for typical AFLT was observed where
      the follow-up duration exceeded a year after the AFLT ablation. This would suggest that AF
      development in patients undergoing typical AFLT ablation is progressive and inevitable.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients with typical AFLT confirmed by a 12-lead ECG that are referred for ablation
        and manifest ≥ 2 risk factors associated with future development of AF will be eligible to
        participate in the study.

        Risk factors for predicting future occurrence of AF will include:

          1. prior remote history of AF (≤ 2 episodes ≥ 1 year from the date of evaluation for
             study participation),

          2. LA size &gt; 4.0 cm,

          3. left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 50%,

          4. hypertension, and/or 5) obstructive sleep apnea.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with documented ≥ 2 AF episodes within the preceding 6 months of enrollment,

          2. inability or unwillingness to take 6 weeks of oral anticoagulation after the procedure
             and

          3. failure to provide informed consent.
