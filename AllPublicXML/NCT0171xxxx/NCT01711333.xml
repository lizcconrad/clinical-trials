      This is a multinational, single-arm, therapeutic used clinical trial. After screening in
      subjects with peripheral arterial disease symptom due to chronic occlusive arterial disease,
      the eligible subjects will be enrolled, followed by the administration of the study drug (two
      capsules qd of Pletaal SR 100mg Capsules) for 12 weeks.

             enrollment visit,

          4. Ankle Branchial Index (ABI) ≤0.90 when measuring the pressure in a supine position
             after resting for 10 minutes,
