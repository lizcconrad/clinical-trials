      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the efficacy of SPD489 compared with
      placebo in adults (18 55 years of age inclusive) with moderate to severe Binge Eating
      Disorder at Visit 8 (Weeks 11 and 12) as measured by the number of binge days (defined as
      days during which at least 1 binge episode occurs) per week as assessed by clinical interview
      based on subject diary

        Inclusion Criteria -

          1. Subject is between 18-55 years of age.

          2. Subject meets the following DSM-IV-TR criteria for a diagnosis of BED:

             Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by
             both of the following: eating, in a discrete period of time (eg, within a 2-hour
             period) an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat in a
             similar period of time under similar conditions, and a sense of lack of control over
             the eating (eg, a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one
             is eating).

             The binge eating episodes are associated with at least 3 of the following: eating much
             more rapidly than normal; eating until uncomfortably full; eating large amounts of
             food when not feeling physically hungry; eating alone because of being embarrassed by
             how much one is eating; feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or feeling very
             guilty after overeating.

             Marked distress regarding binge eating. The binge eating occurs, on average, at least
             2 days a week for 6 months. The episodes of binge eating do not occur exclusively
             during the course of bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa.

          3. Subject's BED is of at least moderate severity with subjects reporting at least 3
             binge eating days per week for the 14 days prior to the Baseline Visit (Visit 0) as
             documented in the subject's binge diary. A binge day is a day during which at least 1
             binge eating episode occurs.

          4. Female subjects must have a negative serum B HCG pregnancy test and a negative urine
             pregnancy test.

        Exclusion Criteria-

          1. Subject has concurrent symptoms of bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa.

          2. Subject is receiving psychotherapy (eg, supportive psychotherapy, cognitive behavior
             therapy, interpersonal therapy) or weight loss support (eg, Weight Watchers) for BED
             within 3 months.

          3. Subject has used psychostimulants to facilitate fasting or dieting as a part of their
             BED within 6 months.

          4. Subject has a lifetime history of psychosis, mania, hypomania, dementia, or ADHD.

          5. Subject is considered a suicide risk in the opinion of the investigator, has
             previously made a suicide attempt, or is currently demonstrating active suicidal
             ideation. Subjects with intermittent passive suicidal ideation are not necessarily
             excluded based on the assessment of the investigator.

          6. Subject has known history of symptomatic cardiovascular disease, advanced
             arteriosclerosis, structural cardiac abnormality, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm
             abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems.

          7. Subject has recently initiated treatment with a lipid-lowering medication (within the
             past 3 months).

          8. Subject has a history of moderate or severe hypertension.

          9. Subject is female and pregnant or nursing.

         10. Subjects who have had bariatric surgery, lap bands, duodenal stents, or other
             procedures for weight loss.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Binge Eating (Y-BOCS-BE) Total Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The Y-BOCS-BE measures the obsession of binge-eating thoughts and compulsiveness of binge-eating behaviors. The scale is a clinician-rated, 10-item scale, each item rated from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms). Total scores range from 0 to 40. Reduction in total score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Eating Inventory Scores at Week 12</title>
        <description>The Eating Inventory also known as the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire is a 51-item self-reported questionnaire intended to assess 3 dimensions of eating behavior. There are 36 true/false items, 14 items on a 4-point Likert scale (1=eat rarely to 4=always), and 1 item on a 6-point Likert scale (1=eat whatever you want to 6=constantly limiting food intake).
Cognitive Restraint score ranges from 0-21. Hunger score ranges from 0-14. Disinhibition score ranges from 0-16. Higher scores denote higher levels of restrained eating, disinhibited eating and predisposition to hunger.</description>

        <description>The BES is a self-reported questionnaire containing 16 items designed to assess behavioral, affective, and attitudinal components of the subjective experience of binge eating. Each item is assessed based on 1 of 4 responses, with 1 denoting that a participant has greater control over eating behavior and 4 denoting that a participant had less control over eating behavior. A total score (sum of the 16 items) may range from 16-64. A lower score indicates greater control over eating behavior.</description>

        <description>The FrSBe is a 46-item self-rating scale designed to measure the neurobehavioral traits associated with the 3 primary regions of the prefrontal cortex. Participants were asked to indicate the frequency with which they have engaged in certain behaviors using a rating scale from “1” (almost never) to “5” (almost always).

          <description>The FrSBe is a 46-item self-rating scale designed to measure the neurobehavioral traits associated with the 3 primary regions of the prefrontal cortex. Participants were asked to indicate the frequency with which they have engaged in certain behaviors using a rating scale from “1” (almost never) to “5” (almost always). Summary scores were calculated and converted to t-score. A decrease from baseline in FrSBe total score represents improvement.</description>

        <description>Quality of life was assessed using the EQ-5D-5L, which is one of the most widely used generic index measures of health-related quality of life. It consists of a 5-item descriptive system that measures 5 dimensions of health, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Percentage of participants with various pain/discomfort conditions were reported.</description>
