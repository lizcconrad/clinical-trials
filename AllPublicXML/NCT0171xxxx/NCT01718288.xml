      Evaluate the possibility of optimization of therapy with prostanoids (iloprost), in patients
      with Fontaine's stage IIb severe chronic ischemia, both in patients eligible for surgery both
      in patients for which it is only possible medical therapy

    <textblock>
      The management of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) stage IIb and pain-free
      walking distance (PFWD) less than 100 meters is a major clinical problem, in view of the
      significant cooling of the quality of life and evolution often severe that characterizes the
      clinical course of these patients. Revascularization Surgery is the treatment of choice, but
      about half of patients with severe PAD IIb is not eligible for surgery or endovascular
      treatment. The usefulness of use of vasodilators or hemorheological is controversial, and
      medical treatment of these patients is therefore heterogeneous understanding the various
      pharmacologic options (for the correction of risk factors, prevention of cardiovascular
      events, improvement of claudication), and rehabilitative programs. Iloprost, a synthetic
      analogue of prostacyclin, is effective in the treatment of patients with chronic critical
      ischemia, and its pharmacological profile (effective vasodilator, anti-platelet, and
      leukocyte activation) is particularly suitable to modulate multiple components pathogenesis
      of peripheral arterial disease. Specifically, in the treatment of patients with PAD IIb
      severe, the current state is available only a retrospective study that compared the use of
      iloprost with that of vasodilators. Aim of the study FADOI-2bPILOT is to evaluate
      prospectively and for an observation period of 13 months, if you can get a benefit on the
      pain-free walking distance and on clinical outcome from &quot;anticipated&quot; and additional use of
      iloprost, in patients with severe IIb stage PAD treated according to current &quot;best medical
      practice&quot;.

    <description>Aim of this multicenter, randomized, controlled study was prospectively evaluate the effects of iloprost, added to standard therapy, in patients with 2b stage PAD and PFWD (pain-free walking distance) less than 100 metres, eligible and non-eligible for surgical revascularization. A treadmill test 3-6-9-12 months (before iloprost cycle for patients group 1B and 2B). A final evaluation 13 months (for one month to the conclusion of the 12 months treatment of iloprost for patients group 1B and 2B, and after 13 months from enrolling for patients in the study group 1A and 2A)</description>

    <description>The study, consists of two substudies, which deal with patients susceptible to medical therapy alone (substudy 1) or treated with classical surgical therapy (substudy 2).
For each substudy, pts will be divided into two groups, one that will receive conventional treatments but not prostanoids, other conventional treatments with addition of iloprost.
The 4 groups:
1A. Pts unsuitable to surgical or endovascular vascular therapy: conventional treatment
B. Pts unsuitable to surgical or endovascular vascular therapy: treatment with iloprost plus conventional treatment
A. Pts suitable to vascular surgical or endovascular therapy: conventional treatment
