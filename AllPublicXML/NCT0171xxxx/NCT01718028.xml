  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of SYSTANE® BALANCE dosed 4 times a day
      for 30 days to increase non-invasive tear film break up time over baseline, compared to a
      saline control, in dry eye subjects with lipid deficiency.

    <description>NITFBUT is defined as the time elapsed between eye opening after a blink and the appearance of the first break in the tear film, ie, dry area. NITFBUT was evaluated noninvasively with a Tearscope. One eye from each participant was chosen as the study eye, and only data for the study eye contributed to the analysis. A positive change value indicates an improvement in tear film stability, which may improve dry eye symptoms in dry eye sufferers.</description>

    <description>NITFBUT is defined as the time elapsed between eye opening after a blink and the appearance of the first break in the tear film, ie, dry area. NITFBUT was evaluated noninvasively with a Tearscope. One eye from each participant was chosen as the study eye, and only data for the study eye contributed to the analysis. A longer tear film break-up time indicates a more stable tear film, which may improve dry eye symptoms in dry eye sufferers.</description>

NITFBUT was evaluated noninvasively with a Tearscope. One eye from each participant was chosen as the study eye, and only data for the study eye contributed to the analysis. The percentage of participants with a lengthening in tear film break up time relative to baseline is reported.

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in NITFBUT at Day 14</title>
          <description>NITFBUT is defined as the time elapsed between eye opening after a blink and the appearance of the first break in the tear film, ie, dry area. NITFBUT was evaluated noninvasively with a Tearscope. One eye from each participant was chosen as the study eye, and only data for the study eye contributed to the analysis. A positive change value indicates an improvement in tear film stability, which may improve dry eye symptoms in dry eye sufferers.</description>
