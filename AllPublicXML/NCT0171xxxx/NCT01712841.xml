  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most prevalent cause of vision loss in
      developed countries and is often discussed in terms of the &quot;dry&quot; and the &quot;wet&quot; forms. The
      &quot;wet&quot; form of AMD is the more advanced form of the disease and is responsible for 80% of the
      legal blindness in AMD. Treatment options include a promising class of biologics called
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factors, as well as photodynamic therapy and laser surgery.
      These therapies can slow further vision loss, but cannot achieve recovery of lost vision. The
      &quot;wet&quot; form of AMD is always preceded by the &quot;dry&quot; form. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect
      that the early detection and treatment of the &quot;dry&quot; form may help reduce vision loss or
      progression to the more damaging &quot;wet&quot; form. Unfortunately, symptoms appear only in advanced
      stages of the &quot;dry&quot; form. As light sensitive cells in the macula breakdown in a process
      called geographic atrophy, the patient may notice blurred central vision.

      OCT is an imaging technology that can perform non-contact cross-sectional imaging of retinal
      and choroidal tissue structure in real time. It is analogous to ultrasound B-mode imaging,
      except that OCT measures the intensity of reflected light rather than acoustical waves.

      This study aims is to use OCT technology to compare how the retinal anatomy and blood flow
      differ within three severity groupings of non-exudative age-related macular degeneration
      (NEAMD).

        Individuals between the ages of 60 and 85 years of age presenting to the Retina Service
        within the Department of Ophthalmology at the Casey Eye Institute of Oregon Health &amp;
        Science University with signs and symptoms of non-exudative AMD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of mild, moderate or severe NEAMD.

          -  Media clarity, pupillary dilation, and subject cooperation sufficient for adequate
             fundus photographs.

          -  Vision better than 20/200

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to give informed consent.

          -  Inability to maintain stable fixation for OCT imaging.

          -  A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in
             the study (e.g. unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular
             disease, and glycemic control).

          -  A concurrent ocular pathology that may contribute to vision loss (e.g., CNV, glaucoma,
             visually significant cataract, optic neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, history of
             retinal surgery) or interfere with acquisition of high-quality images

          -  Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 (systolic above 180 OR diastolic above 110). If blood
             pressure is brought below 180/110 by anti-hypertensive treatment, subject can become
             eligible.

          -  An ocular condition is present that, in the opinion of the investigator, might affect
             or alter visual acuity during the course of the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis
             or other ocular inflammatory disease, neovascular glaucoma, etc.).

          -  Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be
             decreasing visual acuity by 3 lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing acuity
             to 20/40 or worse if eye was otherwise normal).

          -  Unable to ambulate and take tram from clinic to where OCT is located
