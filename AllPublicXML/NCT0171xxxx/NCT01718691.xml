      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of SyB L-0501 (two-day
      consecutive 90 mg/m2/day IV drip infusions) in combination with rituximab (375 mg/m2 IV drip
      infusion) on untreated, low-grade B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma
      where hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is not indicated.

        <title>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>PFS is the period from registration date to the earliest onset date of any progression event calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The median and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using Greenwood’s formula.
Progression event was defined as progression (includes recurrence/relapse), initiation of post-study treatment, confirmation of other malignant tumor, or death due to any given cause. The date of progression was determined based on overall response assessed using IWRC, Revised RC, and WHO, and assessment by the primary physicians (excluding overall response).</description>

A dose of 90 mg/m^2/day of SyB L-0501 is administered on Day 1 and Day 2 as an IV drip infusion, followed by 26-day observation. This is 1 cycle (28 days), which will be repeated for a maximum of 6 times.
Drug: rituximab
A dose of 375 mg/m^2 of rituximab is administered on Day 1 (Day 0 in Cycle 1 only) as an IV drip infusion, followed by 26-day observation. This is 1 cycle (28 days), which will be repeated for a maximum of 6 times. From Cycle 2, rituximab will be coadministered with SyB L-0501 on Day 1. However, if the investigator or sub-investigator judges that the coadministration is difficult, rituximab may be administered on Day 0.</description>
