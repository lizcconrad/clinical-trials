      Background:

      - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to study the brain. It takes a series
      of pictures that can be used to look at how the brain processes information. It is used to
      study problems with thinking, language, and movement, among other things. Researchers are
      working to develop new and better fMRI techniques. To test these techniques, they want to
      perform fMRI scans on healthy volunteers.

      Objectives:

      - To test different fMRI techniques in healthy volunteers.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.

        -  Participants will have fMRI scans of the brain. During these scans, they will be asked
           to perform simple tasks. These tasks may involve language, thinking, or motor skills.
           The scanning sessions will last up to 2 hours.

        -  Participants may be asked to return for additional fMRI scans over several years.

      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non invasive imaging technique that enables
      scientists to understand the biological basis of higher order cognitive functioning such as
      emotions, attention, language and visual processing. It has been used as a research tool
      since the 1980 s. Recently, fMRI has received approval by the Center for Medicare and
      Medicaid Services (CMS) to be used clinically which we believe will drastically increase its
      use in clinical decision making by physicians in the very near future. However, currently
      implemented imaging techniques have technical and physiologic limitations such as
      susceptibility artifacts, image distortions, physiological noise, and MRI induced energy
      deposition from radiomagnetic waves typically used in fMRI acquisitions that may potentially
      reduce the clinical effectiveness of this imaging modality. This protocol is a unique
      technical development pilot study being conducted jointly by researchers at the National
      Institutes of Health (NIH) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate the
      performance of physiologic and technical factors of fMRI imaging methods and equipment that
      may affect image quality, reproducibility, and reliability in the clinical setting. These
      studies are an important basis upon which improved regulatory evaluation of new functional
      imaging technologies can be performed as these technologies become increasingly used in
      patient care in the future.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Healthy volunteers, new or from current NIH protocols are eligible. Healthy volunteers
             will be defined according the history obtained from reported medical history, medical
             record (reported at registration), the MRI safety questionnaire, and a clinical grade
             noncontrast brain MRI.

          -  Willing to travel to the NIH for follow-up visits

          -  Greater than 18 years old

          -  Able to understand and sign informed consent.

          -  Bilingual or multilingual subjects can participate in this study as long as the
             subjects are also fluent in English. Subjects do not need to be native or monolingual
             speakers of English.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The following criteria will be used to exclude subjects from participating in this
        protocol:

          -  Implanted metal clips or wires of the type which may concentrate radiofrequency fields
             or cause tissue damages from twisting in a Magnetic field. Examples:

               -  Aneurysm clip, implanted neural stimulator,

               -  Implanted cardiac pacemaker, defibrillator, or certain other implanted electrical
                  or metallic devices,

               -  Cochlear implant, ocular foreign body (metal shavings),

               -  Any implanted device (pumps, infusion devices, etc.),

               -  Shrapnel injuries,

               -  History of metal in head or eyes or other parts of the body.

               -  Vagus Nerve Stimulators (VNS)

               -  Subjects with tattoos that contain metal.

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Over 350 lbs because of the weight limit of the MRI table

          -  Prior surgery that may render performing the MRI to be unsafe.

          -  Untreatable claustrophobia otherwise requiring anesthesia or antianxiety medications
             that may alter the subject s ability to perform the tasks during fMRI scanning.

          -  Subjects will be asked to refrain from drinking or eating caffeinated foods or drinks
             the morning of the scan that can result in vessel vasoconstriction prior to the scan.

          -  Any contraindications that the Physician identifies from the Subject s reported
             history, MRI Safety Questionnaire and/or medical record.
