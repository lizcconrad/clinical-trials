  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of omarigliptin (MK-3102),
      dosed once-weekly in participants with T2DM who have inadequate glycemic control on diet and
      exercise. The primary hypothesis is that after 24 weeks, treatment with omarigliptin compared
      with placebo provides greater reduction in hemoglobin A1c (A1C).

    <description>A1C (%) is used to report average blood glucose levels over prolonged periods of time.
Because it was discovered that in another omarigliptin study (MK-3102-028, NCT01814748) subjects had taken metformin (prohibited per protocol, and taken without investigator knowledge), after unblinding of Phase A of this study, an analysis of metformin levels was performed on stored Week 18 blood samples. Of the subjects not rescued with metformin prior to Week 18, 10% in the omarigliptin group and 20% in the placebo group had levels showing that they were taking metformin (prohibited per protocol). The use of prohibited metformin disproportionately by the placebo group may have resulted in a smaller than expected treatment effect for efficacy outcome measures (see post-hoc analysis).</description>

        <description>A1C (%) is used to report average blood glucose levels over prolonged periods of time.
Because it was discovered that in another omarigliptin study (MK-3102-028, NCT01814748) subjects had taken metformin (prohibited per protocol, and taken without investigator knowledge), after unblinding of Phase A of this study, an analysis of metformin levels was performed on stored Week 18 blood samples. Of the subjects not rescued with metformin prior to Week 18, 10% in the omarigliptin group and 20% in the placebo group had levels showing that they were taking metformin (prohibited per protocol). The use of prohibited metformin disproportionately by the placebo group may have resulted in a smaller than expected treatment effect for efficacy outcome measures (see post-hoc analysis).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieve an A1C Goal of &lt;7% (53 mmol/Mol) at Week 24 (Phase A, FAS Population)</title>
        <description>A1C is a blood marker used to report average blood glucose levels over prolonged periods of time and is reported as a percentage (%). The percentage of participants who achieved A1C values &lt;7.0% (53 mmol/mol) in the FAS population at Week 24.
Because it was discovered that in another omarigliptin study (MK-3102-028, NCT01814748) subjects had taken metformin (prohibited per protocol, and taken without investigator knowledge), after unblinding of Phase A of this study, an analysis of metformin levels was performed on stored Week 18 blood samples. Of the subjects not rescued with metformin prior to Week 18, 10% in the omarigliptin group and 20% in the placebo group had levels showing that they were taking metformin (prohibited per protocol). The use of prohibited metformin disproportionately by the placebo group may have resulted in a smaller than expected treatment effect for efficacy outcome measures (see post-hoc analysis).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieve an A1C Goal of &lt;6.5% (48 mmol/Mol) at Week 24 (Phase A, FAS Population)</title>
        <description>A1C is a blood marker used to report average blood glucose levels over prolonged periods of time and is reported as a percentage (%). The percentage of participants who achieved A1C values &lt;6.5% (48 mmol/mol) in the FAS population at Week 24.
Because it was discovered that in another omarigliptin study (MK-3102-028, NCT01814748) subjects had taken metformin (prohibited per protocol, and taken without investigator knowledge), after unblinding of Phase A of this study, an analysis of metformin levels was performed on stored Week 18 blood samples. Of the subjects not rescued with metformin prior to Week 18, 10% in the omarigliptin group and 20% in the placebo group had levels showing that they were taking metformin (prohibited per protocol). The use of prohibited metformin disproportionately by the placebo group may have resulted in a smaller than expected treatment effect for efficacy outcome measures (see post-hoc analysis).</description>

        <description>Blood glucose was measured 2 hours after a meal (2-hour PMG). 2-hour PMG is expressed as mg/dL. This change from baseline in 2-hour PMG reflects the Week 24 2-hour PMG minus the Week 0 2-hour PMG.
A post-hoc sensitivity analysis was performed that excluded participants in both treatment groups who were found to have used prohibited metformin (see results above for a description of the use of prohibited metformin).</description>
