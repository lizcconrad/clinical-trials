  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study involves developing and evaluating an interactive, web-based CBT
      intervention for OEF/OIF Veterans with hazardous or problematic substance use and PTSD
      symptoms (PTSD or subsyndromal PTSD). The intervention will address the special culture and
      experiences of the investigators targeted population (OEF/OIF Veterans). The web-based CBT
      intervention includes 24 modules, to be used across 24 sessions targeting OEF/OIF Veterans
      with hazardous or problematic substance use and PTSD symptoms. The investigators ask
      participants to complete 2 sessions per week (one module per session) for 12 weeks. The first
      18 modules to be completed across 18 sessions (9 weeks) are considered core modules relevant
      to all Veterans in the target population. These modules are designed to reduce posttraumatic
      stress symptoms as well as reduce and prevent the escalation of problematic substance use.
      The remaining 6 module topics are considered &quot;optional&quot; and are used based on the interest
      and clinical need of various sub-groups of VA patients. The study includes initial input as
      well as feedback on a beta version from experts who have worked with OEF/OIF veterans with
      PTSD and substance abuse problems as well as input/feedback from the target population (the
      Veterans themselves). In addition to presenting content grounded in evidence-based CBT
      interventions, the program also employs state of the art technologies to deliver module
      content grounded in evidence-based learning principles, including Computer-Assisted
      Instruction, Computer Simulation and other interactive exercises.

    <description>Participants who are randomly assigned to the treatment condition will receive the same standard care as those in the control condition and they will also receive access to the web-based CBT intervention. Participants in this condition will be asked to complete 24 CBT sessions, 2 sessions/topics per week for 12 weeks. Participants will be asked to complete the 18 &quot;core modules&quot; of the program during the first 9 weeks of the trial and then to re-visit important modules and complete optional modules of their choice during the final 3 weeks of the trial.</description>

    <description>TAU consists of the usual Veterans Integrated Service Network 2 (VISN) primary care services. As we have described, all of the participants will be recruited from patients presenting for treatment typically for physical complaints in primary care clinics in VA's VISN 2 (Upstate NY). VISN 2 officially practices a co-located, collaborative care model of integrated (behavioral health and physical health) in its primary care clinics. This integrated model has been implemented widely in both VA and non-VA primary care clinics in the United States .</description>

    <description>Participants in this condition will be asked to complete 24 CBT sessions, 2 sessions/topics per week for 12 weeks. We expect that each session will be approximately 30 minutes in duration. Participants will be asked to complete the 18 &quot;core modules&quot; of the program during the first 9 weeks of the trial and then to re-visit important modules and complete optional modules of their choice during the final 3 weeks of the trial. They can choose to do this using a designated computer in a private room at their local VA or can complete these sessions in the privacy of their own home with their personally-owned computers. Participants can choose to complete each session on any day/time of their choosing in a given week.</description>
