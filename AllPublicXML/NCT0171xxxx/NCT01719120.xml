      This study is a randomized controlled trial in patients with insomnia. Eligible subjects will
      be randomly assigned to self-help treatment with telephone consultation (SHTC), self-help
      treatment without telephone consultation (SH), or waiting-list control. The subjects will
      receive self-help treatment once per week for 6 consecutive weeks. In addition to self-help
      treatment, the subjects in SHTC group will receive telephone consultation once per week for 6
      consecutive weeks.
