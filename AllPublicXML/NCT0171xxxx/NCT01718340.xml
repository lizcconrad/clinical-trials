  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of insulin resistance is increased in women with recurrent miscarriage
      compared with matched fertile controls,Insulin resistance (IR) in this syndrome is not only
      implicated toward early pregnancy loss (EPL) but also pathognomic for various obstetrical
      complications during pregnancy.An elevated free androgen index appears to be a prognostic
      factor for a subsequent miscarriage in women with recurrent miscarriage.

      There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effect of metformin supplementation in
      pregnancy to prevent a miscarriage in women with recurrent miscarriage.

      The patients with PCO and hyper insulinemia will be subdivided into two groups, one group
      will continue metformin 500 mg three times per day from the start of induction of ovulation
      till the end of pregnancy, the other group will stop the drug once pregnancy test become
      positive. Pregnancy follow up including the early and second trimester pregnancy loss,
      Secondary outcomes like gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension and intrauterine
      growth restriction were also analyzed at the end of the study.
