  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of immediate release
      tapentadol hydrochloride for the relief of moderate to severe acute non-cancer pain among
      Filipino patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center (study
      conducted at multiple sites), observational study (study in which the investigators/
      physicians observe the patients and measure their outcomes). The study will enroll
      approximately 100 patients who will be taking immediate release tapentadol hydrochloride with
      a dosing regimen stipulated in the product insert. As this is an observational study,
      assessment of patients will be based on the accepted clinical practice in the Philippines.
      Patients will be monitored at baseline (Day 1) and throughout the 28-day treatment period of
      tapentadol IR (Day 7, Day 14 and Day 28) for effectiveness with the help of short form Brief
      Pain Inventory questionnaire. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events,
      clinical laboratory tests, and co-morbid conditions. The total study will be conducted for 3
      years and the duration of treatment will be for 28 days.

    <description>This is an observational study. Immediate release tapentadol hydrochloride will be administered as per the recommended doses approved in Philippines. The recommended oral starting dose is 25 mg, 50 mg or 100 mg every 4 to 6 hours depending on the initial pain intensity and thereafter, the dose will be adjusted to maintain adequate analgesia with acceptable tolerability. The dosing regimen will be individualized according to the severity of pain being treated, the previous treatment experience, and the ability to monitor patients.</description>
