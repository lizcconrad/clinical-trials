             3. Adult patients with chronic kidney disease for longer than 12 months and stable in
             the opinion of the investigator for the past 3 months 4. Systolic blood pressure &lt;=160
             mm Hg and &gt;= 90 mm Hg on 2 readings. Diastolic blood pressure &lt;= 100 mm Hg and &gt;= 40
             mm Hg on 2 readings during at least one of the screening visits.

             5. Subject is willing to practice birth control. 6. Subject is willing and able to
             comply with all protocol requirements. 7. Subject has a measureable level of
             galectin-3 concentration in plasma at any time prior to entry.

             8. Subject has a glomerular filtration rate between 15-45 mL/min/1.73 m2 determined
             using the CKD-EPI equation (see section 3.6.1) 9. Subject's has clinical laboratory
             values of:

               1. Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL

               2. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X Institutional Upper Limit of Normal (IULN)

               3. AST and/or ALT ≤ 2.5 X the upper limit of normal 10. Female subjects of
                  childbearing potential (i.e., women who have not been surgically sterilized or
                  have not been post-menopausal for at least 1 year) and male subjects with
                  partners of childbearing potential must agree to use medically acceptable methods
                  of contraception throughout the study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have had treatment with an experimental (unlicensed) drug within 4 weeks
             or ≤ 5 half-lives prior to treatment with GCS 100.

          2. Subjects with kidney disease due to systemic lupus erythematosus (regardless of
             whether active or in remission), any form of vasculitis (regardless of whether active
             or in remission), IgA nephropathy, multiple myeloma, polycystic kidney disease,
             untreated obstructed nephropathy or any other causes that in the opinion of the
             investigator may put the subject at an increased risk

          3. Subject is expected to start renal replacement therapy of any kind within 6 months
             after enrollment

          4. Subjects with previous solid organ transplant

          5. Subject is undergoing treatment with immunosuppression agents except for topical
             agents or inhaled steroids when conditions are chronic and stable.

          6. Subject with know history of cancer within the past 5 years prior to enrollment

             hepatitis C, active hepatitis B, or prior history of infection with hepatitis B (HBcAb
             positive). Medical Monitor may approve if adequate hepatic function has been
             documented for patients without evidence of cirrhosis for subjects with HCV or prior
             history of hepatitis B, including, but not limited to liver biopsy.

          8. Subject has a clinically relevant active infection and/or a serious co-morbid medical
             condition such as recent myocardial infarction (within the last 6 months), unstable
             angina, difficult-to-control congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension,
             difficult-to-control cardiac arrhythmias, chronic obstructive or chronic restrictive
             pulmonary disease, and/or cirrhosis.

          9. Subject had major surgery within 4 weeks prior to Study Day 1.

         10. If female, subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.

         11. Subject has a concomitant disease or condition, including laboratory abnormalities,
             which in the opinion of the Investigator could interfere with the conduct of the study
             or could put the subject at unacceptable risk.
