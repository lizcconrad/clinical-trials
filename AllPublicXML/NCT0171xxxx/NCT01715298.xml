  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study serves to determine whether the treatment of patients with stable, symptomatic
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with the investigational drug NVA237 is
      efficient and safe. The efficacy and safety of the drug will be tested against a placebo
      treatment. The primary criterion to assess efficacy will be the difference between the serial
      lung function measurements of patients who have been treated for 12 weeks with NVA237 versus
      those that have received placebo treatment for 12 weeks. A serial lung function measurement
      (FEV1 testing) will be conducted and the &quot;area under the curve&quot; will be the measure for the
      ability to breathe.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Standardized Area Under the Curve for Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second Post Dosing</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The standardized Area Under the Curve (AUC) for Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) post dosing (FEV1 AUC) is measured at week 12 of treatment. Serial lung function measurements are taken at the following time points following dosing at week 12 to calculate the FEV1 AUC: 5 min, 15 min, 1:00 h, 2:00 h, 4:00 h, 6:00 h, 8:00 h, and 11:55 h after the morning dose.
The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in FEV1 AUC0-12h following the morning dose at Week 12 (defined as the mean FEV1 change from baseline (CFB) over 5 min to 11 h 55 mins divided by 11 h 50 mins). Where the FEV1 AUC is smaller than at baseline, a negative value can occur</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Health Status Assessed by St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The health status, as reported by the patients, is assessed using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). The SGRQ is a 50 item scale assessing symptoms, patient activities and impact of the disease. Scores range from 0 to 100 units, with higher scores indicating more limitations. The assessment is based on total score as well as the percentage of patients with clinically significant improvement at week 12 versus day 1. A clinically meaningful improvement (MCID) in SGRQ is defined as a decrease of 4 or more units of the SGRQ scale in the total score, as compared to baseline (change from baseline).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Standardized Area Under the Curve for Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second Post Dosing</title>
        <description>The standardized Area Under the Curve (AUC) for Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) post dosing (FEV1 AUC) is measured at week 12 of treatment. Serial lung function measurements are taken at the following time points following dosing at week 12 to calculate the FEV1 AUC: 5 min, 15 min, 1:00 h, 2:00 h, 4:00 h, 6:00 h, 8:00 h, and 11:55 h after the morning dose.
The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in FEV1 AUC0-12h following the morning dose at Week 12 (defined as the mean FEV1 change from baseline (CFB) over 5 min to 11 h 55 mins divided by 11 h 50 mins). Where the FEV1 AUC is smaller than at baseline, a negative value can occur</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second at All Individual Timepoints</title>
        <description>The Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) assessments for all individual time points of the serial measurements on day 1 and at week 12 are analyzed. Time points of the serial lung function measurements are 5 min, 15 min, 1:00 h, 2:00 h, 4:00 h, 6:00 h, 8:00 h, and 11:55 h after the morning dose. The table indicates the percent change from baseline (CFB) in FEV1 and standard deviation in brackets. Where the FEV1 is lower than at baseline, a negative percent value can occur.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Health Status Assessed by St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The health status, as reported by the patients, is assessed using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). The SGRQ is a 50 item scale assessing symptoms, patient activities and impact of the disease. Scores range from 0 to 100 units, with higher scores indicating more limitations. The assessment is based on total score as well as the percentage of patients with clinically significant improvement at week 12 versus day 1. A clinically meaningful improvement (MCID) in SGRQ is defined as a decrease of 4 or more units of the SGRQ scale in the total score, as compared to baseline (change from baseline).</description>

        <title>Breathlessness Assessed by Transition Dyspnea Index</title>
        <description>Breathlessness at week 12 is measured using the interviewer-administered Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI). On day 1, breathlessness is assessed by the interviewer-administered Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI). The change from BDI to TDI is assessed, with the TDI total score ranging from -9 to +9 units of the scale. The lower the score, the more deterioration in severity of dyspnea. Patients are considered to have clinically significant improvement (MCID) with the TDI score change versus BDI being equal to or greater than 1.</description>

Each question can be answered with one of four pre-defined answers, corresponding to a unit value of 0-3, where 0 stands for the lowest and 3 for the most severe symptom experience. Symptom scores are calculated as the mean of the combined daily symptom scores (combined from morning and evening scores) for each patient over 12 weeks (Day 1 to week 12). The baseline is calculated from the run-in epoch prior to randomization. The change from baseline in the least squares mean daily symptom scores over the 12 week treatment period is provided. Where the mean daily symptom score over the 12 week treatment period is lower than the baseline, the result is negative. A negative result indicates an improvement in COPD symptom severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Days With &quot;no Daytime Symptoms&quot;</title>
        <description>Patients are reporting symptoms by using an electronic diary. The electronic diary has 9 symptom questions each morning and each evening. Each question can be answered with one of four pre-defined answers, corresponding to a unit value of 0-3, where 0 stands for the lowest and 3 for the most severe symptom experience. A day with &quot;no daytime symptoms&quot; is defined from diary data as any day where the patient has recorded in the evening no cough, no wheeze, no production of sputum, and no feeling of breathlessness (other than when running) during the past approximately 12 hours in the evening questionnaire. The change from baseline in the percentage of days with “no daytime symptoms” is calculated from the mean percentage of days with this answer over the 12 week treatment period, with the baseline being. The baseline is calculated from the run-in epoch prior to randomization.</description>

        <description>Patients are reporting symptoms by using an electronic diary. The electronic diary has 9 symptom questions each morning and each evening. One of the symptom questions of the evening questionnaire relates to the impact of COPD symptoms on the performance of usual daily activities (“Did your respiratory symptoms stop you performing your usual daily activities today“). The answer with the lowest symptom score is “not at all.” A &quot;day able to perform usual daily activities&quot; is defined from diary data as any day where the patient was not prevented from performing their usual daily activities due to respiratory symptoms. The change from baseline in the percentage of “days able to perform usual daily activities” is calculated from the mean percentage of days with this answer over the 12 week treatment period, with the baseline beingThe baseline is calculated from the run-in epoch prior to randomization.</description>

        <description>The Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)assessments for all individual time points of the serial measurements on day 1 and at week 12 are analyzed. Serial lung function measurements are taken at the following time points following dosing on Day 1 and at week 12: 5 min, 15 min, 1:00 h, 2:00 h, 4:00 h, 6:00 h, 8:00 h, and 11:55 h after the morning dose. For week 12 (day 85), the pre-dose measurements (-45 min and -15 min) and the trough measurements (23:15 h and 23:45 h post-dose) are included. The endpoints are the change from baseline in FVC following the morning dose on Day 1 and at Week 12. Where the FVC at any one timepoint is smaller than at baseline, a negative value can occur.</description>

        <description>Mean trough Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) is assessed as the arithmetic mean of two FVC measurements, conducted within the last hour of a 24 hours period from a morning dose, either that of day 1 or at week 12 of treatment (23:15 h and 23:45 h assessments). The endpoints are the change from baseline in trough FVC on Day 1 and at Week 12, with the mean of the -45 min and -15 min measurements on Day 1 as the baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Morning and Nighttime Symptom Scores</title>
        <description>Patients are reporting morning and nighttime symptoms by using an electronic diary. The electronic diary has 9 symptom questions each morning and each evening. Each question can be answered with one of four pre-defined answers, corresponding to a unit value of 0-3, where 0 stands for the lowest and 3 for the most severe symptom experience. Morning and nighttime symptoms scores for each patient over 12 weeks are reported and analyzed. Symptom scores are calculated as the mean of the symptom scores (morning symptom scores or nighttime symptom scores, respectively) for each patient over 12 weeks (Day 1 to week 12). The baseline is calculated from the run-in epoch prior to randomization. The outcome is calculated as the change from baseline in the morning and nighttime symptom scores, respectively. A negative number indicates a reduction in the symptom severity and is owed to the calculation of the change from baseline.</description>
