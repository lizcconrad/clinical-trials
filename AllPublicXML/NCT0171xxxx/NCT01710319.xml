      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the differences in &quot;natural killer (NK)
      blood cells, a type of white blood cell that fights infection in the body, among different
      types of patients that have lung surgery. The four different groups of patients are:

        -  smokers with lung cancer

        -  smokers without lung cancer

        -  non-smokers with lung cancer

        -  non-smokers without lung cancer.

      Research has shown that different strains of mice possess varying susceptibility to lung
      cancer. C3H and C57BL6 mice are highly resistant to lung cancer, whereas A/J and 129 mice are
      very susceptible to lung cancer. Data from our lab shows that the mice have different numbers
      of natural killer (NK) cells as well as different characteristics of those cells. C3H and
      C57BL6 mice have higher numbers of NK cells as well as higher expression of CD11b, whereas
      A/J and 129 mice have lower numbers and lower expression.

      These findings justify parallel investigation of NK cells in human populations resistant and
      susceptible to lung cancer. Through blood samples, circulating NK cells can be counted and
      phenotypically analyzed. Smoking can be used as a factor to establish lung cancer risk.
      Additionally, non-smokers suffering from lung cancer provide an opportunity to investigate
      whether lung cancer patients have lower abundance of NK cells and lesser expression of CD11b,
      independent of the effects of smoking.

      Objective:

      The main goal of this study is to investigate the quantitative and phenotypic differences in
      circulating NK cells among human populations. Participants will be classified as heavy
      smokers (HS), non-smokers (NS), those suffering from lung cancer (LC), and those free from
      lung cancer (NC).

      Hypothesis #1: NS/LC participants will have fewer NK cells and lower expression of CD11b
      compared to HS/NC and NS/NC participants.

      Hypothesis #2: NS/LC participants will have more numerous NK cells and higher expression of
      CD11b compared to HS/LC participants.

      A blood draw will be obtained from patients in order to complete flow cytometry to analyze
      NK-specific markers to determine NK cell abundance and phenotypic expression. Obtain an
      optional blood draw on pts at least 30 days from the initial draw if transient confounders
      (viral infections or leukemoid reactions-a benign transient post-viral increase in WBCs)
      noted that could affect the NK Cell's behavior and interfere with the results.
