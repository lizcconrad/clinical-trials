      This study will compare two investigational techniques for measuring how vaginal gels spread
      and coat the vagina. This study will also explore the experiences and opinions of women using
      this vaginal gel. We want to understand how the characteristics of a gel, such as a gel's
      thickness or consistency, affect how the gel spreads and feels in the body. We hope to use
      the information we learn from this study to develop future vaginal gels that could be
      combined with medications and used to slow down or stop the spread of sexually transmitted
      infections.

    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetics of a microbicide gel, i.e. the time- and space-dependent distribution of
      its active microbicidal ingredient(s) (APIs) throughout the body, derives from the time- and
      space-dependent distribution of the gel itself within the vaginal canal. That distribution
      may also serve as a physical barrier that retards migration of semen-borne HIV virions to
      epithelial surfaces. Within the vagina, the gel creates local physical forces (&quot;stresses&quot;)
      against the epithelial surfaces; and its distribution along the canal might be so extensive
      that gel leaks out from the introitus. A woman may have sensations of those stresses and also
      feel gel leakage. Thus, intravaginal microbicide gel distribution is central to both its
      biological functioning (to deliver APIs and also to slow HIV transport) and the behavioral
      perception of it by users (i.e. how it &quot;feels&quot; and whether that experience is pleasurable or
      not). The latter, in turn, can govern acceptability of the gel and adherence to designated
      gel use in clinical trials. This study will characterize and correlate gel distribution and
      women's sensory perceptions and preferences of that distribution, for two relevant volumes (2
      mL and 4 mL) of a current microbicide placebo gel. An optical vaginal imaging device will
      measure gel distribution in the vagina. A computer-assisted self-interview (CASI) survey will
      capture women's perceptions and preferences.
