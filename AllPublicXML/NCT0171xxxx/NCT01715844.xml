  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In people who develop asthma after the age of 12 and who are also overweigh, there can be an
      increased burden of asthma symptoms, more flare-ups, and poorly-controlled asthma when
      compared to normal weight asthmatics. Certain factors are more abundant in the blood of
      individuals who are obese. One such factor is derived from the metabolism of an amino acid
      found in your diet, which is known as L-arginine (Amino acids are most commonly known as the
      building blocks of proteins, the same as the proteins found in food). This factor is called
      asymmetric dimethylarginine or ADMA. The balance of L-arginine to ADMA may be important to
      the health of subjects with asthma. The balance between L-arginine and ADMA plays an
      important role in producing nitric oxide (NO) in the airways. NO is normally produced in the
      lung and plays a major role in maintaining airways open and functioning normally. Our
      research has shown that in subjects with asthma who are overweight and developed asthma later
      in life, the combination of low L-arginine and high ADMA, may lead to lower NO levels. We are
      asking participants in this study to take L-citrulline, which is converted to L-arginine by
      your body, as a supplement for a period of one week. We anticipate that L-citrulline will
      restore NO levels in the airways, by increasing the ratio of L-arginine to ADMA
