  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a novel strategy to prevent the clinical problem of
      secondary autoimmunity following alemtuzumab treatment of multiple sclerosis.

      The hypothesis is that autoimmunity after alemtuzumab can be prevented by giving a drug that
      promotes thymic T cell regeneration (Palifermin, Kepivance®).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, double-blinded, randomised controlled trial of palifermin
      (Kepivance) vs. placebo in the prevention of autoimmunity following alemtuzumab treatment of
      multiple sclerosis.

      The dose of palifermin (kepivance)used in this trial will be informed by a dose-escalation
      study.
