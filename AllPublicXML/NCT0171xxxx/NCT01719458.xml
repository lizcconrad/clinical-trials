    <textblock>
      In this study we propose to study 24 unmedicated abstinent alcohol dependent patients, 24
      obese individuals and 24 individually matched healthy control subjects and determine
      Norepinephrine Transporter (NET) expression in vivo using (S,S)-[11C]MRB and PET.

      In this study we propose to study 24 unmedicated abstinent alcohol dependent patients, 24
      obese individuals and 24 individually matched healthy control subjects and determine NET
      expression in vivo using (S,S)-[11C]MRB and PET. This will provide novel insight into
      alterations in pre- and post-synaptic homeostasis in alcoholism and obese people with the
      goal to explain regulatory processes and their alterations in these disorders. A better
      understanding of brain mechanisms and contributory stress would have an enormous impact on
      the public's understanding of the vulnerabilities for these disorders, influence medical and
      legal response to these problems, could lead to a new understanding of these phenomena, and
      stimulate a better means of prevention and treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. age 18-50 years inclusive;

          2. able to read and write English;

          3. for women, being in follicular phase of menstrual cycle at the time of the PET scan as
             determined by calculating the time since the last menses and assessments of serum
             hormone levels;

          4. 30 &lt; BMI &lt; 35 for obese subjects (upper limit of 35 selected given our experience with
             heavier individuals fitting comfortably in the MRI scanner) and 18.5 &lt; BMI &lt;25 for
             normal weight subjects, and no recent weight changes in prior 12 weeks prior to the
             study;

          5. for alcohol dependent patients meet current DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence or
             being in partial remission; abstinence on the MRI and PET scan days will be determined
             by patient self-report, breath alcohol tests (BACs) conducted during inpatient stay at
             the CNRU/GCRC, participants have to be non-obese BMI &lt; 30, and

          6. for current daily smokers, having smoked 10 or more cigarettes daily for the past year
             and CO level &gt; 10 ppm at intake; for non-smokers, no tobacco consumption for more than
             one year and never having used tobacco daily.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. any major neurological illness or injury and any current or prior clinically
             significant mental health or substance use disorder (with possible exception of
             nicotine dependence and alcohol dependence per the inclusion criteria) as determined
             by SCID interview and the judgement of the PI;

          2. use of any psychoactive medication within past three weeks;

          3. any significant unstable medical condition such as asthma or heart disease which may
             limit the interpretation of the imaging results, for example due to changes in tracer
             delivery in hypertensive patients;

          4. IQ&lt;70 based on past intelligence testing;

          5. any metal in body that would pose a risk with MRI; and

          6. claustrophobia that would interfere with MRI or PET imaging;

          7. presence of alcohol and drug use in the 72 hours prior to scanning, with the exception
             of tobacco;

          8. pregnancy or nursing for women,

          9. peri- and post- menopausal women, and those with ovarectomies will be excluded

         10. current eating disorders, including binge eating.
