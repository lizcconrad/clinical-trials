  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of prolonged release
      tapentadol hydrochloride for the relief of moderate to severe chronic non-cancer pain among
      Filipino patients.

  <detailed_description>

      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center (study
      conducted at multiple sites), observational study (study in which the investigators/
      physicians observe the patients and measure their outcomes). The study will enroll
      approximately 100 patients who will be taking prolonged release tapentadol hydrochloride with
      a dosing regimen stipulated in the product insert. As this is an observational study,
      assessment of patient will be based on the accepted clinical practice in the Philippines.
      Patients will be monitored at baseline (Day 1) and throughout the 84-day treatment period of
      prolonged release tapentadol hydrochloride (every 7 days for the first two weeks, and
      thereafter every 28 days for the next three months) for effectiveness with the help of short
      form Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire. Safety evaluations will include assessment of
      adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, and co-morbid conditions. The total study will be
      conducted for 3 years and the duration of treatment will be for 84 days.

    <description>This is an observational study. Prolonged release tapentadol hydrochloride will be administered as per the recommended doses approved in Philippines. The recommended oral starting dose is 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, or 250 mg every 12 hours, with or without food depending on the initial pain intensity and thereafter, the dose will be adjusted to maintain adequate analgesia with acceptable tolerability. The dosing regimen will be individualized according to the severity of pain being treated, the previous treatment experience, and the ability to monitor patients.</description>
