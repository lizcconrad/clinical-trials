  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of L. reuteri DSM 17938 on pain frequency
      and severity in children of 5-16 years old and with diagnosis of FAP.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects between of 5-16 years
      of age with FAP as defined in the Rome III criteria and with pain severity of at least 40 mm
      on a 100 mm VAS scale and pain frequency of at least 1 episode per week over the preceding 8
      weeks will be recruited. In accordance to the specific Rome III criteria for inclusion, FAP
      is defined as a variable combination of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms not
      explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities.

      A study questionnaire to record pain and other gastrointestinal symptoms will be used.

      One-hundred and six (106) Subjects will be randomized to receive either dietary
      supplementation with L. reuteri DSM 17938 (2 chewable tablets with breakfast), or the same
      number of comparable placebo tablets, for 4 weeks. Supplementation will be stopped after 4
      weeks, and the subjects will be followed up for an additional 4 weeks. The subjects will
      complete a diary to record frequency and intensity of pain, use of medication, deviation from
      the usual diet, physical activities, and absence from school and other activities.
      Gastrointestinal symptoms are assessed by the GSRS (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Score).

      Subjects/caregivers will be instructed to maintain the usual diet throughout the study, but
      not to consume other probiotics (foods or supplements) during the entire study period.

      The symptoms diary will be completed daily by the parents and will report information on the
      frequency of pain episodes, location of pain, presence or absence of associated symptoms,
      need to take medication for pain and interference with normal activities. The intensity of
      the symptoms will be assessed by using the Wong-Baker Faces scale.

    <description>The active study product consists of a citrus flavored 450 mg chewable tablet containing freeze-dried L. reuteri DSM 17938. The study product is a convex tablet 10.3 mm in diameter, plain on both sides and with faint spots. It is composed of freeze-dried L. reuteri, isomalt, xylitol, sucrose distearate, hydrogenated palm oil, lemon-lime flavoring and anhydrous citric acid. The total viable count of L. reuteri DSM 17938 is 1x108 live bacteria (CFU)/tablet.</description>
