  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a major complication of ovarian stimulation for
      IVF if hCG is used to trigger final oocyte maturation. The investigators propose that using
      GnRH agonist as a trigger will eliminate OHSS, even in high-risk patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Administration of hCG (10.000 or 5.000 IU) is essential in IVF protocols to trigger final
      oocyte maturation after ovarian stimulation. In high responder patients with potential risk
      of developing OHSS, hCG is usually withheld and the treatment cycle is cancelled without
      obtaining (cryopreserved) embryos for replacement.

      An alternative approach to trigger final oocyte maturation is to administer a GnRH agonist
      instead of hCG. This method is not possible following a long GnRH agonist protocol which
      causes down-regulation of the GnRH receptor. However, following GnRH antagonist treatment the
      GnRH receptor remains receptive to competitive binding by a GnRH agonist.

      It has been well-described in earlier IVF trials that a bolus of GnRH agonist will displace
      the GnRH antagonist from the GnRH receptors in the pituitary inducing an endogenous LH (and
      FSH) surge resulting in the maturation of oocytes and good quality embryos. In addition, the
      risk of moderate-to-severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) becomes minimal due to
      the rapid demise of the corpora lutea. Following luteolysis, fresh embryo transfer would
      require alternative luteal phase support to secure good clinical outcome. Alternatively, good
      quality embryos obtained after GnRH agonist triggering can be cryopreserved and replaced in
      following frozen-thawn embryo transfer (FTET) cycles. Thus, also eliminating late onset OHSS
      due to pregnancy.
