  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whilst oxaliplatin and docetaxel have established activity in the treatment of advanced
      gastro-oesophageal cancer, their role, however, in the management of this disease remains
      unclear. Furthermore it is unclear whether this disease is optimally treated with a
      combination of two or three cytotoxic drugs. This trial aims to determine whether the
      combination of oxaliplatin and weekly docetaxel warrants further investigation in a formal
      phase III trial. The combination of epirubicin, oxaliplatin and capecitabine will be the
      comparator arm for this evaluation.

      Primary Objective:

      Determine in a randomised study if the response rate to docetaxel and oxaliplatin (ElTax) is
      comparable to epirubicin, oxaliplatin and capecitabine (EOX) and warrants further evaluation
      in advanced gastro-oesophageal cancer.

      Secondary Objective:

      To examine the effect of treatment on time to progression, progression free survival, overall
      survival, quality of life, and the associated toxicity from treatment.

      This is a randomised two-arm parallel group phase II study. 140 patients will be recruited
      over a period of 12 months, and will be randomised to receive either eight 3-weekly cycles of
      Epirubicin, Oxaliplatin and Capecitabine (EOX) or six 4-weekly cycles of Docetaxel and
      Oxaliplatin (EITax).
