  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microembolization is commonly associated with carotid artery stenting (CAS), but our
      understanding of subclinical microembolization is superficial. Through collaborative effects
      of multidisciplinary team-experts, novel approaches, and longitudinal evaluations, we hope to
      better understand the clinical significance and long-term cognitive effects of microemboli.
      This proposal may change our current clinical practice by providing a better outcome measure
      for carotid interventions and improving outcomes of CAS procedures through risk factor
      stratification. Our central hypothesis is that development of subclinical microemboli is
      associated with decline in cognitive function following CAS and that the risk of development
      of microemboli themselves is associated with patient- and procedure-related factors. We hope
      that this prospective study will help to clarify these important issues in the era of rapidly
      evolving percutaneous interventions.

    <description>Carotid revascularization can significantly reduce the risk of stroke in patients with severe carotid stenosis; however, it has been associated with cognitive decline in 25% of the older adults who undergo the procedure. Neuroimaging techniques that characterize white matter integrity and regional hypoperfusion have the potential to provide sensitive brain structure indicators that may be associated with memory decline following revascularization procedures. In this proposal, we hope to determine the risk factors and cognitive effect of microembolization following carotid revascularization procedures.</description>
