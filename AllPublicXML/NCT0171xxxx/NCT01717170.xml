  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the STOP-UVEITIS study, we propose to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and bioactivity
      of two doses of Tocilizumab (4mg/kg and 8mg/kg), administered monthly, in patients with
      non-infectious intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis.

          -  Have active uveitis, defined as having at least 1+ Vitreous Haze (SUN scale) in study
             eye. As mentioned above, at least 12 of the randomized subjects must also have

             and/or at least 1 other systemic immunosuppressant;

          -  Have posterior, intermediate, or panuveitis; for panuveitis, if an anterior component
             is present, it must be less than the posterior component;

          -  Sufficient inflammation to require systemic treatment or long-term regional treatment.
             Patients whom the investigators feel may only need short-term topical therapy should
             not be enrolled.

          -  Best-corrected EARLY TREATMENT DIABETIC RETINOPATHY STUDY(ETDRS) visual acuity of
             20/20 to 20/400 (approximately 80 to 20 letters) in the study eye;

          -  Best- corrected ETDRS visual acuity of 20/400 or better in the fellow eye
             (approximately 20 letters).

          -  Must have a chest radiograph within 3 months prior to enrollment with no evidence of
             malignancy, infection or fibrosis.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening. In addition, sexually active females of childbearing potential must agree
             to use TWO of the following adequate forms of contraception while on study medication:
             oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptives; tubal ligation; intrauterine
             device; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; or vasectomized partner.

          -  Males must agree to use barrier contraception (latex condoms) when engaging in sexual
             activity while on study medication and for 28 days after taking the last dose of study
             medication.

          -  Subjects with a documented history of non-infectious intermediate-, anterior and
             intermediate, posterior, or pan-uveitis including but not restricted to: intermediate
             uveitis, sarcoidosis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, birdshot
             retinochoroidopathy, retinal vasculitis, sympathetic ophthalmia, multifocal
             choroiditis with panuveitis. Prior to study screening, potential subjects must have
             been evaluated and screened for infectious etiologies by the investigators, possibly
             as part of standard clinical acre; all testing to rule out infectious causes must be
             performed within 3 months of screening for the STOP-UVEITIS study.

          -  Currently active and uncontrolled uveitis (of the types mentioned above) that at the
             determination of the investigator, requires the initiation of corticosteroid
             monotherapy at a dose of ≥ 10 mg/day (or equivalent) or prednisone therapy and
             immunomodulatory therapy or injections of corticosteroid (intravitreal or periocular);
             or uveitis in subjects for whom oral corticosteroid is contraindicated, relatively or
             absolutely.

          -  Evidence of active non-infectious ocular inflammation, that at the determination of
             investigator, requires therapy (e.g. vitreous cells, vitreous haze, retinal

             photography, or ancillary testing (e.g. fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green
             (ICG), optical coherence tomography). As long as the investigator determines that the
             degree of inflammation can be monitored for regression or progression, the
             inflammation criterion can be met.
