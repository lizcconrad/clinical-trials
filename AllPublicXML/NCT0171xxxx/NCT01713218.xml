  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has one of the worst prognoses of all human cancers
      and is considered as a sanctuary, resistant to most of the drugs used. Identification of new
      molecular targets involved in its pathogenesis is urgently needed and required both proper
      and innovative efficacy assessment.

      This proof-of-concept trial is studying the &quot;dynamic&quot; tumor response after the administration
      of a short course (4 weeks) neoadjuvant combination of gemcitabine and a Hedgehog inhibitor
      (Vismodegib) before surgery in patients with operable pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is characterized by a high stromal density and is a hypoperfused tumor,
      precluding cytotoxics delivery to the epithelial tumoral compartment. There is thus a
      rationale for combining chemotherapy and antistromal drugs like Hedgehog inhibitors.
      Targeting the resectable primary tumor offers an appropriate setting to (1) evaluate and
      monitor early treatment effects on the tumor, (2) correlate dynamic imaging changes
      (perfusion and diffusion coefficient) to pre- and post-therapeutic tissue changes, (3)
      identify specific predictive biomarkers for the drugs used (i.e. gemcitabine transporters and
      Hedgehog pathway genes and proteins) and (4) assess if this early &quot;dynamic and biomolecular
      response&quot; can predict treatment benefit and patient outcome.

    <time_frame>4 weeks (duration of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy).</time_frame>
    <description>In order to detect changes in the tumor microenvironment and to monitor treatment efficacy, Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) and Diffusion Weighted-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI) constitute tools more and more used. The acquired data can be analyzed using a pharmacokinetic model to obtain quantitative parameters relative to tissue perfusion and vascular permeability (Ktrans, a volume transfer constant of contrast agent between blood plasma and the extravascular extracellular space; Apparent Diffusion Coefficient as a surrogate marker of tissue cellularity). DCE/DW-MRI will be achieved weekly before each neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment and before surgery. Each patient will be his/her own control by comparing serial imaging results with those of the baseline MRI.</description>

    <description>The objective is to identify within pre-therapeutic samples and surgical specimens several specific biomarkers involved (1) in the Hedgehog signalling pathway (GLI1, Sonic Hedgehog, Patched, Smoothened immunohistochemical patterns protein expression) and predicting response to anti-Hh therapy, (2) in the metabolization of gemcitabine (human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1, deoxycytidine kinase) and predicting response to gemcitabine therapy, and (3) in the relative contribution of both anti-Hh therapy and gemcitabine therapy.</description>
