    <textblock>
      Observational cohort study in children hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis. Patients are
      nursed in cohort isolation, meaning that all patients admitted for bronchiolitis are cohorted
      together, irrespective of viral diagnosis. Aim is to investigate the incidence and clinical
      impact of co-infections in this group.
