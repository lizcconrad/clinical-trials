  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over, single centre, 14 week
      clinical trial on healthy volunteers. Following a two week run-in-period, subjects were
      randomized, and treatment with synbiotic or placebo for 21 days was given, followed by a
      3-week wash-out period before the second treatment period, followed by a another wash-out
      period. Volunteers completed questionnaires for each period on overall health and well being,
      stool frequency and consistency and gastrointestinal symptoms. The subjects were asked to
      collect fecal samples for investigation of microbiological and microbial metabolites before
      and after three treatment periods. The primary objective of the study is tan increase in
      fecal butyrate concentration. Secondary objectives are changes in microbiota composition and
      short-chain fatty acids.
