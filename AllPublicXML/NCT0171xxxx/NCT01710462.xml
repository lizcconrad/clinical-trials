      This superiority phase III study to compare the combination of Pantoprazole and Domperidone
      with Pantoprazole isolated to the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The
      hypothesis is that combination of the two medication at the unique capsule is better to the
      patients because decrease the quantity of times the patients need to take medicines during
      the day.
