    <textblock>
      This study will prospectively enroll approximately 660 children, at least 18 months and less
      than 5 years of age, who have been referred to a pediatric developmental evaluation centers.
      Enrolled children will have blood drawn for RNA gene expression analysis and undergo a
      clinical evaluation to determine the presence or absence of a diagnosis of ASD.

      The sequential co-primary objectives of this study are:

        -  To develop an algorithm to classify blood RNA gene expression patterns to maximize
           agreement between the classification and a clinical assessment of presence or absence of
           Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).

        -  To prospectively assess the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the blood RNA gene
           expression classification algorithm (the SDX-002 test) in children referred to a
           developmental evaluation clinic for a possible developmental disorder.
