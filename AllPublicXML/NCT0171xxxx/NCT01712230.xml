  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine whether a reduction in hormones (such as occurs during
      menopause) causes a decrease in calories burned during physical activity. This study will
      also determine whether a reduction in hormones decreases calories burned while sleeping,
      resting, and eating and whether an exercise intervention can prevent this.

      Participants will be women who are nearing menopause based on age (42-52 y) but have normal
      menstrual cycles. Participants will be randomized to receive monthly injections of placebo or
      a study drug that reduces sex hormones (GnRH agonist) for 24 weeks. Women who receive GnRH
      agonist will be further randomized to no exercise or a supervised exercise program. Thus, the
      3 treatment groups are: placebo, GnRH agonist, GnRH agonist+exercise. The investigators will
      measure changes in calories burned during physical activity, sleep, rest, and after a meal
      after 3 and 6 months of hormone suppression using doubly-labeled water and room calorimetry.
      Other measures include food intake estimated from food records; body composition measured by
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA); glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose
      tolerance test; and markers of inflammation in the blood.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy women aged 40 to 60 years

          2. Are still experiencing regular menstrual cycles.

          3. They must be willing to be randomized to placebo or GnRHAG therapy for 24 weeks

          4. Be physically able to be randomized to participate in a programmed exercise training
             program.

        The investigators will consent up to 132 subjects with the aim of enrolling 22 in each of
        the 3 groups (placebo, GnRHAG, or GnRHAG+Exercise).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  irregular menstrual cycles defined as 2 or more missed cycles in the previous year

          -  serum FSH &gt;25 mIU/mL measured during the first 5 days of the menstrual cycle
