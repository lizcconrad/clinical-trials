      A phase I trial to study the safety of mobilization of stem cells with G-CSF and Mozobil in
      patients with chronic liver disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver cirrhosis in humans represents the end stage of chronic liver injury. Supply of &quot;new&quot;
      stem cells to the liver could regenerate hepatocytes and restore the lost function. Delivery
      of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) has been shown in animal models and limited clinical trials
      to result in improved liver disease (MELD) score.

      In preclinical studies we have demonstrated that the combination of G-CSF plus Mozobil can
      effectively mobilize both hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and MSCs into the peripheral
      circulation. While G-CSF only mobilizes HSCs.

      The clinical trial will test the safety of treating patients with end stage liver disease
      with G-CSF and Mozobil to mobilize MSCs into the peripheral circulation.

    <description>The secondary objective is to study the mobilization of stem cells, including MSCs, to the peripheral circulation and the effect on liver function. Functional assays will define the levels of heamtopoietic stem cells (CD34+ cells) and MSCs (CFU-F) in the circulation of patients.</description>

        transplant Age &lt; 18 MELD score &gt;12 Patients whose MELD scores are currently less than or
