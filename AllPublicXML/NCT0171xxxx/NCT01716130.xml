  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the acceptance of the Fluzone Intradermal (ID)vaccine in adults and vaccine
      administrators in the United States. Patients completed 2 surveys, one immediately
      post-vaccination and one seven days later, that documented demographics and assessed their
      injection pain, injection anxiety, speed of injection, overall satisfaction, and preference
      for next year's vaccine. Vaccine administrators completed one survey assessing ease of
      vaccine preparation and administration, time required to administer, and safety/risk of
      needle stick injury for patient and administrator.

      Patients were divided into two groups: 1) those that reported receiving the intramuscular
      (IM) influenza vaccine in the past 3 years; and 2) those that reported not receiving the IM
      influenza vaccine in the past 3 years. The survey responses were compared between the two
      groups. In addition, the subjects that reported receiving the IM vaccine in the past 3 years
      were asked to compare their experience with the IM vaccine versus the ID vaccine.

    <description>Using a survey tool, patients receiving the Fluzone ID vaccine were separated into 2 groups: 1) those that reported receiving the IM influenza vaccine in the past 3 years; and 2) those that reported not receiving the IM influenza vaccine in the past 3 years. All subject's satisfaction was assessed by survey immediately post-vaccination and 7 days later. Survey responses were compared between the 2 groups. The group that reported receiving the IM influenza vaccine in the past 3 years was asked to compare their experience with the ID vaccine in comparison to the IM vaccine.</description>
