  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised controlled trial that formally compares intra-ocular lenses, which can
      be used in cataract surgery, one of which is the standard 'monofocal' lens, and the other is
      the newer toric lens which can correct astgimatism.

      The null hypothesis is that both intra-ocular lenses give the same visual outcome in cataract
      surgery. The alternative hypothesis is that the toric lens, provides a better unaided
      (without glasses) vision, by correcting the participant's astigmatism.

      It has been decided to conduct a randomised controlled trial of the two lenses, as although
      the toric lenses are endorsed by many case series (which show a reduction in astigmatism),
      they have not been formally compared to the standard lens. An RCT will enable the formal
      comparison.

      It is expected that this trial will take approximately a year to conduct: six months of
      recruitment and six months of follow-up. A further six months will be required to analyse the
      data and prepare a manuscript for publication.

      The investigators do not plan to conduct an interim analysis or report as this is a
      short-trial (six months follow-up) using two alternative lens that are CE marked and already
      widely used.

      Participants who have both cataract and astigmatism will be identified from the
      GP/optometrist referral letter. They will be seen in specially designated clinics for this
      research study, which will run alongside the routine cataract 'one' stop clinics at St
      Richard's Hospital and Worthing Hospital. This will allow for those patients who wish to be
      part of the study to have all the necessary examination done in one visit and for those who
      decline participation to be seen in the regular cataract clinic. Potential participants will
      be sent the research trial information (appendix A) with their appointment letter.

      After introducing himself the researcher (who is also a senior cataract surgeon at Western
      Sussex Hospital Trust), will check if potential participants have had the opportunity to read
      the trial information that they were sent, or give participants a further copy as required.
      The key points of the trial will be re-iterated by the researcher and they will be invited to
      ask any questions about the trialThe researcher will check that the potential participant has
      read and understood the participant information leaflet. They will answer any questions that
      the potential participant has and will then take signed consent from those willing to
      participate.

      Only one eye (the 'trial eye') from each patient will be used in the trial. In patients with
      bilateral cataract, one eye will be selected as the trial eye. This will be the eye that the
      participant prefers, after consultation with the researcher or surgeon, to have operated
      first. The participant will be allocated a unique study reference number.

      Patients who decline to take part in the trial will be offered cataract surgery as per usual
      WSHT/NHS procedure.
