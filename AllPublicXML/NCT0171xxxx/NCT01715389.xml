    <textblock>
      This pilot intervention study will test the feasibility and acceptability and explore the
      outcomes of a primary care-based shared decision making (SDM) electronic medical record
      (EMR)-based portal that provides education, elicits and tracks patients/families' treatment
      concerns and goals, assesses symptoms and asthma control over time, and provides decision
      support to clinicians and families.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of the intervention to parents and clinicians</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parents and clinicians will be asked a series of open-ended questions regarding themes including satisfaction, acceptability and unintended consequences of using the portal for intervention subjects and using MyChart in general for control subjects. Subjects will also be asked a series of Likert-scaled questions related to satisfaction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shared decision making</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Joint participation in decision-making will be measured by the Observing Parent Involvement (OPTION) scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent Activation</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parent activation will be measured by the Parent Patient Activation Measure (PPAM).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Goal Attainment</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months, 3 months, 6 months then Monthly</time_frame>
    <description>Parents will identify one or more goals at the study start. Progress toward the goal(s) will be assessed at 3 and 6 month follow-up using Likert-scaled items for the control group, and monthly through use of the portal for the intervention group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma-Related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma-related quality of life will be measured using The Integrated Therapeutics Group Child Asthma Short Form (ITG-CASF)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Control</measure>
    <time_frame>0 months, 6 months</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma-related Utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Utilization will be measured by parent report and chart review by the research team of the following:
Any primary care or subspecialty outpatient encounters relevant to asthma care, asthma-specific acute primary care visits or Urgent Care Center visits, asthma-specific Emergency Room visits, asthma-specific hospital admissions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Medication Adherence/Receipt</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of Recruitment</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The feasibility of recruitment will be assessed by examining the proportion of all families contacted who meet enrollment criteria and the proportion of families meeting enrollment criteria who enroll.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of Follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The feasibility of follow-up will be assessed by the proportion of enrolled families who complete each study measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of Portal Use</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The feasibility of portal use will be assessed by the level of research team/other outside support needed.</description>

    <description>Parents in the intervention group will use the MyAsthma Patient Portal to receive enhanced educational information on asthma and its treatment, identify concerns and goals related to asthma treatment, track progress toward goals and management of concerns monthly, and track asthma symptoms monthly.
Clinicians seeing intervention families at office visits will have access to information from the portal including concerns, goals, progress toward goals, and tracking of asthma symptoms.</description>
