  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of
      treating persons who are actively using illicit drugs for hepatitis C using a collaborative,
      multidisciplinary, integrated care model. We hypothesize that by maximizing facilitators and
      minimizing barriers to treatment we can enable drug users to receive effective treatment for
      hepatitis C.

      This study examines the feasibility of integrated treatment for hepatitis C in active IDUs
      using a client-centered, multidisciplinary model that combines expert care in five domains:
      (a) antiviral pharmacotherapy for HCV infection; (b) substance abuse treatment; (c)
      psychiatric evaluation and treatment; (d) primary medical care; and (e) intensive,
      client-centered, case management. The Weill Cornell Medical College Center for the Study of
      Hepatitis C collaborates with community-based organizations providing services to injection
      drug users to provide multidisciplinary, integrated care using a model that combines the
      resources of culturally appropriate community-based agencies with those of a state-of-the-art
      tertiary care center.

    <description>SVR is measured 24 weeks after completion of antiviral treatment</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>completion of medical and psychiatric evaluation for antiviral therapy</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>initiation of antiviral therapy</measure>

    <measure>other adverse events or adverse effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Monthly up to 72 weeks</time_frame>
