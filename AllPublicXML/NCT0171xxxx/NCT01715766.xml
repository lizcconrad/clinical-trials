  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn about the causes of different types of pain that can
      occur in people who have had an amputation. By gathering information through blood tests,
      photographs, a nerve test, and questionnaires, we hope to de-code how each individual's
      special characteristics affect the type and amount of pain they experience in their amputated
      limb.

      Studies have already shown that pain following amputation might be caused by differences in a
      person's genes. This study may help us find out how genes affect the way you feel pain and
      why you may feel more or less or different kinds of pain than another person with a similar
      amputation. What we learn in this research study may lead to discoveries as to why some
      painkillers work better for some people than others.

      Blood draw will consist of, two BD™ P100 tubes (2x8.5mL=17mL) where the plasma will be
      separated by centrifuge then placed in a -80ºC freezer. Two RNA tubes (2 x 2.5mL=5mL) and one
      DNA tube (8.5mL) will be place first, in a -20ºC freezer for 24-36 hours then moved to a
      -80ºC freezer. All the blood samples will remain in a -80ºC freezer at the Department of
      Clinical Investigation(DCI) laboratory until they are sent to Duke University after every 8
      subjects.

        Male and female active duty military personnel age 18 years and older presenting with the

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female active duty military personnel age 18 years and older undergoing
             treatment at WRAMC and future WRNMMC with the diagnosis of post injury amputation of 1
             limb, more than 3 but less than 18 months prior to enrollment. In particular, phantom
             limb pain patients will be included

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe Traumatic Brain Injury (Primary major head trauma and diagnosis of traumatic
             brain injury resulting in documented, permanent or prolonged cognitive deficits that
             would preclude participation in the study (i.e. decreased intellectual capacity,
             marked memory deficits, or inability to communicate verbally or in writing)

          -  Significant cognitive deficits that would preclude participation in the study.

          -  Substantial hearing loss without alternative means of communication.

          -  Documented spinal cord injury with permanent or persistent deficits.

          -  Diagnosis of fibromyalgia or other chronic pain syndrome such as chronic headaches.

          -  Evidence of ongoing tissue damage pain, infection, bone spur, or poorly fitting
             prosthesis.
