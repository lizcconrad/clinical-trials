  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>a rate of rupture of 1%</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>All the subjects have been monitored for 2 years and will be checked MRI to define rupture at 6month, 1 year and 2year after the breast implant.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>a rate of capsular contracture of 5%</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Baker classification that divided into 4 stages will be used as a reference to evaluate the capsular contracture. Only stage 3 and 4 will be confirmed as capsular contracture.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>a rate of connective tissue disease</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Connective tissue disease include hair loss, erythema, photosensitivity, dry eye syndrome,myalgia,neuralgia,arthralgia, etc.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in bust girth and actual measured bra-cup size</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Bra cup size can be determined by measuring right or left bust circumference over the nipple.
6 inch= doubleA, 7inch=A, 8inch= B, 9inch=C, 10inch=D, 11inch=E Bust girth means bust circumference line . It can be determined by measuring around the women's torso over the fullest part of the breasts.</description>
