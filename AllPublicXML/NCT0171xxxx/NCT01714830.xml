    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) can affect both sexes and lasts at least for 3 months. CPP in women
      could be due to endometrioses, ovarian cyst, colitis, etc, making the correct diagnosis
      important (1-3). The most prevalent reason for CPP in men is non-bacterial chronic
      prostatitis and in many cases they are considered equivalent to each other (4).

      Chronic non-bacterial prostatitis is associated with pain in pelvic region and could be
      associated with other symptoms such as dysuria, myalgia, arthralgia, chronic fatigue, burning
      sensation in the urethra, abdominal, urine frequency, and pain after ejaculation (4-6).
      Chronic prostatitis / chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is devided into two groups: III
      A Type (inflammatory) and III B (Non-inflammatory). The difference between the two groups is
      the presence of leukocytes in prostatic secretions after prostate massage, urine and semen
      (7,8).

      In general population, the prevalence of chronic pelvic pain syndrome is about 0.5 percent
      because many patients do not consider their symptoms as disease, while 6.3% of people may
      show symptoms (9-11).

      One of the most important challenges in the treatment of chronic prostatitis / chronic pelvic
      pain syndrome, is that its etiology is obscure and it is known as a multi-factorial syndrome.
      The proposed explanations are infection, psychological reasons, autoimmunity and
      neuro-myospasm. Hypotheses about endothelial cells defect and cardio vascular disease have
      also been proposed, upon which the new therapies have been based.

      In duplex mapping study of prostatic vessels in two groups of healthy and chronic
      non-bacterial prostatitis people, it was shown that there was a significant reduction in
      systolic flow in prostatic arteries in people who had chronic non-bacterial prostatitis, and
      there was a direct association between pain and blood flow intensity, suggesting chronic
      ischemia as a possible cause for pain (13). Pain in prostate without significant infection is
      the hallmark of chronic prostatitis / chronic pelvic pain syndrome (5). In physical exam,
      prostate or pelvic tenderness may be observed in half of the patients.

      The diagnosis of chronic prostatitis / chronic pelvic pain syndrome is challenging. No
      specific lab test exists for its detection. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, which is
      typically increased in acute infection, is usually normal in this condition. The diagnostic
      approach in these patients is based on ruling out other curable causes such as benign
      prostatic hyperplasia or bladder cancer (14-20).

      NIH Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) is used to evaluate symptom severity and
      response to treatment in these patients. A reduction of 4-6 points in the score is considered
      significant response to the treatment (21).

      There is no first line treatment for patients of chronic pelvic pain syndrome. The use of
      anti-bacterial, alpha-blockers or anti-inflammatory drug is logical. However, if the patient
      does not respond, further administration is not helpful. In non-responders, combination of
      drugs or other non-medical methods should be considered (23-26).

      As discussed earlier, blood flow reduction, ischemia and disorders in endothelium of vessels
      may cause pain in these patients and methods to improve blow flow may help(13,27). One of
      these methods is extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) which is typically used for
      tendonitis, acceleration in bone reunion and wound healing, improvement in muscle movements
      through a reduction in passive muscular tonus, increasing muscular range of motion after
      cerebrovascular accident (CVA), treatment of Peyronie's disease and erectile dysfunction
      (28-30).

      Shoskes et al compared 24 chronic prostatitis patients with 11 controls in terms of vascular
      stiffness, indexes of increased blood flow, vasodilation and reactive vascular hyperemia,
      using Endo-PAT Â® 2000-Machine. They showed that endothelial disorder and stiffness along with
      the risk of cardiovascular disorders are increased in CP/CPPS (31).

      The use of ESWT for the treatment of CP/CPPS has been evaluated in a few studies. In a
      double-blind randomized control trial, Zimmermann et al placed 60 patients with chronic
      pelvic pain syndrome from chronic non-bacterial prostatitis into two groups and treated one
      of them in 4 sessions with a frequency of 3000 per session. The treatment group showed
      superior results in terms of symptom improvement(32).

      In another study, Zimmermann et al followed 34 patients with chronic pelvic pain syndrome,
      after one, four and twelve weeks post ESWT in terms of quality of life and pain reduction.
      They showed that this method is useful and without any complications (33).

      Considering the promising results of the cited articles along with the paucity of data in
      this regard we decided to perform a double-blind sham-controlled study to evaluate the
      effectiveness of ESWT in CP/CPPS.

      Eligible patients will sign an informed consent. Bacterial prostatitis will be ruled out by a
      2-glass test (In this method a mid-stream urine sample is collected (10 ml of urine is
      discarded and the second 10 ml of urine is collected) and then prostate massage is done for a
      minute by Digital Rectal Exam and then another 10 ml of urine is collected.

      After briefing the patients about the method and obtaining written consent from, he will be
      randomly allocated into either the treatment or control group.

      In the first group patients will be treated by ESWT once a week for 4 weeks. (Each time 3000
      impulses, with 0.25 mJouls/M2 and 3 Hertz of frequency. After each 500 pulses, the probe
      position will be corrected, using trans-perineal ultrasound. The used device in this study is
      the standars electromagnetic DUOLITH SD1- shock waves against erectile dysfunction.

      In the control group, the same protocol is applied but with the probe being turned off.

      The examination is performed in supine position for patient. For each patient, pelvic pain
      intensity considering is performed at the beginning and end of study, by VAS. Patients are
      considered by doctor for NIH index at the beginning and end of study.

      Finally, obtained data about pain relief and change in NIH-CPSI are recorded in special
      profile for each patient and finally are analyzed.
