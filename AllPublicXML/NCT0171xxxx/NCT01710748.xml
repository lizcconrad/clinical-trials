    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized controlled, single blind, two-arm, multicenter
      clinical evaluation.

      Diabetic patients (n=112) with de novo coronary artery disease will be randomized to one of
      the 2 treatment arms: 1) Reservoir-Based Polymer-Free Amphilimus-Eluting Stent or 2)
      Polymer-Based Everolimus-Eluting Stent.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Polymer-Free Amphilimus-Eluting Stent
      implantation is effective in reducing neointimal hyperplasia as compared to Polymer-Based
      Everolimus-Eluting Stent in diabetic patients, using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) as
      the primary imaging modality.

    <textblock>
      In patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), drug eluting stents (DES) have been shown to be
      associated with greater neointimal suppression than bare-metal stents. However, there is an
      ongoing debate on the optimal drug-eluting stent in diabetic patients.

      This study is a prospective, randomized controlled, single blind, two-arm, multicenter
      clinical evaluation.

      Diabetic patients (n=112) with de novo coronary artery disease will be randomized to one of
      the 2 treatment arms: 1) Reservoir-Based Polymer-Free Amphilimus-Eluting Stent or 2)

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neointimal hyperplasia volume obstruction</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is assessed by Optical Coherence Tomography. It is defined as neointimal hyperplasia volume (mm3) divided by the stent volume multiplied by 100.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of uncovered struts</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>This endpoint is assessed by Optical Coherence Tomography. Struts are classified as uncovered if any part of the strut is visibly exposed to the lumen, or covered if a layer of tissue is visible over all the reflecting surfaces.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of malapposed struts</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>This endpoint is assessed by Optical Coherence Tomography. Apposition is assessed strut by strut by measuring the distance between the strut marker and the lumen contour. Struts with distance to lumen contour larger than the sum of strut + polymer thickness are considered malapposed. This results in incomplete strut apposition thresholds of 89 µm for the Xience Prime and 80 µm for the Cre8 stent. Struts located at the ostium of side branches, with no vessel wall behind, are excluded from the analysis of apposition.</description>

    <measure>Maximum percentage of NIH cross-sectional obstruction</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>This endpoint is assessed by Optical Coherence Tomography. Percentage of NIH cross-sectional obstruction is defined as the NIH area (mm2) divided by the stent area multiplied by 100.</description>
