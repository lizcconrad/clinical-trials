    <textblock>
      In this study, fluticasone furoate (FF) and vilanterol (VI) in different dose combinations
      (50/25mcg, 100/25mcg and 200/25mcg) will be administered from a single dry powder device to
      evaluate the PD, PK, safety and tolerability of the combination in healthy Chinese subjects.
      The information gathered will be used as a support of the clinical development program of the
      fixed dose combination of FF/VI inhalation powder in Chinese population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-way cross over, randomized,
      single and repeat dose study. A total of 16 healthy subjects aged 18-45 years will be
      randomised with the aim of achieving at least 10 evaluable subjects to each treatment period.
      The primary objective is to evaluate the systemic steroid PD effects (serum cortisol 24 hour
      weighted mean on Day 7) of FF and systemic ß-adrenergic PD effects (ECG maximum QTcF 0-4h and
      whole blood potassium 0-4h in Day 1 and Day 7) of VI; the secondary objectives are aimed to
      evaluate the PK, safety and tolerability of FF/VI inhalation powder after a single and repeat
      dose administration.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;= 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN
             is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Healthy male or female between 18 and 45 years of age inclusive.

             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.
             Subjects with blood pressure values outside the normal range [systolic (90-139 mmHg)
             and diastolic (50-89 mmHg)] and subjects with ECG findings suggestive of a previous MI
             should always be excluded from enrollment.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

        Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal
        ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea
        [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
        &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;147 pmol/L) is confirmatory].

        Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in
        Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or
        investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy
        at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until completion of the
        follow-up visit.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of
             the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1. This criterion must be followed from
             the time of the first dose of study medication until completion of the follow-up
             visit.

          -  No significant abnormality on 12-lead ECG at screening, including the following
             specific requirements:

        QRS interval to be &gt;= 60msec and &lt;=120msec; The waveforms must enable the QT interval to be
        clearly defined; QTc interval must be &lt; 450msec (QTcF; machine or manual reading) based on
        a single ECG value, or an average from three ECGs obtained over a brief recording period.

          -  Subjects who are current non-smokers, who have not used any tobacco products in the 12
             month period preceding the screening visit, and have a pack history of &lt;=5 pack years.

          -  Subjects who are able to use the inhalation device satisfactorily.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

             than 3 units (males) or defined as an average weekly intake of greater than 14 units
             or an average daily intake of greater than 2 units (females). One unit is equivalent
             to a 285mL glass of full strength beer or 425mL schooner of light beer or 1 (30mL)
             measure of spirits or 1 glass (100mL) of wine (NHMRC Guidelines [NHMRC, 2001]).

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components (magnesium
             stearate and lactose etc.) or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion
             of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  History of milk protein allergy.

          -  History of any adverse reaction including immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to any
             ICS, β2-agonist or sympathomimetic drug.

          -  Blood donation or sampled as a study subject within three months preceding the first
             dose of study drug and blood donation during the entire study.

             to dosing.

          -  Lactating females.
