  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) typically have reduced
      exercise capacity. This is because their lungs are damaged and because of increased work of
      breathing. In some patients, exercise capacity is reduced to such a level that even simple
      activities of daily living, such as washing and dressing, may impose a challenge.

      Recent findings in healthy young people suggest that increasing the amount of nitrate in our
      diet in the form of beetroot juice can improve the ability to exercise. Studies involving
      cycling have shown that less oxygen is needed to perform the same level of exercise after
      taking more nitrate in the diet. Nitrate (found in abundance in beetroot) is known to be
      converted in the body to nitric oxide (NO), a substance which increases blood flow and may
      affect the energy-producing mechanisms inside muscle cells. A recent exciting finding is that
      such dietary nitrate supplementation appears to reduce the amount of oxygen needed to
      complete moderate intensity exercise (walking) in healthy individuals. It is the purpose of
      this study to see if such effects could be seen in COPD patients. If this is indeed the case,
      then it may suggest that a period of dietary supplementation of a relatively cheap, widely
      available, and natural food product may improve the ability of patients to undergo everyday
      tasks and ultimately improve their quality of life.

      To help investigators understand the effects of dietary nitrate supplementation on the
      ability to exercise in COPD patients, the investigators will recruit 15 people with mild to
      moderate disease. They will complete a series of undemanding exercise tests on three separate
      occasions. On one occasion they will have had a course of nitrate rich beetroot juice leading
      up to the tests, and on the other occasion they will have had a course of beetroot juice with
      the nitrate removed. The investigators will monitor blood pressure, levels of nitrate and
      nitrite in the blood, oxygen uptake and functional capacity during the tests which will allow
      us to assess any effects that may have occurred as a result of increased nitrate intake.
