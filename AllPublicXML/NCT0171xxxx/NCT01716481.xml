    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study was to test hypothesis that ischemic stroke patients having
      moderate to severe persistent neurologic deficit will have better outcomes with intravenous
      transplantation of autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) expanded with autologous serum
      that is obtained at acute phase of stroke than patients receiving standard treatment.

      In this study, we will use autologous 'ischemic' serum that obtained at the earliest time
      point as possible (immediate after randomization) for the purpose of ischemic
      preconditioning. We have recently conducted preclinical studies on the effects of ischemic
      preconditioning on the MSC functions. We have evaluated the characteristics of rat MSCs after
      culture with fetal bovine serum (FBS) or serum obtained from rat stroke model. Compared to
      FBS, the use of serum obtained from rat stroke model resulted in more rapid expansion of
      MSCs, which reduces cell preparation time by increase in G2/M phase, decreased cell
      death/senescence, increased trophic factor secretion, and increased migration capacity.
