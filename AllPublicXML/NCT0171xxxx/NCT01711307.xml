  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed trial is a multi-centre prospective randomized controlled trial comparing
      outcomes of patients with acute Achilles tendon ruptures treated either non-operatively or
      with open operative tendon repair. All patients will undergo accelerated functional
      rehabilitation. The primary outcome measure is Achilles tendon re-rupture rate.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Equivalent clinical outcomes to surgical repair; reduced morbidity and disability to subjects
      through elimination of a surgical repair; reduction of cost to patients by eliminating need
      for surgery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Complete mid-substance rupture of the Achilles tendon as diagnosed on clinical exam

          -  Present for initial assessment and treatment with application of a plantar-flexed cast
             within 48 hours of their injury.

          -  Referred to one of the participating orthopaedics surgeons in a timely fashion so as
             to allow for further treatment (operative repair or initiation of the rehabilitation
             protocol) within 14 days of their injury.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Open Achilles injury

          -  Achilles injury that is not a mid-substance tendon injury

          -  Any additional injury to the ipsilateral lower extremity

          -  Contraindication to surgery or anesthetic

          -  (Physical or mental) that may interfere with compliance with the rehabilitation
             protocol

          -  Any known factor for increased risk of Achilles tendon rupture (i.e. diabetes
             mellitus, immunosuppressive therapy including local or systemic steroids, and
             fluoroquinolone use).
