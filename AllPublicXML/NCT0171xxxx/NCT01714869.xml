  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how effective and feasible an 8-week course of
      Swedish massage is, for reducing pain and increasing function in adults who are VA healthcare
      users, with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this supplement is to enroll n=25 VA healthcare users with knee OA into the
      initial 8-week EMBARK massage program in order to collect preliminary data on the
      feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of massage in this patient group, in preparation for
      a larger grant submission to evaluate the effectiveness of massage for knee OA in the VA
      healthcare system. All veterans enrolled under this supplement will complete the initial
      8-week massage protocol, since this will allow us the maximum opportunity to assess the
      feasibility and gather preliminary efficacy data. Veterans with symptomatic knee OA will be
      recruited from the Durham VA Medical Center, and the remaining study activities will be
      completed at the Duke site of the EMBARK study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis of the Knee and Hip Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Index is self-administered and assesses the three dimensions of pain, disability and joint stiffness in knee and hip osteoarthritis through 24 questions. The WOMAC has been subject to numerous validation studies to assess reliability and responsiveness to change in therapy, including physical forms of therapy</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain: The Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Used to measure pain sensation intensity evoked by nociceptive stimuli. Subjects quickly and easily rate stimuli within the series by indicating level of pain on a 100 mm scale. Pain intensity is represented by the participant drawing a line on the scale indicative of pain experienced (0 = no pain, to 100 = worse pain imaginable). The VAS is anchored at the left by &quot;no pain sensation&quot; and at the right by &quot;the most intense pain sensation imaginable.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain: PROMIS Pain Interference Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is a system of highly reliable, valid, flexible, precise, and responsive assessment tools that measure patient-reported health status. The Pain Interference Questionnaire has 6 questions answered on an ordinal scale of five gradations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Joint Flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Joint flexibility is defined as the range of motion (ROM) allowed at the knee. The knee's ROM is measured by the number of degrees from the starting position of a segment to its position at the end of its full range of the movement. This is measured using a double-armed goniometer. A stationary arm holding a protractor is placed parallel with a stationary body segment and a movable arm moves along a moveable body segment. The pin (axis of goniometer) is placed over the joint.</description>
