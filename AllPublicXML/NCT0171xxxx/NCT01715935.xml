      Disease and Stage: Metastatic and locally advanced clear cell renal carcinoma

      An open-label, exploratory, single-arm, multicenter trial.

      Everolimus will be administered orally, once daily, for 6 weeks followed by a 1-week rest
      period prior to nephrectomy.

      Two to four weeks after surgery, everolimus will be reintroduced only for metastatic patients
      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of patient consent, or other
      stopping rules are met.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, exploratory, single-arm, multicenter trial. Treatment with everolimus will be
      initiated once patients have undergone baseline screening and provided their written informed
      consent.

      Everolimus will be administered orally, once daily, for 6 weeks followed by a 1-week rest
      period prior to surgery. The starting dose will be 10 mg daily with provision for dose
      reduction based on tolerability.

      Radical nephrectomy will be performed at the end of week 7. For metastatic patients, two to
      four weeks after surgery, everolimus will be reintroduced. Treatment will be continued until
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of patient consent, or other stopping
      rules are met.

      Patients with locally advanced renal carcinoma will stop drug intake before nephrectomy.

      Resumption of everolimus may be postponed in cases of a delay in wound healing or surgical
      complications.

      After treatment discontinuation and the last treatment visit (28-days after the last dose),
      patients will be followed up in order to collect data on the onset of progression and
      survival. In metastatic patients discontinuing treatment for reasons other than disease
      progression, tumor assessment will continue every 3 months, until disease progression or
      initiation of other anticancer therapy for up to one year of follow-up.
