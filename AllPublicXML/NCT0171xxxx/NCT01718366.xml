      Determinate safety and response rate of the association Deferasirox -Vitamine D - Azacitidine
      in treatment of high risk MDS

      Deferasirox Exjade:

      The dose of Deferasirox will be assigned according to the ferritin level. Dose escalation is
      scheduled during the phase I, with 5 additional patients per group.

      The maximal tolerated dose of Deferasirox will be required for the phase II of the study.

      The first dose will be assigned according to the ferritin level of the patient at time of
      inclusion:

      5 mg/kg/d if the ferritin is &gt;300ng/ml and &lt; 1000ng/ml in Group 1 10 mg/kg/d if the ferritin
      is ≥1000ng/ml) in Group 2

      Group 1 : Ferritin 300 to 1000ng /ml:

        -  cohort 1 : 5 mg/kg/d

        -  cohort 2 : 10mg/kg/d

        -  cohort 3 : 15 mg/kg/d

      Group 2 : Ferritin &gt; 1000ng /ml:

        -  cohort 1 : 10 mg/kg/d

        -  cohort 2 : 15mg/kg/d

        -  cohort 3 : 20 mg/kg/d

           5 patients will be treated by cohort. In absence of toxicity (extra-hematological
           toxicity grade 3 or 4 or hematological grade 4), 5 additional patients will be included
           in the next cohort.

      Deferasirox will be administrated once daily during all the study period. Uvedose will be
      administrated once weekly during all the study period (100.000 UI P.O).

      Azacitidine will be administrated sc at 75 mg/m²/d, during 7 days, J1 to J7 of each
      cycles(One cycle is 28 days)

      During phase I and II, Deferasirox will always be associated with Vitamin D and Azacitidine

      Patients will be received 6 cycles of treatment (except if progression, unacceptable toxicity
      or withdrawn of patients occured) After 3 and 6 cycles, an evaluation will be done to
      evaluate the efficacy of the treatment.

      No dose modification of deferasirox will be done after 3 cycles of treatment except in case
      of progression). After 6 cycles, patients with CR, PR, marrow CR or HI will be treated with
      the same dose of Deferasirox until progression .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deferasirox will be administrated once daily in the morning on an empty stomach, 30 minutes
      before meal.

      Deferasirox will be stopped if the ferritin level is under 100 ng/ml,and could be restarted
      is the ferritin level increase to 200 ng/ml

      Uvedose dose could be adjusted according to the phosphocalcic metabolism parameters and the
      plasma Vitamin D3 level.
