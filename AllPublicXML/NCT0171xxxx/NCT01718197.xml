      The mission of SARP is to improve the understanding of severe asthma through integrated study
      of its clinical and biological features and to evaluate their changes over time. The ultimate
      goal of these efforts is to promote better treatments for severe asthma.

    <textblock>
      The mission of the SARP is to improve the understanding of severe asthma to develop better
      treatments. The SARP will gain a better understanding of asthma and its endotypes, in
      children and adults, by defining the disease at the molecular and cellular levels in the
      context of the temporal phenotypic expression of the disease. To this end, the SARP
      investigators will utilize both mechanistic and evoked phenotype approaches to: 1)
      characterize developmental molecular, cellular and physiologic phenotypes in children and
      adults with mild to severe asthma, and 2) to further elucidate the evolving pathobiology and
      pathogenesis of severe asthma and its sub-phenotypes and 3) compare these features over time.

      This approach involves a shared longitudinal protocol conducted across all participating
      centers which includes common information on all SARP participants. Additionally, the SARP-SF
      has identified mechanistic research questions to be included in the shared longitudinal
      protocol. This will be explored through additional sample collections of sputum and fluids
      and biopsied tissue collected by bronchoscopy. Together, these longitudinal and mechanistic
      approaches will enable prediction of phenotype stability/fluctuation and pharmacologic
      responses and identification of novel, disease-modifying targets for treatment.

        A diverse sample of subjects with asthma is needed to gain better understanding of asthma
        and its endotypes. SARP will therefore enroll subjects 6 years and older with a physician
        diagnosis of asthma. The target recruitment goal for each center is 75% adults (age 18 and
        older) and 25% children age 6-17 years. Within the pediatric age group, an attempt will be
        made to enroll equal numbers of children 6-11 and 12-17 years of age. Similarly, an attempt
        will be made to enroll at least 50% females and 30% minorities.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  FEV1 bronchodilator reversibility ≥12% or airway hyperresponsiveness reflected by a
             methacholine PC20 ≤16 mg/mL

          -  An exception will be made for enrollees whose FEV1 is &lt; 50% predicted (&lt;70% in
             children aged 6 to 17 years), precluding methacholine challenge testing. If
             bronchodilator reversibility is &lt;12% in these participants, a diagnosis of asthma
             acceptable to the investigator is sufficient for inclusion in SARP.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy during the characterization phase,

          -  Current smoking,

          -  Smoking history &gt; 10 pack years if ≥30 years of age, or smoking history &gt; 5 pack years
             if &lt;30 years of age,

             at the PI's discretion), severe scoliosis or chest wall deformities that affect lung
             function, or congenital disorders of the lungs or airways,

          -  Currently participating in an investigational drug trial.

        Healthy Controls:

        Inclusion criteria: Healthy subjects between the age of 18y and 65y. At least 3 of the 7
