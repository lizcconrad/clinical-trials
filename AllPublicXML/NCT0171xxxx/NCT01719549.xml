      In this study, we will evaluate the efficacy and safety of TKI258(Dovitinib) monotherapy as a
      salvage chemotherapy after failure of standard first or second-line chemotherapy in
      metastatic or unresectable gastric cancer harboring FGFR2 amplification.

             drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in
             the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for this study.
