      The purpose of this study is to determine if consuming ANMUM Materna (a fortified milk
      product) over a 12-week period increases red blood cell folate concentrations in women of
      childbearing age in Singapore, compared to an equivalent amount of standard (unfortified)
      milk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Folic acid (~400 µg/day) taken around the time of conception significantly reduces the risk
      of a neural tube defect (NTD)-affected pregnancy. Strategies to reduce NTD with folic acid,
      include supplement use and food fortification. An attractive strategy for NTD prevention is
      the use of fortified foods targeted for use by women planning a pregnancy. Fonterra currently
      markets a fortified-milk (ANMUM Materna) in Asia, designed for use prior to and during
      pregnancy. This milk product, if consumed as directed, provides ~400 µg folic acid per day.
      It is not known whether ANMUM Materna will reduce NTD rate. However, in a case-control study
      the risk of NTD was inversely associated with maternal red blood cell (RBC) folate
      concentrations. Accordingly, if ANMUM Materna increases RBC folate, it could be expected to
      decrease NTD risk.

      In this study, the ANMUM Materna fortified milk will be tested against a standard control
      (unfortified) milk over a 12 week period. The subjects will consume 75g of milk powder daily
      throughout the supplementation period.
