    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is still one of the most common malignance in Korea. Because of the popularity
      of regular check ups, early detection of gastric cancer has increased, consequently, the
      survival of the patients also has increased. In this reason, the interest of outcomes after
      gastrectomy for gastric cancer move survival only to quality of life of these patients.

      Although the definition of metabolic syndrome is various, but it is normally accepted as a
      state that insulin resistance or glucose intolerance combined with hypertension or
      hyperlipidemia or obesity. Metabolic syndrome is a worldwide health problem, and the
      treatment is modification of life style, weight loss and medication. However, in most of the
      patients metabolic syndrome is considered not curable disease. Recent studies have shown that
      some bariatric surgery offers not only control the overweight but also metabolic syndrome.
      The exact mechanism is still unknown but decreased gastric volume and intestinal bypass
      itself seemed to play an important role to improve metabolic syndrome over just decreased
      weight.

      For treating gastric cancer, gastrectomy is essential and the extent of gastrectomy is varied
      subtotal and total gastrectomy according to the location of tumor. Also, reconstruction type
      is varied gastroduodenostomy and Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy after subtotal gastrectomy,
      esophagojejunostomy after total gastrectomy. This kind of operation for gastric cancer lead
      decreased gastric volume and/or intestinal bypass, which means this operation could lead
      similar effect of bariatric surgery. Already, there have been several retrospective reports
      that metabolic syndrome or diabetes was improved after gastrectomy for gastric cancer but no
      prospective study about this subject yet in Korea.

      The purpose of this study is that evaluating the degree of improvement of metabolic syndrome
      after gastrectomy for gastric cancer, and analyze the differences between the type of
      operation.
