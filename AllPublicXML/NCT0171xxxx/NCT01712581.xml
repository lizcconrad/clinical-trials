    <textblock>
      T1, T2 and T2* relaxation times, as determined with cardiac MRI, are markers of myocardial
      tissue content (water, fibrosis, iron).

      The aim of study is to determine the normal values of T1, T2 and T2* relaxation times in
      healthy volunters aged 18-69 years using 1.5T clinical MRI.

    <textblock>
      Cardiac MRI is more and more used in patients with ischaemic and non-ischaemic heart
      diseases. One major strength of MRI is its great potential for tissue characterization.

      For early detection and follow-up of patients with hemosiderosis, who are at high risk of
      myocardial iron overload, cardiac MRI seems to be the most reliable, more reproducible and
      less invasive method. In addition MRI does not require injection of contrast media. It is
      commonly accepted that myocardial T2 * value of less than 20 ms corresponds to iron overload
      in the myocardium. However, this value is based on a small sample study and nomogram based on
      age were not published. The determination of normal values in a population of healthy
      controls according to age appears to be a prerequisite for reliable interpretation of imaging
      data.

      Moreover, myocardial edema and fibrosis are more and more evaluated with cardiac MRI using T1
      and T2 myocardial relaxation times. As for T2* values, normogram of T1 and T2 values based on
      age were not published.

      The increasing use of T1, T2 and T2* mapping sequences in clinical practice for tissue
      characterization of the myocardium justify the implementation of a study in healthy
      volunteers to determine normograms based on age.
