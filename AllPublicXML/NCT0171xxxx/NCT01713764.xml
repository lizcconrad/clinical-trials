  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a small pilot, designed to provide data regarding the feasibility and
      acceptability of conducting such a study on a larger scale. The present study is a randomized
      controlled clinical trial comparing two mindfulness-based lifestyle modification programs to
      help people manage diabetes and lose weight, one using on a low-carbohydrate diet (LC) and
      the other using a moderate-carbohydrate diet promoted by the American Diabetes Association
      (ADA). Intervention content will include information about nutrition (carbohydrate
      restriction or American Diabetes Association recommended diet) and emotion regulation and
      mindful eating strategies.

    <textblock>
      Approximately 40 individuals with Type II diabetes or prediabetes will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to treatment groups. Groups will meet for 12 weekly sessions, then approximately
      biweekly for 3 sessions, for a total of 15 1.5-2 hour sessions over 4.5 months. Participants
      will be evaluated at 0, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. Our outcome of interest is HbA1c
      (glycated hemoglobin, a measure indicative of blood glucose levels and tied to diabetes
      severity).

    <description>Participants will be instructed to follow a low carbohydrate diet: carbohydrate intake 10-50 grams a day not including fiber. Foods permitted include: meats, poultry, fish, eggs, cheese, cream, some nuts and seeds, green leafy vegetables, and most other non-starchy vegetables. Because most individuals self-limit caloric intake, no calorie restriction will be recommended.
Participants will also be taught information about mindfulness and positive affect practices. The mindfulness-based curriculum will focus on the following elements: training on topics such as mindful meditation, mindful eating, awareness of fullness and hunger signals, and taste satiety. The positive emotion curriculum will include: training on topics such as noticing and savoring positive events, gratitude, positive reappraisal, personal strengths, attainable goals, and acts of kindness.</description>

    <description>Participants in the American Diabetes Association (ADA) diet group will receive standard ADA advice. The diet includes high-fiber foods (such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes), low-fat dairy products, fresh fish, and foods low in saturated fat.
