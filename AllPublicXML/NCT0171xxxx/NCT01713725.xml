  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic urticaria can be defined as the occurrence of widespread daily or almost daily wheals
      for at least 6 weeks, which may be accompanied by angioedema. While the wheals are transient,
      the resolution of angioedema is slower than wheals and could take up to 72 hours. The natural
      course of chronic urticaria is self-limited, with spontaneous remissions and occasional
      relapses. The investigators calculated a 0.6% (95% CI(Confidence Interval): 0.4-0.8)
      prevalence in a population study. It has a great impact on patients' quality of life. In a
      recent national survey on patients attending Allergy Department, chronic urticaria was the
      disease with greater impact on mental quality of life out of all allergic diseases.

      In spite of the high morbidity of this disease and the impact in quality of life, there is no
      available treatment. Last guidelines recommend initiating treatment with antihistamine and if
      there is no response to increase the dose off-label up to four-fold; systemic corticosteroids
      are also recommended in short tapering and if no response, the only treatment with clinical
      evidence to be employed is cyclosporine. As additional data, the treatment cost of this
      disease has been calculated in 2047$/year.

      In past years it has been employed the monoclonal humanized anti-Immunoglobulin IgE (iGE)
      antibody (Omalizumab) to treat moderate to severe asthma with good results. The rationale for
      this approach in chronic urticaria is that Omalizumab inhibits the binding of IgE to the high
      affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) which decreases the FceRI expression on the surface of mast
      cells and basophils so that immunoglobulin G cross linking of the alpha subunit and basophil
      degranulation is prevented.The hypothesis the investigators are working on is that monoclonal
      IgE antibody Omalizumab could be effective in controlling chronic urticaria symptoms in
      patients non respondent to conventional therapy. The investigators hypothesize that
      Omalizumab is able to revert the basophil or mast cell activation present in chronic
      urticaria.

      The objective of the present study is to demonstrate with an adequate methodology the
      efficacy and safety of Omalizumab for a new indication that is chronic autoimmune and no
      autoimmune urticaria. For that purpose, The investigators will perform a Multicenter double-
      blinded, placebo- controlled, randomized cross-over (2x2) trial. The investigators will
      include 20 patients including both female and male adults non respondent to antihistamines at
      supra therapeutic dose. Efficacy will be evaluated through the Urticaria Activity Score 7
      (UAS7), Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life validated questionnaire, patients' symptoms card
      and use of medication. Dropouts in each treatment group will be also evaluated. The
      investigators will also record leave days because of urticaria and Emergency Department
      visits, as well as adverse reactions during treatment.

      The present study would allow to offer to the Health System an evidence to evaluate the
      convenience or not to approve the use of Omalizumab for the new indication of chronic
      urticaria treatment. It is important to take into account that in the present study the
      investigators will include both autoimmune and non-autoimmune urticaria, since the efficacy
      could differ between both urticaria types. In the same way, the Health Authorities (AEMPS)
      would have independent additional information obtained through adequate methodology in the
      case that a new indication is requested. The investigators also want to stress that in the
      near future the company that manufactures this antibody could ask for a new indication for
      chronic urticaria.

      A third outcome expected is to offer information on the lasting effect of the drug that is
      symptoms' free weeks after the dose. This information would be provided from the washing
      period data and from those patients who were allocated of placebo after the active drug arm.
      This would give much needed information on the best dosing scheduling protocol.
