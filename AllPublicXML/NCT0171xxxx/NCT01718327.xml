  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with non-resectable cholangiocarcinoma, gemcitabine with cisplatin is considered
      as the reference treatment in first line chemotherapy. However, the outcomes of these
      patients remain limited and therefore more effective drugs are warranted. The context of the
      disease and current data on sunitinib suggest that sunitinib may have activity in patients
      with advanced non resectable cholangiocarcinoma.

      Thereby, it is proposed to conduct an open label single arm trial aiming evidencing activity
      of sunitinib in such a patient population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the overall survival of patients with advanced and
      unresectable cholangiocarcinoma treated continuously by sunitinib as second line at the dose
      of 37.5 mg per day, after one line of chemotherapy and to determine whether sunitinib
      deserves further studies in this indication.

      The secondary objectives are

        -  To evaluate the criteria of efficacy

        -  To evaluate the effects of sunitinib on tumor angiogenesis

        -  To characterize the safety profile of sunitinib

        -  To identify markers associated with response to sunitinib

    <description>Criteria of efficacy will be determined by:
The time to progression under treatment defined as time from first sunitinib dose to documented disease progression or death due to any cause.
The objective response rate (ORR) defined as the percentage of all patients who experienced a confirmed complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) based on RECIST criteria. The best overall response, defined as the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence, will be considered.</description>

    <description>The effects of sunitinib on tumor angiogenesis will be determined using the following imaging techniques:
Tumor density modification assessed on CT-scan
The functional response according to modifications of vascular permeability assessed by either dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging parameters and/or diffusion MRI.</description>

    <description>Safety will be determined in this patient population by the evaluation of adverse events assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.
In order to ensure complete safety data collection, all AEs occurring during the study, including any pre- and post-treatment periods required by the protocol must be recorded.
The period of observation for this study is from signature of informed consent or visit 1 to 1 month after last study drug administration.
Post-treatment follow up (including assessment/follow-up of adverse events) will be performed every 2 months</description>
