    <textblock>
      To understand if Mexiletine will restore normal colonic motility in a patient with a missense
      mutation in SCN5A, which encodes a voltage-sensitive sodium channel NaV1.5 as it is known to
      rescue certain expression defects of NaV1.5 in vitro.

    <description>Colon transit will be measured using validated scintigraphy methods conducted in our Clinical Research Unit (CRU).[17, 18] The participant will ingest a Tc-99m labeled sulfur colloid in egg to be used as a stomach marker and ln-111 chloride bound to activated charcoal enclosed in a methacrylate-coated capsule to measure colonic transit.</description>
