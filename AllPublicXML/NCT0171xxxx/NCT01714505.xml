    <textblock>
      An unblinded, randomized, cross-over design with each patient participating in two 40-hour
      outpatient admissions: (a) Experimental involving automated Control-to-Range (CTR) and (b)
      Control using Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM)- augmented insulin pump treatment outside of a
      hospital based clinical research center. The principal goal is to validate a smart
      phone-based control-to-range (CTR) system for ambulatory use and to estimate the effect of
      CTR vs. sensor-augmented pump therapy, thereby providing justification for further larger
      home-based trials of CTR.

      The overall objective of this project is to sequentially test, validate, obtain regulatory
      approval for, and deploy at home, a closed-loop Control-to-Range (CTR) system for optimal
      blood glucose (BG) regulation in people with type 1 diabetes. The CTR system is comprised of
      two algorithmic layers: a Safety Supervision Module (SSM) and Insulin on Board Tracking and
      Safety Module (ITSM), and an automated Range Correction Module (RCM). Both modules will
      receive continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin delivery data. The SSM and ITSM will
      monitor the safety of the subject's continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump (CSII) to
      prevent hypoglycemia. The RCM will be responsible for optimizing BG control and mitigating
      postprandial hyperglycemic excursions through series of insulin boluses. To run CTR, we will
      use our wearable artificial pancreas platform, known as DiAs (Diabetes Assistant), which
      consists of a smart phone running CTR and connected to standard insulin delivery and CGM
      devices.

    <description>The LBGI reflects the frequency and extent of hypoglycemic episodes and presents the results in &quot;risk space.&quot; Thus the LBGI is a weighted average of the number of hypoglycemic readings, with progressively increasing weights as BG levels go down. The increase of the weights follows a risk function; thus the LBGI has been associated with risk for hypoglycemia and prediction of severe hypoglycemic episodes.
LBGI &lt; 2.5 is associated with low risk of hypoglycemia, 2.5 &lt; LBGI &lt; 5 is associated with a moderate risk of hypoglycemia and LBGI &gt; 5 is associated with a high risk of hypoglycemia.</description>

Open-Loop: Insulin delivery will be controlled by the DiAs system running in open-loop mode. The subject will interact with the system through its GUI. Subjects will be permitted to administer correction boluses at any time during the Control Admission, whether or not they are eating a scheduled meal or snack.

        <title>Safety, Low Blood Glucose Index (LBGI)</title>
        <description>The LBGI reflects the frequency and extent of hypoglycemic episodes and presents the results in “risk space.” Thus the LBGI is a weighted average of the number of hypoglycemic readings, with progressively increasing weights as BG levels go down. The increase of the weights follows a risk function; thus the LBGI has been associated with risk for hypoglycemia and prediction of severe hypoglycemic episodes.
LBGI &lt; 2.5 is associated with low risk of hypoglycemia, 2.5 &lt; LBGI &lt; 5 is associated with a moderate risk of hypoglycemia and LBGI &gt; 5 is associated with a high risk of hypoglycemia.</description>
