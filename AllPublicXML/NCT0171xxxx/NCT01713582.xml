      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the recommended dose (RD) of OTX015/MK-8628
      for further phase II studies, in participants with acute leukemias (acute myeloid leukemia
      [AML; de novo and secondary to a myelodysplastic syndrome] or acute lymphoblastic leukemia
      [ALL]) or hematologic malignancies (diffuse large B cell lymphoma [DLBCL] or multiple myeloma

                  and dasatinib), or only 1 line including 1 TK inhibitor, if the
                  relapse/refractoriness is associated with the detection of a resistance mutation
                  to these inhibitors

               -  DLBCL participants: Failed 2 standard lines of therapy (≥1 containing an
                  anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody), or for whom such treatment is contra-indicated

               -  MM participants: Adequately exposed to at least one alkylating agent, one
                  corticosteroid, one immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) and bortezomib, or for whom such
                  treatments are contra-indicated.

          -  For participants with evaluable disease:

               -  Advanced leukemia participants must have &gt;5% bone marrow blasts at study entry,
                  without alternative causality (e.g. bone marrow regeneration)

               -  DLBCL participants must have ≥1 non-irradiated tumor mass ≥15 mm (long axis of
                  lymph node) or ≥10 mm (short axis of lymph node or extranodal lesions) on spiral
                  computed tomography (CT)-scan.

               -  MM participants must have ≥1 of the following: serum monoclonal component &gt;1 g/dL
                  (IgG), or &gt;0.5 g/dL (IgA), or Bence-Jones (BJ) proteinuria &gt;200 mg/24h, or
                  measurable plasmacytoma (not previously irradiated).

          -  Life expectancy ≥3 months.

          -  Off previous therapy ≥3 weeks prior to first study drug administration with full
             recovery from any previous toxicities, except 1) hydroxyurea single agent of in
             combination (e.g. + 6-Mercaptopurine [6MP]) to control hyperleukocytosis, which should
             be stopped for ≥48 hours, and 2) rituximab, which should be stopped for ≥3 weeks.

          -  Recovery from the non-hematologic toxic effects of prior treatment to grade ≤1,
             according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC)
             classification, except alopecia.
