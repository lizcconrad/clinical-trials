      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the efficacy of SPD489 compared with
      placebo in adults (18 55 years of age inclusive) with moderate to severe Binge Eating
      Disorder at Visit 8 (Weeks 11 and 12) as measured by the number of binge days (defined as
      days during which at least 1 binge episode occurs) per week as assessed by clinical interview
      based on subject diary

    <measure>Binge Eating Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Response is based on the reduction in the number of binge eating episodes. Responses were categorized as follows:
1-week Cessation = 100% reduction in binge episodes during the preceding 7 days
Marked Reduction = 99% to 75% reduction during the time since the previous visit
Moderate Reduction = 74% to 50% reduction during the time since the previous visit
Negative to Minimal Reduction = &lt;50% reduction during the time since the previous visit</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Eating Inventory Scores at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>There are 36 true/false items, 14 items on a 4-point Likert scale (1=eat rarely to 4=always), and 1 item on a 6-point Likert scale (1=eat whatever you want to 6=constantly limiting food intake). Cognitive Restraint score ranges from 0-21. Hunger score ranges from 0-14. Disinhibition score ranges from 0-16. Higher scores denote higher levels of restrained eating, disinhibited eating and predisposition to hunger.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Binge Eating Scale (BES) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The BES is a self-reported questionnaire containing 16 items designed to assess behavioral, affective, and attitudinal components of the subjective experience of binge eating. Each item is assessed based on 1 of 4 responses, with 1 denoting that a subject has greater control over eating behavior and 4 denoting that a subject had less control over eating behavior. A total score (sum of the 16 items) may range from 16-64. A lower score indicates greater control over eating behavior.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Frontal Systems Behavior (FrSBe) Total Score at Up to 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FrSBe is a 46-item self-rating scale designed to measure the neurobehavioral traits associated with the 3 primary regions of the prefrontal cortex. Subjects were asked to indicate the frequency with which they have engaged in certain behaviors using a rating scale from &quot;1&quot; (almost never) to &quot;5&quot; (almost always). Summary scores were calculated and converted to t-score. A decrease from baseline in FrSBe total score represents improvement.</description>

Cognitive Restraint score ranges from 0-21. Hunger score ranges from 0-14. Disinhibition score ranges from 0-16. Higher scores denote higher levels of restrained eating, disinhibited eating and predisposition to hunger.</description>

          <description>There are 36 true/false items, 14 items on a 4-point Likert scale (1=eat rarely to 4=always), and 1 item on a 6-point Likert scale (1=eat whatever you want to 6=constantly limiting food intake). Cognitive Restraint score ranges from 0-21. Hunger score ranges from 0-14. Disinhibition score ranges from 0-16. Higher scores denote higher levels of restrained eating, disinhibited eating and predisposition to hunger.</description>

        <description>The BES is a self-reported questionnaire containing 16 items designed to assess behavioral, affective, and attitudinal components of the subjective experience of binge eating. Each item is assessed based on 1 of 4 responses, with 1 denoting that a subject has greater control over eating behavior and 4 denoting that a subject had less control over eating behavior. A total score (sum of the 16 items) may range from 16-64. A lower score indicates greater control over eating behavior.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Frontal Systems Behavior (FrSBe) Total Score at Up to 12 Weeks</title>
        <description>The FrSBe is a 46-item self-rating scale designed to measure the neurobehavioral traits associated with the 3 primary regions of the prefrontal cortex. Subjects were asked to indicate the frequency with which they have engaged in certain behaviors using a rating scale from “1” (almost never) to “5” (almost always). Summary scores were calculated and converted to t-score. A decrease from baseline in FrSBe total score represents improvement.</description>

        <description>C-SSRS is a semi-structured interview that captures the occurence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period. The interview includes definitions and suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to determine if a suicide-related thought or behaviour occurred. The assessment is done by the nature of the responses, not by a numbered scale.</description>

        <population>Safety Analysis Set defined as all randomized subjects who took at least 1 dose of investigational product and who had at least 1 post-baseline safety assessment completed. All subjects from Site 015 were excluded from the Safety Analysis Set.</population>
