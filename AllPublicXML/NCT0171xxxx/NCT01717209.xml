  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research study evaluating the individual and combined effects of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO)
      and inhaled prostacyclin (iPGI2), on the function of the right heart after surgery for either
      heart transplant or for left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement. The investigators
      hope to learn if these two medications, when given together after surgery, improve right
      heart function by lowering blood vessel pressures in the lungs. The investigators hope to
      learn if the combined effects of these two medications are better than either medication used
      alone. Participants were selected as a possible participant in this study because right heart
      problems are common during and after surgery for heart transplant and for LVAD placement. In
      addition, iNO is always given during and after these two types of surgeries at Stanford to
      help improve how the right heart functions.

      The study will begin once the participant arrives in the cardiothoracic intensive care unit
      (CTICU) after heart surgery for either heart transplant or LVAD placement. As is standard of
      care after these types of surgeries, the participant will arrive in the CTICU with a
      breathing tube already in place, receiving iNO, and connected to a breathing machine. The
      participant will be receiving relaxing medication in an intravenous line provided by the
      cardiac anesthesiologist and the CTICU physicians. The participant will be unaware of the
      study period while the participant is sedated. Data will be collected from the monitor screen
      connected to the participant's arterial and venous lines, and if placed, LVAD monitor. These
      data are:

      Central venous pressure (CVP) Mean arterial pressure (MAP) Mean pulmonary artery pressure
      (MPAP) Cardiac Index (CI) Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) Pulmonary vascular resistance
      (PVR) Right ventricular stroke work index (RVSWI) LVAD Flow LVAD Pulsatility Index (PI)

      These data will be collected at five different time periods during the first eight hours
      after surgery.

        1. Time zero. Data will be collected after surgery upon your arrival to the CTICU while
           receiving iNO.

        2. After two hours of iNO treatment data will be collected. iPGI2 will then be combined
           with the current iNO.

        3. After two hours of combined iNO and iPGI2 treatment, data will be collected. iNO will
           then be stopped.

        4. After two hours of iPGI2 treatment data will be collected. iNO will be restarted.

        5. After two hours of combined iNO and iPGI2 treatment, data will be collected. The study
           ends after this data collection time.

    <description>Right Heart Dysfunction was measured as mean of Right Ventricular Stroke Work Index (RVSWI) for the initial 8 hours after admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
