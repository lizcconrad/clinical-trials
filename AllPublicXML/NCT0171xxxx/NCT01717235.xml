  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study subjects were screened and enrolled for the study. Subjects were housed in the clinical
      facility from not less than 12 hours pre-dose till at least 30 hours post-dose in each
      period. After maintaining at least 10 hours of overnight fast Test or Reference product was
      administered orally (as per the randomization schedule) to each subject with about 240 mL of
      water at ambient temperature in each period by trained study personnel.

      The pre-dose (0.00 hours) blood sample was collected before dosing and post-dose samples were
      collected at 2.00, 3.00, 4.00, 5.00, 5.50, 6.00, 6.50, 7.00, 7.50, 8.00, 8.50, 9.00, 9.50,
      10.00, 10.50, 11.00, 12.00, 14.00, 16.00, 20.00, 24.00 and 30.00 hours in each study period
      with a washout period of 7 days between the dosing of two periods. Subjects were continuously
      monitored for well being i.e., blood pressure, radial pulse and oral temperature before
      check-in, prior to drug administration and at regular intervals post dose in each period. The
      concentration of Ropinirole in plasma samples obtained from study subjects was determined
      using validated LC-MS/MS method. Pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses were performed on
      obtained drug concentration data, using appropriate software.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        i. Availability of volunteer for the entire study period and willingness to adhere to
