  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The provision of adolescent vaccination in a school setting will be feasible and acceptable
      to parents as evidenced by the number and percentage of students immunized within each school
      compared to those in schools without a program. The likelihood of vaccination for diphtheria,
      tetanus, and pertussis (Tdap), human papillomavirus (HPV), and meningococcal conjugate
      vaccine (MCV4) and all three combined) among eligible students enrolled in schools with a
      comprehensive school-based immunization program will be significantly higher than that of
      students enrolled in schools without a school-based immunization program.
