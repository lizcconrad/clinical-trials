      Urinary Neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) has been recently reported to be
      related with the degree of hydronephrosis in pediatric ureteropelvic junction obstruction
      (UPJO) patients. We are trying to analyze whether it is related with the grade of renal
      injury in UPJO patients.
