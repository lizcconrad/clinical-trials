  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of steady-state (constant concentration of
      medication in the blood) rilpivirine on pharmacokinetics (how a single dose of metformin is
      absorbed in the body, distributed within the body, and removed from the body) of a single
      dose of metformin, over time, in healthy adult participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) and
      sequential study (study medication is given in a sequence) in healthy participants, to
      investigate the pharmacokinetic interaction between steady-state rilpivirine and a single
      dose of metformin. The study consists of 3 phases including, the screening phase (28 days
      before enrollment), treatment phase (19 days), and the follow-up phase (7 days after the last
      intake of study medication). All participants will receive study medications in two sessions
      in a fixed, sequential order as a session 1 (a single dose of metformin on Day 1) followed by
      washout period (period when no treatment is received) of 4 days and then session 2
      (rilpivirine on Day 5 to Day 17 with a single dose of metformin on Day 15). The duration of
      the study is approximately 54 days. Safety evaluations including adverse events, clinical
      laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination (including skin
      examination) will be monitored throughout the study.
