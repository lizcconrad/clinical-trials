    <textblock>
      Based on the previous clinical experience in other cancers, and considering the absence of
      current standard salvage regimens, the single agent docetaxel is selected as the regimen for
      this phase II study. Main toxicity of docetaxel is myelosuppression. The low rate of severe
      myelosuppression observed in other cancer trials warrants further study in urothelial cancer.
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and activity of weekly docetaxel given
      as salvage therapy for advanced urothelial cancer.

      Study scheme

      Patients eligible for this study will be offered participation. Screening numbers are endowed
      to all subjects who sign the informed consent forms. These screening numbers are used as
      'Subject Identification Code&quot; along with subject initials. Subjects withdrawn from the study
      retain their screening number.

      Patients will have study drug discontinued at the time of progression and will then remain on
      study for a 4-week safety follow-up. Those without progression may continue to receive
      docetaxel as long as this is considered to be in their interest by their physician. After
      progression, patients will remain on study for the purpose of collecting follow-up and
      survival information.

      VII-3. Study treatment

      The study drug doses should be calculated taking the body surface area into consideration.
      Docetaxel 30 mg/m2 will be administered on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. Docetaxel will be
      diluted in 250 ml 0.9% saline or 5% dextrose to produce a final solution with concentration
      of 0.3-0.74 mg/ml. It will be administered as an infusion over 60 min on each infusion day.
      Patients will be premedicated with iv dexamethasone 15 mg, antihistamines and a prophylactic
      antiemetic treatment prior to docetaxel infusion in order to reduce the incidence and
      severity of fluid retention as well as the severity of hypersensitivity reactions. Patients
      experiencing adverse events attributed to irinotecan should have treatment delay as needed
      and/or may be interrupted or reduced depending on individual tolerability and according to
      the protocol.

      Treatment will be continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or consent
      withdrawal. After failure of study treatment, further treatment can be administered at the
      discretion of investigators.
