  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the U.S. The 2008 US Public
      Health Service Smoking Cessation Guideline recommends offering effective treatment to smokers
      in all health care settings, including hospitals. Nearly 4 million smokers are hospitalized
      each year, and hospital admission offers a &quot;teachable moment&quot; for intervention.
      Hospital-initiated smoking cessation intervention is effective, but only if contact continues
      for more than 1 month after discharge. The challenge is to translate this research into
      clinical practice by identifying an evidence-based cost-effective model that U.S. hospitals
      can adopt. The major barrier is sustaining contact after discharge. This project tests an
      innovative strategy to streamline the delivery and maximize the uptake of post-discharge
      smoking interventions.

      Specific Aim: To test the effectiveness of an innovative strategy to maximize smokers' use of
      evidence-based tobacco treatment (counseling and medication) after hospital discharge,
      thereby increasing the proportion of smokers who achieve long-term (6-month) tobacco
      abstinence.

      Study Design: A multi-site randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial will enroll
      1350 adult smokers admitted to 3 acute care hospitals in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. All
      subjects will receive a brief in-hospital smoking intervention and be randomly assigned at
      discharge to either Standard Care (passive referral to their state quitline) or Extended
      Care, a 3-month program consisting of (1) Free Medication: A 30-day supply of FDA-approved
      medication (nicotine replacement, bupropion, or varenicline) given at hospital discharge and
      refillable for a total of 90 days to encourage medication use and adherence; (2) Interactive
      Voice Response (IVR) Triage to Telephone Counseling from a national quitline provider. IVR
      aims to encourage medication adherence and enhance counseling efficiency by identifying
      smokers who need post-discharge support. Immediate transfer of a patient from automated IVR
      call to live telephone counselor will facilitate a successful connection to counseling.

      Outcomes, assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months after hospital discharge, are: (1) intervention
      effectiveness (cotinine-validated 7-day point-prevalence tobacco abstinence rate at 6 month
      follow-up [primary outcome] and other tobacco abstinence measures); (2) treatment
      utilization, and (3) cost-effectiveness (cost per quit). Exploratory analyses will examine
      the intervention's effect on hospital readmissions and mortality in the 6 months after
      discharge.
