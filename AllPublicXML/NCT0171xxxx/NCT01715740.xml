  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urticaria is a common dermatology disease. Urticaria affects nearly 25% of the population at
      some time in their lives. Recurrent skin itch, insomnia, daily activities limitation greatly
      affect the quality of life. Some patient with chronic urticaria who had poor response to
      antihistamine may need second line medication. In United States, up to 54% chronic urticarial
      patient use oral corticosteroid to control. However, long-term use of oral steroids still
      needs to consider the impact of its side effects. Therefore, patients may seek for
      alternative medicine as an adjuvant therapy.

      It is still lack large-scale clinical trials in Traditional Chinese Medicine research of
      chronic urticarial. The aim of this study is to conduct a double-blind, randomized clinical
      trial to analyze the effectiveness of Chinese medicine in chronic urticaria and its possible
      mechanisms.

      Traditional Chinese medicine has been used widely in Taiwan for several diseases, such as
      allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis. For urticaria,certain antipruritic Chinese herbal
      medicine, such and Xiao-feng-san (XFS), Qing-shang-fang-fen-tang (QSFFT), have been commonly
      used in clinical practice, yet no clinical trials have been done to prove the effectiveness.

      In this study, a double-blinded, randomized, placebo control trial is designed and total 100
      chronic urticaria patients will be enrolled. All subjects will be divided into Chinese herbal
      medicine (CHM) and placebo control groups, in 1:1 allocation ratio. CHM group will receive
      capsule of mixture of XFS and QSFFT, 4gm four times a day, total 16 gm in a single day; while
      control group will receive placebo capsule with similar look, smell, and taste with same
      scheme. Total 1 month treatment course with 1 month follow-up study course will be done.
      Changes in symptom severity is the primary outcome, while improvement in sleep disturbance,
      and serologic marker evolution are the secondary outcome.
