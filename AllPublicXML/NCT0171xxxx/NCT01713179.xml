    <textblock>
      Ambroxol is a metabolite of bromhexine and possesses mucokinetic and secretolytic properties
      that are also found in mucolytic agents.1 Ambroxol has been used for decades for the
      treatment of respiratory disorders associated with excessive mucus, including chronic
      inflammatory pulmonary conditions, bronchitis, and pneumonia.2,3 The drug changes the
      biophysical properties of secretions by degrading the mucin polymers, deoxyribonucleic acid,
      fibrin in airway secretions, and by generally decreasing viscosity.4 In addition, ambroxol
      increases cyclic nucleotide (cAMP or cGMP),5 which can theoretically increase tear
      secretion.6 Many systemic medications, such as antihistamines, antidepressants, diuretics,
      acne drugs, and certain blood pressure medicines can cause or exacerbate a dry eye.7,8 On the
      other hand, several topical medications, including mucolytics such as ambroxol and
      bromhexine, may be used to treat tear-deficient dry eyes by promoting lacrimal gland
      function.9 However, the effects of mucoactive agents on the tear film have not been
      investigated systemically, and mucoactive agents may have a disturbing effect on the tear
      film because they modify mucin.10,11 The tear film is composed of 3 unique layers, including
      the outermost lipid layer, the middle aqueous layer, and the innermost mucus layer; this
      structure enables it to perform many functions.12 The lipid layer acts as a barrier to
      prevent tear film evaporation, and the aqueous layer supplies oxygen and important nutrients
      to the cornea.13 The mucin layer, secreted mostly by conjunctival goblet cells, coats the
      corneal surface rendering it hydrophilic, and anchors the tear film to the corneal surface.14
      Deficiencies in the amount of tear production or alteration in tear composition can lead to
      ocular surface disease.15 Although many studies have focused on aqueous-deficient dry eye
      syndrome,16-18 the effect of mucin layer defects on the tear film has not been thoroughly
      studied. Furthermore, very few reports have determined the effects of oral mucolytic agents
      on the tear film and ocular surfaces, although a study has reported that filamentary
      keratopathy was treated with debridement of filaments and application of topical mucolytic
      agents such as acetylcysteine eyedrops. In the present study, we investigated the effects of
      oral ambroxol on tear film and ocular surface.

    <description>Corneal fluorescein staining was examined with a biomicroscope under blue-light illumination after fluorescein instillation into the tear film. The corneal surface was divided into 5 areas (1 center zone and 4 peripheral zones). Corneal erosion staining was recorded using a standardized grading system of 0 to 3 for each of the 5 areas.</description>

    <description>Fluorescein was placed in the lower conjunctival sac using a fluorescein strip (HAAG-STREIT, Köniz, Switzerland), and the time between the last blink and the first appearance of a dark spot was measured using the cobalt blue light of a slit lamp.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>After applying 1 drop of 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride to each eye, the inferior fornix was carefully dried with tissue paper. Fluorescein was then applied to the inferior fornix of each eye. The patient continued to sit in the examination room under ambient light and was asked to blink normally. After 10 minutes had elapsed, as determined by a timer, a Schirmer paper strip was inserted into the inferior fornix of each eye at a position approximately one-third lateral to the temporal caruncle. This maneuver was repeated for 3 times over a period of 30 minutes at 10-minute intervals.</description>

    <description>One drop of 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride (Alcaine, Alcon, Forth Worth, TX, USA) was instilled in the conjunctival sac for topical anesthesia. In a silent room, filter paper (Color Bar, EagleVision, Memphis, TN, USA) was placed in the inferolateral one-third of the lower lid. Care was taken to prevent the paper from contacting the cornea. After 5 minutes, the level of strip wetting (in millimeters) was measured.</description>
