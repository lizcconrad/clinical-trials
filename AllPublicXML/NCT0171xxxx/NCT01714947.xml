    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, open-label study in 4 to 6 evaluable patients with advanced solid tumors or
      lymphomas. This study is intended to provide a quantitative characterization of the mass
      balance, routes of metabolism, and excretion pathways of alisertib.

    <description>Part A: Patients will receive a single dose of 35-mg [14C]-alisertib oral solution containing 80 - 100 Î¼Ci of total radioactivity (1.19 - 1.48 mCi/mmol). The estimated duration is approximately 10 days during which time the patient will remain at the clinical facility. The maximum number of days that a patient may remain in confinement is expected to be between 11 to 17 days.
Part B: Eligible patients from Part A may continue into Part B which will begin immediately after or within 2 weeks of the patient completing Part A (ie, when the patient has met the criteria to be discharged from the clinic). Patients will receive alisertib tablets administered orally at a dose of 50 mg twice daily for 7 days in 21-day cycles.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          -  18 years or older

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic and/or advanced solid tumors or
             lymphomas for which standard curative or life-prolonging treatment does not exist, or
             is no longer effective or tolerable

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1

          -  Expected survival longer than 3 months from enrollment in the study

          -  Radiographically or clinically evaluable tumor

          -  Suitable venous access for the conduct of blood sampling

          -  Recovered from the reversible effects of prior antineoplastic treatment (with the
             exception of alopecia and Grade 1 neuropathy)

          -  Female patients who are postmenopausal for at least 1 year OR are surgically sterile
             OR if of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of
             contraception at the same time

          -  Male patients who agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire
             study and through 4 months after the last dose of study drug OR agree to abstain from
             heterosexual intercourse

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in the
        study:

          -  Female patients who are lactating or have a positive serum pregnancy test

          -  Treatment with any investigational products or systemic antineoplastic treatment
             within 21 days before the first dose of alisertib.

          -  Medical conditions requiring daily, chronic, or regular use of proton pump
             inhibitors(PPIs) within 7 days preceding the first dose of alisertib, or H2-receptor
             antagonists within 24 hours preceding the first dose of alisertib.

          -  Patient requiring systemic anticoagulation (excluding low-dose aspirin, or low-dose
             anticoagulation to maintain patency of venous access devices). Low molecular weight
             heparin, administered as preventive treatment, is allowed if the patient has tolerated
             treatment with a stable dose and schedule without bleeding complications for more than
             1 month

          -  Major surgery within the 14 days preceding the first dose of alisertib

          -  Infection requiring systemic intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy within 14 days
             preceding the first dose of study drug, or other severe infection

          -  Life-threatening or uncontrolled medical illness unrelated to cancer

          -  Ongoing nausea or vomiting that is Grade 2 or worse in intensity

          -  Diarrhea that is Grade 2 or worse in intensity or use of an antimotility agent to
             control diarrhea to an intensity of Grade 1 or lower level.

          -  Known GI disease or GI procedures that could interfere with the oral absorption,
             excretion, or tolerance of alisertib

          -  History of urinary and/or fecal incontinence

          -  History of uncontrolled sleep apnea syndrome and other conditions that could result in
             excessive daytime sleepiness such as severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

          -  Inability to swallow tablets, or inability or unwillingness to avoid taking anything
             by mouth except for water and prescribed medications for 2 hours before and 1 hour
             after the first dose of alisertib

          -  Inadequate bone marrow or other organ function as specified in study protocol

          -  Any cardiovascular condition specified in the study protocol

          -  Known or suspected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive or hepatitis B surface
             antigen-positive status, or known or suspected active hepatitis C infection

          -  Inability to comply with study visits and procedures including required inpatient
             confinement (approximately 11-17 days)

        Please note that there are additional exclusion criteria. The study center will determine
        if you meet all of the criteria.
