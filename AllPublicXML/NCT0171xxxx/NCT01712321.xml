  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a 12 week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which daily doses
      of vilazodone 20 to 40 mg/day or matching placebo will be administered on a 1:1 ratio. The
      study will include 30 outpatients age 18-75 with SAD, generalized subtype who return for at
      least one post randomization visit where efficacy evaluations are conducted.
