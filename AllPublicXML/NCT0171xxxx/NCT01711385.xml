  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an ongoing study new dental patients are screened to determine their risk of having
      undiagnosed pre-diabetes or diabetes based on risk factors readily known by the patient and
      signs of gum disease. Investigators further seek to assess if a post-identification
      intervention leads to a greater likelihood of study participants identified as potentially
      pre-diabetic or diabetic visiting their physician regarding their screening blood test
      results, and to improved health outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 3% to 4% of the U.S. adult population has undiagnosed diabetes and the
      prevalence is likely to be substantially higher among people with risk factors for diabetes.
      Of note, many patients at the time of diagnosis of diabetes already have diabetic
      complications. This indicates that there is a period of &quot;asymptomatic&quot; diabetes during which
      hyperglycemia and other risk factors are present and complications are developing. This
      substantial delay in clinical diagnosis of diabetes involves a period of about 10-12 years
      that elapses between onset of diabetes and its diagnosis. Early diagnosis of diabetes, with
      treatment aiming at strict control of blood glucose levels, is important in preventing or
      mitigating its clinical complications and improving health outcomes.

      Oral findings may offer an unrealized opportunity for the identification of affected
      individuals unaware of their condition. Previous research suggests that oral healthcare
      professionals have the opportunity to identify unrecognized diabetes and pre-diabetes in
      dental patients and refer them to a physician for further evaluation and care.

      Based on these findings, efforts to identify dental patients' risk of having undiagnosed
      pre-diabetes or diabetes, using a new diagnostic blood test as the outcome (HPLC HbA1c),
      continue. In addition, a subgroup of study subjects identified as potentially pre-diabetic or
      diabetic are randomly assigned to either a group 1/basic-standard intervention arm or to a
      group 2/enhanced intervention arm. The investigators seek to determine if a
      post-identification intervention leads to a greater likelihood of study participants
      identified as potentially pre-diabetic or diabetic visiting their physician regarding their
      blood test results and to improved health outcomes. Results of this pilot study have the
      potential to set in motion far ranging, changes in the practice of dentistry, leading to the
      advancement of a new paradigm in dental practice that calls for the adoption of a more
      holistic approach to patient care.

    <description>Study patients are notified of their blood test result within 72 hours. Those identified as potentially pre-diabetic or diabetic, and randomized to the enhanced intervention arm, receive a tailored message about their modifiable risks and are advised to see their physician regarding their test results or are provided with a referral to one. They are given a letter to take to their physician that specifies the risk factors identified, the tests carried out for the patient and the exact numeric results. They receive a call at month 2 to see if they have followed up with a physician regarding their test results. If they have not seen a physician regarding their results, they are advised again to do so and reminded of their individual risk factors. At month 4 they are asked again if they have seen a physician regarding their test results. If they still have not seen a physician at this time the message is reinforced. They are contacted again by phone to schedule the 6-month recall visit.</description>
