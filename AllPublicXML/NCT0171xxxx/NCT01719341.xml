    <textblock>
      Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative therapy
      for patients with both haematological and some non-haematological disorders. However, one of
      the major limiting factors for transplantation is the inability to identify a suitable
      HLA-matched donor. Development of an cost-effective and clinically efficacious alternative to
      HLA-identical sibling or unrelated donor transplantation would significantly expand the
      availability of allogeneic HSCT to patients in Singapore. Preliminary results indicate that
      the use of high dose post-transplant cyclophosphamide (Cy) for graft versus host disease
      (GVHD) prophylaxis in haplo-identical allogeneic HSCT is associated a low incidence of GVHD
      and low treatment related toxicity. We propose a phase II clinical trial to assess the
      efficacy of a haplo-identical allogeneic transplantation protocol using high dose
      post-transplant Cy for the treatment of patients with haematological disorders. A
      non-myeloablative protocol (Fludarabine-low dose cyclophosphamide-TBI) will be used for
      patients with bone marrow failure syndromes and indolent lymphoid disease. In view of the
      higher relapse risk of patients with myeloid malignancies, these patients will be treated
      with a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (Fludarabine-Busulphan). The primary end-point
      of the study will be overall survival at one year. Economic cost of the haplo-identical
      transplantation, as well as treatment timelines will be recorded and compared will other
      forms of unrelated donor allogeneic transplantation (umbilical cord blood transplantation and
      unrelated HLA-matched adult donor). Immunological reconstitution of patients following
      haplo-transplantation will be analysed and data will be utilized to guide future
      immunotherapy strategies post-transplantation.

      One year survival after non-myeloablative haploidentical stem cell transplantation is not
      inferior to that observed after non-myeloablative volunteer unrelated donor or unrelated cord
      blood haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

        Sample size estimation based on Case and Morgan Two Stage Phase II Design with an expected
        duration of accrual of 2 years, assuming a power of 80% and a level of significance of 10%.
        With an S0 of 0.25 and SA of 0.50, an interim analysis will be performed after 14 patients
        are recruited with an anticipated final recruitment total of 21 patients for each arm of
        the study.
