    <textblock>
      A double-blinded randomised control trial conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and
      Gynaecology of a tertiary hospital, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC) for
      two years duration from January 1st, 2012 till December 31st, 2013.

      The aim of the study is to compare the haemodynamic and cardiovascular effects between
      intravenous carbetocin 100 μg and intravenous oxytocin 5 IU in women undergoing elective
      Lower Segment Caesarean Section (EL LSCS).

      Study hypothesis: A single injection of carbetocin is haemodynamically and cardiovascularly
      safe and has similar efficacy in comparison to a single injection of oxytocin.

      OUTCOME MEASURES systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), Heart Rate
      (HR), saturation of oxygen (SpO2) in certain time after drug injection.

      The presence of myocardial ischemia symptoms and side effects of both drugs, ECG changes such
      as ST depression and changes in T-waves.

      Hemoglobin and troponin-T level

      The need for additional oxytocin infusion and estimated blood loss

      The time interval between initial drug administration, type of additional oxytocic
      intervention that used and complication that happened.
