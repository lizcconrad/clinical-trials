  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ano-rectal manometry is indicative in patients with either fecal incontinence or
      constipation. Recently anorectal 3D- high resolution manometry has been developed. Pressure
      variations are measured circumferentially along the anal canal. It may allow a better
      understanding of anorectal disorders by displaying anal pressure asymmetry and it could be
      useful to assess the functional anatomy of the pelvic floor better than conventional
      manometry.
