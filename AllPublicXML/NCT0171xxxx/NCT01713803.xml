  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study in opioid dependent subjects.
      Subjects meeting entry criteria will be treated with multiple doses of B-BNX or B-Placebo,
      with non-responders rescued within 6 hours. Open treatment B-BNX will be administered as
      follow-up therapy. Clinical efficacy assessments include the clinical opioid withdrawal scale
      (COWS), subject-rated assessments, and a urine drug screen.
