  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of access to nutrition services on
      pregnancy outcomes in the obese urban population. There are many studies that have shown that
      obesity has a negative impact on pregnancy. However, currently there are only a few small
      studies that specifically look at ease of access to nutrition services in an obese urban
      population and the effect this has on maternal weight gain and pregnancy outcomes. This study
      will compare two groups of pregnant women with a BMI of 30 or greater. The investigators
      hypothesize that access to nutritional services will lead to decreased weight gain during
      pregnancy and improved pregnancy outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of access to nutrition services on
      pregnancy outcomes in the obese urban population. Approximately one fourth of women in the
      United States are overweight and nearly one third are considered to be obese. Pregnancy
      places obese women at increased risk for several adverse events in the antepartum,
      intrapartum, and postpartum period. There are many studies that have shown that obesity in
      pregnancy has a negative impact on pregnancy. However, currently there are few studies in the
      United States that specifically look at ease of access to nutrition services in an obese
      urban population and the effect this has on pregnancy outcomes. This study will be a
      randomized controlled study that will compare two groups of pregnant women with a BMI of 30
      or greater one of which has access to nutritional services along with routine prenatal care
      while the other gets only routine prenatal care. The investigators hypothesize that the obese
      parturient who has access to nutritional services will have decreased weight gain during
      pregnancy and ultimately have improved pregnancy outcomes. This will help to guide future
      care for the obese parturient in the urban population who may have limited access to
      services.
