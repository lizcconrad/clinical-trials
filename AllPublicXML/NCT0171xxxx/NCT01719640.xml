  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cell injury in human islets induced by non-immune mediated inflammation occur in vitro upon
      hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Infusion of autologous bone marrow mononuclear
      cells (BMMNCs) is an emerging therapeutic approach for DM, which showed promising outcomes
      with mild side effects. Infusion of BMMNCs and autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
      in combination might exert enhanced repairing effects. We hypothesized that infusion of these
      two classes of cells might provide multiple signals for regeneration and improve recovery
      from inflammation-induced lesion. The effects might be maximized by intra-arterial pancreatic
      infusion.
