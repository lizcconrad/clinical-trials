  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plantar warts on the sole of the foot are among the most common warts seen in podiatry
      clinics. Some patients are readily cured by simple standard of care treatments that include
      wart debridement (trimming or excision) and application of 17% salicylate (commercially known
      as Compound W)or by other treatments that may be painful and affect mobility. No treatment is
      consistently effective and most patients fail treatment multiple times.

      Ethyl pyruvate (EP)is a common food additive noted to be 'generally regarded as safe' that
      may improve the activity of salicylate in wart treatment by improving the ability to
      penetrate and/or persist in the skin. The use of 17% salicylate with the addition of EP may
      improve cures of common foot plantar warts in subjects who also be receiving other
      standard-of-care treatment.
