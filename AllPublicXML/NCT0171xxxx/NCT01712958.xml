    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the fourth leading cause of
      cancer-related death in the world. Despite potentially curative surgery and the use of modern
      adjuvant chemotherapy, up to 40% of CRC patients subsequently develop local tumor relapse or
      metastatic disease. Currently, aside from post-operative pathological staging, early follow
      up of the patients does not include a specific test or any other evaluation that could
      predict disease recurrence. Therefore, exploring and identifying novel biomarkers of CRC's
      following diagnosis of the primary tumor may help us in identifying patients at high risk for
      recurrence.

      Modifications in signaling pathways and their regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) are being
      evaluated as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancer in general and CRC in particular.
      It has been established, although not completely, that miRNAs have a role in initiation and
      progression of CRC. Modifications of miRNAs have been recorded in CRC tumors, and the
      expression patterns of these miRNAs could in principle biomark this cancer's phenotype. As
      miRNAs are well documented to regulate critical molecules in signaling pathways, their
      regulation of tumor relevant pathways may also serve to further sub-classify patients into
      drug responsive groups. Moreover, miRNAs may be sampled from peripheral blood and are
      available as a non-invasive diagnostic method, their application as biomarkers is of special
      interest.

      In this study the investigators aim to quantify miRNA levels in human colon and rectal
      tumors, tumor adjacent and normal tissues. By comparing this data from a large cohort of
      patients, the investigators aim to identify specific, relevant miRNAs that may serve as
      biomarkers to stratify CRC patients according to their clinical characteristics such as
      disease stage, specific treatment, prognosis and disease recurrence.
