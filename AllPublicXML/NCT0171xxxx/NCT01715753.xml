    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to assess the effects of weight loss on functional status and
      lean muscle mass in frail, obese older adults (&gt;/= 60) who participate in a 6 month weight
      reduction intervention. Participants will be randomized into one of two study arms: Weight
      Loss Control: (n = 25) subjects follow a calorie-reduction diet for a weight loss of ≥10%; or
      Weight Loss-High Protein: (n = 50) subjects follow a calorie-reduction diet for a weight loss
      of ≥10%, with a high proportion of high quality protein at each meal. Intakes of &gt; 30g of
      high quality protein will be achieved three times a day by subjects in this group,
      predominantly all from animal sources and 60-70% of animal protein from beef. Subject
      criteria will include obese (&gt;30 kg/m2) older adults (&gt;60 yrs.) with mild to moderate
      functional impairment (by Short Physical Performance Battery; SPPB score &gt;/= 4)
