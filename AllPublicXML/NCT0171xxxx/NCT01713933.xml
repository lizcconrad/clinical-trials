    <textblock>
      This study is an evaluation of the Ulthera® System used to treat the upper arms for
      improvement of brachial ptosis. All enrolled subjects will receive one bilateral upper arm
      treatment. Follow-up visits will occur at 60, 90 and 180 days post-treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, clinical trial treating up to 35 subjects. Study
      photographs of the upper arms will be taken prior to treatment, immediately post-treatment,
      and at each follow-up visit. Brachial volume and dermal thickness measurements will be
      obtained.

          <title>Patient Satisfaction</title>
          <description>Patient satisfaction was determined by scores on a patient satisfaction questionnaire (PSQ) completed at 180 days post-treatment. Subjects indicated how satisfied they were with study treatment, i.e., Very Satisfied, Satisfied, Dissatisfied, Very Dissatisfied. Pre-treatment and Day 90 post-treatment photographs were available for viewing during the assessment.</description>
          <population>Thirty-one (31) subjects returned for the 180 day post-treatment visit. Two subjects were lost-to-follow-up. One subject was excluded from analyses as an outlier due to high BMI and substantial weight gain during the study period.</population>
