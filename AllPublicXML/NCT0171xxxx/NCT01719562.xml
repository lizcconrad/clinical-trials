  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) works in detecting heart damage
      in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI, may help
      doctors predict whether patients will have heart damage caused by chemotherapy in patients
      with cancer receiving chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To design an automated MRI hardware/software platform for measuring and reporting left
      ventricular (LV) function (volumes, strain, and ejection fraction [EF]), T1 myocardial
      signal, and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV).

      II. To determine if pre- to 3 month post-anthracycline-based chemotherapy (Anth-bC) changes
      in our MRI platform generated measures of LV volumes, EF, strain, myocardial T1, and aortic
      PWV predict pre- to 24 month post-Anth-bC differences in these same parameters.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo MRI scans for LV function, T1 myocardial signal, and aortic PWV at baseline,
      3 months, and 24 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To correlate results of an automated MRI hardware/software platform for measuring left ventricular (LV) function with manual results.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>For the automation to be considered useful it should correlate highly with the manual results, exhibit a similar mean value and overall variability. 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the difference between measures will be constructed and the upper and lower bounds of these intervals will be examined. The final diagnostic we will perform is to run F-tests to determine whether the variability from each measure is the same or different. 95% CIs will be examined for the ratio of the variance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To test the ability of the pre- to post-anthracycline-based chemotherapy (Anth-bC) changes in our MRI platform generated measures of LV function to predict pre- to 24 month post-Anth-bC differences in LV function.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient is individually categorized as either having a persistent CV worsening or not depending on whether they exhibit a 20% worsening of their outcome by 3 months and that level of worsening persists to 24 months. We will examine paired t-tests for each time point for each measure to test whether measures are significantly worse at each time point. We will fit longitudinal models that examine all three time points (baseline, 3 and 24 months) simultaneously to determine whether there is a linear (or some other) function that can describe the decline in these subclinical CV MRI measures.</description>
