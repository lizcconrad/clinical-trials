  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter observational study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of first-line
      bevacizumab (Avastin) in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy in participants
      with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Participants for whom the treating physician has
      decided to initiate first-line fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy in combination with
      bevacizumab will be observed for approximately 4 years.
