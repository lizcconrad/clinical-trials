  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent research in multiple sclerosis (MS) have suggested that altered coagulation and
      vascular inflammation may play a role in pathophysiology of MS. Sonoclot is viscoelastic
      method of analyzing clot formation. This instrument will be used to compare coagulation in
      individuals with MS to healthy controls. A 24-hour dietary recall and food frequency
      questionnaire will help determine whether coagulation is modified by fish consumption.

      This case-control study will recruit individuals with a diagnosis of MS and healthy controls.
      Individuals will be asked to come to Bastyr Clinical Research Center for a single study
      visit, at which time dietary intake, current medications and supplements, other medical
      diagnoses, and coagulation will be evaluated.

    <measure>Sonoclot Coagulation Spectrum (Sonoclot Signature)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Sonoclot Coagulation Spectrum represents a combination of coagulation parameters, including activated clotting time, clot rate, time to peak, and peak amplitude. The mean value of all contributing parameters will be compared between cases and controls.</description>

    <description>The ASA24, in combination with a medication history, will be used to evaluate whether omega-3 fatty acid intake is associated with reduced rates of coagulation in either cases or controls.</description>
