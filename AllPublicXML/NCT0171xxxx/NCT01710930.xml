  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine if a doubling of serum TARC (compared to
      baseline) is associated with the occurrence of exacerbations of ABPA.

      The secondary objectives of the study are :

        1. To investigate if induced sputum eosinophils count (compared to baseline) is associated
           with the occurrence of exacerbations.

        2. To examine if the exhaled NO (compared to a baseline) is associated with the occurrence
           of exacerbations.

        3. To investigate if activation of circulating T cells (compared to a baseline) is
           associated with the occurrence of exacerbations.

        4. To examine if the rate of specific Asp f IgG measured by ELISA (compared to a baseline)
           is associated with the occurrence of exacerbations.

        5. To determine if the variation of one of the markers above, TARC or Asp f specific IgE
           measured at baseline, may be associated with the radiological stage of the disease
           (ABPA-S, ABPA-CB, ABPA-ORF).

        6. To investigate if there is a link between fungal exposure at home (visually assessed by
           the contamination level and the proportion of positive samples for Asp. f) and the
           frequency of exacerbations.

        7. To establish if some of the clinical, functional or biological data studied are
           associated with the frequency of exacerbations.

    <description>Phase 1 : Inclusion of patients (V0) :
In the case of a participation agreement, data on age, profession, previous history, history of the disease and current treatments will be collected. Different tests will be performed at this visit.
Phase 2 : Determination of the baseline (V1) : Patients will be reviewed one month after V0 (V1). In the absence of exacerbation between V0 and V1, the examinations performed in routine practice will be used to determine the basic state of biological parameters of interest. During this visit, different tests will be performed.
Phase 3 : Quarterly monitoring of patients (V2-V9) : Patients will be followed every three months for 2 years (V2-V9).</description>
