  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes rely on either finger stick or sensor
      glucose readings when making their insulin dosage decisions. Designing a computerized system
      that mimics the way insulin is produced naturally in a person who does not have type 1
      diabetes holds many challenges; all of which cannot be addressed in just one study. The
      purpose of the Medtronic Overnight Closed Loop study is to assess the performance of a system
      designed to automatically infuse the correct insulin dose during the hours that the patient
      is sleeping.

      The system consists of an insulin pump that provides insulin to the patient through an
      infusion set. A sensor inserted just under the patient's skin measures glucose levels and a
      transmitter sends this information to the pump. To enable the sensor to register the glucose
      information correctly, it must be set (calibrated) by a finger stick blood glucose 3-4 times
      a day. In the commercially released system, the physician would recommend the continuous
      background (basal) insulin rates and the patient would be required to make decisions
      regarding extra insulin (bolus) for meals or as a response to high glucose levels.

      In the Closed Loop System, a mobile control system is added to these devices. This consists
      of an Android phone, a closed loop algorithm and a translator. This system is designed to
      translate the sensor information and direct the pump to provide the required dosage of
      insulin automatically without requiring input from the patient.

      Reliable calibration has proved challenging, and so it is important that the system function
      safely, even when calibration is inaccurate. In this study, a calibration error will be
      introduced under very controlled circumstances. This testing will identify if the system can
      maintain acceptable overnight glucose levels, regardless of whether or not calibration is
      ideal.

    <measure>Amount of time spent in the target range defined as 3.8-8.8 mmol/l (70 to 160 mg/dL) YSI glucose during in-clinic overnight visits</measure>
    <time_frame>Two in-patient nights</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will arrive at the research facility between 17:00 and 18:00. Plasma glucose will be measured and they will have their evening meal of no more than 80 g of carbohydrate. They will bolus for this meal using their usual Bolus Wizard (Medtronic) settings. After the meal, an IV catheter will be inserted for the collection of venous blood samples. The Mobile Control System will be connected and closed-loop control will be started approximately 4 hours after dinner. The subject will remain under closed-loop control overnight (approximately 11 p.m.-6 a.m.). During one of the Closed Loop nights the system will be challenged by a calibration error of 30%. At approximately 7 am (before breakfast), the Mobile Control System will be turned off and the patient will be provided with a breakfast (approximately 40-70 gm of carbohydrate) and will take a bolus according to the Bolus Wizard. The patient will return to their usual pump treatment with the MiniMed Paradigm Veo System.</description>
