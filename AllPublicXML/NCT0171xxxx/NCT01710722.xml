    <textblock>
      Three treatments are compared to see which causes the most weight loss, fat loss, loss of
      stomach fat and improvement in blood tests like cholesterol.

      1) Leptin A-200 injections daily with 2 inactive pills taken three times a day, 2) Caffeine
      with ephedrine pills taken 3 times a day with an inactive injection daily and 3) Both Leptin
      A-200 injections daily and caffeine with ephedrine pills taken three times a day.
