    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the use of metformin and sitagliptin used in
      conjunction with insulin can improve the blood sugars of teenagers with Type 1 diabetes.

      -  The study will include a total of 4 visits. The time period between the very first visit
           and the very last visit will be between 10 and 15 weeks. Each participant will be
           randomized to one of the 3 groups in the study. The groups are as follows:

        -  Group 1: Insulin and sitagliptin

        -  Group 2: Insulin and metformin

        -  Group 3: Insulin and combination of sitagliptin and metformin

        -  The study is a randomized open label design. All subjects will undergo a screening
           visit; if inclusion and exclusion criteria are fulfilled they will be enrolled in the
           study. At the time of enrollment the subject will continue their home insulin regimen
           and will be randomized to an add an oral hypoglycemic agent(s) : metformin, sitagliptin
           or combination therapy (metformin and sitagliptin). The total duration on study
           medication will be 6 weeks. All subjects will undergo a baseline mixed meal tolerance
           test (MMTT) in their standard or usual insulin Each subject will undergo a total of two
           studies. Blood draws will be necessary.
