        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged &gt; 18

          -  Histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, and
             uterine papillary serous carcinomas (UPSC), and gynecologic malignant mixed müllerian
             tumors (MMMTs).

          -  Must have had prior platinum or platinum based therapy.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status 0-1.

          -  Platinum resistant or refractory disease within 6 months of completing or while
             receiving a platinum and taxane containing regimen

          -  Measurable disease

          -  Adequate bone marrow and hematological function.

          -  Must have recovered from acute toxicity from prior treatment

          -  Prior treatment with an anti-angiogenic agent is not an exclusion criterion.

          -  No prior GI perforation, or GI obstruction or involvement of the bowel on imaging

          -  Known hypersensitivity to Cremophor EL. However, participants are eligible if they
             have had a prior paclitaxel reaction, but subsequently tolerated the drug at
             rechallenge.

          -  No patients receiving other investigational therapy for the past 30 days before
             dosing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  More than 3 prior lines of chemotherapy for recurrent cancer.

          -  History of other active malignancy, other than superficial basal cell and superficial
             squamous cell, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix within last 2 years.

          -  Life expectancy of less than 3 months

          -  CTC Grade 1 or greater neuropathy (motor or sensory) from comorbidity other than prior
             taxane exposure, such as diabetes.

          -  Inadequately controlled hypertension or prior history of hypertensive crisis or
             hypertensive encephalopathy.

          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure.

          -  History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to study Day
             1.

          -  History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to Day 1.

          -  Known CNS disease, except for treated brain metastasis

          -  Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, requiring surgical repair or
             recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) within 6 months prior to Day 1.

          -  History of hemoptysis (1/2 teaspoon of bright red blood per episode) within 1 month
             prior to Day 1.

          -  Evidence of bleeding diathesis or significant coagulopathy (in the absence of
             therapeutic anticoagulation).
