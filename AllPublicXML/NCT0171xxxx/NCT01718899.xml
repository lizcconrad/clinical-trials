    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of PVX-410, (a cancer
      vaccine), treatment regimen for patients with smoldering multiple myeloma as a single agent
      and in combination with lenalidomide.

      This is a dose escalation, phase 1/2a study to assess the safety and tolerability of PVX-410,
      (a multi-peptide cancer vaccine), treatment regimen in patients with smoldering multiple
      myeloma as a single agent and in combination with lenalidomide.. Approximately 22 patients
      will receive six (6) bi-weekly, subcutaneous injections of PVX-410 for a total of twelve (12)
      weeks of treatment. Safety will be monitored throughout the study. Tolerability,
      immunogenicity and clinical response will also be measured as described in the protocol.
