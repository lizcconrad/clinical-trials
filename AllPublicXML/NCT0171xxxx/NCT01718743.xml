  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of MLN9708 and
      Revlimid (also called lenalidomide or CC-5013) can help to control MM as maintenance
      treatment after an autologous stem cell transplant.

      Lenalidomide is designed to change the body's immune system. It may also interfere with the
      development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. This may decrease or
      prevent the growth of cancer cells.

      MLN9708 is designed to block a protein that plays a role in cell function and growth. This
      may cause cancer cells to die.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, after you have recovered from
      your transplant, you will be start receiving maintenance therapy to try to keep the disease
      from coming back after the transplant.

      You will take MLN9708 by mouth on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 day cycle. You should swallow
      the capsule whole, with water, and should not break, chew, or open the capsule. It should be
      taken on an empty stomach at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.

      If you miss a dose and the next scheduled dose is 72 hours or more away, you can take MLN9708
      to make up for the missed dose. A double dose should not be taken to make up for a missed
      dose. If you vomit after taking a dose, you should not repeat the dose but should resume
      dosing at the time of the next scheduled dose.

      You will also take lenalidomide by mouth. The number of capsules you take will depend on side
      effects you may have.

      If a dose of lenalidomide is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day.
      If it is missed for the entire day, it should not be made up. If you take too much
      lenalidomide you should seek emergency medical care and contact study staff right away.

      If the study doctor thinks it is needed, your dose of lenalidomide may increase after 3
      months.

      You will keep a diary to record the drugs you take. You will be asked to bring any unused
      drug and empty drug containers to the clinic at their next visit.

      Study Tests:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1 (+/- 7 days):

        -  You will complete a questionnaire that asks you about symptoms you may be having. This
           will take about 5-10 minutes to complete.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, height, and
           weight.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn and stored at a research blood bank at MD
           Anderson for future research related to cancer.

      On Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 (+/- 3 days):

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to be stored at a research
           blood bank for future research related to cancer.

        -  You will have a physical examination, including measurement of your height and weight.

        -  You will complete the questionnaire about side effects you may be having.

        -  Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood (about 1-2 teaspoons)
           pregnancy test 24 hours before beginning treatment.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-3 (+/- 7 days):

      Â°Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine (over 24 hours) will be collected to check the status of
      the disease.

      Dose Escalation:

      If the study doctor increases your dose of lenalidomide, the following tests and procedures
      will be performed on Days 8 and 15:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.

      During Maintenance Therapy, women who are able to have children will have urine or blood
      pregnancy tests (about 1-2 teaspoons) every 4 weeks if you have regular periods (or every 2
      weeks, if your periods are not regular). This blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) or urine pregnancy
      test will be repeated 4 weeks after your last dose of study drug.

      If at any time during the study the doctor thinks the disease has come back, you will have a
      bone marrow biopsy/aspirate.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-treatment
      visit.

      End of Treatment Visit:

      About 30 days after the last dose of study drugs:

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected (over 24 hours) for routine tests.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, height, and
           weight.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will have a bone survey to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to check the status of the disease.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests

        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1-2 teaspoons)
           pregnancy test.

      Banking:

      All blood and tissue left over from the procedures performed as part of this study will be
      collected and stored in a research bank at MD Anderson for use in future research related to
      cancer. In addition, some blood will be collected for banking.

      Before your samples can be used for research, the people doing the research must get specific
      approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of MD Anderson. The IRB is a committee
      made up of doctors, researchers, and members of the community. The IRB is responsible for
      protecting the participants involved in research studies and making sure all research is done
      in a safe and ethical manner. All research done at MD Anderson, including research involving
      your samples from this bank, must first be approved by the IRB.

      Your samples will be given a code number. No identifying information will be directly linked
      to your samples. Only the researcher in charge of the bank will have access to the code
      numbers and be able to link the samples to you. This is to allow medical data related to the
      samples to be updated as needed. Other researchers using your samples will not be able to
      link this data to you.

      This is an investigational study. Lenalidomide is FDA approved and commercially available for
      MM and myelodysplastic syndrome. Its use after an autologous stem cell transplant is
      investigational. MLN9708 is not FDA approved or commercially available.

      Up to 88 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
