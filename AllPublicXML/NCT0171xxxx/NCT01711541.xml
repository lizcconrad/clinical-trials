  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This partially randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of
      veliparib when given together with combination chemotherapy and to see how well they work in
      treating patients with stage IV head and neck cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more
      effective when given with or without veliparib in treating head and neck cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase II dose, dose limiting
      toxicity (DLT), and safety of ABT-888 (veliparib) with carboplatin and paclitaxel induction
      chemotherapy in locoregionally advanced head and neck (LAHNC) patients. (Phase I) II. Compare
      magnitude of tumor shrinkage (response) following 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy with and
      without ABT-888 in LAHNC. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare progression-free (PFS), disease-specific (DSS), and overall survival (OS) in
      subjects treated with or without ABT-888. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of veliparib followed by a phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7, paclitaxel
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes
      on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then continue on to concomitant chemoradiotherapy.

      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive veliparib, paclitaxel, and carboplatin as in Phase I. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Within 10 days from completion of course 2, patients begin concomitant
      chemoradiotherapy.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID on days 1-7. Patients also receive paclitaxel and
      carboplatin as in Phase I. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 10 days from completion of course 2,
      patients begin concomitant chemoradiotherapy.

      CONCOMITANT CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 regimens of concomitant
      chemoradiotherapy based on the guidelines of the institution where they are being treated.

      OPTION I (CONCOMITANT CHEMORADIATION WITH CISPLATIN): Patients receive cisplatin IV on days 1
      and 22 and undergo radiation therapy 5 days per week for 6 weeks. Treatment repeats every 2
      weeks for 5 courses.

      OPTION II (CONCOMITANT CHEMORADIATION WITH TFHX): Patients receive hydroxyurea PO every 12
      hours on days 1-5 for up to 11 doses, fluorouracil IV over 120 hours on days 1-5, paclitaxel
      IV on day 1, and undergo radiation therapy BID on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks
      for 5 courses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18,
      24, 30, 36, 48, and 60 months. Patients who progress will be followed up every 6 months
      through year 5.
