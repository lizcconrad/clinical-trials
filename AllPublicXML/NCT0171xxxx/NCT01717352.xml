    <textblock>
      The present study will test the effectiveness of two different approaches for preparing
      overweight/obese individuals for weight loss: 1)providing important information about weight
      control, including dispelling common myths; or 2) developing a consistent sleep and eating
      routine to prepare for the challenges of a weight control intervention.
