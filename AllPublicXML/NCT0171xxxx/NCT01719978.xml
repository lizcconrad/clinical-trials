  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among the adjuvants to local anaesthetics (LA), the enzyme hyaluronidase is most often used
      as a diffuser agent of the LA in ophthalmic anaesthesia. It serves to improve clinical
      efficacy and prolong anaesthesia as an alternative to long-lasting and potentially more
      dangerous LA, especially in patients with increased cardiovascular risk. There is scarce
      clinical data about the safety of the use of hyaluronidase in dental procedures.

      This study aimed to compare hemodynamic and electrocardiographic variables during a dental
      surgical procedure using a local anaesthetic associated with hyaluronidase or placebo in
      healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This double-blind crossover &quot;split-mouth&quot; trial evaluated the cardiovascular effects induced
      by 3.6 mL of the LA 2% HCl mepivacaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine, concomitantly with 75
      TRU/mL hyaluronidase or placebo in inferior alveolar nerve block, for the performance of
      bilateral and symmetrical third molar surgery in 20 outpatients. Cardiovascular parameters,
      including systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR),
      were monitored using oscillometric and photoplethysmographic methods in 10 clinical stages.
      Electrocardiographic records (ECG) of 12 leads were obtained in four steps. Hyaluronidase
      injected concomitantly with LA did not induce changes in SBP, DBP and HR compared to placebo.
      There were no instances of ST segment depression, ST segment elevation, wide QRS complex
      extrasystoles, or narrow QRS complex extrasystoles.

      To date, few studies in dentistry have investigated the effects of local anaesthetic efficacy
      in hyaluronidase, and even fewer have studied the relation to systemic effects induced by
      this interaction.

      The use of LA injected concomitantly with 75 TRU/mL of hyaluronidase is safe when using this
      dose and route of administration.

      Clinical Relevance: In dentistry, few studies have investigated the effects of hyaluronidase
      on local anaesthetic efficacy, and even fewer have examined the possible systemic effects
      induced by this interaction.
