      This study is to see whether the early intravenous administration of tranexamic acid improves
      the outcome of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

      Previous studies reported that IV/Oral administration of tranexamic acid improves the outcome
      upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, the drug is scarcely used nowadays as those studies
      are outdated in present clinical field where early endoscopic treatment and PPI
      administration are considered norm. Although a recent meta-analysis done by Cochrane review
      group concluded that it improves patient survival, other review articles including &quot;Gut&quot;
      suggested that a well-designed clinical study is needed for re-evaluation of the efficacy and
      safety of the drug in current clinical situation. We hypothesized that early administration
      of the drug will significantly decrease the proportion of patient requiring early endoscopic
      treatment.
