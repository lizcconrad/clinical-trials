  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This post-approval study will primarily evaluate the long-term safety of the MedStream
      Programmable Infusion System when used in combination with Baclofen for the treatment of
      severe spasticity. A secondary objective, to assess long-term effectiveness, based on the
      observed scores on the Ashworth Scale (rigidity for the lower extremities) and their Spasm
      Scores over the 36-month follow-up period will also be described.

        All subjects presenting for a de novo programmable pump implant or replacement of an
        implantable, programmable infusion pump for the treatment of severe spasticity with
        intrathecal Baclofen are potential study candidates and will be screened for study
        eligibility. Subjects who do not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will not be enrolled
        into this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is a viable candidate for &quot;de novo&quot; or continued (pump replacement)
             therapy for the treatment of severe spasticity with intrathecal Baclofen delivered by
             an implantable programmable pump.

          -  The subject or his/her Legally Authorized Representative must voluntarily provide
             Informed Consent for participation in this study in accordance with 21 Code of Federal
             Regulations (CFR) Part 50.

             requirements for a period of 36 months after implant.

          -  The subject has an anticipated life expectancy of 24 months or greater.

          -  The subject must be 18 years of age or older at time of MedStream implant procedure.

             the materials in the infusion pump or catheter(s).

          -  The subject has a co-morbid condition that could limit his/her ability to participate
             in the study or to comply with the follow-up requirements or, which might impact the
             scientific integrity of the study.

          -  The subject has a rapid degenerative neurological disease such as lateral sclerosis,
             amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), rapidly progressive Multiple Sclerosis, inherited
             or rapidly progressive leukodystrophies, Moyamoya disease, cerebral autosomal dominant
             arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL),
             thrombophilias, rapidly progressive autoimmune disorders, or any disorder where
             progression of the underlying spinal cord or a central nervous system (CNS) disease is
             expected to progress significantly over the next 3 years
