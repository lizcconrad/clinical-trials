  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incontinence is one of the most common complications of radical prostatectomy. The continence
      rate is not significantly improved even by robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP).
      However, some reports suggested that posterior reconstruction (PR) behind vesicourethral
      anastomosis could improve early recovery of continence during open, laparoscopic or
      robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.

      But, recent prospective studies reported no benefit of PR after RALP, which was the opposite
      result of those of previous studies. However the PR techniques used in these prospective
      studies seem to be quite different from the previous techniques. They seem to have used
      single-step PR, which opposes the median dorsal fibrous raphe (MDFR) only to the
      Denonvilliers' fascia (DF). By contrast, the original technique incorporated additional
      reconstruction between the MDFR and the posterior bladder wall 1-2 cm from the new bladder
      neck.

      Our group identified this anatomic structure as the posterior counterpart of the detrusor
      apron (PDA). The PDA is a strong, thick functional tissue containing muscle that is more
      appropriate for pulling and fixing the MDFR than the DF. As such, we hypothesized that the
      key proximal structure for PR is not DF, but rather PDA. Furthermore, single-step
      reconstruction between MDFR and PDA could be enough for PR. We previously investigated
      whether our new PR technique, which entails opposition of the MDFR solely to the PDA, would
      improve continence recovery compared with the standard RALP technique without PR. And our
      retrospective study demonstrated that this new PR technique during RALP significantly
      shortens the time to the recovery of continence compared with the standard technique, which
      does not incorporate PR (Int J Urol, 2012;19:683-7).

      Thus, we plan to validate this result by a well-designed, prospective, randomized controlled
      study.
