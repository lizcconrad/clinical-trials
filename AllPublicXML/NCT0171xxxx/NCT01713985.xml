  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups.
      Group A will receive Ultherapy™ on the right side of the face and neck and Thermage on the
      left side. Group B will receive Thermage on the right side of the face and neck and
      Ultherapy™ on the left side. Follow-up visits will occur at 90 and 180 days post-treatment.
      Study images will be obtained pre-treatment, immediately post-treatment, and at each
      follow-up visit.

      This is a prospective, single-center, double-blinded, split-face, randomized pilot study. A
      triple Ultherapy® treatment and standard Thermage treatment will be provided to all subjects
      to the full half face, neck, and submental areas. Changes in face and neck skin laxity and
      wrinkles, from baseline and between study treatments, will be assessed at study follow-up
      visits. Patient satisfaction questionnaires will also be obtained.
