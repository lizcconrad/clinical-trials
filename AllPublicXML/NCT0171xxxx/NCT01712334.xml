  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IV, multicenter, randomized, open-label, two-period crossover study will evaluate
      the comparable efficacy and safety of Pulmozyme (dornase alfa) delivered by the eRapid
      nebulizer system in patients with cystic fibrosis. Patients who have been receiving Pulmozyme
      once daily chronically for at least 6 months will continue to receive Pulmozyme once daily
      for a run-in period of 2 weeks using the Pari LC Plus nebulizer. Patients will then be
      randomized to receive in a crossover design Pulmozyme once daily for two treatment periods of
      2 weeks each using either the Pari LC Plus or the eRapid nebulizer. Anticipated time on study
      treatment is 6 weeks.

    <measure>Stability of Lung Function: Percent Predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of each 2-week treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was performed according to American Thoracic Society standards. FEV1 is the amount of air that is forced out of the lungs in one second and was measured at the end of each 2-week treatment period. The percent predicted FEV1 was calculated as: Percent predicted FEV1 =FEV1 (L) / Predicted FEV1 (L) ×100.</description>

    <description>An adverse event was considered any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Preexisting conditions that worsened during the study and laboratory or clinical tests that resulted in a change in treatment or discontinuation from study drug were reported as adverse events.</description>

        <title>Stability of Lung Function: Percent Predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)</title>
        <description>Spirometry was performed according to American Thoracic Society standards. FEV1 is the amount of air that is forced out of the lungs in one second and was measured at the end of each 2-week treatment period. The percent predicted FEV1 was calculated as: Percent predicted FEV1 =FEV1 (L) / Predicted FEV1 (L) ×100.</description>
