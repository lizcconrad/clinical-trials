      The project aims to introduce into clinical practice for Caesarean section conducted under
      general anesthesia with the rapid induction myorelaxation with rocuronium and the reversal of
      neuromuscular blockade by using sugammadex. The aim is to demonstrate at least the same
      efficiency and confirm the safety of the procedure for both mother and newborn compared with
      older procedure.

      Project &quot;Modern myorelaxation procedure and reversal of neuromuscular blockade during general
      anesthesia for caesarean section&quot; aims to introduce in other indications for rapid induction
      of general anesthesia common and safe, alternative method of combining short-acting
      intravenous anesthetics propofol and fast-onset non-depolarizing muscle relaxant rocuronium
      into the clinical practice and demonstrate the efficacy and safety in this indication. At the
      same time to demonstrate the benefits of using modern reversal of neuromuscular blockade by
      sugammadex in termination the caesarean section under general anesthesia. Both procedures
      will be monitored by clinical observation, monitoring instrumentation and laboratory
      examination of mother and fetus (newborn) in various stages of peripartal period. The main
      benefit of this procedure will be in particular risk groups of mothers which are indicated by
      Caesarean Section while neuraxial blockade is contraindicated.

    <description>Quality: Rapid induction to general anesthesia with administration propofol and rocuronium for termination the pregnancy by Caesarean section are at least as good as the combination of propofol and succinylcholine iodide.Recording and evaluated will be the time from the beginning as the first drug in the rapid induction to general anesthesia will be administered until the discovery of the first wave of etCO2 after successful intubation (seconds), evaluation of intubation conditions (resistance to laryngoscopy, position of the vocal cords, response to the intubation attempt (limbs movement or cough) scored 1-3 according to level terms, conditions, entry scores for direct visualization of the vocal cords by Cormack-Lehane (I-IV)</description>

    <description>Economics: After reversal of neuromuscular blockade using sugammadex are procedure time and turnovers shorter than the use of neostigmine in the recommended dosage for patients undergoing termination of pregnancy by Caesarean section. Recording and evaluated will be the total procedure time until the recovery from neuromuscular blockade to the level of TOF ratio of 0.9, the administration of the recovery dose will in group ROCSUG in the case for posttetanic count mode in the level of PTC1, 2 at a dose of sugammadex 4mg/kg , the TOF count 1.2 sugammadex at a dose of 2 mg / kg, in the case of failure to achieve these values the anesthesiologist wil wait with the administration of the recovery dose for their achievement. In group SUCNEO for achieving TOF count 1.2 and higher, the dose of atropine to 0.01 mg / kg and neostigmine 0.03 mg / kg will be administered.</description>

    <description>Rocuronium, sugammadex doesnÂ´t lead to the deterioration of perinatal parameters and leads to fewer complications during anesthesia and postoperative period against a combination of succinylcholine iodide, rocuronium and neostigmine.Demographic characteristics (age,weight,BMI,gain in pregnancy,previous pregnancy, complications during pregnancy,medication during pregnancy), multiple gestation,parity,fetal position,the reason for the indication of caesarean section, the reason for general anesthesia caesarean section,week of termination of pregnancy,fetal weight,umbilical cord blood pH, pCO2,pO2,BE,Apgar,sex of the fetus,STAN or CTG assessment,the nature of amniotic fluid,time to cutting the umbilical cord will be monitored. Anesthesia complications (present or absent),the evaluation questionnaire of subjective feelings of the patient 1 day after caesarean section - sore throat,vigilance during anesthesia,myalgia,diplopia,weakness,inability to cough,shortness of breath will be recorded</description>
