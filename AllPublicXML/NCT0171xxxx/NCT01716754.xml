  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assessed the effect on asthma control of different dose levels and regimens of
      QGE031 in asthma patients that are inadequately controlled with inhaled steroid and beta-2
      agonist medication. Safety was assessed also. Comparison was to placebo and omalizumab.
      Information from this study was planned to support the design of future studies.

    <measure>Percentage of QGE031 Participants With Clinically Important Improvement of &lt;= -0.5 in the Asthma Control Questionnaire 7 (ACQ-7) Score Compared to Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ-7 measures asthma symptom control and consisted of 7 items: 5 on symptom assessment, 1 on rescue bronchodilator use and 1 on airway caliber (FEV1 % predicted). All 7 questions of the ACQ were equally weighted. Items 1-6 scored along a 7-point response scale, where 0 = good controlled and 6 = poor controlled. The 7th item on % predicted FEV1 (pre-bronchodilator) was scored by clinic staff on a 7-point scale (0 - &gt; 95%; 1 - 90-95%; 2 - 80-89%; 3 - 70-79%; 4 - 60-69%; 5 - 50-59%; 6 - &lt; 50%). The average score of the 7 questions was calculated as the sum of scores divided by the number of questions that were answered by the participants, as long as there were at least 6 questions answered and the missing items were neither question 1 nor question 7.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in ACQ-7 Score</measure>

The average score of the 7 questions was calculated as the sum of scores divided by the number of questions that were answered by the participants, as long as there were at least 6 questions answered and the missing items were neither question 1 nor question 7. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Change From Baseline in ACQ-7 Score Less Than -1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16, Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The AQLQ is a 32-item disease specific questionnaire designed to measure functional impairments that are most important to participants with asthma. The 32 items in the AQLQ were divided into four domain-specific scores and a total score as follows: Activity limitations = Mean of Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 19, 25, 28, 31, 32 (11 items); Symptoms = Mean of Items 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 29, 30 (12 items); Emotional function = Mean of Items 7, 13, 15, 21, 27 (5 items); Environmental stimuli = Mean of Items 9, 17, 23, 26 (4 items); and Overall Score = Mean of Items 1 to 32 (32 items). Each item of the AQLQ was equally weighted and scored along a 7-point scale, where 1 indicates maximal impairment and 7 indicates no impairment. Thus, higher scores indicate better asthma-related quality of life. The mean overall score ranged from 1 to 7. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

      <recruitment_details>A total of 471 participants were randomized to one of the 14 treatment groups. Of these, 5 participants did not receive study treatment. Therefore, the full analysis set (FAS) and safety set included 466 participants.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The treatment arms for QGE031 and placebo were pooled into high dose QGE031 (240 mg q2w, 240 mg q4w, 180 mg q2w and 120 q2w), low dose QGE031 (36 mg q2w and 18 mg 2qw) and Placebo Total (all QGE031 placebo and Omalizumab placebo arms).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of QGE031 Participants With Clinically Important Improvement of &lt;= -0.5 in the Asthma Control Questionnaire 7 (ACQ-7) Score Compared to Placebo</title>
        <description>The ACQ-7 measures asthma symptom control and consisted of 7 items: 5 on symptom assessment, 1 on rescue bronchodilator use and 1 on airway caliber (FEV1 % predicted). All 7 questions of the ACQ were equally weighted. Items 1-6 scored along a 7-point response scale, where 0 = good controlled and 6 = poor controlled. The 7th item on % predicted FEV1 (pre-bronchodilator) was scored by clinic staff on a 7-point scale (0 – &gt; 95%; 1 – 90-95%; 2 – 80-89%; 3 – 70-79%; 4 – 60-69%; 5 – 50-59%; 6 – &lt; 50%). The average score of the 7 questions was calculated as the sum of scores divided by the number of questions that were answered by the participants, as long as there were at least 6 questions answered and the missing items were neither question 1 nor question 7.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ACQ-7 Score</title>
        <description>The ACQ-7 measures asthma symptom control and consisted of 7 items: 5 on symptom assessment, 1 on rescue bronchodilator use and 1 on airway caliber (FEV1 % predicted). All 7 questions of the ACQ were equally weighted. Items 1-6 scored along a 7-point response scale, where 0 = good controlled and 6 = poor controlled. The 7th item on % predicted FEV1 (pre-bronchodilator) was scored by clinic staff on a 7-point scale (0 – &gt; 95%; 1 – 90-95%; 2 – 80-89%; 3 – 70-79%; 4 – 60-69%; 5 – 50-59%; 6 – &lt; 50%). The average score of the 7 questions was calculated as the sum of scores divided by the number of questions that were answered by the participants, as long as there were at least 6 questions answered and the missing items were neither question 1 nor question 7. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) Score</title>
        <description>The AQLQ is a 32-item disease specific questionnaire designed to measure functional impairments that are most important to participants with asthma. The 32 items in the AQLQ were divided into four domain-specific scores and a total score as follows: Activity limitations = Mean of Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 19, 25, 28, 31, 32 (11 items); Symptoms = Mean of Items 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 29, 30 (12 items); Emotional function = Mean of Items 7, 13, 15, 21, 27 (5 items); Environmental stimuli = Mean of Items 9, 17, 23, 26 (4 items); and Overall Score = Mean of Items 1 to 32 (32 items). Each item of the AQLQ was equally weighted and scored along a 7-point scale, where 1 indicates maximal impairment and 7 indicates no impairment. Thus, higher scores indicate better asthma-related quality of life. The mean overall score ranged from 1 to 7. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
