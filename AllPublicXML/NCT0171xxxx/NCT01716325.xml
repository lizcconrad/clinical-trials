      The purpose of the study is to establish and clinically evaluate a new approach to treating
      obesity by using information and communication technologies (ICT). A mobile environment and
      organizational interventions to improve the process of an integrated treatment of people with
      obesity will be identified, developed, introduced and clinically evaluated.

      A mobile environment to improve the process of an integrated treatment of obese people will
      be identified, developed, introduced and clinically evaluated. The study will include 150
      patients aged between 25 to 65 for men and 25 to 70 for women, diagnosed with obesity (BMI≥30
      or BMI&gt;27,5 and 20% risk or more for developing a cardiovascular diseases). One group of
      patients will visit conventional live workshops for weight loss and the other group will use
      ICT. At the initial examination by the doctor all survey participants will have measured
      blood pressure, body mass, waist circumference, percentage of body fat, percentage of
      skeletal muscle, resting metabolic rate, estimated risk of developing cardiovascular disease
      and will be directed to laboratory examination (blood lipids and cholesterol, blood sugar).
      Both groups will go through 16 workshops for weight loss. Each week they will monitor their
      body mass, waist circumference, physical activity (type, duration, intensity) and food intake
      (type, quantity). After six months all survey participants will be examined again. We will
      compare effectiveness of ICT weight loss group with conventional weight loss group.
