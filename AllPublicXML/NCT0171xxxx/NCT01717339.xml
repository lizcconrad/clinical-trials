  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with endothelial dysfunction and the development
      of cardiovascular disease. It is unclear how OSA results in endothelial dysfunction, but
      given the association between OSA and obesity, adipose-derived hormones (adipokines) are
      likely to be involved. Leptin, an adipokine upregulated in patients with OSA, has been shown
      to be associated with deleterious effects on vascular function resulting in impaired
      endothelial function. This proposal is directed at investigating the molecular mechanisms of
      endothelial dysfunction in OSA patients. We hypothesize that endothelial dysfunction
      associated with OSA is a result of molecular alterations within endothelial cells. As a part
      of these studies we will look at NO signaling pathways in adipose tissue and microvessels
      from normal and OSA subjects.

    <measure>Change in Brachial artery diameter in response to hyperemia.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 15 min after hyperemia</time_frame>
    <description>Endothelial function test - Arterial endothelial function will be assessed non-invasively by ultrasound examination of the arterial endothelium dependent vasodilation response to reactive hyperemia. The right brachial artery, proximal to the antecubital fossa, will be imaged longitudinally using a linear-array transducer. Flow-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilation will be assessed by measuring the brachial artery diameter at baseline and during reactive hyperemia. Reactive hyperemia will be induced by deflating a cuff previously inflated to 200 mmHg for 5 minutes in the forearm. Variables will be measured for three consecutive cardiac cycles and the average will be taken.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non OSA, and newly diagnosed OSA subjects, na√Øve to CPAP treatment, aged 18-65 years,
             with BMI less than or equal to 55 kg/m2, who are free of all chronic diseases
             including diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, will be recruited for our study.
             Subjects with dyslipidemia and hypertension will be allowed to participate in the
             study. Subjects taking anti-depressents, and anithypertensives will be allowed to
             participate in the study. Also, subjects taking beta blockers and beta agonists will
             be allowed to participate in the study.

        If a subject is on aspirin or any other anti-inflammatory medication but free of known
        vascular disease and depending on the indication, the study doctor may ask the subject to
        suspend aspirin or anti-inflammatory therapy for 7 days prior to participation in the
        study. In the event that the subjects does not stop the aspirin or other anti-inflammatory
        medication, they will not be able to participate in the study because of the risk of
        bleeding during the fat biopsy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Body weight &gt;450 pounds (204.5kg)

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Anemic (hemoglobin &lt;13.5 g/dL for men and &lt;12.0 g/dL for women.

          -  Postmenopausal

          -  Smoking

          -  Use of chronic Medications (aspirin, statins, anti-inflammatory drugs)
