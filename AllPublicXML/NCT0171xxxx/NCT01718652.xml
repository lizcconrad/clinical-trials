  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how a single dose of cyclosporin affects the
      pharmacokinetics (ie, how the body affects the drug) of multiple doses of canagliflozin
      (JNJ-28431754). The safety and tolerability of canagliflozin will also be assessed in healthy
      volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open label (all volunteers and study staff know the identity of
      assigned treatments), single-center, multiple-dose study to determine how cyclosporin (a drug
      which reduces the activity of a patient's immune system) affects the pharmacokinetics of
      canagliflozin (a drug currently being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes
      mellitus). The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, an open-label treatment
      phase, and an end-of study (or follow-up) phase. Each volunteer will participate in the study
      for approximately 47 days.

    <description>Comparison of the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) (measures of the body's exposure to canagliflozin) before and after administration of a single dose of cyclosporine. This will be used to determine whether there is a pharmacokinetic interaction between cyclosporine and canagliflozin.</description>
