  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia frequently develop
      challenging neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) as a result of their illness. Non-pharmacological
      strategies to manage these symptoms such as music, exercise, and participating in pleasant
      social events have been demonstrated to be safe and effective strategies to reduce these
      behavioral symptoms. Our project, Volunteers Adding Life in Dementia (VALID), will design and
      implement a volunteer-led program to reduce behavioral symptoms and improve the quality of
      life of older adults with dementia who are residing in long-term care facilities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related forms of dementia is
      increasing in Canada and the majority of individuals with dementia develop neuropsychiatric
      symptoms (NPS) such as agitation, psychosis, depression and anxiety at some time during their
      illness. NPS are particularly problematic in long-term care (LTC) where approximately 60% of
      individuals have dementia, and 80% of individuals with dementia have NPS at any time. Adverse
      outcomes associated with NPS include increased use of psychotropic medications, stress for
      families and nursing staff, increased costs of care, and decreased quality of life. A novel
      approach to implementing non-pharmacological interventions for LTC residents with NPS is the
      use of volunteers. Volunteer-led programs have been demonstrated to be an effective,
      inexpensive, and sustainable method of implementing psychosocial interventions for older
      adults in acute care. The objectives of our project are to: 1.) Recruit and train
      approximately 40 volunteers in the VALID program; 2.) Conduct a cluster-randomized controlled
      trial of the VALID program in 6 LTC facilities (3 intervention and 3 control LTC sites; 60
      individuals with dementia in each of the experimental and control arms) to determine the
      effect of the VALID program on symptoms of NPS, patient quality of life, volunteer's
      experience, and LTC staff stress, 3.) Determine key components of the VALID program that
      served as facilitators and barriers to implementation.
