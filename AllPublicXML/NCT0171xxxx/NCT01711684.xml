  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melanoma is a life-threatening cancer which poses a significant health burden, especially
      when metastatic or spreading to areas other than the original tumor growth. Although various
      treatment options are currently available for melanoma, melanomas that have metastasized
      widely to the skin pose a significant clinical challenge as the available therapies have
      limited effect. This study proposes the use of a topically applied compound named
      diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP) which has been shown to be effective in treating melanoma
      patients whose diseases have spread widely throughout the skin. DPCP works by having a
      patient's own immune system, which is usually used to fight infections, attack cancerous
      cells. This compound has commonly been used to treat other conditions such as warts and hair
      loss throughout the world for many years and is known to cause limited side effects. Altering
      a patient's own immune system through topical treatments has also been shown to benefit
      patients with other cancers that have metastasized to skin such as breast cancer. In this
      study, the investigators will use DPCP to treat cutaneous metastases of various cancers
      including melanoma. Our overall intention is to get a better understanding of effective
      immune responses in the skin that may mediate metastatic cancer regression or cure.

      This is an open label study to determine the efficacy and mechanism(s) of the proprietary
      DPCP gel composition as a topical immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of cutaneous
      metastases. This study is investigator initiated, carried out only at Rockefeller University
      and the Sponsor holds the IND and is providing the test agent. The products to be evaluated
      are 0.4% DPCP, in a non-volatile gel vehicle, and 0.04% DPCP in the same gel vehicle applied
      to the target lesions biweekly for 14 weeks. It is our goal to apply the study drug to all
      cutaneous metastatic lesions, but at the Investigator's discretion, certain lesions will be
      avoided if they are in particularly difficult locations such as around the eyes or on the
      lips. The estimated duration of the study is 142 days with 112 days of treatment followed by
      subject examination on Day 142. If DPCP is shown to cause resolution of lesions by this
      visit, there will be the possibility of continuing DPCP use as long as study medication
      continues to be provided to The Rockefeller University.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  male or female at least 18 years of age, up to 99 years of age

          -  able to give verbal and written informed consent

          -  clinically diagnosed cancer with multiple cutaneous metastases that are able to be
             biopsied. The subject may or may not be on concomitant cancer treatments/have internal
             metastases.

          -  for women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) or in men whose partners may become
             pregnant, willingness to use an acceptable method of contraception to prevent
             pregnancy for the duration of the study (while receiving study medication and for one
             month following the last dose of study medication). Acceptable forms of contraception
             are listed in the informed consent form.

          -  must have a negative urine pregnancy test (for WOCBP)

          -  must be willing and able to have the therapy applied by the investigator, must be
