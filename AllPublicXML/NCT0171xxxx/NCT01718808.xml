      OBJECTIVE: The objective of the trial is to judge on the benefit obtained by an upfront
      cetuximab treatment delivered as monotherapy or as part of a combination treatment with
      capecitabine in vulnerable elderly patients selected for V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral
      oncogene homolog (KRAS) wild-type and B-type Raf kinase (BRAF) wild-type metastatic
      colorectal cancer (mCRC).

      Primary endpoint: If in a treatment arm the number of patients alive and without progression
      at 12 weeks is 17 or more, this arm will be considered promising, otherwise not promising.
      Additionally, a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in Progression free
      survival (PFS) rates between the two arms will be calculated.

      Secondary endpoints and patient characteristics:

        -  Laboratory values may be expressed as the absolute values (continuous variables) or/and
           as grading (ordinal categorical variables).

        -  Generally for each categorical variable the results will be summarized by frequencies
           and percentages. For response rates 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals will be
           calculated.

        -  For each adverse event, the results will be summarized by frequencies and percentages of
           different grades among all cycles as well as by frequencies and percentages of the
           within-patient worst grades

        -  For each continuous variable the results will be summarized by descriptive statistics.

        -  Time-to-event variables will be presented by Kaplan-Meier curves and summarized by
           medians and 95% confidence intervals.

        -  All analysis will be done by treatment arm.
