  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pazopanib hydrochloride
      (pazopanib) when given together with cetuximab in treating patients with incurable recurrent
      or metastatic head and neck cancer. Pazopanib may stop the growth of cancer by blocking blood
      flow to the tumor. Pazopanib may also block some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the ability of some tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Giving pazopanib with cetuximab may provide a more effective treatment for patients
      with advanced head and neck cancer.

             EGFR-specific monoclonal antibody or EGFR-specific TKI for treatment of incurable
             HNSCC. Prior therapy with an EGFR-specific monoclonal antibody as part of the
             definitive treatment of curable HNSCC is acceptable if this occurred more than 3
             months prior to study enrollment. For the dose-finding cohorts, prior EGFR-specific
             therapy in the incurable setting is allowed.

          -  Patient must not have had radiation therapy, minor surgery, or tumor embolization with
             14 days prior to the first dose of pazopanib.

             therapy, or investigational therapy within 14 days or 5 half-lives of the drug prior
             to the first dose of pazopanib. For patients enrolling in the phase I portion of this
             study, this requirement does not apply to prior treatment with cetuximab.

          -  Patient must not have prior major surgery, trauma, presence of any non-healing wound,
             fracture, or ulcer within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  Patient must not have a history of other malignancy ≤ 2 years previous with the
             exception of completely resected non-melanomatous skin carcinoma or successfully
             treated in situ carcinoma.

          -  Patient must not be receiving any medication that is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor
             beginning 14 days prior to first dose of study drug. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include
             (but are not limited to): antibiotics such as clarithromycin, telithromycin,
             troleandromycin; protease inhibitors such as ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir,
             nelfinavir, lopinavir; antifungals such as itraconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole;
             and antidepressants such as nefazodone.

          -  Patient must not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patient must not be experiencing any ongoing toxicity from prior anti-cancer therapy
             that is &gt; grade 1 or that is progressing in severity, except alopecia.

             metastases or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, except for individuals who have had
             previously-treated CNS metastases, are asymptomatic, and have had no requirement for
             steroids or anti-seizure medications for 6 months prior to first dose of pazopanib.

          -  Patient must not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of
             similar chemical or biologic composition to pazopanib, cetuximab, or other agents used
             in the study.

          -  Patient must not have any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality that may
             increase the risk of GI bleeding including, but not limited to, active peptic ulcer
             disease, known intraluminal metastatic lesions with risk of bleeding, inflammatory
             bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease), other GI conditions with
             increased risk of perforation, history of abdominal fistula or GI perforation or
             intra-abdominal abscess within 28 days prior to beginning study treatment.

          -  Patient must not have any clinically significant abnormality that may affect
             absorption of investigational product including, but not limited to, malabsorption
             syndrome or major resection of the stomach or small bowel.

          -  Patient must not have an uncontrolled intercurrent illness within the 6 months prior

             or IV congestive heart failure (as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA)),
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, cardiac
             angioplasty or stenting, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, symptomatic peripheral
             vascular disease, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance
             with study requirements.

          -  Patient must not have poorly controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood
             pressure of ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 90 mmHg). Initiation or
             adjustment of antihypertensive medications is permitted prior to study entry. Blood
             pressure must be re-assessed on two occasions that are separated by a minimum of one
             hour; on each of these occasions, the mean (of 3 readings) from each assessment must
             be &lt; 140/90 mmHg for a patient to be eligible for this study.

          -  Patient must not have a history of cerebrovascular accident including transient
             ischemic attack within the past 6 months. Patients with recent deep venous thrombosis
             or pulmonary embolism who have been treated with therapeutic anti-coagulating agents
             for at least 6 weeks are eligible as long as INR is stable.

          -  Patient must not have evidence of active bleeding or bleeding diathesis.

          -  Patient must not have any known endobronchial lesions and/or lesions infiltrating
             major pulmonary vessels.

          -  Patient must not experience hemoptysis in excess of 2.5 mL within 8 weeks prior to the
             first dose of pazopanib.

          -  Patient must not be pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Patient must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.

          -  Patient must not be known to be HIV-positive on combination antiretroviral because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with pazopanib. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
