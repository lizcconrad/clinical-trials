      Background:

      - The drug 18F-VM4-037 is being tested for use in cancer imaging studies. It may help tumor
      tissue show up more clearly during scans. Researchers want to see how well it works for scans
      for people who have kidney cancer.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of 18F-VM4-037 during imaging studies of kidney
      cancer.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults at least 18 years of age with kidney cancer that will be treated with surgery.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected.

        -  Participants will have two positron emission tomography (PET) scans of their kidneys.
           They will have the scans before and after receiving an injection of 18F-VM4-037. The
           scans will take about 2 hours to complete.

        -  About 3 weeks after the PET scans, participants will provide tumor tissue samples from
           their kidneys.

        -  This is a scanning study only. Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.

      BACKGROUND:

        -  Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CA IX) is a hypoxia-inducible enzyme regulated by the Von Hippel
           Lindau (VHL) protein that is commonly overexpressed in certain malignancies including
           renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and may have prognostic significance.

        -  The VHL gene is commonly mutated or inactivated in RCC tumors and VHL activity regulated
           the expression and activity of not only CAIX but also CAXII as well as other genes
           critical for tumor angiogenesis such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
           glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), glucose transporter 3 (GLUT 3) and platelet derived
           growth factor (PDGF).

        -  18F-VM4-037 is an imaging drug product formulation which binds to the active site ligand
           of CA-IX and also binds to CAXII. We propose to evaluate 18F-VM4-037 as a positron
           emission imaging (PET) radiopharmaceutical for the in vivo detection of CA-IX and CAXII
           in renal tumors.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To evaluate the biodistribution of 18F-VM4-037 within tumor and non-tumor tissues.

        -  To assess safety of 18F-VM4-037 in patients with primary or metastatic RCC.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Subject is greater than or equal to 18 years old, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
           (ECOG) 0-2.

        -  Subject must have confirmed primary RCC (greater than or equal to 2.5cm) in diameter on
           conventional imaging modality or extrarenal/extrahepatic RCC lesion (greater than or
           equal to 1cm).

      DESIGN:

      - Twenty subjects with primary RCC greater than or equal to 2.5cm in diameter or
      extrarenal/extrahepatic lesion suspicious for metastatic RCC (greater than or equal to 1cm in
      diameter) scheduled for clinically indicated surgery or biopsy will undergo dynamic
      18F-VM4-037 PET/CT imaging. Results will be compared with pathology.

          <description>The T category describes the original tumor. T0: No evidence of primary tumor; T1–T4: Size and/or extent of the primary tumor, with higher numbers indicating larger size/extent. The N category describes whether or not the cancer has reached nearby lymph nodes. N0: No regional lymph node involvement (no cancer found in the lymph nodes). The M category tells whether there are distant metastases (spread of cancer to other parts of the body). M0: No distant metastasis (cancer has not spread to other parts of the body); M1: Distant metastasis (cancer has spread to distant parts of the body).</description>
