      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of a Bayer Blood Glucose Monitoring
      System (BGMS) and four additional Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (BGMS) from other
      manufacturers. All meter BG results were compared with plasma results obtained with a
      reference laboratory glucose method (YSI Glucose Analyzer).

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of a Bayer Blood Glucose Monitoring
      System (BGMS) and four additional Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems (BGMS) from other
      manufacturers. All meter BG results were compared with plasma results obtained with a
      reference laboratory glucose method (YSI Glucose Analyzer). Performance of the five systems
      were evaluated across the glucose range of the BGMSs using capillary blood. All testing and
      lancing were performed by study staff and some samples were tested from subject fingertips.
      Additionally, some blood samples were glycolyzed to lower the glucose concentration levels
      and glucose solution was added to other samples to raise glucose concentration levels.

    <measure>MARD (Mean Absolute Relative Difference Between BGMS Results and Reference Method Results) Across the Overall Tested Glucose Range</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Using the overall Blood Glucose (BG) range (27 to 460 mg/dL), the Mean Absolute Relative Differences (MARD) between the BGM System readings and the YSI laboratory reference values were compared. MARD was calculated from the sum of all |(BG meter)-(BG reference)|/(BG reference) assessments, divided by the number of assessments, then multiplied by 100(%). Each evaluable sample was tested on all 5 BGMS, thus the same number of BG test results was analyzed for each BGMS intervention. Lower MARD values indicate smaller differences between meter value and the reference value. Higher MARD values indicate higher differences between meter value and the reference value.</description>

    <description>Using fresh and glycolyzed samples with Blood Glucose (BG) &lt;=80 mg/dL, the Mean Absolute Relative Differences (MARD) between the BGM System readings and the YSI laboratory reference values were compared. MARD was calculated from the sum of all |(BG meter)-(BG reference)|/(BG reference) assessments, divided by the number of assessments, then multiplied by 100(%). Each evaluable sample was tested on all 5 BGMS, thus the same number of BG test results was analyzed for each BGMS intervention.

    <description>Using samples with Blood Glucose &gt;180 mg/dL, the Mean Absolute Relative Differences (MARD) between the BGM System readings and the YSI laboratory reference values were compared.

        <title>MARD (Mean Absolute Relative Difference Between BGMS Results and Reference Method Results) in the Low Glucose Range(&lt;=80 mg/dL)</title>
        <description>Using fresh and glycolyzed samples with Blood Glucose (BG) &lt;=80 mg/dL, the Mean Absolute Relative Differences (MARD) between the BGM System readings and the YSI laboratory reference values were compared. MARD was calculated from the sum of all |(BG meter)-(BG reference)|/(BG reference) assessments, divided by the number of assessments, then multiplied by 100(%). Each evaluable sample was tested on all 5 BGMS, thus the same number of BG test results was analyzed for each BGMS intervention. Lower MARD values indicate smaller differences between meter value and the reference value. Higher MARD values indicate higher differences between meter value and the reference value.</description>
        <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
        <population>Same number (93) of BG results was possible for each BGMS. Staff collected 3 capillary samples from each subject (total 314), of which 93 samples were less than or equal to 80 mg/dL.</population>
