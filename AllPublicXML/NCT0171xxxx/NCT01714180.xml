      Studies have shown that different percentages of body fat can alter the way drugs are
      distributed in the body. This study will use blood samples taken at different time points for
      patients taking acyclovir to determine if higher body weights affect drug exposure. The
      information gathered from this study will help understand if patients with higher body
      weights need a different dosing plan.

      Patients receiving acyclovir as standard of care will be enrolled into this study. They will
      have blood draws once before they take acyclovir and 10 times after they take the acyclovir
      (over a total of 12 hours). These patients will be in the hospital already and will not need
      to make additional trips back to have blood drawn. A total of about 4—5 tablespoons of blood
      will be drawn for this study. 7 obese patients and 7 matched, non—obese patients will be
      enrolled into this study.
