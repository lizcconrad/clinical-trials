  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study's main goal is to develop and preliminarily test a technology-based
      intervention to improve asthma medication adherence in urban African American emerging adults
      (ages 18-29). It is hypothesized that youth randomized to MCTI for adherence will show
      improvements in motivation to adhere to asthma medications and self-reported adherence
      compared to the comparison condition at 1- and 3- month follow up.

      This study collected pilot data with a sample of 48 African American emerging adults with
      asthma with suboptimal medication adherence. Half of the sample were randomized to receive a
      multi-component technology-based intervention (MCTI) targeting adherence to daily controller
      medication. The MCTI consisted of two components: 1) 2 sessions of computer-delivered
      motivational interviewing targeting medication adherence, and 2) individualized text
      messaging focused on medication adherence between the sessions. Text messages were
      individualized based on Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). The remaining half of
      participants completed a series of computer-delivered asthma education modules matched for
      length, location, and method of delivery of the intervention session. Control participants
      also received text messages between intervention sessions. Message content was the same for
      all control participants and contain general facts about asthma (not tailored).
