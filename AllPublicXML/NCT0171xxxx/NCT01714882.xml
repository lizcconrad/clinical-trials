      In Vitro Fertilization (IVF).

      The investigators are trying to determine two different stress management techniques in
      couples undergoing IVF. One arm will be randomized to learning these techniques by themselves
      by watching and following instructions on a digital video disc (DVD). The other arm will have
      an in-person class that will teach the couples different stress reduction techniques.

    <measure>Clinical or biochemical miscarriage</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Miscarriage will be defined as a biochemical or clinical miscarriage. A biochemical miscarriage will include a rise and then subsequent fall in beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (BhCG) to less than 5 IU/L. A clinical miscarriage will be defined as vaginal bleeding with passage of products of conception recognized as products of conception by histopathology.</description>
