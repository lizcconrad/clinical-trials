      This study will be a single-center, open-label, randomized, 3-treatment crossover study of
      single oral doses of an API-capsule formulation of E2609 under fasted conditions and a tablet
      formulation administered under fed and fasted conditions in healthy subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Caucasian males defined as persons of a European or Latin American descent

          2. Healthy male 30 to 55 years inclusive at the time of informed consent

          3. Body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 32 kg/m2 at Screening

          4. Subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia), or they and
             their female partners must not be of childbearing potential or must be practicing
             highly effective contraception throughout the study period and for 30 days after study
             drug discontinuation. No sperm donation is allowed during the study period and for 30
             days after study drug discontinuation.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Any history of seizures or epilepsy (not including a history of simple febrile
             seizures in childhood) or disturbance of consciousness likely to be due to seizures

          2. Any medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator has high risk of
             seizures (e.g., history of traumatic brain injury associated with loss of
             consciousness or amnesia, alcohol abuse, substance abuse) at Screening or within past
             5 years

          3. Any history of cerebrovascular disease (stroke or transient ischemic attack)

          4. A history of prolonged QT/QTc interval or prolonged period from the beginning of the
             QRS complex to the end of the T wave on an ECG (QT)/ QT corrected for heart rate using
             Fridericia?s formula (QTcF) interval (QTcF &amp;gt; 450 ms) as demonstrated by the mean of
             triplicate electrocardiogram (ECGs) (recorded at least 1 min apart) at Screening or
             Baseline Period

          5. Any other clinically significant ECG abnormalities at Screening or Baseline Periods,
             e.g. component of the ECG cycle from onset of atrial depolarization to onset of
             ventricular depolarization (PR)&amp;gt;220 ms, component of ECG wave representing
             ventricular depolarization (QRS)&amp;gt;110 ms

          6. Hypersensitivity to the study drugs or any of their excipients
