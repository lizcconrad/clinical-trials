  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two main goals. The first goal is to test whether a mobile phone intervention
      can increase adherence to daily inhaled steroid medications in African American adolescents
      prescribed this type of medication by his/her asthma doctor. The second goal is to use a
      mobile phone intervention to better understand real life patterns of use of quick-relief
      (beta2-adrenergic agonist) asthma medication in this population.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to inhaled corticosteroids, measured objectively using an electronic dose counter</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence is measured as the mean of daily adherence to prescription inhaled corticosteroid dose over 14 days both at baseline and at week 10 of the active treatment phase. For the primary outcome, we will compare adherence at week 10 to adherence at baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To understand patterns of use of quick-relief medication for asthma</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This study will use an electronic dose counter and mobile phone technology to track participants real time use of quick-relief (beta2-adrenergic agonist) medication for asthma during the 10 weeks of active treatment.</description>

    <description>Each participant will be provided with a spacer and a peak flow meter, and instructions on proper technique, by a member of the study team during the baseline period. They will also meet with study staff at study visits during the active treatment phase to review their adherence to daily inhaled corticosteroids and usage patterns of short acting B2-agonist medication.</description>

    <description>Each participant will receive a mobile phone with talking, texting and a data plan. They will get to keep the mobile phone at the end of the study, but the talking, texting and data plan will only be active during their participation in the study.</description>
