      The primary objective of the study is to assess whether an improved MSF HIV diagnostic
      algorithm which includes a simple and easy to perform confirmation test has significantly
      better positive predictive value than WHO recommended RDT testing algorithms that do not
      include confirmatory testing.

    <textblock>
      Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT's) are essential tools in antiretroviral treatment (ART) scale
      up. An important drawback to RDTs is the risk of false positive results. In 2005, MSF-Holland
      has therefore changed the testing algorithm to introduce a confirmation test. This proposal
      outlines an evaluation study of the results of the new confirmatory testing algorithm. It
      aims to compare the confirmatory algorithm employed by MSF-OCA to the MoH serial algorithm
      which is based on WHO recommendations. A secondary objective of the study is to determine if
      there is a correlation between kala-azar infection and risk of false positive HIV RDT results
      as clinicians in the projects suspect such a correlation. Furthermore, the study will look at
      the positive predictive value of weak test lines, which have been associated with higher risk
      of false positive results. Finally, the study aims to evaluate the results of a new
      simplified confirmation test, the dilution testing. Clients for the study will be recruited
      at two counseling and testing sites in Abdurafi and Humera, aiming to reach a sample size of
      200 serial-algorithm positive and 200 negative samples in each site.
