    <textblock>
      Drug discovery can take many years especially since most studies to measure effectiveness
      depend on clinical outcomes like pulmonary function tests and hospitalizations.

      This is an observational study designed to collect information, blood, and bronchoalveolar
      lavage fluid in people who have IPF and those who do not. The people who have IPF will be
      followed for 12 months to collect more biological samples and record clinically relevant
      information.

      The goal of this study is to identify new molecular markers that are measurable and reliable
      in people who have IPF. It is hoped that these markers can be used in future drug studies to
      significantly speed up the process of finding drugs that help.

    <description>We anticipate that we will successfully enroll 60 subjects with IPF in a 12 month longitudinal cohort study and provide biological samples (Bronchiolavage (BAL), alveolar macrophages, and blood) to Projects 1-3 for use in identifying mechanistically-informative markers of alveolar epithelial cell ER stress, αvβ6-mediated TGFβ activation, and EMT. We expect that levels of some of these mechanistic markers will be measurable in patient samples, and may be differentially present in IPF compared to normal controls. Variations in baseline levels of mechanistically-informative molecular markers may identify subgroups of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) patients that share distinct clinical phenotypes.</description>
