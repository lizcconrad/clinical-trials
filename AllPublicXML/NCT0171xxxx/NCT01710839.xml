      To see if Lucentis 0.5mg combined with Targeted Pan Retinal photocoagulation will decrease
      the total number of intravitreal injections in a year for ischemic central retinal vein

      The WAVE trial is a phase IV, open label, 12-month trial of intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg
      in patients (n=30) with ischemic CRVO, HRVO and BRVO who have been previously treated with
      ranibizumab or any other anti-VEGF intravitreal injection therapy, who are incomplete
      responders to 2 or more consecutive intravitreal anti-VEGF injections in the past 4 months.
      Randomization is 1:4, 1=control, ranibizumab only, 4=treatment arm. In total, 6 subjects will
      be randomized to control and 24 randomized to treatment arm.

      Cohort 1- 24 Subjects previously treated Patients will receive 6 doses of ranibizumab 0.5 mg,
      followed by PRN intravitreal injection of ranibizumab 0.5 mg based on pre-defined retreatment
      criteria for up to 11 total injections.

      Wide field angiography guided peripheral targeted-retinal photocoagulation (TRP), will be
      divided into 2 sessions if needed, one at the 2 weeks post injection visit and another later
      at M4/V7, if repeat wide field angiogram indicates areas not sufficiently treated in the
      first TRP session

      Cohort 2- 6 Subjects, previously treated patients will receive 6 doses of ranibizumab 0.5 mg,
      followed by PRN intravitreal injection of ranibizumab 0.5 mg based on pre-defined retreatment
      criteria for up to 11 total injections.
