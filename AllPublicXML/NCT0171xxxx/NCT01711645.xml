    <textblock>
      Monitoring immune response and longevity in serum and milk after Tdap administration to
      postpartum women. The clinical trial will involve women (aged 18 - 45 years) who have just
      delivered full-term infants (greater than or equal to 37 completed weeks of gestation) at
      Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The enrollment period will be fifteen months. The
      duration is over two years of observation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, prospective study involving only one intervention, receipt of a single
      0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) dose of Adacel (Tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and
      acellular Pertussis) vaccine, among 55 healthy post partum women. The purpose of the study is
      to examine the immune responses and subsequent decline in serum and breast milk antibody
      titers over two years of observation. The clinical trial will involve women (aged 18 - 45
      years) who have just delivered full-term infants (greater than or equal to 37 completed weeks
      of gestation) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. One particular population at
      Vanderbilt to target will be the &quot;centering prenatal care group&quot; that has breastfeeding rates
      as high as 75 percent at hospital discharge and maintained at 20 percent at 6 months. The
      enrollment period will be fifteen months. The subjects, staff assessing subjects, and
      laboratory personnel will be aware of receipt of the vaccine. Since only a single vaccine
      product is being utilized, there is no blinding needed of the subjects or staff.

          <description>Blood was collected from participants at baseline prior to vaccination and at 6 weeks after vaccination for assessment of IgG by ELISA against the PT, FHA, PRN and FIM antigens. The geometric mean of participants' fold rise in antibody concentrations from baseline to post vaccination was calculated, along with the 95% CI.</description>

        <title>ELISA Geometric Mean Concentrations (GMC) of Serum IgG to PT, FHA, PRN and FIM at Baseline</title>
        <description>Blood was collected from participants at baseline prior to vaccination for assessment of IgG by ELISA against the PT, FHA, PRN and FIM antigens. Antibody concentrations were reported as ELISA units per milliliter (EU/mL). A value of 5 EU/mL was imputed for results reported as below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) (&lt;10 EU/mL). The geometric mean of participants’ concentrations at the timepoint was calculated, along with the 95% CI.</description>

        <title>Count of Participants With 4-fold Rise in ELISA Antibody Concentrations at Month 6</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants for assessment of IgG by ELISA against the PT, FHA, PRN and FIM antigens at baseline prior to vaccination and 6 months after vaccination. A 4-fold rise in antibody concentration from prior to vaccination was defined as a post-vaccination IgG greater than or equal to 40 EU/mL for participants with baseline IgG concentrations less than the LLOQ (10), or 4 times the baseline IgG concentration for baseline IgG concentrations greater than the LLOQ.</description>

        <description>Breast milk (colostrum) was collected from participants at baseline prior to vaccination for assessment of secretory IgA (sIgA) to the PT antigen by ELISA. Available data at the timepoint were summarized by geometric mean of the concentration as reported in EU/mL along with the 95% confidence interval.

        <title>ELISA GMC of Breast Milk IgA to PRN and FIM by Study Day.</title>
        <description>Breast milk (colostrum) was collected from participants at baseline prior to vaccination for assessment of secretory IgA (sIgA) to the PRN and FIM antigen by ELISA. Available data at the timepoint were to be summarized by geometric mean of the concentration as reported in EU/mL along with the 95% confidence interval. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of the assay was 10 EU/mL.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Participants With 4-fold Rise in Antibody in Breast Milk by Study Day.</title>
        <description>Breast milk samples were collected from participants for evaluation of PT and FHA secretory IgA (sIgA) by ELISA. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for the assay was 10 EU/mL. A 4-fold rise in concentration from prior to vaccination was defined as a post-vaccination sIgA concentration greater than or equal to 40 EU/mL for participants with baseline sIgA concentrations less than the LLOQ, or 4 times the baseline sIgA concentration for baseline sIgA concentrations greater than the LLOQ.</description>

        <population>Only 4 participants were able to provide a breast milk (colostrum) sample at baseline and post vaccination samples had no detectable titer, resulting in a fold-rise analysis being uninterpretable; therefore, this analysis was not conducted.</population>

      <time_frame>Since pertussis vaccine is offered as standard of care to healthy adults, including postpartum women, anticipated AEs related to pertussis vaccine administration, as per Package Insert, were not collected. AEs reported for this protocol were limited to 1. severe vaso-vagal reaction, including loss of consciousness or &gt; grade 2 hypotension, associated with the blood draw; and 2. adverse events leading to infection or inability to breast feed following the use of the breast pump.</time_frame>
      <desc>Anticipated adverse events related to administration of the pertussis vaccine as per Package Insert include injection site reactions (pain, swelling and erythema) and systemic reactions (headache body ache and muscle weakness). Events meeting VAERS reporting requirements were to be reported to VAERS and not collected for this protocol.</desc>
