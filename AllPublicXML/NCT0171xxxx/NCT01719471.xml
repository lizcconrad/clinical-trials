      To examine the influence of current daily tobacco smoking on brain activation during stress,
      tobacco cue, and neutral relaxing conditions
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will participate in an fMRI session to examine changes in frontal and limbic brain
      regions with tobacco cues, stress and neutral/relaxing imagery. During each fMRI session
      subjects will participate in six imagery trials: 2 different neutral/relaxing, 2 different
      stress and 2 different tobacco cue scripts.
