  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial at a single site. The
      primary objective is to evaluate the safety of ACCS in diabetic subjects with deep burns. The
      secondary objectives of this study are to (1) evaluate efficacy of ACCS in healing burns and
      (2) evaluate whether treatment with ACCS results in less scarring, in subjects with diabetes
      separately comparing healing of the skin graft and the skin graft donor site using ACCS plus
      a burn dressing versus placebo and a burn dressing.

          -  18 - 75 years of age.

          -  Thermal or scald burn, either full thickness or deep partial thickness, which in the
             opinion of the burn surgeon, requires a meshed skin graft to heal.

          -  Target burn area for treatment equal to or less than three percent total body surface
             area.

          -  A skin graft site harvested at 10/1000ths of an inch and a skin graft meshed at 2:1.

          -  Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) burn of less than or equal to 20 percent total body
             surface.

          -  Patient must have a known history of diabetes, or be found to have diabetes at the
             time of admission, confirmed by a Hemoglobin A1C of greater than 6.5 percent.

             employ either a highly effective form of birth control (e.g., implants, injectable
             medications, a hormone combination oral contraceptive, etc.), sexual abstinence, or a

             the study (through study discharge). Male subjects with a WOCBP partner must be

          -  Willing to participate in the clinical study and comply with the requirements of the
             trial.

          -  Full thickness burns involving tendon, ligament, bone, or joint capsule.

          -  Burns of the face, neck, palmer surface of the hands and plantar surface of the foot.

             medication, chemotherapeutic agents, anti-viral therapy, or concurrent radiation
             therapy within 30 days of signing the informed consent.

          -  History of non-compliance with treatment or clinical visit attendance.

          -  Acute clinically significant infection (including viral infections) in the six weeks
             prior to administration of study drug or any clinically significant ongoing chronic
             infection (excluding fungal infections of the nail beds).

          -  Evidence or history of skin conditions that would interfere with evaluations.
