      To assess the bioequivalence of the investigational TEST product with the marketed REFERENCE
      products by measurement of Plasma concentrations of Amlodipine ,Losartan, Carboxylic acid
      losartan metabolite &amp; Hydrochlorothiazide in plasma and calculation of the bioequivalence

    <description>To assess the bioequivalence of the investigational TEST product with the marketed REFERENCE products by measurement of Plasma concentrations of Amlodipine ,Losartan, Carboxylic acid losartan metabolite &amp; Hydrochlorothiazide in plasma and calculation of the bioequivalence parameters from those measurements followed by ANOVA and 90% confidence interval statistical evaluation.
Cmax Ratio: Scaled average bioequivalence will be performed. Bioequivalence limits will be defined and widened according to the variance of Ïƒw2 within subject variability for the reference based on Amlodipine, Losartan, &amp; Hydrochlorothiazide
AUC Ratio: The 90% confidence interval for this measure lies within an acceptance range of 80.00% - 125.00% based on Losartan, &amp; Hydrochlorothiazide
AUC0-72 Ratio: The 90% confidence interval for this measure lies within an acceptance range of 80.00 - 125.00 % based on Amlodipine
Carboxylic acid Losartan metabolite will be considered as supportive data</description>
