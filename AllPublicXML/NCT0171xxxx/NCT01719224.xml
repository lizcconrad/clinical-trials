  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that sleeping in a 45 degrees elevated body position decreases
      the likelihood of upper airway vulnerability to collapse early after delivery. Furthermore,
      the investigators want to elucidate the anatomical and physiological risk factors that
      contribute in the upper airway obstruction in post-partum patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After obtaining study consent, each patient underwent measurements of upper airway
      cross-sectional area (CSA) during daytime within 48 h after delivery. The minimum upper
      airway CSA was measured using acoustic pharyngometry (Eccovision Acoustic Pharyngometry;
      Sleep Group Solutions, Inc) in sitting, 45° elevated, and nonelevated upper body position.
      This method has been previously used and validated in pregnant women.

      In the patients who further gave consent for the sleep study, polysomnography (PSG) was
      performed throughout the entire study night. Within a crossover design, patients were
      randomly assigned to receive first either nonelevated or 45° elevated upper body position.
      Position was changed after 3.5 h by a member of the team.

        <title>Minimum Upper Airway Cross-sectional Area: to Elucidate the Anatomical and Physiological Risk Factors That Contribute to the Upper Airway Obstruction in Post-partum Patients</title>
        <description>Each patient underwent measurements of upper airway CSA during daytime within 48 h after delivery. The minimum upper airway CSA was measured using acoustic pharyngometry (Eccovision Acoustic Pharyngometry; Sleep Group Solutions, Inc) in sitting, 45° elevated, and nonelevated upper body position.</description>
