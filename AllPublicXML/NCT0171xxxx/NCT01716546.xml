  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose to study the effect of panitumumab when combined with an active
      regimen, such as DCF (Docetaxel/Cisplatin/Fluourouracil), in previously untreated patients
      with advanced cancer of the stomach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose a phase I/II study in order to evaluate the effect of panitumumab when
      combined with an active regimen, such as DCF (Docetaxel/Cisplatin/Fluourouracil), in
      chemotherapy - naive patients with advanced cancer of the stomach.

      Investigators hypothesize that the addition of panitumumab to DCF regimen in advanced cancer
      of the stomach and gastroesophageal junction is feasible, well tolerated and could achieve an
      objective response rate of greater than 40%.

      The 2-weekly schedule of DCF will be used as chemotherapy since a recently presented trial
      demonstrated a comparable efficacy but a more favourable toxicity profile comparable to the
      3-weekly schedule.
