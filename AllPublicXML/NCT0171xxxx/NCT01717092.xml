    <textblock>
      Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTPH) is associated with considerable
      morbidity and mortality. Its incidence after pulmonary embolism and associated risk factors
      are not well documented in Chinese population. We conducted a prospective, long-term,
      follow-up study to assess the incidence of symptomatic CTPH in consecutive patients with an
      acute episode of pulmonary embolism but without prior venous thromboembolism. Patients with
      unexplained persistent dyspnea during follow-up underwent transthoracic echocardiography and,
      if supportive findings were present, ventilation-perfusion lung scanning and pulmonary
      angiography. CTPH was considered to be present if systolic and mean pulmonary-artery
      pressures exceeded 40 mm Hg and 25 mm Hg, respectively; pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure
      was normal; and there was angiographic evidence of disease.
