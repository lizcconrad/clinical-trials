  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most serious challenges facing antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs for HIV/AIDS
      in resource-constrained settings is the failure of ART-eligible patients to complete the
      steps required to initiate treatment. The high rate of loss to care of patients who are
      treatment-eligible at HIV diagnosis may be due in part to the large number of steps required
      between receiving an HIV diagnosis and obtaining the first dose of antiretrovirals (ARVs). In
      South Africa, these steps usually require approximately four clinic visits over a period of
      2-8 weeks before a patient can start treatment. One strategy proposed for reducing losses
      among those eligible for ART is to simplify and condense the steps required for starting
      treatment. This is now possible because new, point-of-care (POC) tests for CD4 counts and
      tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis are available. These technologies can be combined with changes to
      clinic schedules to allow all steps required for ART initiation under South African
      guidelines (lab tests, physical exam, education) to take place on the day the patient
      presents for an HIV test.

      This study is a randomized strategy evaluation of the feasibility, effectiveness, and
      cost-effectiveness of rapid ART initiation. Outpatient, non-pregnant, HIV-positive adults who
      come to a South African clinic for an HIV test, consent to study participation, and are
      eligible for ART will be randomized 1:1 to rapid ART initiation or to standard care. Those
      who are assigned to rapid ART initiation will have the possibility of receiving their first
      dose of ARVs as early as the same day, while those who are assigned to standard care will
      follow the clinic's usual procedures for starting ART. Rapid ART initiation for HIV-positive
      pregnant women, which has recently become the standard of care in South Africa, will also be
      assessed in a programmatic evaluation conducted alongside the randomized evaluation, with a
      retrospective comparison group. The primary study outcome for non-pregnant adults will be
      remaining alive, in care and virally suppressed 10 months after having a positive HIV test at
      the study site or making a first HIV-related visit. The primary study outcome for pregnant
      women will be adherence to ART until delivery. The cost effectiveness of the rapid initiation
      strategy will be assessed as the cost per patient achieving the primary outcome for each
      population.

    <description>The primary outcome for non-pregnant adults is the proportion of subjects in each group alive, in care and virally suppressed at the routine six-month monitoring visit within 10 months of a positive HIV test or initial HIV care visit if previously diagnosed. The analysis period will start at study enrollment and continue through the earlier of the patient's six-month viral load or 10 months after the patient's HIV test.</description>

    <description>The primary outcome for pregnant women is the proportion of subjects in each group who adhere to ART or the prior prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) regimen until delivery. The number of weeks a pregnant woman is on ART before delivery is the most important predictor of perinatal HIV transmission7. The guideline change to immediate ART initiation for pregnant women is likely to lead to earlier initiation for most pregnant women, but the intervention will be effective only if patients adhere to ART through the duration of pregnancy. Adherence will be measured as making monthly medication pickups to allow a continuous supply of ARVs through delivery. The analysis period for the primary outcome will start on the day of study enrollment, which is the date of a positive HIV test or the first antenatal visit of the current pregnancy, for women previously diagnosed, and end at the actual or estimated delivery date.</description>
