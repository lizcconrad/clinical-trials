  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability in the world, and stem cell -
      transplantation provides a promising approach for rehabilitation. The main objective of this
      study is to evaluate the efficacy of the intracerebral injection of autologous bone marrow
      mesenchymal stem cells in patients with chronic stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For many stroke survivors, the best hope is a lengthy program of rehabilitation, followed by
      a life-long process of clinical support. However, even with rehabilitation therapy, 50% to
      95% of stroke survivors remain impaired. There is thus a great need for new therapeutic
      developments for patients with disability after stroke, which is largely unexplored.
      Regenerative cell-based therapies offer long-term hope for many patients with stroke, as stem
      cells might be possible for dead or injured neural cells to be replaced after acute stroke.
      In this study, the investigators will assess the safety and feasibility of intracerebral
      transplantation of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in patients with chronic
      stroke. The neurological outcome will be determined after transplantation.
