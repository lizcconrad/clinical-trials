      The objective of this study is to assess the post-infusion viability of S-303 Red Blood Cells
      (RBC) by measuring the 24 hour post-infusion recovery and lifespan of autologous RBCs
      prepared with the S-303 Treatment System for RBC after storage for 35 days in comparison to
      conventional untreated RBCs stored for 35 days.

                  contraception

               -  Participation in another clinical study currently or within the past 28 days
