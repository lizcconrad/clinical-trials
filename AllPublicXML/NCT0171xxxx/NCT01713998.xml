  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 60 subjects will be enrolled. Enrolled subjects will receive one Ulthera® treatment on
      the face and neck. Follow-up visits will occur at 90 and 180 days post-treatment. Study
      images will be obtained pre-treatment, immediately post-treatment, and at each follow-up
      visit.

      This trial is a prospective, single-site, double-blinded, randomized, split-face design.
      Subjects will be randomized to one of three treatment groups, receiving treatment using
      different energy levels. Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale scores and patient satisfaction
      questionnaires will be obtained.

    <measure>Subjects' Assessment of Pain During Treatment With Lower Energy Settings</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were assessed for the duration of study treatment, an average of 75 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects' sensory response to the Ulthera treatment exposures were recorded using a validated Numeric Rating Scale (NRS,0-10), for each anatomical region treated and energy settings used, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst pain possible.
Pain scores were collected in a consistent manner, following treatment of each section of the face and neck on both sides (submental, submandibular, cheek, periorbital, infraorbital, and forehead), and for each transducer used. Split-face comparisons of pain scores obtained during study treatment by research staff blinded to the energy settings used were completed.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Improvement in Skin Laxity on the Face and Neck</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A split-face comparison of improvement in overall lifting and tightening of skin was completed by three masked assessors. Pre-treatment and 90 days post-treatment photos from 45 subjects who returned for their 90-day follow-up visit were reviewed, assessing for improvement in skin laxity, i.e., lifted and tightened skin in the areas treated using treatment energy settings based on subjects' assigned study group.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Assessment of Brow Lift at 90 Days Post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative assessment and analysis of brow lift from baseline to 90 days post-treatment was completed comparing brow lift achieved using standard energy settings compared to adjusted energy settings. The number of subjects with 1 mm or more brow lift is reported. Note: Because the submental region was treated using standard energy settings in all study groups, a quantitative analysis of lift in this region between the study groups would most likely not be informative, and therefore was not completed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Assessment of Improvement at 90 Days Post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects completed a Patient Assessment Questionnaire at 90 days post-treatment by referring to their image in a mirror, their 90-day post-treatment photos, and their pre-treatment photos, and reporting if any improvement was noted on the right and left sides of their face and neck.</description>

    <measure>Subject Assessment of Improvement at 180 Days Post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>180 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects completed a Patient Assessment Questionnaire at 180 days post-treatment by referring to their image in a mirror, their 180-day post-treatment photos, and their pre-treatment photos, and reporting if any improvement was noted on the right and left sides of their face and neck.</description>

        <title>Subjects' Assessment of Pain During Treatment With Lower Energy Settings</title>
        <description>Subjects' sensory response to the Ulthera treatment exposures were recorded using a validated Numeric Rating Scale (NRS,0-10), for each anatomical region treated and energy settings used, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst pain possible.
Pain scores were collected in a consistent manner, following treatment of each section of the face and neck on both sides (submental, submandibular, cheek, periorbital, infraorbital, and forehead), and for each transducer used. Split-face comparisons of pain scores obtained during study treatment by research staff blinded to the energy settings used were completed.</description>

        <title>Subject Assessment of Improvement at 90 Days Post-treatment</title>
        <description>Subjects completed a Patient Assessment Questionnaire at 90 days post-treatment by referring to their image in a mirror, their 90-day post-treatment photos, and their pre-treatment photos, and reporting if any improvement was noted on the right and left sides of their face and neck.</description>
