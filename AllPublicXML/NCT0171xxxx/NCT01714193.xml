  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there is a drug-drug interaction between
      multiple doses of canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) and single doses of an oral contraceptive
      containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel. The safety and tolerability of canagliflozin
      will also be assessed in healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>

      This study will be an open-label (all volunteers and study staff know the identity of the
      assigned treatment), single-center, fixed-sequence study (all volunteers receive the same
      medication on the same days), to determine how canagliflozin (a drug currently being
      investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus) affects the pharmacokinetics (ie,
      how the body affects the drug) of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and
      levonorgestrel. The study will consist of 3 phases; a screening phase, an open-label
      treatment phase, and an end-of-study (or follow-up) phase. Each volunteer will participate in
      the study for approximately 33 days.
