  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this pilot study is to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters
      and collect preliminary safety data for pravastatin when used as a prophylactic daily
      treatment in pregnant women at high risk of preeclampsia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia shares pathogenic similarities with adult cardiovascular diseases as well as
      many risk factors. Endothelial dysfunction and inflammation are fundamental for the
      initiation and progression of both. There is strong evidence that
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are beneficial
      in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular mortality and other cardiovascular
      events. Biological plausibility as well as animal data supports a similar role for statins in
      preeclampsia.

      Currently, there are no clinically available agents to prevent preeclampsia. However because
      of the below properties of statins, this class of medications could substantially contribute
      to preeclampsia prevention.

        1. Statins pleiotropic actions on various mechanisms: reversing the angiogenic imbalance by
           upregulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor
           (PlGF), and reducing the antiangiogenic factors such as soluble fms-like tyrosine
           kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin (sEng).

        2. Statins up regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, leading to improved nitric
           oxide production in the vasculature and to activate the heme oxygenase-1/carbon monoxide
           (HO-1/CO) pathway, protecting the endothelium and reducing the inflammatory and
           oxidative insults.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the maternal-fetal safety and pharmacokinetic
      (PK) profiles of pravastatin when used in pregnant women at high-risk of developing
      preeclampsia.
