      THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO COMPARE THE EFFICACY, TOLERABILITY, AND SAFETY OF DIFFERENT BOWEL
      PREPARATIONS FOR COLONOSCOPY IN CHILDREN.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COLONOSCOPY IS AN ESTABLISHED DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC TOOL IN A VARIETY OF
      GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT CONDITION AFFECTING CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTs. FOR EXAMPLE:
      INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE, COLONIC POLYPS OR LOWER GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT BLEEDING.

      THE IDEAL PREPARATION SHOULD BE OF LOW VOLUME, PALATABLE AND SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETE COLON
      CLEANOUT.

      PRIMARY AIMS OF THIS WERE TO COMPARE THE EFFICACY AND ACCEPTANCE OF FOUR METHODS OF BOWEL
      CLEANSING BEFORE COLONOSCOPY IN CHILDREN. SECONDARY AIMS WAS TO COMPARE THE SAFETY PROFILE OF
      THIS METHODS.

    <measure>Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>During the performance of colonoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>Preparation efficacy was evaluated by the blinded endoscopist according to the Boston Bowel Preparation scale (BBPS) consisting of four-point scoring system.
The total score ranging from 0 to 9 was divided into four different classes: excellent cleansing (total score 8-9), good cleansing (total score 6-7), poor cleansing (total score 4-5) and inadequate cleansing (total score 0-3).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>safety</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events were assessed on the day of colonoscopy by direct questioning and by telephone interview 48-96 hours after colonoscopy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>clinical tolerabiity</measure>
    <time_frame>On the morning of colonoscopy, immediately before the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability assessment was based on the recording of occurrence and severity of GI symptoms such as nausea, bloating, abdominal, pain/cramps and anal discomfort</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>On the morning of colonoscopy, immediately before the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Compliance was scored on a 3-point scale according to the percentage of drunk solution</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>On the morning of colonoscopy, immediately before the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The easiness of taking or swallowing the solution was graded according to the following scale: very severe distress = 4, severe distress = 3, moderate distress = 2, mild distress = 1, no distress = 0.</description>
