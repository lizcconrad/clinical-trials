  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is prospective, multi-center clinical trial. Enrolled subjects will receive one Ulthera®
      treatment on the decolletage. Follow-up visits will occur at 90 and 180 days following
      treatment. Study images will be obtained pre-treatment, immediately post-treatment, and at
      each follow-up visit.

    <description>Assessment of improvement, in a blinded fashion, using a Chest Wrinkle Scale at 90 days post-treatment. However, during conduct of the trial, the Chest Wrinkle scale was deemed inadequate as a primary endpoint in this study. Therefore, conduct of a traditional blinded masked assessment, the gold-standard measure in aesthetics, was used as the primary endpoint,i.e., improvement in wrinkles and lines of the décolletage as determined by a blinded, masked, qualitative assessment of photographs at 90 days post-treatment compared to baseline.
&quot;Improvement&quot; = a blinded evaluator assessed an &quot;Improvement&quot; when evaluating a masked, paired photo set and correctly chose the Post treatment photo.
&quot;Incorrect&quot; = a blinded evaluator assessed an &quot;Improvement&quot; when evaluating a masked, paired photo set but incorrectly chose the Post treatment photo.</description>

    <time_frame>90 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The overall level of aesthetic improvement at 90 Days post treatment compared to baseline was assessed using a Clinician Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (CGAIS). The CGAIS is a 5-point scale with the following descriptors:
Very much improved
Much improved
Improved
No change
Worse
The scale was completed in two steps:
Based on a live assessment of the subject while referring to the subject's pre-treatment photographs; and
Based on a comparison of the subject's pre-treatment photographs to current post-treatment photographs.
&quot;Improved&quot; = Very Much Improved + Much Improved + Improved</description>

However, during conduct of the trial, the Chest Wrinkle scale was deemed inadequate as a primary endpoint in this study. Therefore, conduct of a traditional blinded masked assessment, the gold-standard measure in aesthetics, was used as the primary endpoint, improvement in wrinkles and lines of the décolletage as determined by a blinded, masked, qualitative assessment of photographs at 180 days .post-treatment compared to baseline.
&quot;Improvement&quot; = a blinded evaluator assessed an &quot;Improvement&quot; when evaluating a masked, paired photo set and correctly chose the Post treatment photo.
