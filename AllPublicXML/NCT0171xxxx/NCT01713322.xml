  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunization procedures are a common source of iatrogenic pain for infants. A recently
      developed clinical practice guideline, led by Taddio et al., created evidence-based
      strategies for management of immunization pain. User-friendly educational tools outlining
      these strategies were made. The goal of cluster randomized controlled trial is to assess
      whether these educational materials increase utilization of pain-relieving strategies by
      parents during infant immunizations.

      Immunization procedures are a common source of iatrogenic pain for infants. A recently
      developed clinical practice guideline led by Taddio et al. provides evidence-based
      recommendations for the management of immunization pain in children. User-friendly
      educational tools based on the guideline have also been developed, including a factsheet and
      educational video. The primary objective of this study is to assess whether these materials
      can increase utilization of pain -relieving strategies by parents during immunizations.
      Parents will be recruited during their infant's 2-month or 4-month scheduled visit to receive
      either the educational material related to immunization pain management (intervention group)
      or general information about immunization (control group). The study team will then follow
      these infants at their current and upcoming immunizations visit and document the pain
      management strategies utilized, infant pain responses, and parental satisfaction with pain
      management.
