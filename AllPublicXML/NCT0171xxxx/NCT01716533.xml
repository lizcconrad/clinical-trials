  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to 1) evaluate the C. difficile-specific immune response in CDI patients and
      2) explore the difference in immune response between the patients with CDI recurrence and
      those with a sustained clinical response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with an initial episode of CDI will be followed up for CDI recurrence or sustained
      clinical response. The subjects will be allocated into 2 groups at the study end:

        -  Recurrence Group: Subjects who experience recurrence of CDI after clinical response to
           antibiotic treatment to treat the initial CDI episode.

        -  Sustained response Group: Subjects who do not experience recurrence of CDI after
           clinical response to the antibiotic treatment to treat the initial CDI episode.

      This protocol has been amended twice to improve recruitment of subjects in the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that they can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol or/ and subjects who can receive assistance from his/ her
             legally acceptable representative (LAR) or a designate who can and will comply with
             the requirements of the protocol.

          -  A male or female aged 18 years or older at the time of enrolment.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject/ LAR of the subject.

          -  A reasonable prognosis of survival during the study period as judged by the
             investigator.

          -  Outpatients, emergency room and/ or hospitalized subjects diagnosed with CDI for which
             the symptoms started maximum 14 days prior to study enrolment.

          -  Subjects who receive or plan to receive antibiotic treatment to treat the CDI episode.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrently participating or planning to participate in another clinical study, at
             any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to
             an investigational or a non-investigational product.

          -  Previous CDI episode within the previous 6 months before study enrolment (except for
             up to ~25% of the subjects).

          -  Chronic diarrheal illness such as, but not limited to, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's
             disease.

          -  Planned surgery for CDI within 24 hours after study entry.

          -  Previous vaccination against Clostridium difficile.

          -  Having received a Clostridium difficile monoclonal antibody product(s) within the
             previous 3 months or planned administration during the study period.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins within the previous 3 months or planned
             administration during the study period.

          -  Subject having any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             jeopardize the safety or rights of the subject participating in the study, would make
             it unlikely for the subject to complete the study, or would confound the results of
             the study.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs within the previous 6 months.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history.

          -  Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          -  Major congenital defects.
