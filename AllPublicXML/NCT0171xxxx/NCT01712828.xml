  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To find out if the blood level of lenalidomide can be changed when a drug that prevents
      p-glycoprotein (a protein naturally present in the body that helps carry substances across
      cell membranes that is found in many parts of the body like the intestines, liver, and
      kidneys) from working (called a P-gp inhibitor) when taken together with lenalidomide. The
      study is also trying to find out if blood level of temsirolimus can be changed when a subject
      takes lenalidomide together with temsirolimus.

      This will be a single-center, open label, 2-part study. Part 1 will be a two-period,
      fixed-sequence crossover study with lenalidomide alone in Period 1, followed by lenalidomide
      in combination with quinidine in Period 2. Part 2 will be a fixed-sequence, three-period,
      crossover study with lenalidomide alone in Period 1, temsirolimus (via direct intravenous
      infusion) in Period 2, and lenalidomide in combination with temsirolimus (via direct
      intravenous infusion) in Period 3. Diphenhydramine (given via intravenous injection) will be
      administered shortly before temsirolimus in order to decrease the chances of an allergic
      reaction to temsirolimus. Part 1 and Part 2 will be conducted at the same time. Subjects can
      only participate in either Part 1 or Part 2.
