  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate safety and efficacy of PF-05212377 in subjects with mild-to-moderate
      Alzheimer's Disease with existing neuropsychiatric symptoms on a stable dose of Donepezil.
      The 4-week run-in will minimize placebo effect. The 12-week treatment period is considered
      the minimum length necessary to reliably evaluate the effect PF-05212377 on cognition and and
      neuropsychiatric symptoms in this population. The 2-week washout will allow to monitor
      re-emergence of neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in ADAS-cog13 Total Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>ADAS-cog13 (13-item ADAS cog) is a psychometric instrument that evaluates word recall, ability to follow commands, constructional praxis, naming, ideational praxis, orientation, word recognition, memory, comprehension of spoken language, word-finding, and language ability, with a measure of delayed word recall and concentration/ distractibility. The total score of the 13-item scale ranges from 0 to 85, with an increase in score indicating cognitive worsening.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Total Score at Week 16 (Visit 5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI evaluates both frequency and severity of 12 neuropsychiatric disturbances including delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, motor disturbance, nighttime behaviors, as well as appetite/eating. The NPI total score (for 12 behavioral domains) is calculated as the product of frequency and severity for each domain, and ranges from 0 to 144. An increase in score indicates a worsening of symptoms.</description>

        <description>The NPI evaluates both frequency and severity of 12 neuropsychiatric disturbances including delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, motor disturbance, nighttime behaviors, as well as appetite/eating. The NPI total score (for 12 behavioral domains) is calculated as the product of frequency and severity for each domain, and ranges from 0 to 144. An increase in score indicates a worsening of symptoms.</description>

          <description>Proportion (%) of participants with QTcF Interval abnormalities meeting categorical criteria over the 12-week double blind treatment period. The QTcF interval is a measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the heart's electrical cycle, which is corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula.
Participants with a post-baseline QTcF absolute value of 450 - &lt;480, 480 - &lt;500, or &gt;=500 mec, or with a post-baseline QTcF increase of 30 - &lt;60 or &gt;=60 msec were counted.</description>

        <description>Participants in each category of the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) mapped from the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) responses were reported.
C-CASA Event Code: &lt;1&gt; Completed suicide; &lt;2&gt; Suicide attempt; &lt;3&gt; Preparatory acts towards imminent suicidal behavior; &lt;4&gt; Suicidal Ideation; &lt;7&gt; Self-injurious behavior, no suicidal intent.
The suicidality assessments were performed at Screening, Week 0 (Visit 1), Week 4 (Visit 2), Week 6, (Visit 3), Week 10 (Visit 4), Week 16 (Visit 5), and Week 18 (Visit 6).
Only participants falling any category of C-CASA events were listed below.</description>
