  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to obtain a better understanding of the biological
      response of red blood cells to sulforaphane contained in fresh broccoli sprouts that have
      been put through a blending process. This study will use commercially available fresh
      broccoli sprouts certified by Brassica Protection Products LLC (BroccoSprouts®). This product
      can also be purchased at some local grocery stores in the produce section. It is believed
      that NRF2, a transcription factor encoded by the NFE2L2 gene, plays a role in the regulation
      of defense against oxidative stress. The detrimental accelerated breakdown of sickle cell
      disease (SCD) red blood cells (SS RBC) is partially due to reduced anti-oxidative capacity.
      Previous analysis of SS RBC microRNAs revealed that a reduced level of NRF2, the master
      regulator of anti-oxidative stress capacity, contributes to reduced resistance to oxidative
      stress and increased hemolysis; NRF2 also induces fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which is known to
      prevent SS RBC sickling.

      First, erythroid progenitors from normal and SCD subjects will be tested ex-vivo to find out
      how sulforaphane, a natural NRF2 activator, affects the oxidative stress capacity, HbF
      expression, and microRNA expression of red cells.

      Second, a pilot clinical trial will be conducted to determine the safety and physiological
      effects of 3 weeks of daily consumption of broccoli sprout homogenate in a cohort of Hb
      SS/SB0 thalassemia adult SCD patients. During this study, subjects RBCs will be assayed for
      changes in anti-oxidative stress capacity and microRNA composition in mature SCD red blood
      cells.

    <description>Adult subjects with Hb SS/SB0 thalassemia will be recruited to participate in this part of the study. Subjects will be asked to consume broccoli sprout that have been blended into a milkshake-like substance daily for three consecutive weeks. Safety measures will include recording of vital signs and adverse signs and symptoms. Assessment of physiological effects will include measurement of blood chemistries, counts, LDH, and hemoglobin F level. Measurements of cellular effects will include changes in microRNA gene profiling, gene expression profiling, and quantitation of anti-oxidant capacity.</description>

    <description>In the in-vitro part of the study, sulphoraphane will be added into the culture media used to grow and differentiate the erythroid cells from blood samples obtained from three Hb AA volunteers and three Hb SS subjects. The subjects will have a single clinic visit for the blood donation.
In the second part of the study, enrolled subjects will be asked to consume homogenates of broccoli sprouts by mouth daily for three weeks. They will have a maximum of five clinic visits for medical assessments and lab draws during this time. They will then have a final clinic visit after a washout period of six weeks.</description>
