    <textblock>
      Sunitinib is an oral drug used for treatment of advanced kidney cancer. The standard dose is
      50mg, but many patients require a dose decrease due to side-effects. Drug levels of sunitinib
      vary approximately 10-fold between patients.

      This study will measure blood levels of sunitinib and its metabolite, and correlate these
      with side-effects and the response to the treatment. The study aims to establish whether
      blood levels change with time, and see how useful blood levels are for monitoring patients
      treated with sunitinib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Sunitinib is an oral multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for first-line
      systemic therapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. It is metabolised to a pharmacologically
      active metabolite, SU012662, which is of equal potency to the parent compound. At a standard
      50mg daily dose, variability in plasma levels between patients is approximately ten-fold. In
      clinical trials, over 30% of patients require a dose reduction due to toxicity. However, some
      patients can tolerate up to 100mg without excessive toxicity. It is unknown if sunitinib
      clearance changes with time. Pre-clinical experiments observed tyrosine kinase inhibition at
      a plasma concentration of 50-100ng/ml.

      Design: This is a prospective non-randomized, Phase II clinical study. Decision to treat
      patients with single-agent sunitinib is pre-determined by treating specialists before
      entering this study. Toxicity and trough sunitinib/metabolite levels will be measured every
      six weeks during treatment.

      Aim: This study will prospectively examine the relationship between steady-state trough
      levels of sunitinib/metabolites and the time on treatment, in addition to changes in trough
      levels over time. Trough levels will also be correlated with other measures of efficacy and
      treatment-related toxicity. Furthermore, we aim to confirm that the putative target of
      50ng/ml correlates with toxicity and time on sunitinib.

    <description>This duration extends from the date the patient starts sunitinib until the date sunitinib is abandoned.
