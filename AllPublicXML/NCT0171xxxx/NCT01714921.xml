    <measure>Determine the relative reduction of shock related episodes with Smart shock technology</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Effectiveness will be measured by the aim of Smart Shock algorithms: the reduction of shocks. Utilisation will be measured by the programming of Smart Shock algorithms and detection of tachycardia, the deviance from nominal parameters and the application of Smart Shock algorithms. To get impression of the necessarity for ICD therapy in these patients, the risk of ventricular and atrial arrhythmia will be examined in the patient population included in the study. To determine the effect of Smart Shock technology, the relative fraction of episodes which are not treated by shock delivery due to Smart Shock, will be measured. It is assumed, that a total 95% confidence interval of 10% is sufficient from a medical point of view.</description>
