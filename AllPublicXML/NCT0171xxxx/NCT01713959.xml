    <textblock>
      Single-center, randomized, split-body, pilot study, treatment of up to 23 subjects in two
      treatment groups. Subjects will receive two Ultherapy treatments at Day 0 with follow-ups at
      7 and 14 days post-treatment #1, and Day 28 with follow-ups are 7, 14, 30, 60, 90 days
      post-treatment #2.

      Subjects will be randomized to one of two study groups:

        -  Group A: Split body treatment. Ultherapy to one axilla, Sham treatment to the other
           axilla.

        -  Group B: Bilateral Ultherapy treatments, with a pre-treatment subcutaneous lidocaine
           injection administered to one axillary side.

      Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS), gravimetric test and starch iodine test will be
      obtained at all study visits. Patient satisfaction questionnaires will also be obtained at
      30, 60 and 90 days post-treatment #2.

    <description>The HDSS is a scale used for primary axillary/underarm hyperhidrosis patients. It provides a qualitative measure of the severity of their condition based on how it affects their daily activities. Patients select the statement that best reflects their experience with underarm sweating.</description>
