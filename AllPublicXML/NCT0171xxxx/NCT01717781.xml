      This prospective randomized pilot study is aimed to verify if the operative time of a LRH
      with pelvic lymphadenectomy for early stage cervical cancer (FIGO stages IA2-IB1-IIA&lt;2cm) and
      for advanced stage cervical cancer (FIGO stages IB2-IIA&gt;2cm-IIB) submitted to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy with complete clinical response could be reduced using Thunderbeat (an
      ultrasonic energy device that incises and coagulates by using ultrasonic and bipolar
      technology ) (Olympus Medical Systems Corp, Tokyo) vs. bipolar electrosurgery .

      Secondary endpoints of this comparison are incidence of intra- or postoperative
      complications, estimated blood loss, postoperative pain, days of hospitalization and costs
      for the health care system.

      Radical abdominal hysterectomy (RAH) with pelvic lymphadenectomy is the standard surgical
      treatment for early stage cervical carcinoma FIGO stages IA2-IB1-IIA&lt;2cm1. Since the early
      90's laparoscopic radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy (LRH) has been suggested
      as surgical approach for the treatment of cervical cancer. In the recent years, many
      institutions have begun to consider it an attractive technique and to study its feasibility
      and safety. Most of these studies have shown that LRH is relatively more time-consuming than
      standard laparotomy and ranges from 90 to 420 minutes according to surgeons' experience and
      different techniques adopted to achieve hemostasis, resect the parametrium and uterosacrals.
      Spirtos et al. demonstrated that staplers could reduce mean operation time from 253 to 205
      minutes if compared to argon beam coagulator. Moreover, the pulsed bipolar system was
      associated with significant reduction in operative time in comparison with the conventional
      bipolar system (mean, 172 minutes vs 229 minutes; P &lt; 0.001). The largest series of LRH
      reported from a single institution by Puntambekar et al included 248 patients and described
      the &quot;Pune technique&quot; (anterior and posterior peritoneal U cuts, early dissection of the
      rectovaginal space, fully mobilization of the uterus, resection of the cardinal and
      uterosacral ligaments with Ligasure system (Ligasure Vessel Sealing System; Valleylab, Tyco
      Healthcare, Boulder, CO)), obtaining a very short mean operative time (mean, 92 minutes;
      range 6-120 minutes).

      A recent review on laparoscopic and robot-assisted radical hysterectomy with pelvic
      lymphadenectomy including 17 studies reported a mean operating time of 202 minutes [range,
      184-221 minutes] in the group of LRH, which matches with our experience of 210 min (range
      180-240), using conventional bipolar electrosurgery.

      The aim of this pilot RCT is to verify if the operative time of a LRH with pelvic
      lymphadenectomy for early stage cervical cancer (FIGO stages IA2-IB1-IIA&lt;2cm) and for
      advanced stage cervical cancer (FIGO stages IB2-IIA&gt;2cm-IIB) submitted to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy (NACT) with complete clinical response could be further reduced using
      Thunderbeat (an ultrasonic energy device that incises and coagulates by using ultrasonic and
      bipolar technology ) (Olympus Medical Systems Corp, Tokyo) vs. bipolar electrosurgery .

      Saving operative time would mean shorter anesthesia and faster recovery, further improving
      the safety profile of the laparoscopic approach in the treatment of cervical cancer.

      Secondary endpoints of this comparison are incidence of intra- or postoperative complications
      (Cardiac, Respiratory, Neurological, Gastrointestinal, Renal, Fever, Wound or other
      Infection, Lymphocele), estimated blood loss, postoperative pain (evaluated by VAS), days of
      hospitalization and costs for the health care system.

    <description>Laparoscopic radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy are performed with Thunderbeat technology: using Thunderbeat technique, surgeons can avoid changing instruments during surgery since Thunderbeat combines bipolar energy for haemostasis and ultrasound for dissection and cut.
Thunderbeat is used to divide the round ligaments, to seal ovarian pedicles, to open the anterior and posteriors leaves of the broad ligaments peritoneum, to incise the bladder peritoneum, to develop the paravesical and pararectal spaces, to seal uterine arteries and uterine pedicles, to dissect the bladder and develop rectovaginal septum, to unroof the ureter, to cut parametria, and to divide the uterosacral ligaments. Monopolar hook is used in the culdotomy. Thunderbeat is also used to perform pelvic lymphadenectomy.</description>

    <description>Laparoscopic radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy are performed with standard bipolar electrosurgery.
A 10 mm port is inserted at the umbilicus for the telescope. Once pneumoperitoneum (12 mmHg) is achieved, intra-abdominal visualization will be obtained with a 0° high-definition telescope.
Two additional 5 mm ports are placed under direct visualization. One more 5-mm trocar is inserted in the right mid abdomen at the level of the umbilicus. The instruments used include bipolar grasper, monopolar scissors, monopolar hook, various graspers and a suction irrigation system.</description>
