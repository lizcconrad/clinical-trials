  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parents of children newly diagnosed with cancer experience depression and anxiety, especially
      in the first several months of treatment. Bright IDEAS, an 8-session problem-solving skills
      training (PSST) program has been used in studies with more than 900 mothers including more
      than 125 monolingual Spanish-speaking mothers. It has been shown to significantly decrease
      mothers' distress and to particularly benefit Latina immigrants. This past spring, the
      NCI/NIH designated Bright IDEAS as a Research-Tested Intervention Program and has included it
      in the National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices. To date, Bright IDEAS has
      been available to mothers at only a few cancer centers with specially trained personnel. This
      proposal is designed to bring Bright IDEAS on-line to make it available to mothers and
      fathers 24/7 anywhere with Internet access. The investigators will carefully analyze
      acceptability and use to gain insight into the most promising ways of disseminating
      interventions like Bright IDEAS using Internet, Internet II, and other emerging technologies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research and experience document that caregivers of children with cancer encounter
      extraordinary stresses during the child's illness. These stresses are particularly severe
      during diagnosis and early therapy and can interfere significantly with a caregiver's ability
      to make reasoned and timely decisions on their child's behalf. With increasing survivor
      rates, it has become evident that decisions made in the early stages of cancer management can
      have profound long-term effects, adding to the distress caregivers feel trying to make the
      &quot;right&quot; decisions. Too help mothers of newly diagnosed children cope more effectively with
      these challenges, the investigators conducted randomized controlled trials (R25CA65520,
      R01CA098954) to develop, field test, and evaluate the efficacy of the Bright IDEAS paradigm
      of problem-solving skills training (PSST), a cognitive-behavioral therapy shown to decrease
      anxiety and depression - two symptoms of post-traumatic stress commonly experienced among
      this group of mothers. Our findings clearly show that PSST significantly increases
      problem-solving skills (primary effect) and decreases negative affectivity (secondary effect)
      in mothers from a variety of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Particularly
      powerful and long-lasting effects were noted in Spanish-speaking mothers, an especially
      underserved population. In March 2010, the NCI designated Bright IDEAS as a Research-based
      Therapy/Intervention Program (RTIP) and entered it into the National Registry of
      Evidence-based Programs and Practices (NREPP). As an 8-session, in-person intervention,
      Bright IDEAS is labor intensive and, to date, has only been available at a few institutions
      with trained personnel. However, as a part of the RTIPs evaluation process, the Dissemination
      Capability of Bright IDEAS was rated 5/5. This proposal is designed to meet the challenge
      inherent in this perfect score. The investigators will also immediately broaden the scope of
      users by including fathers as eligible participants in this study of a new delivery paradigm
      the investigators believe they will find appealing. Aim 1 is implementation of an engaging,
      easy-to-use on-line version of Bright IDEAS that would be available 24/7 to any person
      anywhere who has access to the Internet. Aim 2 is the use of &quot;Diffusion of Innovations&quot;
      theory to craft a framework for disseminating not only Bright IDEAS but other similar
      interventions with the greatest effectiveness and efficiency. In past studies, the
      investigators have shown that the human element (time and attention) inherent in in-person
      interventions is effective in bringing immediate relief of distress but not sufficient to
      maintain its benefits over time. In contrast, mothers receiving PSST increase their skills
      and continue to improve their sense of well-being 3 months after the intervention. What the
      investigators have not investigated is whether a computer-based intervention is as effective
      as (not inferior to) an in-person intervention. The results will have significant
      implications for future dissemination strategies, especially the use of Internet II and other
      emerging technologies.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Subjects will be drawn from the pool of all parents who are primary
        caregivers of children diagnosed with any form of cancer 4-16 weeks prior to contact about
        the Problem Solving Skills Training intervention and cared for at one of the 4 data
        collection sites. No attempt will be made to stratify the sample by any particular
        demographic variables (e.g., age, ethnic background, or type of cancer diagnosed in their
        child), except that monolingual Spanish-speaking parents will be specifically recruited to
        provide adequate representation for statistical analysis at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles
        and UT/MD Anderson Cancer Center. Goal: 20% total enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria: Parents of children with cancer will be excluded if (1) they do not
        read or speak English or Spanish; (2) their child is in severe a medical crisis, as
        determined by the oncologist, or (3) they live a prohibitive distance to complete the
        intervention (typically, &gt;50 miles from the Center) and do not have access to a telephone
        for phone intervention sessions. Internet access will be facilitated as part of the e-PSST
        intervention arm. These exclusionary criteria are identical to our previous work; &lt;10% of
        eligible mothers have been excluded.
