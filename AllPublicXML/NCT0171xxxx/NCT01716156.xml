    <textblock>
      This study will compare two different durations of treatment with grazoprevir (MK-5172) in
      combination with ribavirin (RBV) in treatment-naïve non-cirrhotic interferon-eligible
      interleukin 28b CC (IL28B CC) genotype participants with genotype 1 (GT1)-positive chronic
      hepatitis C (CHC). Participants will be randomized to receive 12 or 24 weeks of combination
      therapy.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Sustained Virologic Response 12 Weeks After the End of All Study Therapy (SVR12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 36</time_frame>
    <description>SVR12 was defined as HCV RNA &lt;25 IU/mL 12 weeks after the end of all study therapy. HCV RNA was measured using the Roche COBAS™ Taqman™ HCV Test, v2.0® assay, which has a lower limit of quantification of 25 IU/mL and a limit of detection of 9.3 IU/mL.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Experiencing at Least One Adverse Event (AE) on Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Fourteen days following last dose of study drug (up to 26 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an adverse event. Data are presented according to actual treatment duration (12 weeks or 24 weeks) regardless of participants' initial arm assignment.</description>

    <measure>Time to Achievement of First Undetectable HCV RNA</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The mean time (in days) to first achievement of undetectable HCV RNA was assessed using Kaplan-Meier plot and summary statistics. HCV RNA levels in plasma were measured using the Roche COBAS™ Taqman™ HCV Test, v2.0® assay on blood samples drawn from each participant at Week 2, Week 4, Week 12, and at end of treatment. The assay has a lower limit of quantification of 25 IU/mL and a limit of detection of 9.3 IU/mL. Undetectable HCV RNA was defined as below the limit of detection of 9.3 IU/mL.</description>

        <description>An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor’s product, is also an adverse event. Data are presented according to actual treatment duration (12 weeks or 24 weeks) regardless of participants' initial arm assignment.</description>
