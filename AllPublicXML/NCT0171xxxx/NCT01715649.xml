  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Telehealth remote patient monitoring is a means of using communications technology - such as
      telephones, computers, and the Internet - to connect patients remotely with their healthcare
      team from their homes. The investigators hope to learn more about improving healthy behaviors
      and blood glucose among persons with diabetes using telehealth remote patient monitoring
      technology to connect directly with nurse care coordinators.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a process for improving blood glucose and healthy
      behaviors among people with type 2 diabetes using telehealth remote patient monitoring
      technology with nurse care coordinators. Some of the people in this study will work with a
      nurse care coordinator who will review your blood glucose weekly and call you at home every
      month for 3 months, while some of the people in this study will simply receive their normal
      care. At the end of the study, every participant will be asked questions about how they feel
      about their health care.

    <description>In the intervention arm you will test your blood glucose 2 times a day (before and after a meal, activity or other event) using the glucose meter provided to you for use in this study and connect it to the Telehealth Unit. Every week the study team will review your blood glucose levels through the remote patient monitoring secure portal and send you a reminder through the Telehealth Unit with suggestions based on your blood glucose patterns. Once every month a study nurse will call you to review your blood glucose goals and discuss how you may be able to make changes in your health behaviors to improve your blood glucose levels. The study team will work with you to help you make changes to your behaviors that may improve your blood glucose.</description>
