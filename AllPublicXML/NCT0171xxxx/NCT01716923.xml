    <textblock>
      The clinical study will assess the in-vitro characteristics of red blood cells (RBCs) per the
      European Union (EU) criteria for leukocyte depleted RBCs in additive solution and evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of S-303 treated RBCs in a patient population requiring RBC
      transfusion support for acute anemia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥18 years, of either gender.

          2. Must be willing to use an acceptable form of contraceptive while on study (as approved
             by the Investigator or designee)

          3. Must be readily available by telephone

          4. Must provide an informed consent for study participation and have signed an ethics
             committee (EC)-approved informed consent

          5. Must have a negative cross match to S 303 red blood cells (RBCs) at study entry

          6. Must have a blood type of either A+ or O+

          7. Patients must have a likelihood of receiving a transfusion as determined by the
             Investigator OR a Transfusion Risk Understanding Screening Tool (TRUST) Score of ≥3 at
             study entry

          8. Must be scheduled to receive one of the following operative procedures:

               -  Coronary artery bypass graft only, first procedure

               -  Valve repair or replacement only, first procedure

                  or replacement

        After consultation with the Medical Monitor, provision can be made to enroll patients who
        may meet these general criteria but whose surgical procedure is not precisely described in
        the above categories. Such patients will be classified as &quot;other&quot; with their explicit
        condition reported with other study data.

        Exclusion Criteria:

               -  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the 24 hours prior to surgery or anesthesia
                  induction

               -  Requiring an intra-aortic balloon pump or ventricular assist device

             pharmacologic agents or imaging materials, including dyes, investigational surgical
             techniques, or devices. Studies of nutrition, psychology, or socioeconomic issues are
             not grounds for exclusion

          8. Current diagnosis of either chronic or acute renal failure (requiring dialysis) or a
             serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.8 mg/dL within 30 days prior to the start
             of surgery

          9. Current diagnosis of either chronic or acute hepatic insufficiency or a total serum
             bilirubin greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL within 30 days prior to the start of
             surgery

         10. Pre-existing RBC antibody that may make the provision of compatible study red blood
             cell (RBC) components difficult

         11. Patients requiring plasma removal or irradiation of the RBC

         12. Patients with prior history of severe allergic transfusion reactions
