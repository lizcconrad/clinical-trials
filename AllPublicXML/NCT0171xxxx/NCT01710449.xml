  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open label study in 40-60 subjects with diagnosed lung airway disease and in 10-20 normal
      controls. Each subject will receive PFP as a contrast agent to visualize the airway and
      alveolar spaces in their lungs using magnetic resonance imaging of inert gas/oxygen mixtures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the utilization of conventional 'thermally' polarized
      perfluorinated gas mixed with oxygen as an exogenous inert contrast agent to image the airway
      spaces in normal and diseased human lungs. This is an open label proof of concept study
      expanding on work by other groups in animals and ex-vivo human lungs and on studies in human
      subjects with such gases. Projection images (2-dimensional) and 3D images will be obtained
      using 19F MRI coupled with spirometry breathing maneuvers to correlate spirometry variables
      (e.g. FEV1 and FEV1/FVC) with regional distribution of the gas.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Subjects with Lung and/or Airway Disease

        -Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment
        into the trial:

          1. Subjects must be ≥ 18 years of age;

          2. Evidence of lung disease or injury by medical history, physical exam, and/or clinical
             laboratories;

               1. COPD

               2. Asthma

               3. Cystic Fibrosis

               4. Emphysema/Other Small Airways Diseases

               5. Lung Transplant

          3. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial.

          4. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and other trial
             procedures.

               -  Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the trial:

          1. Unable to undergo a 3.0-Tesla MRI exam of the lungs and chest because of
             contraindications (e.g. metal in the eye, claustrophobia);

          2. Unable to receive gas mixture by breathing because of contraindications;

          3. Participation in a clinical trial with a study drug that may impact lung function in
             the past 14 days; or

          4. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with trial participation or may
             interfere with the interpretation of trial results and, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this trial.

             test on the day of the MR scan, prior to the MRI scan.

             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial.
