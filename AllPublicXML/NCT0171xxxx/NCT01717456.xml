  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In previous studies at a university referral center the investigators demonstrated that a
      multicomponent conservative treatment for fecal incontinence was effective. The treatment
      combines patient education with medical management of diarrhea and constipation plus
      behavioral training. The purpose of this study is to determine whether this treatment is
      effective when delivered by home health care nurses to frail elderly patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fecal incontinence (FI) affects 9% of U.S. adults and occurs weekly or more often in 2.7%.
      Prevalence increases with age reaching 15% by 70 years. FI has a devastating impact on
      quality of life and substantially increases caregiver burden when patients have comorbid
      conditions requiring caregiver assistance. The investigators propose an effectiveness trial
      whose overall goal is to determine whether a conservative intervention which has been shown
      to be effective in single-site studies will sustain its efficacy when disseminated to a home
      bound population by home health care nurses. The treatment includes patient education about
      the physiology of how continence is maintained, pelvic floor exercises, behavioral strategies
      for preventing FI, and use of fiber or nonprescription medication to treat diarrhea or
      constipation. To minimize drift when the treatment is disseminated to a large group of
      providers, patient education and other basic components of treatment are included in a
      printed training manual and are available to nurse providers on a website; however, nurse
      supervision to individualize treatment remains important. The study will be carried out in 8
      counties in central North Carolina which are served by the University of North Carolina Home
      Health Care and Rex Home Health Care agencies (partners in this study). Nurses in these
      agencies will be randomly assigned to two groups. For the first two years all patients of the
      nurses in one group will receive the active intervention while all patients of nurses in the
      other group will receive usual care plus a training manual and symptom monitoring to control
      for expectancy. After two years, all patients in these home health care agencies will receive
      the active intervention. After excluding patients with severe cognitive impairment and those
      with stomas, the investigators estimate 252 - 340 patients with FI who are over age 50 will
      receive treatment (at least 189 in active treatment and 63 controls). Specific aims are (1)
      to show that the active treatment is more effective than the control treatment for improving
      FI severity, patient quality of life, and caregiver burden, and that improvements are
      maintained for at least 6 months; (2) to identify moderators of treatment effectiveness
      (candidate variables are cognitive status, mobility impairment, willingness of family
      caregiver to assist with treatment, anxiety, depression, age, and race); and (3) to explore
      whether successful treatment of FI reduces the risk of nursing home referral.

    <measure>Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI) at End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Treatment (Week 6)</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of treatment, the FISI requires the patient to report the frequency of occurrence of 4 types of fecal incontinence (solid, liquid, mucus, and gas incontinence) in the past month. These four responses are multiplied by empirically derived patient weights and the values are added together. Range of scores is 0-61. Higher scores show more severe fecal incontinence.</description>

    <description>At follow up 6 months after the end of treatment, the subject reports the frequency of occurrence of 4 types of fecal incontinence (solid, liquid, mucus, and gas incontinence) in the past month. These four responses are multiplied by empirically derived patient weights and the values are added together. Range is 0-61. No data is available to interpret the scale as mild, moderate, or severe fecal incontinence.</description>

    <time_frame>End of Treatment (Week 6)</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of treatment, the subject is asked, &quot;Compared to before you started home health care, have you experienced adequate relief of your fecal incontinence symptoms? [Responses: yes or no]&quot;. A responder is anyone answering yes. A treatment would be judged successful if there was at least 10% more responders in the active compared to the control groups.</description>

    <description>At follow up 6 months after the end of treatment, the subject is asked, &quot;Compared to before you started home health care, have you experienced adequate relief of your fecal incontinence symptoms? [Responses: yes or no]&quot;. A responder to treatment is a subject who answers &quot;yes&quot;. When applied to group analysis, a treatment is regarded as effective if the responder rate is at least 10% greater in the active treatment arm compared to the control arm. This measure is not recorded at baseline because it is undefined until treatment has been provided.</description>

    <time_frame>End of Treatment (Week 6)</time_frame>
    <description>Validated questionnaire developed to assess the psychosocial and health burden experienced by a family caregiver of the identified patient. The 22-items ask about behaviors and feelings of caregivers on a 6-step ordinal scale (never to almost always). The scale is valid for caregivers of individuals with diverse chronic disabilities (dementia, advanced cancer, acquired brain injury). The scale has good internal consistency. Total scores range 0-66, and 21 or greater is interpreted as high burden (J Clin Epidemiol 2010;63:535-42). Subscales (role and personal strain) have been described but are unreliable so total scores were used.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Home Health Care (HHC) provided lists to the investigators of new patients who were screened by HHC using the OASIS Questionnaire. Research assistants identified eligible patients based on the OASIS questions and telephoned them to obtain verbal consent and to schedule a baseline assessment visit. Written consent was obtained at the baseline visit.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Baseline data collection and written consent was obtained at a home visit prior to referring the patient to HHC for randomization and initiation of treatment. Only 19/31 who gave consent to the research assistant were randomized. 3 others were judged ineligible by HHC, and 9 dropped out while awaiting treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI) at Baseline</title>
          <description>Subjects rated the frequency of 4 types of stool leakage (gas, mucus, liquid, and solid) over the prior month on a 6-stepscale. Possible responses were never, 1-3 times/ month, once/week, 2 or more times/week, once/day, and 2 or more times/day. Based on the average quality of life impact scores assigned by a reference group of 34 subjects with fecal incontinence, weights were assigned to each of these 4 responses and added together for a sum score. Range is 0-61. No guidance on what defines mild, moderate, or severe is available. Higher scores show more severe fecal incontinence.</description>

          <title>Manchester Health Questionnaire (MHQ) Severity Scale at Baseline</title>
          <description>The MHQ (Br J Obstetrics &amp; Gynecol 2001;108:1057-67) is a 32-item questionnaire that assesses the impact of anal incontinence on quality of life in women. Each item is answered on a 5-point ordinal scale. Eight of 9 subscales were used: incontinence impact, role, physical function, social function, personal function, emotional problems, sleep/energy, and severity. A total score was calculated by summing the subscales. The range of scores of each domain is 0-100, and higher scores indicate greater impairment. Means and SDs for a reference group of 154 FI patients were published.</description>

        <description>At follow up 6 months after the end of treatment, the subject reports the frequency of occurrence of 4 types of fecal incontinence (solid, liquid, mucus, and gas incontinence) in the past month. These four responses are multiplied by empirically derived patient weights and the values are added together. Range is 0-61. No data is available to interpret the scale as mild, moderate, or severe fecal incontinence.</description>

The scale is valid for caregivers of individuals with diverse chronic disabilities (dementia, advanced cancer, acquired brain injury). The scale has good internal consistency. Total scores range 0-66, and 21 or greater is interpreted as high burden (J Clin Epidemiol 2010;63:535-42). Subscales (role and personal strain) have been described but are unreliable so total scores were used.</description>
