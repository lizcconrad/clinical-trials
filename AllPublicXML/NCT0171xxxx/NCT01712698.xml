      Acute changes in axial diffusivity will correlate with the severity of injury in patients
      that suffer an acute spinal cord injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters will correlate with severity of spinal cord injury
      in SCI patients as seen in rodent models. We will test whether the quantitative decrease in
      axial (λ║) diffusivity (a biomarker of axonal injury), will predict long-term functional
      outcomes for patients with a SCI.

      Specific Aim: To examine patients after an acute SCI using DTI and to correlate the extent of
      acute decrease in λ║ with the presenting ASIA motor score and long-term functional outcome of
      the patient.
