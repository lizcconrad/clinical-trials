      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of supervised physical exercise on
      endothelial function and number of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in patients with
      systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as evaluate the effect of supervised physical exercise
      on endothelium derived growth factor (VEGF) levels, disease activity, quality of life,
      fatigue, perceived exertion and cardiopulmonary exercise test variables.

    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown that cardiovascular morbimortality is more frequent and early in
      SLE patients than in the general population and cardiovascular disease is an important cause
      of morbidity and mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Disturbances in
      endothelial function are implicated in its pathogenesis. Endothelial function also depends on
      endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) that enhance angiogenesis, promote vascular repair and
      have potential as a marker of cardiovascular disease. Systemic lupus erythematosus patients
      have endothelial dysfunction and fewer EPCs. There are studies showing improvement of
      endothelial function and EPCs after physical exercise program in individuals with heart
      failure, diabetes and coronary arterial disease, but there isn't studies evaluating
      endothelial function and EPCs after.

    <description>Patients were evaluated at baseline and after 16 weeks by high-resolution ultrasound of brachial artery in resting conditions, after reactive hyperaemia (flow-mediated dilation-FMD) and after oral glyceryl trinitrate to assess endothelial function; EPCs were evaluated by flow cytometry using anti-CD34 (cluster of differentiation 34) (FITC), anti-CD133 (PE) and anti-kinase domain receptor (KDR) (APC)</description>

    <description>Women with systemic lupus erythematosus with availability to perform physical exercise were allocated in exercise group (EG) to practice supervised physical exercise for one hour, three times a week for 16 weeks. Those who were not available for this activity were allocated in the control group (CG). Intervention consisted of walking at speed of the ventilatory threshold-1 heart rate obtained from cardiopulmonary exercise test and monitored by frequency meter.</description>
