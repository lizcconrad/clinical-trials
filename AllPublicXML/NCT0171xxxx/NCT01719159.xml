      This is a is a small scale open phase two interventional study to assess long-term
      stabilising effects of on neurological symptoms by regular intrathecal administered
      monoclonal antibodies in progressive multiple sclerosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is presently no efficient therapy available in progressive MS, especially if there is
      no clear evidence of active inflammatory lesions or exacerbations as part of the disease.
      There are, however, evidence that some treatment protocols using cytotoxic drugs may to some
      extent slow down the progressive course. One specific feature of long-standing MS is that
      inflammatory cells accumulate in the central nervous system(CNS) compartment in the
      subarachnoid and perivascular spaces and may therefore be hard to reach via standard drug
      delivery through systemic administration. Administration of substances via the Intrathecal
      (IT) route, however, have shown to efficiently distribute in the subarachnoid spaces and may
      therefore be an attractive route of drug delivery
