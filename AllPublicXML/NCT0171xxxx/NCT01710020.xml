    <textblock>
      There were 2 study periods in this study. In the Period 1, CP-690,550 was to be administered
      approximately 1 to 2 hours following hemodialysis. If significant non-renal clearance of the
      drug occurred such that dialyzability of CP-690,550 could not be assessed in Period 1, a
      second period (Period 2) will be conducted. In Period 2, a single dose of drug will be
      administered approximately 4 hours prior to hemodialysis.

    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood. It was calculated by dividing given dose of drug with AUC.</description>

        <description>Dialyser clearance was calculated as amount of drug in dialysate collected over a period of time (AHD) divided by the product of fraction unbound of drug in plasma (fu), corresponding mid-time plasma concentration of drug (Cmid), and duration of dialysate collection period (tm).
