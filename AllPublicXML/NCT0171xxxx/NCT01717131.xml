  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data from cohorts, prospective studies and one randomized trial (ASCOG Z0011) support the
      hypothesis that omission of additional axillary dissection in case of positive sentinel node
      has a limited impact on overall survival and relapse free survival. However, these data are
      not sufficient enough to recommend, as a standard of care, to avoid axillary dissection in
      case of positive sentinel node. The ASCOG Z0011 trial has been closed before the end of
      inclusions and the predefined non inferiority margin was found to be too large (5% difference
      at 5 years for primary endpoint).

      Prospective randomized trial is then urgently mandatory before omission of axillary node
      dissection becomes a usual practice without a sufficient scientific level of proof. Indeed,
      in several reviews, the rate of omission of axillary node dissection in case of
      micrometastasis increased (Bilimoria) despite any strong proof has been demonstrated.

      The omission of axillary node dissection in case of positive sentinel node may have strong
      practical impacts on patients but also on medical and economical aspects: in avoiding a
      prolonged hospitalisation, secondary morbidities due to axillary dissection requiring
      secondary care and their costs, as well as costs for secondary axillary dissection (14 to 25%
      in case of positive sentinel node) and finally shortening surgery duration.

      The main investigator propose a Non Inferiority Randomized Multicenter Phase III Trial of
      Axillary Node Dissection Versus no Axillary Node Dissection in Case of Positive Sentinel
      Lymph Node in Invasive Breast Cancer
