  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safe and tolerable dose level of
      OPB-111077 for patients with advanced cancer.

      The secondary objective of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of
      OPB-111077; the pharmacodynamic effects of OPB-111077; the antitumor activity of OPB-111077
      as assessed by RECIST or IMWG Uniform Response Criteria; and to explore whether PET responses
      correlate with other measures of clinical response.
