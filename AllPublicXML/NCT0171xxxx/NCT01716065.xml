  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the type of anesthesia during breast cancer
      surgery has any impact on the way a patient's immune system functions for a brief period
      after surgery. If the investigators find that one type of anesthesia versus the other is more
      beneficial to a patient's immune system, then the investigators may use this information to
      design a larger study to exam the effect of anesthesia better.

      There are two different types of anesthesia that the investigators can use for subjects
      undergoing breast surgery. The first type is called &quot;general anesthesia&quot; (GA) which is when a
      person &quot;goes to sleep&quot; with a breathing tube and then receives intravenous (IV) pain medicine
      during and after surgery to minimize surgical pain. The other type of anesthesia is called
      &quot;regional anesthesia&quot; (RA), or &quot;nerve blocks&quot; which numb up the nerves that supply the breast
      area. By doing this type of anesthesia, subjects often don't go &quot;to sleep&quot; with a breathing
      tube, instead, they get heavy IV sedation and take a &quot;deep nap&quot; during the surgery.

      Samples collected for CTC analysis (2 tubes of 8ml of blood) will be drawn at 4 time points:
      pre-operative (at least 24 hours before surgery), immediate prior to surgery, 12-24 hours
      post-operative, and 5-7 days post-operative.

        We will enroll female and male military health care beneficiaries between the ages 18-85
        years old presenting with the diagnosis of primary non-metastatic breast cancer, American
        Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stages I, II or III, undergoing surgery with curative
        intent

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects should be over 18 years of age and capable of providing
             informed consent indicating awareness of the investigational nature of this trial, in
             keeping with institutional policy

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained from each subject prior to entering the
             study

          -  Subjects with primary non-metastatic AJCC stages I, II or III, scheduled to undergo
             either unilateral mastectomy with or without Sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary
             dissection, or unilateral lumpectomy with Sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph
             node dissection

          -  Able to stay overnight in the hospital post surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any subject younger than 18 years or older than 85 years of age

          -  History of previous breast surgery (aside from biopsy), planned breast conserving
             operation (isolated lumpectomy) or reconstruction (rectus or latissimus flap)

             contraindication to having regional anesthesia

             the period of venous blood sampling

          -  Subjects who are pregnant. Exclusion of the possibility of pregnancy by testing (urine
             HCG) or by history (tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or menopause) is required prior to
             inclusion in the study
