      The present study is a randomized open-label -phase III study that aims to compare the
      efficacy and safety of the adjuvant chemotherapy with simultaneous or sequential application
      of Zoladex up to 2-3 years for ≤ 45 year old premenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast
      cancer.

      Data showed that ovarian suppression therapy may protect the ovarian function in
      premenopausal patients received chemotherapy for breast cancer. However this is still a
      controversial issue. Sequential use of GnRHa (Zoladex) as ovarian suppression treatment after
      chemotherapy has been established as an effective endocrine therapy for ER positive
      premenopausal breast cancer. The present study is a randomized open-label phase III study
      that aims to observe the efficacy and safety of the adjuvant chemotherapy with simultaneous
      combination of Zoladex up to 2-3years and chemotherapy compared with the sequential schedule
      in ≤ 45 year old premenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients.
