    <time_frame>Measured at Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples for adalimumab analysis were collected by venipuncture and serum concentrations of adalimumab were determined using a validated enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) method.</description>

    <measure>Mean Disease Activity Scores (DAS28) at Weeks 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Disease Activity Score (DAS28) is a validated index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, C-reactive protein, and general health are included in the DAS28 score. Scores on the DAS28 range from 0 to 10. A DAS28 score &gt;5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score &lt;3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score &lt;2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

    <measure>Mean Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ-DI) Scores at Weeks 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a patient-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) defined for the HAQ-DI is ≥0.22. HAQ remission indicating normal physical function is defined by HAQ-DI &lt; 0.5.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Short Form-36 (SF-36) Physical Component Summary Scores and Mental Component Summary Scores at Weeks 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form 36 (SF-36) determines participants' overall quality of life by assessing 1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual role because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality; 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems; 7) limitations in usual role due to emotional problems; and 8) general mental health. Items 1-4 primarily contribute to the physical component summary score (PCS) of the SF-36. Items 5-8 primarily contribute to the mental component summary score (MCS) of the SF-36. Scores on each item are summed and averaged (range = 0 (maximum disability) - 100 (no disability). The standard recall period is four weeks.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of informed consent to 70 days following the last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. See the Reported Adverse Events Section for more details.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Injection Site Pain on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after injections on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) consisted of a horizontal 100 mm line, with 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; and 100 representing &quot;worst possible pain&quot;. Participants placed a mark on the line representing their current level of pain immediately after injections on Day 1 of the study.</description>

        <description>The Disease Activity Score (DAS28) is a validated index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, C-reactive protein, and general health are included in the DAS28 score. Scores on the DAS28 range from 0 to 10. A DAS28 score &gt;5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score &lt;3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score &lt;2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

≥ 50% improvement in at least 3 of the 5 following parameters:
Physician global assessment of disease activity

        <title>Mean Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ-DI) Scores at Weeks 12 and 24</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a patient-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) defined for the HAQ-DI is ≥0.22. HAQ remission indicating normal physical function is defined by HAQ-DI &lt; 0.5.</description>

        <description>The Short Form 36 (SF-36) determines participants' overall quality of life by assessing 1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual role because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality; 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems; 7) limitations in usual role due to emotional problems; and 8) general mental health. Items 1-4 primarily contribute to the physical component summary score (PCS) of the SF-36. Items 5-8 primarily contribute to the mental component summary score (MCS) of the SF-36. Scores on each item are summed and averaged (range = 0 (maximum disability) - 100 (no disability). The standard recall period is four weeks.</description>
