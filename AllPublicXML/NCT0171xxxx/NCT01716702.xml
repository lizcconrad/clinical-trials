  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer for men. When treated early
      enough it is typically curable. However, common treatments, such as radical prostatectomy and
      radiation therapy, often result in significant negative outcomes with regard to sexual,
      psychological and social function. Both men and partners have identified the need for more
      information and support to address sexual health concerns after treatment. However, very few
      sexual rehabilitation interventions have been developed and rigorously assessed.

      Purpose: The investigators propose to develop and pilot test a new program to meet the sexual
      health needs of men with PCa and their partners using an online, professionally facilitated
      education/support program. The goals of the program are to improve sexual function, intimacy
      and mood for men and their partners after treatment for localized PCa. The program will be
      offered through Cancer Chat Canada, an existing and well-tested Canadian platform for
      professionally facilitated support group programs.

      What Participants Can Expect: A total of 24 men and their female partners (48 individuals)
      will be recruited and assigned to one of two groups. The first group will participate in the
      program immediately; the second group will be offered the program after a 5-month delay. The
      decision about which group will start immediately and which later will be made randomly (by
      chance). Both groups of men and partners will be asked to complete questionnaires three times
      and, at the end of the program, to provide the researchers feedback about how satisfied they
      were with the program, the changes they made, things they learned as a result of the program,
      and suggestions for improving the program. Participants must have access to a computer, an
      Internet connection and be willing to attend online, chat room meetings each week for 1.5
      hours for 6 weeks.

      Implications: Sexual rehabilitation is a high need for men affected by PCa, but is difficult
      to access. The investigators hope to improve access to sexual health care through this study.
