    <textblock>
      The current study will test the causal relationship between elevated levels of cortisol and
      the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) as these factors influence sensitivity to
      environmental threat. The investigators predict that carriers of the short allele of the
      serotonin transporter gene who have elevated cortisol levels will be most sensitive to
      threatening environments, whereas carriers of the long allele who do not have elevated
      cortisol (placebo subjects) will be least sensitive.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression vulnerability has been linked to certain variants of the serotonin transporter
      gene. Research indicates that a polymorphism of the serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) gene
      appears to moderate the association between life stress and depression onset. Life stress
      robustly predicts depression onset for individuals with two short 5-HTTLPR alleles.
      Individuals homozygous for the short 5-HTTLPR allele thus appear to be more sensitive to the
      effect of life stress, which in turn contributes to depression onset. A recent study showed
      that short allele carriers presented with a threat (social or other threats) who also had
      high levels of testosterone had elevated cortisol after exposure to the threat. There is
      neurobiological evidence that short allele status, elevated testosterone levels, and elevated
      cortisol levels are all linked to amygdala hyper-reactivity to the same classes of
      environmental threats. Thus, this study will test, for the first time, a potential
      interaction between 5-HTTLPR status and experimentally manipulated cortisol levels as risk
      factors for downstream mood and/or anxiety disorders by examining potential dysregulated
      stress responses among short allele carriers who have elevated cortisol levels.
