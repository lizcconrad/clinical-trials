  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A clinical study to investigate the safety of mavrilimumab, an antibody being developed for
      the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, an inflammatory condition that
      affects the joints.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the therapeutic improvements with recent biologic agents approved for rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA), there is still a significant unmet medical need for the treatment of subjects
      with this chronic disease to achieve a faster, more complete response, and higher rates of
      remission. This study is an open-label extension study for subjects who have participated in
      one of the qualifying development program studies with mavrilimumab. Participation in this
      study will allow these subjects to continue to receive long-term treatment with mavrilimumab.
      The data from this study will provide an evaluation of the long-term safety of mavrilimumab
      in adult subjects with RA. In addition, long-term exploratory efficacy outcomes such as joint
      damage and disability will be evaluated.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received investigational product. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. TEAEs were defined as AEs with onset date after the first dose of mavrilimumab 100 mg.</description>

    <time_frame>From the start of study drug administration in the study up to 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug (approximately up to 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The 12-lead ECG data were summarized and evaluated. TEAEs related to abnormal ECG findings were recorded and reported. TEAEs were defined as AEs with onset date after the first dose of mavrilimumab 100 mg.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Outside Threshold Values</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 24 to Week 130 at specified time points</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function testing was performed by spirometry to assess forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). FEV1 was the maximal volume of air exhaled in the first second of a forced expiration from a position of full inspiration.The percentage (%) of predicted values of these pulmonary function tests were calculated based on decrease from baseline and categorized as less than or equal to (=&lt;)15% reduction from baseline, greater than (&gt;)15% to =&lt;20% reduction from baseline, &gt;20% reduction from baseline and &gt;20% reduction to &lt;80%. The threshold values refer to baseline values for each participant.</description>

    <time_frame>From Week 24 to Week 130 at specified time points</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function testing was performed by spirometry to assess forced expiratory volume in 6 seconds (FEV6). FEV6 was the maximal volume of air exhaled in the six second of a forced expiration from a position of full inspiration. The percentage of predicted values of these pulmonary function tests were calculated based on decrease from baseline and categorized as =&lt;15% reduction from baseline, &gt;15% to =&lt;20% reduction from baseline, &gt;20% reduction from baseline and &gt;20% reduction to &lt;80%.

    <description>Pulmonary function testing was performed by spirometry to assess forced vital capacity (FVC). FVC was the volume of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. The percentage of predicted values of these pulmonary function tests were calculated based on decrease from baseline and categorized as =&lt;15% reduction from baseline, &gt;15% to =&lt;20% reduction from baseline, &gt;20% reduction from baseline and &gt;20% reduction to &lt;80%. The threshold values refer to baseline values for each participant.</description>

    <time_frame>From Week 0 to Week 132 at specified time points</time_frame>
    <description>Borg dyspnea score was a validated participant reported outcome assessing participant's perceived difficulty in breathing (dyspnea). The score ranges from 0 (nothing at all) to 10 (maximal difficulty). Higher scores indicated greater difficulty in breathing.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Forced Expiratory Volume in 6 Seconds (FEV6) Outside Threshold Values</title>
        <description>Pulmonary function testing was performed by spirometry to assess forced expiratory volume in 6 seconds (FEV6). FEV6 was the maximal volume of air exhaled in the six second of a forced expiration from a position of full inspiration. The percentage of predicted values of these pulmonary function tests were calculated based on decrease from baseline and categorized as =&lt;15% reduction from baseline, &gt;15% to =&lt;20% reduction from baseline, &gt;20% reduction from baseline and &gt;20% reduction to &lt;80%. The threshold values refer to baseline values for each participant.</description>

        <population>The As-treated Population included participants who received at least one dose of mavrilimumab 100 mg Q2W. Here 'n' represents those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points.</population>

          <title>Number of Participants With Forced Expiratory Volume in 6 Seconds (FEV6) Outside Threshold Values</title>
          <description>Pulmonary function testing was performed by spirometry to assess forced expiratory volume in 6 seconds (FEV6). FEV6 was the maximal volume of air exhaled in the six second of a forced expiration from a position of full inspiration. The percentage of predicted values of these pulmonary function tests were calculated based on decrease from baseline and categorized as =&lt;15% reduction from baseline, &gt;15% to =&lt;20% reduction from baseline, &gt;20% reduction from baseline and &gt;20% reduction to &lt;80%. The threshold values refer to baseline values for each participant.</description>
          <population>The As-treated Population included participants who received at least one dose of mavrilimumab 100 mg Q2W. Here 'n' represents those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) Outside Threshold Values</title>
        <description>Pulmonary function testing was performed by spirometry to assess forced vital capacity (FVC). FVC was the volume of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. The percentage of predicted values of these pulmonary function tests were calculated based on decrease from baseline and categorized as =&lt;15% reduction from baseline, &gt;15% to =&lt;20% reduction from baseline, &gt;20% reduction from baseline and &gt;20% reduction to &lt;80%. The threshold values refer to baseline values for each participant.</description>
