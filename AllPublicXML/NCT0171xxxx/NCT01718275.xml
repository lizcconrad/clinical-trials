      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of non-operative management of
      early appendicitis in children. We hypothesize that non-operative management of early
      appendicitis in children with antibiotics alone will be successful in 80% of children at 1
      year follow-up.

    <textblock>
      Non-operative management of appendicitis with antibiotics alone has recently emerged as a
      viable treatment alternative to appendectomy. There have been several clinical trials in
      adults which conclude that antibiotics alone are a safe initial treatment for appendicitis;
      none of these studies included children.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine: conversion to surgery (failure of
      nonoperative management), 30 day, 6 month and 1 year recurrence rate of appendicitis in
      children treated with non-operative management. Recurrence is defined as need for
      appendectomy. The secondary objective is to compare adverse outcomes, length of stay, days to
      return to school, costs of care and quality of life measures between the study group and
      those that receive standard of care.We hypothesize that non-operative management of early
      appendicitis in children with antibiotics alone will be successful in 80% of children at 1
      year follow-up.

      This is a prospective, non-randomized single-site trial measuring the feasibility of treating
      children (7-17 years old) with early appendicitis with antibiotics only (non-operative
      management). There will be two cohorts; those who agree to receive non-operative management
      (Non-Operative Group) and those that permit us to track their standard treatment course
      (Surgery Group).
