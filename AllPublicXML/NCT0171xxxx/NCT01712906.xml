  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mumps is an acute infectious respiratory disease caused by the mumps virus (MuV), which
      occurs mainly in children and adolescents. Its main clinical symptoms were parotid gland
      suppurative swelling and pain with fever. The pathological changes and harm caused by mumps
      was not only confined to the parotid gland, on the contrary, the social harm caused by
      serious complications cannot be ignored. As mumps is a vaccine-preventable infectious
      disease, vaccination is a fundamental strategy for controlling mumps. So far, there are 13
      genotypes of MuV. Based on the analysis of molecular epidemiology, the main epidemic strain
      of MuV in China was the F genotype. The commonly used vaccine strains represented only a
      small number of known genotypes, e.g. Jeryl-Lynn (JL) and Rubini strains, which belong to
      type A, Urabe strain belongs to type B, and L-Zagreb strains belongs to type D. Virus seed of
      Live Attenuated Mumps Vaccine (Human diploid cell) developed by the institute was SP-A
      strain, which was the first separation and preparation of the attenuated mumps viruses in
      China. SP-A belongs to F genotype, which was the domestic epidemic genotype. In addition, the
      cell substrate prepared for vaccine was human diploid cell (KMB-17 strain), which is much
      safer to use. The preliminary test results showed that the vaccine possessed good
      immunogenicity and good antigenic cross-reactivity. The application of this vaccine will
      provide more effective means to prevent and control of mumps epidemic.
