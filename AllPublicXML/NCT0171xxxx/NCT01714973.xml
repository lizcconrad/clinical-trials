      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ACCS in treating
      radiation burns of the skin in patients undergoing treatments for breast cancer and to
      compare ACCS treated burns with those treated with saline placebo controls.

    <description>Cosmesis will be evaluated by photography and investigator assessment using the cosmesis form in National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) Protocol B-39, A Randomized Phase III Study of Conventional Whole Breast Irradiation Versus Partial Breast Irradiation for Women with Stage 0, I, or II Breast Cancer. The following factors will be evaluated in the skin: telangiectasia, atrophy, scarring, pigmentation, erythema, fat necrosis, and fibrosis.</description>

    <description>There will be 3 treatment cohorts of 10 patients each. The area of the breast will be divided into two, roughly equal parts, medial and lateral. The patient will be randomized before the first treatment to receive ACCS and saline, one to the medial segment and the other to the lateral segment. The randomization scheme will be equal in each of three cohorts. The first cohort will receive ACCS and saline beginning with the first radiation treatment, the second cohort will receive ACCS and saline beginning with the onset of erythema from the breast irradiation, the third cohort will receive ACCS and saline beginning with the onset of skin ulceration from the breast irradiation.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive ACCS spray, to half the breast and saline to the other half (blinded) after each of ten consecutive radiation therapy treatments. ACCS and saline will be sprayed onto the breast to deliver 0.01 ml/cm2.</description>
