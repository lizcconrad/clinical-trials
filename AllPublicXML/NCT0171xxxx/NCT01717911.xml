  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have found that a 6-month course of insulin therapy after a short-term intensive insulin
      therapy could shorten the period of hyperglycemia to preserve ß-cell function and further
      improve long-term glycemic control in recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes with severe
      hyperglycemia (&gt;300 mg/dl, with HBA1C level around 9-11%) in our previous study. We thus
      hypothesized that a 6-month course of basal insulin therapy could also help to preserve
      ß-cell function in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with moderate hyperglycemia (200-300
      mg/dl). This prospective study is outpatient-based to evaluate whether 6-month basal insulin
      therapy versus oral anti-diabetic treatment (Metformin and sitagliptin) soon after the
      diagnosis of type 2 diabetes with moderate hyperglycemia (200-300 mg/dl) is associated with
      better ß-cell function reservation. We skip a short-term intensive admission course of
      insulin therapy as our previous study in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with severe
      hyperglycemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ß-Cell dysfunction and decreased insulin sensitivity are the main pathophysiological defects
      responsible for the development of hyperglycemia. There is a progressive deterioration in
      ß-cell function and mass in type 2 diabetics. Optimal metabolic control, especially early
      intensive glycemic control, plays a role in the prevention of progressive ß-cell dysfunction
      and possibly destruction of the ß-cells with worsening of diabetes.

      We have found that a 6-month course of insulin therapy after a short-term intensive insulin
      therapy could shorten the period of hyperglycemia to preserve ß-cell function and further
      improve long-term glycemic control in recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes with severe
      hyperglycemia (&gt;300 mg/dl, with HBA1C level around 9-11%) in our previous study. We thus
      hypothesized that a 6-month course of basal insulin therapy could also help to preserve
      ß-cell function in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with moderate hyperglycemia (200-300
      mg/dl). This prospective study is outpatient-based to evaluate whether 6-month basal insulin
      therapy versus oral anti-diabetic treatment (Metformin and sitagliptin) soon after the
      diagnosis of type 2 diabetes with moderate hyperglycemia (200-300 mg/dl) is associated with
      better ß-cell function reservation. We skip a short-term intensive admission course of
      insulin therapy as our previous study in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with severe
      hyperglycemia.

      This study also can assess what readily available parameter would predict which patients will
      achieve long-term successful glycemic control after correction of glucose toxicity.

      Our results will provide evidence that a 6-month course of basal insulin therapy could
      shorten the exposure to moderate hyperglycemia and further improve beta-cell function to
      achieve long-term glycemic control.
