  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic gall
      stones. For pain relief following laparoscopic cholecystectomy both intraperitoneal and
      intravenous administration of lignocaine has been used. But it is not clear from the existing
      literature which form of administration is more effective for pain relief. Hence this study
      has been undertaken with the following hypothesis : Intravenous lignocaine is superior to
      intraperitoneal lignocaine for postoperative pain relief and minimizing the stress response
      in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic gall
      stones. For pain relief following laparoscopic cholecystectomy both intraperitoneal and
      intravenous administration of lignocaine has been used. But it is not clear from the existing
      literature which form of administration is more effective for pain relief. Hence this study
      has been undertaken with the following hypothesis : Intravenous lignocaine is superior to
      intraperitoneal lignocaine for postoperative pain relief and minimizing the stress response
      in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      In this study the effect of intraperitoneal and intravenous lignocaine will be assessed based
      on the postoperative pain scores, total analgesic requirement, stress response in the form of
      total leukocyte count, c-reactive protein levels,return of bowel activity.

    <measure>Post operative pain relief</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Post operative pain relief will be assessed by visual analogue scale with values between 0 and 10. 0 denotes no pain and 10 denotes worst pain. the patient uses this scale to represent his/her pain at 1 hour postoperatively.</description>

    <measure>Postoperative Analgesic Requirement</measure>
    <time_frame>First 24 hours in the postoperative period</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will get analgesia through patient controlled analgesia pump (PCA). This pump delivers Morphine for pain relief. This will be delivered at 1 mg/ml bolus dose with a lock out period of 15 minutes without any background infusion of the drug. The total requirement over a period of 24 hours will be noted. Also the time taken for the patient to take the first analgesic dose will be recorded. The total demands and the number of good demands in the PCA pump will also be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Respiratory Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperatively and 48 hours Postoperatively</time_frame>

    <measure>Return of bowel activity</measure>
