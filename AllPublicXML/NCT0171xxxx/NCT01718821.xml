  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is one of the most common symptoms associated with cancer. The approach to pain
      management compresses routine pain assessments, utilizes both pharmacologic and
      nonpharmacologic interventions, and requires ongoing reevaluation of the patient. Cancer pain
      can be well controlled in the vast majority of patients if the algorithms of pain control are
      systematically applied, carefully monitored, and tailored to the needs of the individual
      patient.This study is aimed to assess the current pain managements in upper gastrointestinal
      cancer patients in Taiwan. The effects of neuropathic pain and depression on the enrolled
      patients would also be assessed.
