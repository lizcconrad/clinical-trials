    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of multiple doses of isavuconazole on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) after single dose administration. Safety
      and tolerability of isavuconazole will be assessed alone and in combination with MMF.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a body weight of at least 45 kg and has a body mass index (BMI) of 18
             to 32 kg/m2, inclusive.

             possible or probable cardiac causes).

          -  The subject has a history of tuberculosis or exposure to anyone known or suspected to
             have tuberculosis or any illness that might confound the results of the study or pose
             additional risk in administering study drug to the subject.

          -  The subject has a positive result for hepatitis C antibodies, hepatitis B surface
             antigen, or QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test at Screening or is known to be positive for
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  The subject has a known or suspected allergy to any of the components of the trial
             products including mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or the azole class of compounds, or a
             history of multiple and/or severe allergies to drugs or foods, or a history of severe
             anaphylactic reactions.

          -  The subject is a smoker (any use of tobacco or nicotine containing products) within 6
             months prior to Screening.

          -  The subject has had treatment with prescription drugs or complementary and alternative
             medicines within 14 days prior to Day -1, or over-the-counter medications within 1
             week prior to Day -1, with the exception of acetaminophen up to 2 g/day.

          -  The subject has a recent history (within the last 2 years) of drug or alcohol abuse,
             as defined by the investigator, or a positive drug and/or alcohol screen
