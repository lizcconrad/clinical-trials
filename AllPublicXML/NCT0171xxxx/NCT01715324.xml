  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) cycle super ovulating drugs (gonadotropins) are usually
      taken to stimulate the ovaries to produce more than one egg. In Vitro Fertilization protocols
      are constantly under review in order to improve the recruitment of the follicles, which
      contain the eggs, whilst minimizing the doses of gonadotrophins required, with the ultimate
      aim of increasing the live birth rate.

      The addition of growth hormone, which is a biological hormone that can be synthetically
      produced, as a supplement to gonadotrophins in an In Vitro Fertilization cycle has been
      suggested as a way in which In Vitro Fertilization pregnancy rates may be increased.Growth
      hormone has been shown, in animal and human studies, to be important in the recruitment of
      follicles.However, to date, only a limited number of clinical studies have been performed in
      order to assess whether the addition of growth hormone can improve the probability of
      pregnancy in women undergoing ovarian stimulation for In Vitro Fertilization. As the total
      number of patients analysed in these studies was small it has not been possible to determine
      whether if there is any improvement the outcome of an In Vitro Fertilization cycle when a
      woman is given growth hormone therapy as a supplement during her treatment.

      This goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness of using growth hormone therapy as
      a supplement to the administration of gonadotropins in an antagonist In Vitro Fertilization
      protocol.
