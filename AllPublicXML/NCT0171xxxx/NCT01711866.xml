      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of switching subjects with
      advanced Parkinson's Disease (PD) from Pramipexole or Ropinirole to Rotigotine and to assess
      the effects of Rotigotine on motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease in subjects
      switched from previous treatment with either Pramipexole or Ropinirole.

    <description>The CGI Item 4 was used to assess side effects. It ranges from 0 to 4 as follows:
0 = Side effects not assessable
1 = No side effects
2 = Side effects do not significantly interfere with subject's functioning
3 = Side effects significantly interfere with the subject's functioning
4 = Side effects outweigh therapeutic efficacy.</description>

    <description>The PGIC is a 7-point categorical rating scale in which the subject rates the changes in functioning over time as follows:
1 = Very much improved
2 = Much improved
3 = Minimally improved
4 = No change
5 = Minimally worse
6 = Much worse
7 = Very much worse.</description>

Subjects on lower doses switch from Pramipexole or Ropinirole to equivalence doses of Rotigotine on Day 1 of the 28 days Treatment Period. On Day 8 (Visit 3) the dose will be evaluated and potentially adjusted up to a maximum dose of 8 mg / 24 hours.
Subjects on higher doses switch from the equivalent dose to 8 mg / 24 hours Rotigotine of Pramipexole or Ropinirole to 8 mg / 24 hours Rotigotine on Day 1 and the remainder of the dose of Pramipexole or Ropinirole is to be switched on Day 8 of the 28 days Treatment Period. On Day 15 (Visit 4) the dose will be evaluated and potentially adjusted up to a maximum dose of 16 mg / 24 hours.</description>

Subjects on lower doses switch from Pramipexole or Ropinirole to equivalence doses of Rotigotine on Day 1 of the 28 days Treatment Period. On Day 8 (Visit 3) the dose will be evaluated and potentially adjusted up to a maximum dose of 8 mg / 24 hours.
