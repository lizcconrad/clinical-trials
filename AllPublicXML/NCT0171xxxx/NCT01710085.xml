  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial and cervical cancers are one of the most common malignancies seen in females.
      Identification of recurrent disease in early phases of treatment carries a primary importance
      on the outcome of patients. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is a new
      technique recently started to be performed in body imaging and has potential ability to
      detect recurrent disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic impact of
      DWI in detection of recurrent disease in patients treated with curative surgery in
      endometrial and cervical cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial and cervical cancers are one of the most common malignancies seen in female
      genital tract. Although, surgical resection is the treatment of choice for both, adjuvant or
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy and curative radiotherapy are alternative treatment
      options depending on the stage.

      Identification of recurrent disease in early phases carries a primary importance on the
      prognosis.

      Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI), a new technique recently started to be performed in body
      imaging has potential ability to distinguish recurrent disease from normal tissue or
      fibrosis. Our aim in this study is to investigate the diagnostic impact of DWI in detection
      of recurrence rate in patients treated with curative surgery in endometrial and cervical
      cancer.

      All patients who had curative surgery due to endometrial or cervical cancer will be included
      to the study. Patients will be examined with DWI in addition to routine sequences including
      contrast enhanced dynamic studies. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy as well as positive
      and negative predictive values of the study will be investigated from the data derived from
      DWI studies and will be correlated with data obtained by conventional radiologic, nuclear
      imaging studies including PET-CT, as well as pathologic verifications during follow-up
      period.

    <description>Postoperative recurrent disease is usually investigated with physical examination, ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) with different sensitivity and specificities. However, radiologists experience difficulty in detection of small recurrent active tumors with anatomically-based radiologic modalities like CT or conventional MRI in patients treated with hysterectomy. Furthermore, effects of adjuvant therapies or fibrosis developed following surgery could mask or even mimic the recurrent tumor. Our aim in this study is to investigate the diagnostic impact of DWI in detection of recurrence rate in patients treated with curative surgery in endometrial and cervical cancer.</description>
