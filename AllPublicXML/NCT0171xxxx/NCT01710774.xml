      This study will investigate whether telemedicine follow-up care for people with
      diabetes-related foot ulcers in municipal primary health care in collaboration with
      specialist health care is an equivalent alternative to traditional outpatient clinical
      follow-up in specialist health care (noninferiority trial) in relation to healing time.

    <textblock>
      The increasing prevalence of diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes, combined with a steadily
      increasing proportion of older people in the population, will present enormous challenges for
      health care services in Norway. An epidemiologic study of diabetes-related foot ulcers among
      community-dwelling adults, including older people, based on data from the Nord-Tr√∏ndelag
      Health Study (HUNT2) showed that a history of foot ulcer was significantly associated with
      increased mortality and that about 10% of the people with diabetes reported a history of foot
      ulcer. Studies have shown that a foot ulcer is associated with reduced quality of life,
      social limitations and pain. Treating foot ulcers costs society considerable money. These
      results emphasize that diabetes-related foot ulcers represent a challenge for the individual
      and for health care services. Health care services need to rapidly begin treatment for people
      with diabetes-related foot ulcers to ensure high-quality treatment.

      Telemedicine innovations for health care services have developed considerably in recent
      decades. The National Health Plan for Norway (2007-2010) emphasizes that the use of
      information and communication technologies is an important way of achieving health policy
      aims in establishing more integrated diagnosis, treatment and care pathways across
      organizational boundaries. Qualitative studies of diabetes-related foot ulcers have shown
      that using telemedicine equipment enables follow-up care of similar quality to traditional
      consultations while enabling more flexible organization and greater patient satisfaction. A
      few minor quantitative studies show positive gains when telemedicine equipment is used in
      following up diabetes-related foot ulcers, but no randomized controlled studies have been
      performed in this field. Further, studies focusing on the more long-term effects are lacking.

      The project is in accordance with national guidelines and will contribute to increasing the
      focus on research related to integrated care. We expect this project to provide evidence
      about alternative care pathways with a holistic approach that could moderate increases in the
      cost of health care services by delivering a larger proportion of services in municipal
      primary care. The project will be able to provide new evidence on meeting the challenges of
      diabetes-related care more systematically and proactively. We expect that the results of this
      study will contribute to showing the extent to which treatment at the lowest effective
      service level will be more cost-effective and of good or better quality than traditional
      clinical follow-up. This study can and will contribute to setting priorities for the users'
      needs for flexible health services and enabling more patients to be treated near their homes.

      If the study finds evidence of positive health gains for the individual people with diabetes
      and contributes to high quality of care, this new model can be implemented in the entire
      Stavanger Hospital Trust. This approach will enable the multidisciplinary team in specialist
      health care to be used more appropriately, and the team will be more accessible for health
      care personnel in municipal primary health care. This model can be transferred to other
      hospital trusts and contribute to improving knowledge on diabetes among nurses in municipal
      primary health care.
