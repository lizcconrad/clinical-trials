    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to compare 3 versions of MiraLAX/Gatorade, MoviPrep and
      SUPREP to see which preparation cleanses the colon best and which preparation is best
      tolerated.

    <description>The quality of the colon preparation as graded using our new Chicago Bowel Preparation Scale (BPS) (Adventist Midwest Region Institutional Review Board, AMH 2010-01-80; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01063049). Chicago BPS total score is ranges from 0 (very poor) to 36 (outstanding). Modified Chicago BPS total score is ranges from 0 (very poor) to 33 (outstanding). Chicago BPS Fluid score is ranges from 0 (dry) to 3 (wet).</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients at least 18 years old planning to undergo an elective colonoscopy will be
             eligible for inclusion in our study. We would prefer to exclude as few groups as
             possible since in clinical practice these less well studied groups often need a
             colonoscopy and will need to have a colonoscopy preparation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are allergic (this is very rare) or intolerant to any of the study drugs.

          2. Patients who are pregnant.

          3. Patients who required multiple day colon preparations (2 days prior and 1 day prior)
             in the past will be excluded.

          4. Patients with ileus, gastrointestinal obstruction, gastric retention, bowel
             perforation, toxic colitis or toxic megacolon would not be considered elective
             colonoscopies and are excluded.

          5. Patients with known renal disease (baseline creatinine greater than 1.50 mg/dl) will
             need to be excluded due to the magnesium in SUPREP which is contraindicated in
             patients with significant renal disease.
