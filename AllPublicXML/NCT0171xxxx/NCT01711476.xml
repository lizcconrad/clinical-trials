  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of two isocaloric maintenance diets
      with different meal timing distribution on insulin resistance hyperandrogenism and cytochrome
      P450c17 alpha activity in lean PCOS women.

      The investigators hypothesis is that in lean PCOS women a Breakfast Diet (BD) which consist
      in high calorie breakfast and reduced dinner, vs Dinner Diet (DD) which consist in high
      calorie dinner with reduced breakfast; the BD will improve glucose and insulin response to
      OGTT and would decrease the hyperandrogenism and cytochrome P450c17 alpha activity.

      Hyperinsulinemia plays a central role in the pathogenesis in obese as well as in lean PCOS
      women. These women are insulin resistant and have compensatory hyperinsulinemia that
      stimulates ovarian cytochrome P450c17 alpha activity that in turn stimulates ovarian androgen
      concentrations.

      In obese PCOS women, weight loss improves insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism, resulting
      in improvement of clinical symptoms.

      Since lean PCOS women do not have the option of weight loss, it is important to know if
      composition and meal timing distribution may influence glucose metabolism and
      hyperandrogenism and cytochrome P450c17 alpha activity. We hypothesized that a timing pattern
      of increased nutrient intake of protein and carbohydrates in the morning, with decreased
      caloric intake at night would improve insulin sensitivity and hyperandrogenism in lean women
      with PCOS
