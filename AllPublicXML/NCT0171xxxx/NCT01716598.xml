  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Targeted Lung Denervation (TLD) Therapy will be a safe method to ablate the airway nerve
      trunks that travel parallel to and outside of the main bronchi and into the lungs to achieve
      targeted lung denervation and potentially improve breathing and quality of life for patients
      suffering from COPD.

      Use of the IPS System will be technically feasible in accessing the target treatment location
      and delivering RF energy to the target treatment location.
