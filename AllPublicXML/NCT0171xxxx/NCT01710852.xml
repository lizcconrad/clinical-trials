          -  Dual chamber permanent pacemaker implanted

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with an AF burden of 1 to 50%,
             as derived from pacemaker diagnostic algorithms

          -  Able to have pacemaker antiarrhythmic algorithms turned off for the duration of the
             study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in medical history, physical examination, or
             screening laboratory results that would render a subject unsuitable for inclusion

          -  NYHA class III/IV heart failure

          -  Impaired left ventricular function of less than 45% determined by echocardiography
             within 3 months of screening

          -  Continuous Amiodarone therapy within 90 days prior to Study Day 1

          -  Treatment with another Study Drug, biological agent, or device within one-month of
             screening, or five half-lives of study agent, whichever is longer

          -  Use of systemic corticosteroids or other anti-inflammatory medications including
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

          -  Use of statins, ACE inhibitors or AT-receptor antagonists unless on a stable regimen
             for at least 3 months prior to dosing and will remain on a stable regimen for the
             duration of the study

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (BP &gt;160/100)

          -  Current or expected use of any anticoagulant apart from warfarin or dabigatran
