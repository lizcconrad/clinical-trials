    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed study is to design and evaluate a touch screen computer based
      multi-factorial intervention to educate individuals at risk of Metabolic syndrome in diverse
      Indian settings including urban, rural and slum in the State of Bhubaneshwar. The study
      objective is to improve metabolic syndrome related knowledge, attitude and practices among
      individuals using the proposed interactive, bilingual computer based educational program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rising prevalence of overweight and obesity has a direct correlation with increasing
      prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, type2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), Metabolic Syndrome
      (MetS), and Cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Most of the previous studies in India have been
      cross sectional nature and have looked at prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS. Despite the
      clinical and public health importance of this phenomenon, not enough work has been carried
      out so far to study and remedy this situation. A computer based interactive and bilingual
      system is proposed to improve Metabolic syndrome related knowledge, attitudes and practices
      among individuals living in urban, rural and slum settings of Bhubaneswar, India. We propose
      to enroll 750 individuals and the eligible study participants will be randomly assigned to
      either the intervention (computer based MetS Program CBMP) or control (Printed Educational
      Material, PEM) groups. The study participants will be followed at days 30, 60 and 90 days
      following the baseline visit. The primary outcomes include change in knowledge, attitudes and
      practices and secondary outcomes include improvement in quality of life and increase
      satisfaction to medical care.
