    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a Response
      Guided Therapy of boceprevir 800 mg dosed three times a day (TID) orally (PO) in combination
      with Peginterferon (either alpha 2b or alpha 2a) and Ribavirin in HIV/HCV genotype 1 infected
      patients that failed to previous HCV therapy.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For inclusion in the study, subjects must have a qualifying regimen defined as
             peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin or peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin for a
             minimum of 12 weeks. If a subject has received more than one such regimen, the most
             recent regimen is considered the qualifying regimen.

          -  Subject must have previously documented chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1
             infection. Subjects with other or mixed genotypes are not eligible. The HCV-RNA result
             at the screening visit must confirm genotype 1 infection and be ≥10,000 IU/mL.

          -  Subject must have a liver biopsy with histology consistent with CHC and no other
             etiology and/or Fibroscan assessment. In case of:

               1. No cirrhosis. Biopsies and/or Fibroscan must be within 18 months of screening
                  visit.

               2. Cirrhosis. No specific length of time would be requested.

          -  All patients with cirrhosis must have an ultrasound 6 month within of screening visit.

          -  Patients must be on stable antiretroviral therapy including a CD4 cell count of more
             than 100 per mm3 and a HIV plasmatic viral load undetectable (it is &lt; 50 copies/mL)
             for more than 6 months. Antiretroviral therapy must be Raltegravir-based (al least
             during the last 3 months).

          -  Subject must be ≥18 years of age.

          -  HIV treatment should not contain efavirenz (EFV), nevirapine (NVP), etravirine (ETV),
             didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T), zidovudine (AZT), or HIV protease inhibitors.

          -  Subject must weight between 40 kg and 125 kg.

          -  Subject and subject's partner(s) must each agree to use acceptable methods of
             contraception for at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1 and continue until at least 6 months
             after last dose of study drug.

          -  Subjects must be willing to give written informed consent and by investigator opinion
             be able to follow the protocol visit design.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients chronically infected with HCV genotype other than 1

          -  CD4 cell count &lt; 100 cel/mm3.

          -  Plasma HIV RNA more than 50 copies/mL

          -  Platelet count less than 80.000 /mm3

          -  Subjects who required discontinuation of previous interferon or ribavirin regimen for
             a severe adverse event considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably
             related to ribavirin and/or interferon.

          -  Treatment with ribavirin within 90 days and any interferon-alpha within 1 month of
             Screening.

          -  Treatment for hepatitis C with any investigational medication. Prior treatments with
             herbal remedies with known hepatotoxicity are exclusionary.

          -  Participation in any other clinical trial within 30 days of randomization or intention
             to participate in another clinical trial during participation in this study.

          -  History of hemoglobinopathy (e.g., thalassemia) or any other cause of or tendency to
             hemolysis.

          -  Evidence of decompensate liver disease including, but not limited to, a history or
             presence of clinical ascites, bleeding varices, or hepatic encephalopathy.

          -  Diabetic and/or hypertensive subjects with clinically significant ocular examination
             findings.

          -  Unstable or untreated pre-existing psychiatric condition.

          -  Any known pre-existing medical condition that could interfere with the subject's
             participation in and completion of the study.

          -  Any current evidence of substance abuse of alcohol or other drugs.

          -  Subjects receiving opioid agonist substitution therapy but not enrolled in an opiate
             substitution maintenance program.
