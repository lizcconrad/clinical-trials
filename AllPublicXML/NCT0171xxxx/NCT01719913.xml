      Objective: To identify how specific changes of the gluten content in the diet affect the
      host-gut microbiome interactions with implications for metabolic health.

      Design: A randomized, controlled, single-blinded, cross-over intervention trial consisting of
      two 8-week interventions periods, separated by a 6-week wash-out period. A total number of 60
      participants will be included.

      Intervention: low vs high gluten intake.

      The study is designed as a randomized, controlled, single-blinded, cross-over intervention
      trial consisting of two 8-week interventions periods, separated by a 6-week wash-out period.
      A total number of 60 participants will be included. Participants consume, in randomized
      order, a gluten-poor diet (&lt;5 g/d) in the active treatment period and a gluten-rich diet (&gt;25
      g/d) during the control period.

      Measurements: Altered quantitative metagenomics at bacterial gene- and species levels is the
      primary outcome of this study. Secondary outcomes include metabolic and inflammatory markers,
      circulating appetite hormone levels,serum metabolomics, gastrointestinal transit time and
      intestinal permeability. Furthermore, selected control measures are included; 4-day food
      records and a study intervention dietary records.

    <measure>Saliva microbial flora</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Saliva is collected after the participants have taken a small piece of paraffin in their mouth and have chewed until the paraffin has turned into one coherent mass (approximately one minute). Participants are swallowing the produced saliva for that minute. After this, and for the next 3 minutes, saliva is collected in a cup and handed over to the study personnel. Saliva is stored at minus 80 degrees for later studies of saliva microbial flora and saliva biochemistry.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nasal fluid</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Nasal fluid is collected by a non-invasive methodology for in vivo measurement of an array of immunological signalling molecules in the nasal airway lining. The method is based on a standardized collection of mucosal airway fluid from both nostrils onto small sheets of filter papers with efficient absorption properties. The technique is highly reproducible, and used for measuring immunological mediators representing the immediate response ability of the mucosal immune system.</description>
