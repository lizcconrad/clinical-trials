    <description>Strength: 200 mg (4 x 50 mg)
Form: oral tablet
Frequency: single dose
Description: All subjects will receive a single oral dose of Brivaracetam (BRV) 200 mg, given as 50 mg tablets times 4 followed by an adequate volume of water (approximately 200 ml) in 2 of the 3 crossover periods. This dose will be administered 30 minutes after the initiation of the Ethanol / Ethanol Placebo infusion on Day 1.</description>

    <description>Form: intravenous infusion
Frequency: continuous infusion
Description: The ethanol infusion rate is initially based on weight, height, age, and sex. Subsequently, the infusion rate will be adjusted based on Breath Ethanol Measurements to maintain Breath Ethanol Levels (and by extension, blood ethanol levels) of 0.6 g / L.</description>

    <description>In 1 of the 3 crossover periods, all subjects will receive 4 Placebo tablets to match the 50 mg Brivaracetam (BRV) tablets. The Placebo tablet will contain the same excipients as the BRV tablets but without BRV.</description>

    <description>In 1 crossover period subjects will receive Ethanol Placebo (5% glucose). On Day 1, the continuous infusion of Ethanol Placebo will begin with a 30 minute Loading Phase prior to administration of Brivaracetam (BRV) / BRV Placebo and will continue until 5 hours after administration of BRV/BRV Placebo. During the first 10 minutes, the infusion will be accompanied by an infusion of 5% Glucose via the same line in order to mask the sensation at the beginning of the Ethanol infusion.</description>
