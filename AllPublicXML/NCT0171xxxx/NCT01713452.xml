  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stoma closure has been associated with a high rate of surgical site infection (SSI). The rate
      for SSI following stoma closure has been noted to be 7-41%; a rate that is higher than
      expected for a clean-contaminated operative classification. The ideal stoma site closure
      technique is still debated in the current literature. The aim of this study was to compare
      the rate of SSI following two different stoma closure techniques, primary closure versus a
      skin approximating purse string closure, in a multi-center randomized controlled trial. The
      investigators hypothesize that purse string closure technique will have a lower rate of SSI
      than primary closure technique.

      The investigators will randomize ileostomy takedown patients to either a primary closure or
      purse string closure technique intraoperatively. Surgeons at both the University of Minnesota
      and the CHUV hospital in Switzerland will participate in the this study.

    <description>An incision around the stoma will be made with 2-3 mm circumferential margins. This dissection along the mucocutaneous junction will then be made to the fascial defect. Re-establishment of bowel continuity will them be performed. If the circumferential incision does not provide adequate exposure, the incision can be converted to an elliptical one. Thereafter, it will be closed primarily with staples, similar to the primary closure group.
Following ostomy closure, the subcutaneous tissues will be irrigated. A 2-0 monocryl subcuticular purse string stitch will then be placed and cinched to a 1cm diameter. This opening will then be packed with Nu-Gauze as a wick dressing.
Diameter of the skin defect should then be measured.
A postoperative photo will then be taken.</description>

    <description>An elliptical incision (extending transversely) will be made with 2-3 mm superior/inferior margins around the mucocutaneous junction. Dissection will then be made in a perpendicular fashion through the subcutaneous tissue with tapering near the fascial defect. Re-establishment of bowel continuity will then be performed.
Following ostomy closure, the subcutaneous tissue will be irrigated and the skin will be closed tight with staples placed at close intervals (&lt;1.5cm). No subcutaneous drains will be placed.
Length of the incision should be measured in centimeters.
A postoperative photo will then be taken.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects eligible are those with either a colostomy or ileostomy (end or loop) who are
        deemed by their surgeon to be appropriate candidates for ostomy closure. There will be no
        limitations based upon initial indication for formation of the ostomy. Indications for
        initial ostomy formation for fecal diversion can include: infection (e.g. diverticulitis)
        and protection of an anastomosis. (following resection for inflammatory bowel disease,
        benign diseases, or cancer)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from the study if:

          1. The stoma site is left open to heal by secondary intention due to gross contamination
             (surgeon discretion)

          2. The stoma site is re-used (i.e. the same stoma site used for the formation of a new
             ostomy)

          3. A new stoma is created at a different site.
