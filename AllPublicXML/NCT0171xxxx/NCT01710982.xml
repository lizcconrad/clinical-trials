        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is 18 to 80 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Patient is scheduled to undergo open bowel resection.

          -  Female patients must be postmenopausal (for at least 1 year), surgically sterile,
             practicing true sexual abstinence, OR must be using adequate contraception (in the
             opinion of the investigator) for the duration of the study, including the follow-up
             period (e.g. contraceptive implants, injectables, oral contraceptives, some
             intrauterine devices [IUD], and/or barrier method (condom or occlusive cap) with
             spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository).

          -  Hormonal and IUD methods of contraception must be established for a period of 3 months
             prior to dosing and, if changed, alternative methods should be used as directed by the
             investigator throughout the duration of the study.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and
             admission

        After surgery and prior to administration of the first dose of study drug, the following
        eligibility criteria must be assessed:

          -  Patient underwent open bowel resection.

          -  Patient has given written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient weighs more than 200kg (441 pounds).

          -  Patient is classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class 4, 5, or 6

          -  Patient has complete bowel obstruction.

          -  Patient is scheduled to receive a low rectal or anal anastomosis (e.g. proctectomy or
             ileoanal anastomosis) (low rectal is defined as below the anterior peritoneal
             reflection - typically 9-10cm from the anal verge).

          -  Patient is scheduled for laparoscopic or laparoscopic hand-assisted procedure.

          -  Patient's surgical procedure is considered to be an emergency procedure.

          -  Patient has significant impairment of liver or renal function (alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT)/ aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 2.5 times the upper limit of
             normal; creatinine clearance &lt;30mL/minute (min), estimated using serum creatinine with
             the formula [(140 - age in years) × weight in kg]/[(72 × serum creatinine in mg/dl) ×
             0.85 for female patients].

          -  Patient is anticipated to require prolonged post-operative ventilation.

          -  Patient has a psychiatric disorder or cognitive impairment that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would interfere with participation in the study.

          -  Patient has participated in an investigational drug study 30 days prior to the study
             initiation.

          -  Patient has a positive laboratory test result for controlled substances (other than
             for those prescribed by a medical professional and/or accounted for by concomitant
             medications) at screening.

          -  Patient is known to have Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infection currently associated
             with clinically significant symptoms or abnormal liver function.

          -  Patient has a recent, adult history of clinically significant hypersensitivity
             reaction(s) to any drug, in the opinion of the Investigator.

          -  Patient is pregnant (confirmed by pregnancy test) or is breastfeeding.

          -  Patient has known history of drug or alcohol abuse within the previous year.

        After surgery and prior to administration of the first dose of study drug, the following
        eligibility criteria must be assessed:

          -  Patient received a low rectal or an anal anastomosis (e.g. proctectomy or ileoanal
             anastomosis) (low rectal is defined as below the anterior peritoneal reflection -
             typically 9-10cm from the anal verge).

          -  Patient underwent a laparoscopic procedure (including a hand-assisted laparoscopic
             procedure).

          -  Patient is classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class 4, 5, or 6.

          -  Patients has received ulimorelin previously
