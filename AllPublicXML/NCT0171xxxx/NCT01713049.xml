      The purpose: To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FLT PET for the suspicious lesions
      on mammograms and ultrasound.

      1. To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FLT PET for the suspicious lesions on
           mammograms and ultrasound, using the pathologic result of biopsy as gold standard, and
           to determine whether 18F-FLT PET can increase the specificity in breast lesion diagnosis
           and thus reduce the unnecessary biopsy.

        2. To evaluate whether 18F-FLT PET is a cost-effective imaging modality for breast cancer
           diagnosis.
