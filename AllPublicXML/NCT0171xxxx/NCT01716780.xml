  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking at treating cancer pain in head and neck cancer. Patients are asked in
      outpatients to score their worst pain on a scale of 0 to 10 in the last 24 hours. Those with
      a pain score of 4 and above are randomised into the study.

      Patients are allocated to continue with their current care (control group) or to be reviewed
      by the pain/palliative care team (intervention group). At baseline questionnaires are
      completed on level of pain, type of pain, quality of life and anxiety/depression. Information
      is also collected on the analgesia they've used in the past month and basic health economics
      (GP/hospital visits related to pain management and treatment).

      Follow up in the trial is for 3 months and consists of questionnaires as above and further
      collection of information on analgesic usage and health economics.
