  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical devices to increase the individual's bronchial hygiene are commonly used to assist
      patients with chronic retention of secretions. VAKÜM technology has been recently developed
      with the aim to improve the respiratory condition in hypersecretive patients suffering from
      chronic respiratory diseases.

      The aim of this study is to assess the clinical efficacy of VAKÜM technology in patients with
      hypersecretion, and chronic respiratory diseases a clinical trial has been designed.

      Patients with chronic respiratory diseases, hypersecretion (sputum production &gt;30 mL/die),
      and reduced cough efficiency (Peak Cough Expiratory Flow &gt; 150 and &lt; 300 L*min-1) referred to
      standard pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) will be included. Study design is a single-blind
      multicentre randomized trial with consecutive recruitment. Following a preliminary run-in
      period, group comparison will be made between Intervention group using VAKÜM system (Free
      Aspire, MPR, Legnano-I) added to the conventional manual ELTGOL technique, and Control group
      using manual ELTGOL alone over 10 daily sessions.

      Spirometric lung volumes, respiratory muscle strength, arterial blood gases, and quality of
      life will be recorded in both groups pre-to-post PR. Perceived dyspnea (by VAS scale), sputum
      volume and characteristics (on a semi-quantitative 3-point scale) and peak expiratory air
      flows (PEF and PCEF) will be registered on a daily basis over the study period. Primary
      outcome is the change in perceived dyspnea; in order to ensure 80% power to detect a 5 point
      (SD 5) group difference change in the primary outcome at the end of the study period as
      significant at the 0.05 level, at least 42 patients per group are needed. The minimum target
      sample size will be then fixed at 50 patients per group.

      An higher and faster significant reduction of the perceived dyspnea is supposed in the
      Intervention group. Additional benefits among the secondary outcomes are also hypothesised in
      the same group.
