  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years medicine has been enhanced by the incorporation of technological innovations
      from areas as diverse as cell biology, biochemistry, genetics, biophysics and bioengineering.
      One of the few exceptions in this rapid process of implementing technological advances occurs
      in clinical medicine, where its penetration is much less effective than in other scientific
      and professional fields, or even in everyday life. Attempts to tackle this problem have given
      rise to various initiatives in the US and Europe, including Spain.

      There is a surprising paucity of telemedicine systems in clinical practice, especially with
      respect to sleep-related breathing disorders, and most particularly obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA), where protocols are urgently needed to alleviate this healthcare problem represented
      by its under-diagnosis and comorbidity, as well as the long waiting lists for treatment. In
      others words, the growing awareness of sleep disorders, especially OSA, has not been
      accompanied by strategic changes in the cost-effective diagnosis and/or treatment of these
      diseases.

      CPAP therapy compliance is not always appropriate. Helping patients during the first two
      months usually determines compliance. Therefore, the development of strategies to support the
      patient during the first weeks is essential. However, this &quot;collides&quot; with reality, where it
      is difficult to properly care all patients because of congested sleep units. It is therefore
      necessary to implement new and imaginative control schemes especially at the beginning of the
      treatment. Patients' follow-up performed by telemedicine technology is an option that aims to
      substitute the face-to-face visits or at least reduce them considerably. In a future context,
      the idea is that the professional in charge of CPAP patients monitoring has on his/her agenda
      face-to-face visits and televisits (at distance) and information which patient will provide
      through online questionnaires with a certain frequency.

      In this sense, this project aims to analyze whether CPAP treatment compliance of OSA patients
      monitored by telemedicine techniques (website and televisits) is similar to that achieved by
      standard monitoring but more cost-effective. The study design is a multicenter randomized
      trial with parallel groups and blind final evaluation after CPAP treatment following two
      different strategies: one through conventional monitoring in the hospital (face-to-face
      visiting) and another by telemedicine monitoring (non-contact visiting and website).
