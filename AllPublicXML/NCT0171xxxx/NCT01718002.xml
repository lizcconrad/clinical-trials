      The care of the oral cavity is an important way to prevent local and systemic infections.
      This study aimed to: evaluate the use of video as a teaching strategy of oral hygiene for
      patients undergoing chemotherapy. The methodological design used was quasi-experimental
      before-after intervention. The sample consisted of 23 subjects who performed the technique of
      oral hygiene before and after watching an educational video. To do so was given a kit with a
      toothbrush with soft bristles, toothpaste with low abrasivity, mouthwash or product to
      mouthwash and dental floss for oral hygiene. For data analysis we applied the parametric test
      t &quot;Student&quot; paired.

      General Purpose Evaluating the use of video as a teaching strategy of oral hygiene for
      patients undergoing chemotherapy.

      Specific Objectives Assess the steps taken by the subjects to oral hygiene before (initial
      performance) and after (final performance) exposure to an educational video on oral hygiene;
      To investigate the effect of an educational video on oral hygiene in this clientele; Identify
      patient acceptance of the teaching method employed.

      Methods and Procedures Delineation The research was quasi-experimental in nature,
      before-after intervention (the intervention in this study was the teaching learning strategy
      employed used an educational video on oral hygiene.) Patients will be evaluated individually,
      before and after exposure to video. It is not foreseen monitoring at other times.

    <description>Assess the steps taken by the subjects to oral hygiene before (initial performance) and after (final performance) exposure to an educational video on oral hygiene. The subjects were assessed for scores of hits in 15 steps related to the process of oral hygiene before and after the presentation of educational video. he steps are related to the amount of cream dents, tilt the brush, brushing locations, movements employees, number of repetitions, use of dental floss, mouthwash, among others. Eg: P1 - applied a small amount of toothpaste on the brush; P2 - put the brush bristles inclined in place, between the gum and the tooth, put the brush bristles inclined in place, between the gum and the tooth; P3 - brushed the upper arch with sweeping movements towards the top down; P4 - brushed with the lower jaw movements sweep from top to bottom; P5 - brushed the inside of the teeth gum toward the tip of the tooth, using the movement &quot;sweep &quot;...</description>

As for settling scores of the 15 items assessed (maximum score 15) in the implementation of oral hygiene procedure, the subjects had an average initial phase in the other end. We used the t test &quot;Student&quot; test to detect differences between these averages</description>

At this point the researcher also observed the sequence, movements and technical procedures used to analyze the steps of oral hygiene, using the same instrument for such employee initially.</description>
