      Though histoacryl injection is now regarded as treatment of choice in the control of gastric
      variceal hemorrhage, it may be associated with a lot of complications such as ulcers, ulcer
      bleeding, bacterial infections, distant site thrombosis and cerebral vascular accident. On
      the other hand, thrombin has been shown to be effective in acute hemostasis of bleeding
      gastric varices, ranging from 70% to 100% has been recorded. The rebleeding rates were
      between 7% and 50%. Moreover, the benefits of thrombin injection include safety, without
      inducing ulcers or ulcer bleeding. No incidence of distant thrombosis has ever been reported.

      Previous studies have proven that the use of cyanoacrylate glue injection was superior to EIS
      or EVL in arresting acute gastric variceal bleeding. Endoscopic obturation with glue
      injection has gained worldwide popularity except the United States. The hemostatic rates of
      glue injection ranged from 87% to 100%, with rebleeding rates about 7% to 71%.

      Though histoacryl injection is now regarded as treatment of choice in the control of gastric
      variceal hemorrhage, it may be associated with a lot of complications such as ulcers, ulcer
      bleeding, bacterial infections, distant site thrombosis and cerebral vascular accident. On
      the other hand, thrombin has been shown to be effective in acute hemostasis of bleeding
      gastric varices, ranging from 70% to 100% has been recorded. The rebleeding rates were
      between 7% and 50%. Moreover, the benefits of thrombin injection include safety, without
      inducing ulcers or ulcer bleeding. No incidence of distant thrombosis has ever been reported.
      The mechanism of hemostasis induced by thrombin is through the conversion of fibrinogen to
      fibrin and enhancement of platelets aggregation. This trial aimed to compare the relative
      efficacy and safety between histoacryl injection and thrombin injection in the prevention of
      gastric variceal rebleeding.
