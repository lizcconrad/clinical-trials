    <textblock>
      Partners HealthCare maintains a Patient Data Registry (PDR) with information from all patient
      encounters at Partners HealthCare facilities. We intend to utilize the PDR to identify groups
      of patient who are of high clinical suspicion for undiagnosed Gaucher disease. A group of
      potential participants will be identified through the PDR. Detailed records will be requested
      to further narrow to ideal participants based upon previously existing diagnoses and
      symptoms. Participants will be invited to partake in the study via a letter from their
      Partners care provider with supporting study details. Study participants will be evaluated in
      a one-time visit. A complete family and medical history will be collected. A physical exam
      will be performed, and up to 20cc of blood will be drawn. All participants will be notified
      of their disease status via letter and phone call from the study staff. If the study
      participant is diagnosed with GD through this evaluation, proper follow-up recommendations
      and referrals will be provided. Our intent is to determine if existing patient data can
      successfully be utilized to aid in the identification of patients with rare genetic disease.
