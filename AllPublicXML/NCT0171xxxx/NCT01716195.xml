  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive head
      and neck cancer can be treated with a less aggressive regimen of radiation therapy and
      chemotherapy (paclitaxel) after initially receiving two cycles of chemotherapy
      (carboplatin/paclitaxel).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the toxicity of high dose cisplatin, attention has focused on identifying patients at
      lower risk for failure who may potentially benefit from less aggressive chemoradiotherapy
      approaches. HPV-positive Head and Neck Cancer responds favorably to radiation therapy. This
      has prompted investigators to suggest that patients with these cancers might be
      &quot;over-treated&quot; and unnecessarily subjected to the toxicity of intensive chemoradiotherapy
      with excessively high radiation doses.

      This study will select patients with HPV-positive Head and Neck cancer for attenuated therapy
      and may have important implications for individualization of care in the future. The regimen
      of carboplatin and paclitaxel was selected for the induction chemotherapy phase because of
      its ease of administration, improved toxicity profile, high rates of dose delivery, and
      excellent published results showing high response rates and overall survival. This study will
      use induction chemotherapy primarily as a means to select HPV-positive Head and Neck Cancer
      patients, who may benefit from significant radiation dose de-intensification in the
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy phase of treatment. The rationale for this risk-adapted approach
      to local therapy based on HPV status is to administer effective comprehensive treatment
      individualized at diagnosis and after assessment of response to induction chemotherapy (for
      patients with HPV-positive tumors), thus avoiding unnecessary and potentially toxic
      treatment, and hence optimizing the therapeutic ratio.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically proven diagnosis of HPV-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the
             oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx. HPV-positivity will be defined as tumors that are
             p16-positive by immunohistochemistry.

          -  Clinical stage III or IV disease; Note: Patients with M1 tumors are not eligible.

          -  Appropriate stage for protocol entry, including no distant metastases, based upon
             minimum diagnostic workup

          -  Zubrod Performance Status 0-1

          -  Age &gt; 18
