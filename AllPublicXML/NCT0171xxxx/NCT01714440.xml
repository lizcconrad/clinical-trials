  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major aim of this research study is to investigate the relationship between genetic
      variation in DNA (inherited code material in the cells of the body) and factors affecting
      transplant outcomes, like the drugs people receive or the way their immune systems work, for
      example. To do this, investigators will collect blood samples from participants. Genetic
      material will be separated from each blood sample and analyzed, looking for genetic
      variation.

      In the past, the major problems in kidney transplantation were surgical complications, acute
      rejection, and infections. Right now, researchers are focusing on improving immune
      suppression therapy and achieving better long-term survival of kidney transplants. One of the
      ways to try to understand what causes loss of function after many years is to find out if
      there is a genetic factor involved.

      There are a number of differences in specific genes that have been identified and are thought
      to affect transplant outcomes. Studying these gene variations (differences between people or
      differences between populations) is important in determining whether these variations are
      related to transplant outcomes and how this information can help patients achieve better
      long-term transplant survival.
