    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of dabrafenib and pazopanib
      hydrochloride when given together in treating patients with advanced malignant tumors.
      Dabrafenib and pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of GSK2118436 (dabrafenib) given with pazopanib
      (pazopanib hydrochloride) as well as determining the maximum tolerated dosing regimen in
      patients with BRAF mutated advanced malignant tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate pharmacokinetics of the two study drugs and identify potential drug-drug
      interactions.

      II. Determine pharmacogenomics with microarray testing. III. Perform genotyping of tumors and
      if objective tumor response rates are identified.

      IV. Assess objective tumor response rates.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 (once daily on day 1
      and BID on days 3-28 of course 1), and pazopanib hydrochloride PO once daily (QD) on days
      1-28 (days 2-28 of course 1). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;= institutional lower limit of normal

          -  The effects of dabrafenib on the developing human fetus are unknown; pazopanib belongs
             to the pregnancy risk factor group D (adverse effects were observed in animal
             studies); for these reasons, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to
             use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men treated or
             enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the
             study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of
             dabrafenib and pazopanib administration

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Ability to swallow oral medication and keep a pill diary

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks prior to
             study enrollment

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with symptomatic, untreated brain metastases; patients who are on a stable
             dose of corticosteroids for more than 1 month or off corticosteroids for 2 weeks can
             be enrolled; enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs are not permitted; screening with
             central nervous system (CNS) imaging (computerized tomography [CT] or magnetic
             resonance imaging [MRI]) is required only if clinically indicated

          -  Patients with a known history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency;
             patients with G6PD deficiency are excluded from clinical trials because they may
             develop nonimmune hemolytic anemia in response to dabafenib, which contains a
             sulfonamide, a potential risk factor for subjects with this deficiency

          -  Patients taking prohibited medications within 7 days of entering study will be
             excluded due to potential serious interactions with dabafenib; patients taking
             therapeutic doses of warfarin will not be allowed on the study due to potential drug
             interactions (patient on prophylactic low dose warfarin are allowed)

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because dabrafenib is an investigational
             agent with unknown teratogenicity and because pazopanib belongs to pregnancy risk
             factor group D (adverse effects were observed in animal studies); because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with dabrafenib and pazopanib, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with these agents

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are excluded because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions of highly active
             anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) with dabrafenib and pazopanib; in addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Poorly controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure [BP] &gt;= 140 and/or
             diastolic BP &gt;= 90) measured on more than one occasion and not responsive to
             antihypertensives; Note: Initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive medication(s) is
             permitted prior to study entry and during study if required; BP must be re-assessed on
             two occasions separated by a minimum of 1 hour; on each of these occasions, the mean
             systolic (S)BP/diastolic (D)BP values (of 3 readings) must be &lt; 140/90 mmHg in order
             for a subject to be eligible for the study

          -  Prolongation of heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 480 msecs (using Bazett's
             formula)

          -  History of at least one of the following cardiovascular conditions within the past 6
             months:

               -  Cardiac angioplasty or stenting

               -  Myocardial infarction

               -  Unstable angina

               -  Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease

               -  Class III or IV congestive heart failure, as defined by the New York Heart
                  Association

          -  History of cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attack (TIA),
             pulmonary embolism or untreated deep venous thrombosis (DVT) within the past 6 months;
             patients who are being treated for pulmonary embolism (PE) and/or DVT diagnosed within
             the past 6 months with agents other than warfarin are allowed to enter the study

          -  Prior major surgery or trauma within 28 days before first dose of study drug and/or
             presence of any non-healing wound, fracture, or ulcer

          -  Evidence of active bleeding or bleeding diathesis

          -  Patient with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C infection; patients with laboratory
             evidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) clearance are eligible for the trial

          -  Patient with history of malignancy other than completely resected non-melanomatous
             skin carcinoma or successfully treated in situ carcinoma within 5 years of study
             enrollment

          -  Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may affect absorption of
             the study drugs including but not limited to:

               -  Malabsorption syndrome
