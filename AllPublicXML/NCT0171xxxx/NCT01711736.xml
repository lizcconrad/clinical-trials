  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of
      the new influenza vaccine GSK2282512A (FLU-Q-QIV) and compare its activity to the marketed
      vaccine Fluarix® (TIV) in young children 6 to 35 months of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects will be randomized (1:1) in the 2 treatment groups to explore responses to
      vaccination in a sub-group analysis based on age (6 to 17 months, 18 to 35 months).

        <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed were drowsiness, irritability/fussiness and loss of appetite. Any was defined as any solicited general symptom reported irrespective of intensity and relationship to vaccination. Related was defined as symptoms assessed by the investigator to have a causal relationship to vaccination. Grade 3 irritability/fussiness was defined as crying that could not be comforted/prevented normal activity. Grade 3 loss of appetite was defined as not eating at all. Grade 3 drowsiness was defined as drowsiness that prevented normal activity.</description>
