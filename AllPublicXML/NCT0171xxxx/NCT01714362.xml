    <textblock>
      Pulling the eyeball during ophthalmic surgery provokes decrease in heart rate. This
      phenomenon is called oculocardiac reflex. In some patients asystole may occur. Other cardiac
      features of this reflex include hypotension, dysrhythmias, atrioventricular block. These
      cardiovascular disturbances may lead to decreased perfusion and ischemia of vital organs.
      Patients with existing cardiovascular disease are in risk of complications. Cardiovascular
      system is mainly innervated with autonomic nervous system (ANS). Sympathetic/parasympathetic
      activity may be determined by Heart Rate Variability (HRV). HRV analysis based on short 5
      minutes electrocardiography has been found useful for prediction of hypotension and
      bradycardia during induction of general anaesthesia and during spinal block. The aim of this
      study is to verify whether it is possible to predict oculocardiac reflex with the use of HRV
      analysis for ANS activity assessment, measured prior to the ophthalmic surgery.
