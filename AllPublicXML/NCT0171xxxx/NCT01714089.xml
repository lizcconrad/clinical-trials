          1. Males or females, aged between 18 and 50 years.

          2. Diagnosis of RR-MS according to McDonald 2010 diagnostic criteria with a prior brain
             MRI that demonstrates lesions consistent with RRMS, both within the past year.

          3. No evidence of relapse during the 60 days prior to enrollment.

          4. EDSS score of 0-5 at screening.

          5. Women of childbearing potential who have a negative pregnancy test (serum HCG) at
             screening.

          6. Men or women of reproductive potential who commit to use adequate contraception during
             the study and for 1 month following the last day of treatment.

          7. Subjects must be capable of understanding the purpose and risks of the study and
             provide written, informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of Secondary Progressive MS, Primary Progressive MS or Progressive Relapsing
             MS.

          2. Normal baseline brain MRI.

          3. History of any clinically significant autoimmune disease: inflammatory bowel disease,
             diabetes, lupus or severe asthma.

          4. Current or prior malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin carcinoma or in situ
             carcinoma of the cervix that has been adequately treated.)

          5. Significant organ dysfunction, including cardiac, renal (eGFR ≤ 60 ml/min.), liver,
             central nervous system, pulmonary, vascular, gastrointestinal, endocrine, or metabolic
             (e.g., creatinine ≥ 1.6 mg/dL; ALT or AST ≥ 1.5x the upper limit of normal), history
             of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias within 6 months
             prior to enrollment.

          6. Steroid therapy within 60 days prior to enrollment, with the exception of
             corticosteroids or ACTH for relapse treatment during the course of the study.

          7. Known allergy to Gadolinium-DTPA

             irradiation, monoclonal antibody treatment, mitoxantrone, Tysabri, fingolimod,
             cytoxan, methotrexate.

         10. Participation in any investigational therapy within one year prior to enrollment,
             unless given approval by PI.

         11. Known or suspected current or past alcohol or drug abuse within one year prior to
             enrollment.

         12. Any medical, psychiatric or other condition that could result in a subject not being
             able to comply with protocol requirements.
