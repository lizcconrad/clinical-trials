  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2a study of VRS-317 (long-acting growth hormone) in pediatric patients
      with growth hormone deficiency. During Phase 1b, pediatric patients each will receive a
      single subcutaneous injection of VRS-317. During the Phase 2a stage, patients will receive 6
      months of VRS-317 treatment at dose levels selected from the Phase 1b stage. The primary
      endpoints for the study are to determine the safety and efficacy of repeat dose VRS-317.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Phase 1b, separate cohorts of patients will be tested in a single ascending dose format.
      Safety review committee meetings will take place prior to escalating to each increasing dose
      level. Enrolled patients will be monitored for 60 days for safety with PK/PD and safety labs
      collected.

      Two dose levels will be selected after completion of Phase 1b to be tested during Phase 2a (6
      months of continuous VRS-317 treatment). Safety and PK assessments will be made during the
      Phase 2a stage. Patient heights will be measured by stadiometer.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 1b and 2a: Evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple dosing levels of subcutaneous (SC) VRS-317 in pediatric growth hormone deficient (GHD) patients. Phase 2a: Evaluate the efficacy of multiple dose levels of VRS-317</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety observations will include the number of patients with adverse events, concomitant medications, safety labs, vital signs, physical exams, single dose immunogenicity (Phase 1b), and repeat dose immunogenicity (Phase 2a).
The primary efficacy outcome measure is the height velocity over 6 months as measured by standing height taken with stadiometer at baseline and after 6 Months of VRS-317 dosing in Phase 2a.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate pharmacokinetic measures of VRS-317.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome measures include evaluation of pharmacokinetics (PK) of VRS-317 including Cmax, Tmax and AUC. PK measures will be analysed at multiple timepoints after single dosing of VRS-317 during Phase 1b and after repeat dosing of VRS-317 during Phase 2a.</description>

    <measure>Evaluate secondary efficacy measures after 6 months of VRS-317 dosing.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary efficacy measures during Phase 2a include change in height SDS and change in bone age after 6 months VRS-317 treatment.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate pharmacodynamic measures</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome measures include evaluation of pharmacodynamics (PD) as measured by IGF-I and IGFBP-3 responses to single dose VRS-317 during Phase 1b and as measured by IGF-I and IGFBP-3 responses to multiple doses of VRS-317 after repeat dosing during Phase 2a. PD measures will be obtained at multiple timepoints during Phase 1b and Phase 2a.</description>
