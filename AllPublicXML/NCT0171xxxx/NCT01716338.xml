  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glyburide is a medication that has been safely used for several decades to treat non-insulin
      dependent diabetes. This pilot study seeks to evaluate whether glyburide, administered at the
      lowest dose (1.5 mg/dL daily) to healthy (non-diabetic) subjects is safe both physically and
      cognitively. The investigators are hopeful that the results of this study will provide the
      necessary foundation to evaluate this medication's use on a larger scale to determine the
      feasibility of using glyburide in soldiers either prophylactically or for the treatment of
      brain injury.

      This study is a placebo controlled (2:1 drug vs. placebo), randomized clinical trial of 21
      healthy, non-diabetic volunteers receiving daily doses of oral glyburide (1.5 mg) vs. placebo
      while under careful medical monitoring in an inpatient Clinical Research Unit (CRU)within the
      Center for Applied Research Sciences (CARS) at the Washington University in St. Louis Medical
      Center for a duration of 7 days and nights (24 hours per day). Interested subjects who call
      for more information about the study will be scheduled for a screening visit. Subjects will
      participate first in an informed consent process, and those wishing to take part will be
      asked to undergo a comprehensive interview detailing their past medical history and formal
      physical examination (which includes laboratory tests of the urine and blood). If a subject
      is deemed appropriate by the team, he/she will be asked to perform an exercise test
      (treadmill for 30 minutes) and will have an Electrocardiogram (ECG) completed to further
      determine eligibility. Individuals who do not meet inclusion criteria based on screening
      activities will be notified immediately that they are not eligible. Volunteers meeting all
      eligibility criteria will be scheduled for the week long in-patient evaluation.

      Each subject will undergo a battery of physical, cognitive, and laboratory tests in addition
      to receiving oral glyburide or placebo each day for one week.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of glyburide in healthy, non-diabetic volunteers while simulating strenuous activity to observe for any adverse events (i.e. hypoglycemia, dizziness, confusion, etc.). Neuropsychological testing, physical exams, vital signs, ECGs, cognitive assessments, and laboratory values (including serum glucose levels collected 4 x's per day and as needed) will be conducted throughout the 7 day in-patient study to assess for any adverse/serious adverse events.</description>

    <description>Determine the impact after 7 days of glyburide 1.5mg daily (with breakfast) in healthy volunteers who are able to participate in scheduled strenuous activities and adhere to a structured meal plan on cognitive performance using a computer program to test cognition before study drug administration and at the end of the study in addition to daily physical examinations which include mini mental status exams.</description>
