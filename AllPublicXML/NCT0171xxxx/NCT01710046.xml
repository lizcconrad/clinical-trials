  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are cells in the skin and blood of humans with chronic moderate to severe plaque
      psoriasis with specific activities that may determine the effectiveness of treatment. These
      activities may be described by obtaining samples of skin and blood and analyzing them using a
      variety of tests.

      The final subject in Cohort 1 completed the study on 19-Nov-2013 (LSLV date). Because the
      study analyses were novel and exploratory, they required extensive analyses by study team and
      external experts. As a result of this analysis it was determined on 21-July-2014 that the
      data from Cohort 1 were sufficiently definitive and that enrollment of Cohort 2 would not be
      justified. Since this decision resulted in the LSLV for Cohort 1 becoming the LSLV for the
      study, the full data analysis and reporting is not projected to be complete within 12 Months
      of LSLV. The final analysis and final reporting is planned to be completed on 18-Feb-2015.
      Results for this data are anticipated to be released in April 2015.

    <measure>Body Surface Area (BSA)</measure>

    <description>Assessment of BSA with psoriasis was performed separately for 4 body regions: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin), and lower limbs (including buttocks). The percent surface area with psoriasis was estimated by means of the handprint method, where the full palmar hand of the participant (ie, the participant's fully extended palm, fingers and thumb together) represents approximately 1% of the total BSA. The number of handprints of psoriatic skin in a body region can be used to determine the extent (%) to which a body regions is involved with psoriasis. In each body region, the percent body region surface area with psoriasis is multiplied by the Body Region Weighting (head and neck=10%, upper limbs=5%, trunk [including axillae and groin]=3.33% and lower limbs [including buttocks]=2.5%). BSA (%)=0.1Sh + 0.2Sh+0.3St+0.4Sl, where S=body region suface area with psoriasis: h=head; u=upper limbs; t=trunk; l=lower limbs.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of itch (pruritus) due to psoriasis was assessed using the ISI, a single-item, horizontal numeric rating scale. Participants were asked to rate &quot;your worst itching due to psoriasis over the past 24 hours&quot; on a numeric rating scale anchored by the terms &quot;No itching&quot; (0) and &quot;Worst possible itching&quot; (10) at the ends. the baseline is defined as the average of all available diary entries before Baseline/Day 1 and the in-clinic measurement on Baseline/day 1. Week 1 is the mean of daily values of study days 2 to 8 and Week 2 is the mean of daily values of study days 9 to 15.</description>

    <measure>Target Plaque Severity Score (TPSS) by Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Target lesions were selected at baseline and followed for the duration of the study. Each target lesion was scored by the investigator on severity of erythema, induration, and scaling according to a 5-point (0 to 4) severity scale with a maximum sum score for a plaque of 12. The TPSS was calculated as the sum of the scores for erythema, induration, and scaling; the score can vary in increments of 1 unit from 0 to 12.</description>

        <description>Combined assessment of lesion severity and area affected into single score. Body was divided into 4 sections: head, arms, trunk, legs.

        <title>Body Surface Area (BSA)</title>
        <description>Assessment of BSA with psoriasis was performed separately for 4 body regions: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin), and lower limbs (including buttocks). The percent surface area with psoriasis was estimated by means of the handprint method, where the full palmar hand of the participant (ie, the participant's fully extended palm, fingers and thumb together) represents approximately 1% of the total BSA. The number of handprints of psoriatic skin in a body region can be used to determine the extent (%) to which a body regions is involved with psoriasis. In each body region, the percent body region surface area with psoriasis is multiplied by the Body Region Weighting (head and neck=10%, upper limbs=5%, trunk [including axillae and groin]=3.33% and lower limbs [including buttocks]=2.5%). BSA (%)=0.1Sh + 0.2Sh+0.3St+0.4Sl, where S=body region suface area with psoriasis: h=head; u=upper limbs; t=trunk; l=lower limbs.</description>

        <title>Itch Severity Item (ISI) Score by Visit</title>
        <description>The severity of itch (pruritus) due to psoriasis was assessed using the ISI, a single-item, horizontal numeric rating scale. Participants were asked to rate &quot;your worst itching due to psoriasis over the past 24 hours&quot; on a numeric rating scale anchored by the terms &quot;No itching&quot; (0) and &quot;Worst possible itching&quot; (10) at the ends. the baseline is defined as the average of all available diary entries before Baseline/Day 1 and the in-clinic measurement on Baseline/day 1. Week 1 is the mean of daily values of study days 2 to 8 and Week 2 is the mean of daily values of study days 9 to 15.</description>

        <description>Target lesions were selected at baseline and followed for the duration of the study. Each target lesion was scored by the investigator on severity of erythema, induration, and scaling according to a 5-point (0 to 4) severity scale with a maximum sum score for a plaque of 12. The TPSS was calculated as the sum of the scores for erythema, induration, and scaling; the score can vary in increments of 1 unit from 0 to 12.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in TPSS by Visit</title>
        <description>Target lesions were selected at baseline and followed for the duration of the study. Each target lesion was scored by the investigator on severity of erythema, induration, and scaling according to a 5-point (0 to 4) severity scale with a maximum sum score for a plaque of 12. The TPSS was calculated as the sum of the scores for erythema, induration, and scaling; the score can vary in increments of 1 unit from 0 to 12. A negative value indicated improvment.</description>
