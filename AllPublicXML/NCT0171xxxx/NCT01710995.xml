          -  Able to voluntarily provide written informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Must understand the purposes and risks of the study and agree to follow the
             restrictions and schedule of procedures as defined in the protocol.

          -  Able and willing to have a nasogastric tube/probe inserted.
