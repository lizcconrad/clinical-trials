    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine long term effects in the training gain stage of the falls
      management exercise programs (FaME, from Skelton and Dinan) over 10 weeks on physical
      functional performance after mechanical SR-WBV, dance therapy and strength training
      intervention in a frail elderly population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is based on the guideline of falls management exercise programs (FaME; from
      Skelton and Dinan).

      The goals:

      Skilling up: improvement in neuromuscular control, postural control and strengthening of
      large muscle groups of the lower extremity.

      Training Gain: improvement of functional abilities. Maintaining the Gains: muscle growth,
      improvement of bone density and multi-sensory exercises.

      First, a pilot study was conducted with untrained elderly (&quot;Effects of stochastic resonance
      therapy on postural control in the elderly population&quot; (KEK Bern: No.228/09, Clinical Trial
      Registry: NCT01045746). Following, a second pilot study was conducted with frail elderly
      (Application of Whole-body Vibration With Stochastic Resonance in Frail Elderly: The Effects
      on Postural Control Clinical Trial Registry: NCT01543243).

      It was found that the selected chosen form of recruitment (presentation and advertisement)
      and the measurements methods are suitable for untrained elderly. But for frail elderly the
      chosen form of recruitment and the measurement methods are not sufficient.

      For this study, adapted measurement parameters for balance, strength and cognition will be
      used.

      The goals of this study:

      Evaluate the effects of

        -  functional lower extremity

        -  dynamic balance

        -  reaction time

        -  mobility

        -  muscle strength and cognition.

      This is a one-group pre-post design study and the participants will be recruited in Canton
      Bern - Switzerland.

    <description>The Expanded Timed Get Up-and-Go (ETGUG) will be used for measuring dynamic body balance. At 2, 8 and 10 meters along the walkway, markers were set. In the ETGUG test, times for the component tasks are measured at baseline and after a 10-week interventions period.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline during walking in ST and DT condition at 10 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>For the single task condition, the participants will be instructed to walk a distance of 20 meters at their self-selected walking speed. Total time were measured.
For the dual task condition, the participant had to count backwards from the number 250 in steps of 7 while walking the same distance at their self-selected walking speed. Total walking times were measured.
The time differences between the two tasks are evaluated at baseline and after a 10-week interventions period.</description>
