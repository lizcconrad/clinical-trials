             a history of congenital long QT syndrome, or any ECG abnormality that, in the opinion
             of the Investigator, would preclude safe participation in the study

          -  History of osteonecrosis of the hip or have evidence of structural bone abnormalities
             in the proximal femur on MRI scan that are considered clinically significant or may

             joint are not exclusionary

          -  Known concomitant disease(s) known to influence calcium metabolism including
             hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Paget's disease of bone, or any other concurrent
