    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the local and systemic inflammatory response and
      haemostatic alterations in the lungs after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) instillation and to
      determine the feasibility of imaging techniques to quantify lung inflammation in an adapted
      human endotoxin instillation model.

      The investigators will also explore whether glucocorticoid treatment can blunt LPS effects.
