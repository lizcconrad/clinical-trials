  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic lung diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), who
      perform regular physical activity, have improved health and wellbeing compared with those who
      do little exercise. The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether the use of a simple
      pedometer (step counter) to set targets for daily physical activity can encourage COPD
      patients referred for an 8-week pulmonary exercise based programme (PR) to be more active.
      The investigators also want to know whether the use of pedometers during PR can improve
      adherence, self-management and outcome in COPD.
