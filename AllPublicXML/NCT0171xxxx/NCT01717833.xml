      The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of NEMS as a rehabilitation tool for
      muscle weakness following critical illness. The investigators hypothesized that NEMS combined
      with exercise rehabilitation will have a beneficial role in restoration of muscle strength

    <textblock>
      Survivors of critical illness are presented with significant physical impairment that is
      associated with reduced functional ability and health -related quality of life both in the
      short and long-term.

      Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NEMS) has been proposed as an alternative exercise
      modality in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic heart
      failure, who cannot perform active exercise. NEMS has also been used as a preventive tool for
      intensive care unit (ICU) acquired weakness (ICUAW). Its role as a tool for post ICU
      rehabilitation has not been evaluated so far.

      A randomized intervention study was designed to assess the efficacy of NEMS, as a
      rehabilitative tool for critical illness survivors. The first day that patients are
      discharged from the ICU after stratified randomization are assigned to the NEMS group or to
      the control group. In the NEMS group, NEMS will be applied to both lower extremities of the
      NEMS -group simultaneously (quadriceps femoris muscle and peroneus longus) on a daily basis,
      along with a personalized exercise program. NEMS sessions will continue until patient
      discharge from hospital. In the control group, sham NEMS will be applied along with standard
      care when it comes to physiotherapy. At hospital discharge patients of both groups of will
      receive a rehabilitation booklet. Patients on the NEMS group that have significant muscle
      weakness will have NEMS sessions at home for a period of 2 months. Patients are evaluated at
      3 and 6 months after hospital discharge
