  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to measure the blood levels of the medicine called ropivacaine
      (local anesthetic) used to manage pain. Ropivacaine is a widely used medication and is not
      the subject of this study, but the investigators are studying how much of the drug can be
      found in the patient's blood, known as the blood level, of this medicine. Too much
      ropivacaine in a patient's blood can lead to local anesthetic toxicity. Once the nerve
      catheter is removed, local anesthetic toxicity is no longer a potential problem. However,
      there is little data on what ropivacaine blood levels are after having the catheter in for a
      long period of time(up to one month).

      The plasma ropivacaine samples will be assayed at the Department of Research Programs
      Laboratory (DRP) at WRNMMC. Once the whole blood sample has been centrifuged, the plasma will
      be removed with a glass pipette, placed in a storage container. The blood samples will be
      labeled with a non sequential serial number and will not include the time of the blood draw.
      This will blind the DRP laboratory to the patient's identity and timing of the blood draw.

        Military health care beneficiaries age 18 years and older presenting for upper or lower
        extremity surgery requiring continuous infusions of local anesthetic either at WRNMMC will
        be asked to participate in the study. We will recruit up to fifty patients for the study at
        WRNMMC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females 18 years and older, capable of providing informed consent indicating
             awareness of the investigational nature of the study, in keeping with institutional
             policy

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained from each patient prior to entering the
             study

          -  Patients must be scheduled to receive a continuous peripheral nerve catheter

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Refusal to have serial blood drawn

          -  Contraindication for a continuous peripheral nerve catheter (allergy to local
             anesthetic, infection at site of injection, elevated coagulation times (international
             normalized ratio (INR)&gt;1.5, partial thromboplastin time (PTT)&gt;38; these values are
             drawn as part of routine standard of care and those values will be checked prior to
             initial catheter insertion), therapeutic dosing of anticoagulation medication,
             moderate to severe head injury and moderate to severe traumatic brain injury

          -  Patients with a hematocrit &lt; 20. Complete Blood Counts (CBCs) are drawn as part of
             routine standard of care and will be followed by the Acute Pain Service. Although the
             CBCs and ropivacaine blood draws will not always coincide, we will always check the
             last hematocrit obtained prior to our blood draw

          -  Severe liver or renal disease (values greater than two times normal range)
