  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During primary PCI, stent deployment and post-dilatation are associated with no-reflow. The
      mechanisms for no reflow include distal embolization of thrombus, enhanced thrombus formation
      and vascular spasm. No reflow is associated with risk factors such as prolonged duration of
      ischaemia, heavy thrombus burden, persistent ST elevation and long stent length. ACTIVE
      HYPOTHESIS: once normal antegrade flow has been re-established with initial aspiration
      thrombectomy and/or balloon angioplasty at the beginning of primary PCI, compared with usual
      care with direct stenting, a strategy of deferred stenting for 4 -16 hours to permit the
      beneficial effects of normalized coronary blood flow and anti-thrombotic therapies will
      reduce the incidence of no reflow in at-risk STEMI patients. DESIGN: In consecutive STEMI
      patients with risk factors for no reflow and who have given informed consent, when normal
      flow has been established (TIMI 3) by initial aspiration thrombectomy and/or balloon
      angioplasty, participants will be randomized to deferred stenting or usual care with direct
      stenting. All patients will receive dual anti-platelet therapy. Patients who are randomized
      to deferred stenting will receive intravenous glycoprotein IIbIIIa inhibitor and
      anti-coagulation with low molecular weight heparin. Patients who are screened and not
      eligible to be randomized will be prospectively entered into a registry. Study assessments
      for feasibility, safety and efficacy will be prospectively performed. An independent clinical
      event committee will review all serious adverse events. Study endpoints will be subject to
      core laboratory analyses. The study is intended to inform the design of a larger multicentre
      clinical trial.

    <description>During primary PCI in STEMI, when TIMI 3 flow has been re-established with guide-wire, aspiration thrombectomy and/or balloon angioplasty, stenting is then deferred for a period of 4-16 hours following reperfusion. During this time, patients remain in the Coronary Care Unit and will receive intravenous tirofiban and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin 1 mg/kg)</description>
