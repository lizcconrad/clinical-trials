  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 6 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects who have already chosen to have a surgical
      facelift procedure will be enrolled. Subjects will receive selective Ulthera® ultrasound
      exposures in the pre-auricular regions. Subject will return for a follow-up visit up to 48
      hours post-treatment, on the day of their rhytidectomy. Study images will be obtained
      pretreatment, immediately post-treatment, and at the follow-up visit.

      This study is a prospective, single-center clinical trial. Subjects will be enrolled at the
      investigator's discretion if they meet inclusion/ exclusion criteria and provide written
      informed consent. Enrolled subjects will be treated with an assigned transducer based on
      their order of enrollment. At the study follow-up visit, subjects will undergo resection of
      the treated tissue for histological analysis prior to their planned rhytidectomy procedure.
