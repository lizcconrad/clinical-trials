      The UCSF Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) Consultation Service provides
      recruitment services and facilitates the enrollment of research participants into UCSF
      clinical studies. The Recruitment Services will be accessible to all researchers at UCSF and
      affiliated institutions and will address the common problems that investigators encounter in
      the recruitment process.

      Recruitment Services considered and integrated Committee on Human Research (CHR) and HIPAA
      regulations for ensuring human subject rights, participant privacy, and data security into
      the recruitment workflow and data collection/extraction methods. Recruitment Services,
      therefore, requests approval to implement these processes systematically for all studies that
      have already obtained CHR approval to begin recruitment activities.

      The UCSF Research Participant Registry (http://registry.ucsf.edu) is a secure, standalone
      database that actively collects and stores data from willing volunteers who visit its
      website. The UCSF Registry is a cornerstone of the UCSF Recruitment Service (RS). Both the
      Registry and the RS are among several initiatives implemented by the UCSF Clinical &amp;
      Translational Science Institute.

      The chief purpose of the RS is to facilitate the enrollment of research participants into
      UCSF clinical studies. The primary function of the Registry is to expand the pool of
      potential clinical research volunteers. The Registry stores self-reported identifiable health
      information in a searchable database that is compliant with the privacy requirements of the
      Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This information is then used by
      the RS for the future identification and recruitment of potentially eligible participants for
      specific UCSF studies.

      Registry participants whose data matches the major eligibility criteria for a specific study
      will be sent recruitment materials about the study. Contact information for the investigator
      or RS staff will also be included in the e-mailing. Participants are then free to choose
      whether to respond or ignore the study recruitment information.
