  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed protocol is a multi-site double-blind, placebo-controlled outpatient study of
      the safety and efficacy of Adderall-XR (MAS-ER) and topiramate in the treatment of cocaine
      dependence. 198 patients will be enrolled and 176 patients randomized in a 14-week trial. The
      proportion of participants achieving sustained cocaine abstinence for three consecutive weeks
      at the end of the study will be significantly greater for the combined pharmacotherapies
      group compared to the placebo group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the combination of an agent that increased baseline
      dopamine signaling (amphetamine) with one that reduced cocaine-induced dopamine release
      (topiramate) will improve dopamine regulation and be associated with improved cocaine use
      outcomes. 99 subjects at each of the two sites whom meet criteria for cocaine dependence, and
      all other study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assigned to the 14-week
      double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trial. Subjects will be randomized to receive
      either placebo or MAS-ER and topiramate. This proposal will test the hypothesis that MAS-ER
      and topiramate will promote cocaine abstinence. Participants who are randomized to the
      combination medication arm will have their dose titrated to 60 mg MAS-ER daily (over 2 weeks)
      and 200 mg topiramate a day (over 6 weeks) and maintained on this dose through week 13 of the
      trial. During week 14, participants will be tapered off both medications. All participants
      will receive a supportive behavioral treatment that emphasizes study procedure adherence.
      Starting in week one, all patients will receive incentives for compliance with study
      procedures on an escalating reinforcement schedule similar to that developed previously and
      not contingent on urine results. The purpose of the lead-out is to blind patients to the
      exact point of medication discontinuation and to provide naturalistic data on the effects of
      medication discontinuation. Moreover, a 3 month follow-up will be conducted to determine what
      happens to cocaine use after treatment discontinuation.
