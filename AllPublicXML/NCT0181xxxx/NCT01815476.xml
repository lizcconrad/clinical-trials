  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants undergoing radiation after breast conserving surgery for an early breast cancer
      (either Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS), or Early Stage Invasive breast cancer), and are at
      increased risk of developing a skin reaction because of their large breast size.

      After breast conserving surgery (also known as a 'lumpectomy'), women with either DCIS or
      early stage invasive breast cancer receive radiation to the breast to decrease the risk of
      cancer recurrence. Breast radiation is usually done with women lying on their back
      (&quot;supine&quot;). Some women develop temporary breakdown of the skin (moist desquamation). This
      skin reaction can be painful and has been linked to long term side effects such as chronic
      pain and decreased quality of life.

      This study is being done because women with large breasts have higher rates of skin breakdown
      (called 'moist desquamation') and breast pain during and shortly after radiation therapy is
      complete. It is unclear if such skin reactions and pain would be improved by alternating
      treatment position - namely lying on your belly (&quot;prone&quot;) during their radiation treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk of moist desquamation in large breasted women remains unacceptably high and
      reactions tends to be severe and produce significant permanent and delayed side effects.
      Evidence suggests that the use of a prone breast IMRT technique has the potential to decrease
      the risk of moist desquamation in large breasted women to the levels that are now seen when
      average/smaller breasted women are treated with supine IMRT. As prone breast XRT is currently
      only offered at 6 of 15 of the Ontario Cancer Centres polled for the purposes of providing
      motivation for this study, a multicentre RCT is feasible to confirm and quantify the
      improvement provided by the prone technique and provide Level 1 evidence for it to be adopted
      world-wide.

    <description>All participants will receive an adjuvant XRT dose to the breast of 50Gy in 25 fractions using an IMRT technique. In both arms, boost to the surgical bed using a mini-tangent technique will be delivered at the treating oncologist's discretion. Acceptable boost doses are 1600cGy/8 fractions, 1000cGy/5 fractions or 1325cGy/25 fractions as a simulatenous integrated boost. Participants randomized to the supine arm will be positioned supine on an angled breast board, with the ipsilateral arm abducted over her head. Participants randomized to the prone arm will be positioned prone on a prone breast board with both arms immobilized above the participant's head. The us of a cushion-like VaclocTM device is permitted at the treating physician's discretion. Radiation beams will be shaped to encompass the breast volume requiring treatment in both arms.</description>
