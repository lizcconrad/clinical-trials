  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Therapeutic exercise, especially stretch exercise and joint mobilization, remain the
           mainstay of conservative treatment of frozen shoulder.

             1. Nevertheless, shoulder pain during the physiotherapy reduces the treatment effect.

             2. Manipulation or arthroscopic release under general anesthesia may avoid pain during
                the intervention; however, increased risk of humeral shaft fracture and failure of
                release of pathological tissue were reported.

        2. We consider intra-articular injection is a compromized way, from a practical point of
           veiw, to reduce the pain during physiotherapy.

        3. We hypothesize that, intra-articular injection with lidocaine before joint mobilization
           and stretch exercise, can make the patient pain-free during physiotherapy, and the
           effect of combined therapy is superior to physiotherapy alone in the treatment of frozen
           shoulder.
