      Patients with prostate cancer should have the following examination including biopsy, serum
      PSA volume, prostate CT scan or MRI, bone scan, abdomen ultrasound, chest X ray, blood
      biochemistry, blood rout, ECG and testosterone.

      Two groups:

      First group:30 cases should be treated with iodine 125 seed implants 0.5 mc transperineal
      prostate implant +Zoladex 3.6mg im 1/28d (LHRH agonist, 3.6mg subcutaneous injection
      1/4weeks).

      Second group: 30 cases should be treated with Zoladex 3.6mg im 1/28d (LHRH agonist, 3.6mg
      subcutaneous injection 1/4weeks).

      PFS and PSA level will be the primary variables.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of written informed consent

          2. T2c-T3b N0 M0 (biopsy、 bone scan、 CT、 MRI)

          3. No Metastasis (bone scan、 CT、 MRI)

          4. PSA level&gt;10ng/ml

          5. Histological or cytological confirmation of prostate cancer

          6. Able to understand and comply with the requirements of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Having been treated with external radiation therapy or chemistry therapy.

          2. Clinical relevant disease and/or abnormalities (past or present), eg, significant
             cardiovascular, renal or liver disease, malignancy, gastro-intestinal disorders, or
             other conditions which could affect the absorption/elimination of drugs.

          3. Alanine amino transferase (ALT) or aspartate amino transferase (AST) greater than 2
             times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening findings that make it undesirable
             for the patient to participate in the study in the opinion of the investigator(s)

          4. In the opinion of the investigator(s), any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic
             disease (eg, currently unstable or unresolved respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, or renal
             disease).

          5. Contra-indications (eg, known or suspected allergy) to GnRH antagonists or
             excipients(non-active ingredients of investigational product).

          6. Treatment with a non-approved or investigational drug within 30 days before study
             entry.

          7. Bibulosity or drug abuse.
