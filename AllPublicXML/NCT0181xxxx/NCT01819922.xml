An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or congenital anomaly; or a medically important event. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 5-10 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state.

Criteria for clinically significant cardiovascular events: Blood pressure (BP) [supine systolic and sitting systolic BP (SBP): &lt;90 millimeter of mercury (mm Hg), &gt;=30 mmHg maximum increase and decrease from baseline in same posture; supine diastolic and sitting diastolic BP (DBP): &lt;50 mm Hg, &gt;=20 mmHg maximum increase and &gt;=30 mmHg maximum decrease from baseline in same posture]; pulse rate: supine and sitting: &lt;40 or &gt;120 bpm.</description>
          <population>Safety analysis set was defined as all participants who performed the peak aerobic capacity test, were randomized and who had received at least 1 dose of randomized treatment. Here, &quot;n&quot; specified the number of participants who were evaluable for the specified criteria.</population>

        <title>Cardiac Structure: Left Ventricular Volume</title>
        <description>Left ventricular volume was defined as volume of blood pumped from the left ventricle to the heart per beat. It was calculated using measurements of ventricle volumes from an echocardiogram and subtracting the volume of the blood in the ventricle at the end of a beat (called end-systolic volume) from the volume of blood just prior to the beat (called end-diastolic volume). Left ventricular volume was reported using modified Simpson’s technique.</description>

        <population>FAS was defined as all participants who performed the peak aerobic capacity test, were randomized and received at least 1 dose of randomized treatment, and had at least 1 PD measurement.</population>

        <description>Systolic ejection fraction was the fraction of the end-diastolic volume that was ejected out of left ventricle with each contraction, estimated by echocardiography. EDV was the volume of blood within a ventricle immediately before a contraction. Ejection fraction served as a general measure of the cardiac function of a participant.

        <description>Torsion is the twisting of an object due to an applied torque. It is expressed in newton metres. The left ventricle twists in systole storing potential energy and untwists (recoils) in diastole releasing the energy. Twist aids left ventricular ejection and untwist aids relaxation and ventricular filling. Therefore, rotation and torsion are important in cardiac mechanics. It was assessed by echocardiography using speckled tracking analysis .</description>
