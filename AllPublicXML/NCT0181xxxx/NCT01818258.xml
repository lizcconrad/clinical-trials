  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV-infected children from sub-Saharan Africa often present with severe malnutrition. In
      severe malnutrition, metabolic and/or gut structural derangement may lead to inadequate
      antiretroviral (ARV) absorption and/or erratic drug levels. The greater surface area to
      weight ratio in severely malnourished children could also place them at higher risk of under
      dosing compared to children with mild to moderate malnutrition. However, limited data are
      available on the pharmacokinetics of ARVs in severely malnourished children. This study will
      address this critical gap in knowledge by evaluating the PK of zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine
      (3TC), and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in severely malnourished children, compared to
      children with normal nutrition to mild malnutrition.
