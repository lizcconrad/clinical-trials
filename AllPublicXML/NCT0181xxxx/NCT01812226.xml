      The aim of this study is to compare the predictive validity and reliability of PEth testing
      at detecting alcohol use in post liver transplant patients. A prospective cohort study will
      be used to test the primary hypothesis. Subjects enrolled in the study will be followed for
      12 months with biomarker levels drawn at baseline, six and 12 months. The baseline interview
      will inquire about the previous 30 day alcohol and tobacco use; lifetime and 12 month
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV criteria for alcohol abuse and/or dependence; prior
      alcohol treatment; history of abstinence prior to transplant; co-morbid medical issues; and
      depression. The six and 12 months interview will focus on previous 30 day alcohol use. The
      baseline, six and 12 months interviews will be conducted face-to-face at each site. While
      many patients who receive a transplant do not live near the academic medical center that
      performed the surgery patient, they normally have a transplant clinic visit 1-2 times per
      year. Medical records and transplant databases will be assessed to assess the other variables
      of interest.

      Patients who have a positive PEth will be asked to have a confirmatory test performed 10-14
      days after a positive result (PEth &gt;20ng/ml). The rationale for this procedure is to
      determine the test retest reliability of this marker and as well as being able to correlate
      levels of drinking with changes in biomarker levels over time. There is limited information
      on the length of time PEth levels remain elevated in transplant patients after drinking
      episodes.

      Hypothesis H.1. PEth will have a significantly higher &quot;area under the Receiver Operating
      Characteristic (ROC) curve&quot; in a sample of post-transplant patients who report any alcohol
      use in the past 30 days compared to the control group.

      H.2. PEth will have a significantly higher &quot;area under the ROC curve&quot; in a sample of
      post-transplant patients who report daily alcohol use of &gt;40 grams/day (three drinks/day) in
      the past 30 days compared to the control group.

      H.3. PEth will have a significantly higher &quot;area under the ROC curve&quot; in a sample of
      post-transplant patients who report heavy episodic drinking (&gt;60 grams of alcohol, eight or
      more occasions in the past 30 days) compared to the control group.

      H.4. PEth levels will be &lt;20 ng/ml in the control sample of 50 post transplant patients who
      do not have a history of alcohol dependence or alcohol related liver disease.

      H.5. The test-retest reliability of PEth will be &gt;0.90.

    <measure>specificity of PEth to detect alcohol use among post-transplant patients</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The criteria standard on which we will base the specificity will be a combination of patient self-report, family member report and clinician/medical record data.
Subjects in whom any concern of current alcohol use, from any of these sources, would be considered a positive for current drinking.
The PEth levels would then be compared to this standard of current alcohol use
Data from previous research suggests PEth has a specificity close to 100%</description>
