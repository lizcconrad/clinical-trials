      The purpose of this exploratory phase II study is to assess the effectiveness and safety
      profile of Endostar®(Recombinant Human Endostatin Injection) plus Gemcitabine and Docetaxel
      in treatment of soft tissue sarcoma patients with pulmonary metastases.

    <textblock>
      Anticipated 30 subjects will be enrolled to receive Endostar, Gemcitabine and Docetaxel.
      Endostar at a dosage of 7.5 mg/m2 will be administered on Day 1-14 of each cycle. Gemcitabine
      (1000 mg/m2) will be administered on Day 1 and Day 8 of each cycle. Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) will
      be administered on Day 2 of each cycle. An individual cycle of therapy will be defined as a
      3-week (21-day) period. Cycles will be repeated every 3 weeks. Multiple cycles may be
      administered until the subject is PD or until a maximum of 6 cycles. Time-to-progression
      (TTP) will be assessed using the Kaplan Meier method. Overall response rate (ORR) as well as
      individual categories of response (CR, PR, SD, and PD) will be determined using RECIST
      (v1.1). Evaluation of 1- and 2-year overall survival will also be performed. Safety measures
      will be recorded using the NCI-CTCAE (v4.0).
