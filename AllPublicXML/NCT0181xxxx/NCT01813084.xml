    <textblock>
      RV1729 is a new medicine being developed for possible treatment of asthma and smoking related
      lung disease (also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - COPD).

      The main purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of single and repeat doses of RV1729.
