  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the first-line treatment of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in
      Hong Kong. Despite the advances in antibiotic therapy and connecting system, recurrent
      peritonitis remains the major cause of peritoneal failure. A reliable predictor of relapsing
      peritonitis is invaluable in the management of PD peritonitis. Recent studies showed that
      bacterial-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) fragments are present in clinically used fluids
      such as dialysis fluid. LPS are thought to be derived from microorganisms inhabiting body
      fluid. The investigators hypothesize that the presence of LPS in PD effluent is a predictor
      of relapsing peritonitis in PD patients. The investigators plan to study 300 patients with PD
      peritonitis. After inform consent, specimens of PD effluent will be collected on the day of
      initiating antibiotic treatment, every 5 days until the day of completing antibiotic
      treatment, and then 28 days later for the test of LPS level. All patients will be followed
      for one year after completion of antibiotic therapy for the development of relapsing,
      recurrent, or repeat peritonitis episodes. Our study would explore the use of detecting LPS
      in PD effluent as a non-invasive tests for the prediction of relapsing peritonitis.
