      This study involves screening for portal vein thrombosis and portal hypertension in patients
      with Philadelphia negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). These include polycythemia
      vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and myelofibrosis.

      Portal vein thrombosis and portal hypertension are serious complications that are often seen
      in myeloproliferative patients. These complications are usually diagnosed when patients
      become symptomatic, and are often already at an advanced stage. They can further progress to
      cause non-reversible damage to the liver, also called cirrhosis of the liver. As a result of
      this, patients often accumulate fluid in the abdomen which is ascites; and can develop
      swelling of veins in the lining of the esophagus known as varices. If untreated, varices have
      the risk of rupturing resulting in life-threatening bleeding. When diagnosed at an advanced
      stage, the treatment is usually supportive therapy and there are no treatments available at
      present which can reverse these conditions.

      This study is looking at screening for these two conditions using Doppler ultrasound and
      upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
