    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that the IL-1A (+4895), IL-1B (+3954), and IL-1RN gene
      polymorphisms may be associated with PLBW. Smoking has been well documented by numerous
      studies as a major environmental risk factor for periodontitis and adverse pregnancy
      outcomes. Therefore, the investigators only selected non-smoking individuals in this study as
      the smoking-related risk could obscure the polymorphism-related increase in risk for
      periodontitis and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study aimed to determine the association
      between IL-1A (+4895), IL-1B (+3954), and IL-1RN polymorphisms with adverse pregnancy
      outcomes and periodontitis in a non-smoking Turkish population.

      Pregnant women between 18-35 years of age with single gestation and with ≥20 on-crowded teeth
      excluding third molars were included in this study. Subjects were divided into normal birth
      (NB) and PLBW groups on the basis of their pregnancy outcome. Women who delivered an infant
      with a birth weight of more than 2500 g after 37 weeks of gestation were placed in the NB
      group. Women who delivered infants whose birth weight was below 2500 g or before 37 weeks of
      gestation were placed in the PLBW group. Current/past tobacco user, alcohol abuse, history of
      high-risk gestation, hypertension, gestational diabetes, any systemic disease and placenta
      previa were the exclusion criteria for this study. Maternal, obstetric, and demographic
      factors such as maternal age, maternal education, regular prenatal care, genitourinary tract
      infections during pregnancy, total number of births, previous PLBW, and antibiotic use during
      the pregnancy period were also recorded.
