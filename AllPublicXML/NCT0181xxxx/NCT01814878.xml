      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of extended release (ER)
      tramadol hydrochloride (HCl)/acetaminophen with immediate release (IR) tramadol
      HCl/acetaminophen in participants with moderate to severe (very serious, life threatening)
      postoperative pain.

      This study is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), multicenter (when more than 1
      hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), active-controlled,
      parallel group (each group of participants will be treated at the same time), double-blind
      (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives) study.
      The duration of the treatment will be 2 days and will be conducted in 4 periods: screening
      period (from 33 to 2 days before study drug administration to the first surgical incision),
      surgical period (to 1 day before study drug administration), qualification period (1 day) and
      double-blind treatment period (1 to 2 days). Participants will be randomly assigned to 2
      groups: study drug treatment group (ER) and comparator treatment group (IR). Participants
      will be administered 2 tablets of ER tramadol HCl (75 milligram [mg])/acetaminophen (650 mg)
      along with 2 tablets of placebo matching to IR tramadol HCl/acetaminophen in study drug
      treatment group; and 2 tablets of IR tramadol HCl (37.5 mg)/acetaminophen (325 mg) along with
      2 tablets of placebo matching to ER tramadol HCl/acetaminophen in comparator treatment group
      respectively at 0, 12, 24 and 36 hours. Participants will also be administered 2 tablets of
      placebo matching to IR tramadol HCl/acetaminophen in study drug treatment group; and 2
      tablets of IR tramadol HCl/acetaminophen in comparator treatment group respectively at 6, 18,
      30 and 42 hours. Participants will be administered investigational product at 6-hour interval
      from the time of the first investigational product administration over 48 hours. Efficacy
      will be assessed using 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS). Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) at Hour 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Hour 48</time_frame>
    <description>The SPID is time-weighted sum of all observations of pain intensity difference (PID) collected at each measurement time point from Baseline to 48 hours. PID: Baseline pain intensity (PI) minus current PI; PI was assessed using 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS, 0=no pain to 10=worst pain imaginable). PI score ranges from 0-3 where 0=no pain and 3=severe pain. PI score of 0=NRS score of 0, PI score of 1=NRS score &gt;=1 and &lt;=3, PI score of 2=NRS score of &gt;=4 and &lt;=6 and PI score of 3=NRS score of &gt;=7 and &lt;=10. Total score for SPID at 48 hours (SPID48) ranges from -144 (worst) to 144 (best).</description>

    <measure>Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) Score</measure>

    <description>Pain relief was measured on a 5-point categorical scale of 0-4 (0=no change, 1=slight relief, 2=moderate relief, 3=fair relief, 4=pain resolved completely). TOTPAR was calculated as the time-weighted sum over all pain relief up to 48 hours. Total score ranges from 0 (worst) to 24 (best) for TOTPAR6, 0 (worst) to 48 (best) for TOTPAR12, 0 (worst) to 96 (best) for TOTPAR24 and 0 (worst) to 192 (best) for TOTPAR48.</description>

    <description>The SPRID is sum of SPID and TOTPAR. In SPID, PI score ranges from 0-3 where 0=no pain and 3=severe pain. PI score of 0=NRS score of 0, PI score of 1=NRS score &gt;=1 and &lt;= 3, PI score of 2=NRS score of &gt;=4 and &lt;=6 and PI score of 3=NRS score of &gt;=7 and &lt;=10. In TOTPAR, pain relief score ranges from 0-4 (0=no change, 1=slight relief, 2=moderate relief, 3=fair relief, 4=pain resolved completely).

          <title>Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) Score</title>
          <description>Pain relief was measured on a 5-point categorical scale of 0-4 (0=no change, 1=slight relief, 2=moderate relief, 3=fair relief, 4=pain resolved completely). TOTPAR was calculated as the time-weighted sum over all pain relief up to 48 hours. Total score ranges from 0 (worst) to 24 (best) for TOTPAR6, 0 (worst) to 48 (best) for TOTPAR12, 0 (worst) to 96 (best) for TOTPAR24 and 0 (worst) to 192 (best) for TOTPAR48.</description>

In TOTPAR, pain relief score ranges from 0-4 (0=no change, 1=slight relief, 2=moderate relief, 3=fair relief, 4=pain resolved completely).
