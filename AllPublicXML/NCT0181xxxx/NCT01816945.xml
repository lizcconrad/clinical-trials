  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' mobile application-based community, termed Momba, will provide a
      bi-directional flow of information on maternal and infant mental health to traditionally
      underrepresented groups of mothers and their infants. The overall goal of this mobile
      application-based community of low-income postpartum women and infants is to increase the
      social support, social networks, and social capital of low-income mothers; thereby, leading
      to a positive change in the health behaviors, utilization of health services, and mental
      health status of both mothers and their infants.

    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine, through a 15-month pilot randomized controlled trial, the potential feasibility, acceptability, and methodological parameters (proportion of eligible and willing study participants, rate of subject attrition, effect size, and power calculations) that are necessary to design a subsequent, appropriately powered, randomized controlled trial of Momba for new mothers.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Test the proper operating and functioning of the MOMBA application</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>To develop through a 15-month pilot study, a novel application, Momba, to promote mental health among low-income mothers recruited from a large, urban hospital. Subjects will be trained (together) on the operating and functions (including how to use the privacy settings) of the Momba application.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability and performance of structured questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Via 15 months of application participation, we will assess the acceptability and performance of structured questionnaires in the categories of maternal satisfaction, utilization of intervention and adherence to protocol. Measures will be administered via the web- based application utilizing valid and reliable instruments. Participants will also complete Intake and 12 month Follow-up interviews.</description>
