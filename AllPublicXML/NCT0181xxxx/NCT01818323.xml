  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to investigate the safety of T4 immunotherapy when
      administered to treat loco-regional disease in Squamous Cell Cancer of the Head and Neck
      (SCCHN) that is not suitable for conventional active therapy.

      The investigators propose to conduct an open-labelled, non-randomized, dose-escalation phase
      I trial in which autologous T4+ T-cells are administered to patients with SCCHN. T-cells will
      be engineered to express a second generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) named T1E28z.
      Engineered T-cells will be injected directly into the tumour site. Patients will not be
      lymphodepleted. A classical 3+3 design will be employed, with dose escalation from 10^7
      through to 10^9 transduced T4+ T-cells, dependent upon toxicity monitoring. It is anticipated
      that up to 30 patients will be enrolled over the course of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically and/ or cytologically confirmed SCCHN.

          2. 18 years or older.

          3. Locally advanced and/ or recurrent head and neck cancer with or without metastatic
             disease (excluding brain metastases) for whom no standard therapy remains or is
             suitable.

          4. Regarding previous treatment, patients may have received prior systemic therapy,
             including platinum chemotherapy, at least one month earlier. In the presence of
             metastatic disease, recent short-course palliative radiotherapy to non-target site(s)
             is allowed.

          5. Those who refuse palliative treatment may be eligible for participation. However,
             their reasons for not opting for palliative treatment must be explored thoroughly.

          6. At least one loco-regional target lesion measurable by RECIST v1.1 criteria on CT or
             MRI scanning within four weeks of enrolment, and amenable to intra-tumoral injection.

          7. Eastern Co-operative Oncology Performance Status of 0-2.

          8. Normal cardiac function as assessed by electrocardiography and either echocardiography
             (ECHO), or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scanning. Left ventricular ejection fraction
             must be &gt; 50%. Assessment must take place within four weeks of enrolment.

          9. Haematology results within seven days of enrolment: neutrophils &gt;1.5 x 109/L,
             platelets &gt;100 x 109/L, haemoglobin &gt;9g/dl, INR &lt;1.5.

             potential (WOCB) who receive cyclophosphamide must adhere to these contraceptive
             requirements during the trial and until 3 months after the last dose of
