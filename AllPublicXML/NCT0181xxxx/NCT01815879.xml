      Investigator initiated multi-institutional retrospective review of clinical and radiographic
      outcomes after 90Y resin microsphere radioembolization for metastatic colorectal liver
      metastases in the USA. The target is for at least 1,000 evaluable patients with 12+ weeks

      Investigator initiated multi-institutional retrospective review of clinical and radiographic
      outcomes after 90Y resin microsphere radioembolization for metastatic colorectal liver
      metastases in the USA. The target is for at least 1,000 evaluable patients with 12+ weeks
      follow up. Objectives:

      Independent data collection and reporting of pre treatment and 12 week post treatment
      clinical, radiographic and radiation parameters and outcomes in patients treated in the USA
      from 2002-2010. Data beyond 12 weeks will be collected and highly desirable, however as a
      minimum all patients will have 12 week follow up.
