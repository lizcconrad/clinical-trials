      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of Subcutaneous Nerve
      Stimulation (SQS) (also known as Peripheral Nerve Stimulation [PNS]) in the reduction of
      chronic, intractable post-surgical back pain in adults.

    <measure>Number of Back Pain Responders (Subjects Who Achieve at Least a 50% Reduction in Average Back Pain With no Increase in Prescription Pain Medications) From Baseline to Month 3 Post-device Activation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of responders in Treatment and Control groups. Subjects reported typical back pain (0=no pain, 10=worst pain) during the Baseline (BL) and Blinded Phase (M3) periods. Percentage reduction in average back pain was calculated as (BL-M3)/BL. Subjects with at least a 50% reduction in average back pain between Baseline and Month 3, with no increase in prescribed pain medications, were considered responders.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the difference in average improvement in disability (as measured by Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)) from Baseline to Month 3 between the Treatment and Control groups. ODI ranges from 0% (no disability) -100% (greatest disability). Change is calculated as Baseline - Month 3 with a positive change indicating improvement in disability. Subjects with missing Baseline and/or Month 3 ODI assessments were counted as no change (Baseline - Month 3 = 0).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Compare difference in number of subjects satisfied with therapy between the Treatment and Control groups at Month 3. Subjects who reported they were very or somewhat satisfied with the therapy were counted as satisfied. Subjects with no satisfaction response were excluded from the analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life: Physical</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the average change in quality of life (as measured by Short Form Health Survey (SF36 v2): Physical component score (PCS)) from Baseline to Month 3 between subjects in the Treatment and Control groups. The PCS ranges from 0 (worst possible physicial quality of life) to 100 (best possible physical quality of life). Change was calculated as Month 3 - Baseline, with a positive difference indicating improvement in physical quality of life. Subjects with missing Baseline and/or Month 3 SF-36: PCS assessments were counted as no change (Month 3 - Baseline = 0).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life: Mental</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the average change in quality of life (as measured by Short Form Health Survey (SF36 v2): Mental component score (MCS)) from Baseline to Month 3 between subjects in the Treatment and Control groups. The MCS ranges from 0 (worst possible mental quality of life) to 100 (best possible mental quality of life). Change was calculated as Month 3 - Baseline, with a positive difference indicating improvement in mental quality of life. Subjects with missing Baseline and/or Month 3 SF-36: MCS assessments were counted as no change (Month 3 - Baseline = 0).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Worst Back Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the average improvement in worst back pain from Baseline to Month 3 between the Treatment and Control groups. Subjects reported worst back pain (0 (no pain) - 10 (worst pain)) during the Baseline and Blinded Phase (Month 3) periods. Change was calculated as Baseline - Month 3, with a positive change indicating improvement in worst back pain.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This study enrolled adult patients with chronic, intractable post-surgical back pain. First enrollment was in April 2013. Enrollment was suspended in September 2014 due to slow enrollment. The last subject visit was in March 2016. The planned enrollment was 323 subjects, with 218 randomized. Actual enrollment was 137 subjects with 62 randomized.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 137 enrolled subjects, 62 were implanted and randomized. Of the 75 subjects who discontinued from the study prior to randomization, 54 did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, 12 withdrew consent or declined device implant, 3 discontinued due to study suspension, and 6 discontinued for other reasons.</pre_assignment_details>

            <groups_desc>The original sample size estimate for the primary objective was based on the following assumptions: 109 subjects in each arm with a responder rate of 22% in the Control group and 40% in the Treatment group, and a one-sided α= 0.05 using a Z test with unpooled variance, would result in 90% power. Because the study terminated early, the actual sample size (32 in Treatment, 30 in Control) resulted in 47% power under the same assumptions.</groups_desc>
