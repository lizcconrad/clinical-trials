  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress is involved in the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy. The
      superoxide-generating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase 2 (NOX2, encoded by
      the CYBB gene) and the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) play opposing roles
      in the balance of cellular redox status. In the present study, we investigated associations
      of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the regulatory regions of CYBB and GPX4 with
      kidney disease in patients with type 1 diabetes.

      In the present study, three cohorts of type 1 diabetic patients (one Brazilian and two
      French/Belgium cohorts) were studied for the association with diabetic nephropathy (DN) with
      a total of 1396 patients. The patients were classified according to the urinary
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) in absence of
      nephropathy, defined as ACR &lt;30 mg/g or UAER &lt; 20 µg/min or &lt; 20 mg/L and plasma creatinine
      &lt;1.7 mg/dL; incipient nephropathy, defined as persistent microalbuminuria (ACR 30 - 300 mg/g
      of creatinine or UAER 20 - 200 µg/min or 20 - 200 mg/L) and plasma creatinine &lt;1.7 mg/dL;
      established diabetic nephropathy, defined as past or present macroalbuminuria (ACR &gt;300 mg/g
      of creatinine or UAER &gt;200 µg/min or &gt; 200 mg/L) and plasma creatinine &lt;1.7 mg/dL; advanced
      diabetic nephropathy, defined as past or present macroalbuminuria, plasma creatinine &gt;1.7
      mg/dL and any renal replacement therapy. Genotyping of polymorphisms was performed by Real
      Time PCR using fluorescent-labelled probes.

        Three cohorts pf type 1 diabetic patients were used for the present study. The first one is
        a Brazilian cohort with 451 patients recruited in diabetes/endocrinology departments of
        three university hospitals in the cities of São Paulo (SP), Campinas (SP) and Porto Alegre
        (RS), Brazil between October 2004 and October 2012. The second one is a French/Belgium
        cohort with 501 patients recruited from both countries between November 1998 to December
        2000. The third cohort is a French/Belgium cohort with 444 patients recruited from both
        countries between May 1994 to April 1995.
