      This study was advocated by Institute of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, China Academy
      of Chinese Medical Sciences in December 2012.

      It was funded by China major scientific and technological specialized project for
      'significant new formulation of new drugs'.

      The purpose of this study is to make a cohort event monitoring to see whether and how
      Shenqifuzheng injection in hospital results in adverse events or adverse drug reactions.

      It is very common that Chinese Medicine Injection used in hospitals in mainland China.
      However safety problems rose in recent years. There could be many uncertain factors influence
      Chinese Medicine Injection in clinical practice.

      Safety surveillance on Chinese Medicine injection is an important problem that needs to be
      sorted out through large sample observational study.

      A registry study for Shenqifuzheng injection safety surveillance with 30000 patients will be
      conducted from Jan.2013 to Dec.2014.

      Eligibility criteria Patients who will use Shenqifuzheng injection in selected hospitals

    <time_frame>to assess Shenqifuzheng's 'adverse event' and 'drug adverse reaction' during patients' hospital stay, administration information of Shenqifuzheng will be registered every day. The registry procedure will last 3 years only for patients using Shenqifuzheng</time_frame>
    <description>All patients will be measured and assessed at the time Shenqifuzheng is administered to them until they discharge. Patients using Shenqifuzheng will be registered on a registration form including disease background, Shenqifuzheng's administration, and extraction information from hospital information system. An adverse event or drug adverse reaction form also will be used to describe any doubted symptoms or signs from patients. A judgment will be made by doctors directly and a further analysis will be conducted by researchers to decide those potential side effects of Shenqifuzheng</description>
