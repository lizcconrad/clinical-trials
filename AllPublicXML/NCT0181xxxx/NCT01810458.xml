  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that individuals with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency have ongoing liver
      injury which is not detected by the usual blood tests used to look at liver function. This
      ongoing liver injury leads to cirrhosis in a significant number of adults with AAT
      deficiency.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our overarching hypothesis is that liver disease in adults with AAT deficiency is the result
      of the accumulation of the abnormally folded protein within the endoplasmic reticulum of the
      hepatocyte. In some individuals, the intrinsic cellular mechanisms of the hepatocyte are
      sufficient to clear adequate amounts of the abnormally folded protein such that liver disease
      does not occur. In AAT deficient individuals who develop liver disease, environmental and
      other genetic factors stress the hepatocyte, and the normal cellular mechanisms that maintain
      homeostasis are disrupted, leading to liver disease.

      For this proposal, our hypothesis is that the prevalence of liver disease in adults with AAT
      is higher than previously reported because liver injury and fibrosis is not accurately
      detected by available routine liver testing. Testing this hypothesis will require an initial
      evaluation for liver disease with liver function testing and imaging, and then histologic
      confirmation by liver biopsy.

    <description>Liver tissue collected at the time of the first biopsy will be sent for testing which will evaluate for epigenetic markers of liver fibrosis.

    <description>The presence and progression of liver fibrosis will be evaluated by an abdominal ultrasound done at the screening visit, year 1 visit, year 2 visit, and year 3 visit. A liver biopsy will be done if a subject passes the screening visit and will be repeated at the year 3 study visit if the initial liver biopsy reveals liver fibrosis between stages 2 - 4.</description>

    <description>Participants will get a history and physical (H&amp;P) and have an intravenous catheter (IV) placed, for blood draws, at the screening and years 1-3 visits. An IV will also be placed at the liver biopsy visit(s) for the administration of medication. An abdominal ultrasound will be done at the screening and year 3 visits along with the completion of a liver questionnaire. Finally, participants will have a liver biopsy done, with the use of lidocaine, lorazepam, or midazolam and fentanyl, after the screening visit and potentially at the year 3 study visit, depending on the results of the first liver biopsy. Participants who experience pain after the liver biopsy may receive acetaminophen or oxycodone/acetaminophen. Any subject experiencing nausea may receive ondansetron.</description>

             participation in and completion of the study or any condition, which in the opinion of
             the investigator would make the patient unsuitable for enrollment;

          -  Active substance abuse including, but not limited to, alcohol, intravenous or, inhaled
             drugs;

          -  History of adverse reactions or allergy to the local anesthetic, sedative, or

             testing schedule; and

          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating at time of enrollment. Should a female subject
             become pregnant during the follow up period after the initial liver biopsy, continued
             participation would be allowed if the following conditions are met: the subject
             desires to continue; a discussion of risk and benefits of participation between the
             principal investigator and the subject has occurred; and no liver biopsy would be
             performed in the follow up period.
