  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are very few level 1 or level 2 evidence studies that examine postoperative
      rehabilitation of rotator cuff repair and shoulder arthroplasty. A systematic review of level
      1 or level 2 evidence studies was performed (Baumgarten et al., Sports Health, 2009) that
      found only four studies that examined rotator cuff repair rehabilitation.

      The current study was performed to determine if there is a significant difference in passive
      glenohumeral joint range of motion, active glenohumeral joint range of motion, scapular
      substitution, and subjects measured outcome scores (clinimetrics) in patients who undergo
      rotator cuff repair when treated postoperatively with pulley exercises compared to Jackins'
      exercises.

      Null Hypothesis: There will be no significant difference in passive range of motion, active
      range of motion, scapular substitution, and subject measured outcomes scores in subjects who
      undergo rotator cuff repair when treated with pulley exercises compared to Jackins'
      exercises.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scapulothoracic substitution for forward elevation is seen clinically when patients have
      shoulder pain. The patient uses the trapezius musculature to superiorly elevate the upper
      extremity instead of using the deltoid and the rotator cuff for upper extremity elevation.
      Scapulothoracic substitution does not occur in healthy shoulders. Excessive scapular movement
      can be due to an attempt to substitute for poorly functioning shoulder musculature or
      tightness of the capsular structures of the glenohumeral joint.

      Pulleys have been used in postoperative shoulder rehabilitation to improve passive as well as
      active range of motion and develop strength. Jackins described a series of exercises that are
      used to improve active range of motion and develop strength without the use of pulleys. The
      use of pulleys in the post-operative care for patients who have had shoulder surgery is
      thought to contribute to excessive scapular motion. To date, there has not been any study
      that compares the use of pulleys and Jackins' exercises with respect to active range of
      motion, scapulothoracic substitution, and objective patient outcomes measures. Due to the
      lack of level 1 or 2 evidence postoperative rehabilitation studies, a prospective randomized
      study should be performed on patients that have underwent rotator cuff repair.

    <description>Jackin's exercises were initially designed for patients with difficulty performing forward elevation. The patient initially is positioned supine to perform shoulder flexion. When the patient can actively elevate in the supine position, one to two pounds of weight is placed in the patients hand and the patient is asked to repeat the maneuver of supine active elevation. When the patient can do this with little difficulty, the head of the bed is elevated approximately 20 degrees from the supine position and the sequence is repeated. Once the patient is able to perform flexion in this elevated head position, the inclination of the patient is increased in 20 degree increments until the patient is able to perform upright sitting shoulder flexion.</description>
