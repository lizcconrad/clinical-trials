    <textblock>
      First, the purpose of the first year study will examine the joint capsule/muscular and
      shoulder physical activity hypotheses related to ROM deficits as well as functional
      disability in subjects with Stiff shoulders. Second, the purpose of the second and third year
      study will investigate the long-term effect of 12-week joint mobilization, 12-week joint
      mobilization plus soft tissue mobilization/massage, and 12-week joint mobilization plus soft
      tissue mobilization/massage with appropriate shoulder physical activity guide on subjects
      with Stiff shoulders. Subjects: First year: thirty subjects with Stiff shoulders will be
      recruited. Second and third years: forty-five subjects with Stiff shoulders for one year
      follow-up. Methods: For the measurement outcomes; functional disability, rotation range of
      motion, joint mobility, muscle stiffness, and shoulder physical activity will be measured by
      self-reported Flexi-level Scale of Shoulder Function or performance-based motion analysis,
      goniometer, uni-axis load cell and electromagnetic tracking sensor, myotonometer, and
      accelerometers, respectively.
