    <textblock>
      This study will include two groups (cohorts) of participants:

      In Group A, this study will look at the amount of LY2605541 that is present in the body after
      it is injected in 3 different locations in the body of the same participant. At least 16 days
      will pass between each injection.

      In Group B, the study will look at how the body absorbs, distributes, and gets rid of
      LY2605541 in participants over age 65.

      Participants may enroll in only one group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cohort A: are overtly healthy male or female participants, as determined by medical
             history and physical examination, aged ≥18 to ≤55 years of age

          -  Cohort B: are male or female elderly (≥65 years of age) participants that are overtly
             healthy, or have stable, chronic medical conditions [including Type 2 Diabetes
             Mellitus (T2DM)] that, in the investigator's opinion, will not significantly alter the
             disposition of the drug, will not place the participant at increased risk by
             participating in the study, and will not interfere with interpretation of the data

          -  Male participants agree to use a reliable method of birth control during the study and
             for 3 months following the last dose of the investigational product

          -  Female participants are women of child-bearing potential who test negative for
             pregnancy at the time of screening based on a urine pregnancy test and agree to use a
             reliable method of birth control during the study and for 1 month following the last
             dose of the investigational product

          -  Female participants are post-menopausal women, or women not of child-bearing potential
             due to surgical sterilization (at least 3 months after surgical hysterectomy, or at

             clinical research unit (CRU)

        Healthy Participants - Cohort A

          -  Have Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), or a fasting
             blood glucose (BG) greater than (&gt;) 110 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) [6.1
             millimoles per liter (mmol/L)] with a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of &gt;6.2%

          -  Intend to use over-the-counter medication within the 7 days or prescription medication

             supplements, occasional paracetamol, thyroxine replacement therapy, and hormone
             replacement therapy). Antihypertensive and lipid lowering agents are permitted, but
             must have been administered at stable dose(s) for at least 1 month

        Elderly Participants - Cohort B

          -  Have T1DM

          -  Are T2DM participants that require insulin treatment, or have a HbA1c of &gt;10%

          -  Have started new chronic medication(s) or changed the dose of an existing chronic
             medication &lt;1 month prior to dosing. Participants are permitted to continue ongoing
             chronic medications (for example antihypertensive agents, aspirin, non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatory drugs, lipid lowering agents, thyroxine, hormone replacement
             therapy, and/or oral anti-diabetic if participants have T2DM). Other stable chronic
             conditions may be permitted if deemed acceptable by the investigators and Lilly
             clinical pharmacologist or clinical research physician
