  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the safety (including the effect on cardiac
      intervals), tolerability, the effects on the Central Nervous System (CNS), as well as the CNS
      side effect profile of single ascending doses of ASP3652 in healthy, Caucasian male and
      female subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject receives 3 single ascending doses of ASP3652 and a single dose of matching
      placebo during one randomly selected investigational period. Randomization is conducted
      separately for males and females.

      The washout period between dosing occasions is at least 7 days. Screening takes place from
      Day -22 to Day -2. Subjects are admitted to the clinic in the afternoon of Day -1 of
      investigational period 1, 2, 3 and 4 for pre-dose assessments.

      On Day -1 of all investigational periods, subjects do not take any food or drink for at least
      10 hours before the anticipated dosing time on Day 1. For the duration of their stay in the
      clinic, subjects are not allowed to consume caffeine or other xanthine-containing drinks.

      The subjects are discharged on Day 4 of each investigational period. The End of Study Visit
      (ESV) is planned to take place 7-14 days after early discharge or after Day 4 of
      investigational period 4.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is white and of Caucasian origin.

          -  Body Mass Index more than or equal to 18.5 and less than 30.0kg/m2.

          -  Male subject must agree to practice an adequate contraceptive method with female
             sexual partners to prevent pregnancy.

          -  Female subject must agree to practice an adequate contraceptive method with male
             sexual partners to prevent pregnancy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy within 6 months before screening assessment or breast feeding within 3
             months before screening (for females subjects only).

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to ASP3652, or any components of the formulation
             used.

          -  A mean QTc(F) interval of &gt;430 ms (for males) and &gt;450 ms (for females) after
             triplicate measurements, a history of unexplained syncope, cardiac arrest, unexplained
             cardiac arrhythmias or torsades de pointes, structural heart disease, or a family
             history of Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). In case of an abnormal QTc(F) interval, the
             assessment may be repeated once (in triplicate). If the QTc(F) interval exceeds the
             limits, two additional Electrocardiogram (ECG)s can be recorded and the average of the
             three QTc(F) values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.
