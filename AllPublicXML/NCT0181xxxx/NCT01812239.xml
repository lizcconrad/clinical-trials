      A Multicenter, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Randomized Clinical Trial of Vaginal
      Progesterone to Prevent Early Preterm Birth In Twin Pregnancy with Short Cervix.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of asymptomatic women
      with twin pregnancy and a cervix length 10 mm to 25 mm discovered on a routine screening
      transvaginal sonogram between 20w0d to 24w0d gestational age. Women will be randomized in
      either the in-patient or out-patient setting (1:1) to a daily vaginal application of
      micronized progesterone cream(200 mg)vs. placebo to determine if daily vaginal progesterone
      administration reduces the risk of preterm birth prior to 34w0d of gestation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Birth of baby before 34 weeks of gestation</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of delivery</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is defined as Early Preterm Birth, that is, birth before 34weeks of gestation. A birth at 33weeks 6days or earlier is considered to have the primary outcome. A birth at 34weeks 0days or later does not have the primary outcome. Births for any reason before 34weeks 0days are considered to have the primary outcome, whether they are &quot;spontaneous&quot; or not.</description>

    <measure>Rate of &quot;spontaneous birth&quot; before 34weeks of gestation</measure>
    <time_frame>from randomization to birth of the baby - up to 15 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of &quot;spontaneous birth&quot; before 34weeks of gestation. Spontaneous births are those whose underlying cause is judged to be due to preterm labor, prelabor rupture of membranes, or cervical insufficiency. (In contradistinction, &quot;indicated&quot; deliveries are those due to preeclampsia, fetal growth problems, fetal heart rate abnormalities, and other problems.)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of composite neonatal morbidity</measure>
    <time_frame>measures from randomization to 60 days post delivery of the baby</time_frame>
    <description>Composite morbidity is defined as any one or more of: stillbirth, neonatal death, infant death before hospital discharge, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), intracranial hemorrhage (grade 3 or 4)(IVH), necrotizing enterocolitis (stage 2 or 3)(NEC), documented neonatal sepsis within 72 hr of birth, or periventricular leukomalacia (characteristic lesions in the subcortical white matter seen on cerebral imaging studies within 96 hrs of birth)(PVL).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of effectiveness of progesterone in women in highest 2 quartiles of quantitative fetal fibronectin (fFN) versus those in the lowest 2 quartiles of quantitative fFN.</measure>
    <time_frame>from the 21st week of gestation until the 25 week of gestation</time_frame>
    <description>A cervicovaginal swab for quantitative fetal fibronectin testing will be obtained at the first antenatal visit, approximately 1 week after enrollment. The results of this will be used to test a secondary hypothesis that fFN levels will identify a subgroup of participants who respond to progesterone treatment and another subgroup who do not.</description>
