  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is now widely used for cancer
      imaging purpose, notably for preoperative work-up. It aims at visualizing organs metabolism.
      In case of cancer, metabolism is, classically, increased and some hot spots are visible on
      PET images. Because of respiratory motion some lung tumours (especially the smallest ones)
      can be falsely interpreted by the clinician.

      The investigators developed a respiratory-gated PET method in order to reduce the motion
      issue. The investigators designed a study to investigate its effect on lung cancer (primary
      or metastasis) to check if it improves the sensitivity/specificity of PET imaging of the
      lungs.

      To that aim, patients presenting a lung nodule on a CT examination can be proposed to
      participate this study. After the standard PET acquisition (acquired in free-breathing), an
      additional 10 minutes respiratory-gated PET acquisition is performed without additional
      injection. After that, a breath-hold (~10s) CT is performed.

    <description>After fasting for at least 6 hours, normal glucose blood level was checked and each patient received an intravenous injection of 18F-FDG (5MBq/kg). After a 60-minute uptake phase in a quiet environment, patients underwent the PET/CT examination.
Whole-body PET/CT (Ungated session) The Ungated acquisition consisted in a whole-body, free-breathing CT followed by standard multistep PET, used as routine clinical practice in the department.
Respiratory-gated PET/CT (CT-based session) The CT-based method consisted in an additional single-step, 10-minute List Mode respiratory gated PET acquisition followed by an end-expiration breath-hold CT added to the end of the clinical protocol, with continuous respiratory signal recording during these examinations.</description>
