    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib-s-malate works in treating patients with
      thyroid cancer that does not respond to treatment. Cabozantinib-s-malate may stop the growth
      of thyroid cancer by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Cabozantinib-s-malate may also stop the growth of thyroid cancer by blocking blood flow to
      the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The objective response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who have had a partial
      response (PR) or complete response (CR) within the first 6 months after initiation of therapy
      with cabozantinib (cabozantinib-s-malate).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess duration of objective response, progression-free survival and overall survival.

      II. To assess tolerability and adverse events of cabozantinib as a 2nd line therapy in
      patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess effect of cabozantinib on serum tumor marker thyroglobulin and its correlation
      with overall response rate.

      II. To assess response of cabozantinib in bone metastasis (bone metastasis-specific
      progression free survival) as evaluated by pre- and on-study functional imaging such as bone
      scan, fludeoxyglucose F 18 (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan and/or 18F
      sodium fluoride (NaF) PET scan.

      III. To assess effect of cabozantinib on serum and urinary markers of bone turnover and its
      correlation with response to bone metastasis.

      IV. To assess predictors of response by performing tumor genotype studies (e.g. v-raf murine
      sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B [BRAF], rat sarcoma [RAS],
      phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha [PIK3CA],
      mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 [MAP2K1], v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1
      [AKT1], mesenchymal-epithelial transition [MET], rearranged in transformation [RET]/papillary
      thyroid carcinoma [PTC] rearrangement) in archived tumor tissue.

      V. To assess predictors of response by assessing baseline expression levels of vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), phosphorylated vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
      (pVEGFR), phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (pERK), phosphorylated AKT1
      (pAKT) and/or total met proto-oncogene (MET) by immunohistochemistry in archived tumor
      tissue.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and then every 3
      months for 1 year.

             metastases previously treated with whole brain radiation or radiosurgery or subjects
             with epidural disease previously treated with radiation or surgery who are
             asymptomatic and do not require steroid treatment for at least 2 weeks before starting
             study treatment are eligible; baseline brain imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI
             scans for subjects with known brain metastases is required to confirm eligibility;
             eligible patients with brain metastases can be taking anti-convulsant medications but

             nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, voriconazole, and posaconazole); Note: because the
             lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a
             frequently-updated lists; medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk
             Reference may also provide this information; as part of the enrollment/informed
             consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with
             other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the

             formula (QTcF) &gt; 480 ms within 28 days before registration; Note: if initial QTcF or
             QTcB is found to be &gt; 480 ms, two additional electrocardiograms (EKGs) separated by at
             least 3 minutes should be performed; if the average of these three consecutive results
             for QTcF or QTcB is =&lt; 480 ms, the subject meets eligibility in this regard

             positive and currently receiving antiretroviral therapy; Note: patients known to be
             HIV positive, but without clinical evidence of an immunocompromised state, are
             eligible for this trial

          -  The subject has received prior treatment with a small molecule kinase inhibitor or a
             hormonal therapy (including investigation kinase inhibitors or hormones) within 14
             days or five half-lives of the compound or active metabolites, whichever is longer,
             before the first dose of the treatment
