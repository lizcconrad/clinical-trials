      The objective of the non-interventional study is to compare the quality of life, health care
      resource use and costs between the use of a combination of oxycodone and naloxone (Targiniq)
      versus oxycodone and laxatives for patients with severe pain, and to evaluate the
      cost-effectiveness of treatment with Targiniq.
