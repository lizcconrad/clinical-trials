      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best way of giving trastuzumab emtansine in
      treating patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer
      that has spread to other parts of the body or nearby tissue and cannot be removed by surgery.
      Biological therapies, such as trastuzumab emtansine, may stimulate the immune system in
      different ways and stop cancer cells from growing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess change in thrombokinetics (platelet circulation life span).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Benefit rate (as defined by stable disease, partial response, or complete response by
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] v 1.1) at the end of study activities.

      II. To evaluate the safety of trastuzumab emtansine (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) (non-platelet
      toxicity).

      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ado-trastuzumab emtansine.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trastuzumab emtansine intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving response may continue treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

    <description>The actual analysis will fit a linear mixed effects model, using a two-sided Wald test to compare pre-therapy to the two post-therapy values, and should have greater power than a matched pairs design. Also, platelet lifespan may be measured in absolute terms (platelet lifespan) or relative terms (percentage relative to pre-therapy lifespan), and may be transformed to decrease the influence of extreme values.</description>
