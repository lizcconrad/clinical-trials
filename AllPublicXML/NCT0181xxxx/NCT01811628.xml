      The goal of this research study is to collect information from Latino and Hispanic smokers
      and recent quitters about factors that are important to them when they are trying to quit.
      Researchers want to better understand some of the challenges and problems that Latinos and
      Hispanics face when they try to quit smoking, and then use that information to design a
      treatment for future smokers.

      If participant decides to take part in this study, they will complete a questionnaire about
      themselves (such as their age, preferred language, and education level) and their smoking
      habits. This questionnaire should take about 10-15 minutes to complete.

      After participant completes this questionnaire, they will be interviewed by a researcher.
      During this interview participant will be asked to discuss a variety of topics related to
      smoking and quitting, such as their experience with attempts to quit smoking and problems
      they may have had. This interview will last about 1 hour.

      The interview will be audio-recorded. Participant's interview answers will later be
      transcribed (written down) without their name or any other identifying information.

      Study participation will be complete after the interview.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 48 people will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
