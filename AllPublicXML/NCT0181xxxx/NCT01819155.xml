  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide the Senegal Ministry of Health with data on the safety and
      immunogenicity of adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (adjTIV) and full-dose
      seasonal non-adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) in children. This data
      will inform future policy considerations for influenza vaccine. The study is not powered to
      detect significant differences between vaccines or groups, and no hypotheses are to be
      tested; therefore, immunogenicity and safety objectives are to be analyzed descriptively.

      The is a phase 2b, single-center, randomized, observer-blind, parallel group,
      placebo-controlled trial of the immunogenicity and safety of adjTIV and seasonal TIV among
      healthy children aged 6 months through 71 months in the town of Niakhar, Senegal. A total of
      300 healthy children will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio of adjTIV to TIV to placebo. Each
      child will receive two doses of one of the three study vaccines, with each dose given 28 days
      apart. Each child will be followed closely for safety after each dose for the period from one
      month post-dose two to 3 months post-dose two. For determination of immune response to
      vaccination or background influenza infection, 3 mL of blood will be obtained at three time
      points: pre-vaccination, 28 days post-dose one (prior to receipt of dose two), and at 28 days
      post-dose two. Serum anti-influenza antibodies produced against virus strains contained in
      the vaccine will be detected using hemagglutination inhibition assay.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A male or female child at least 6 months of age and under 6 years of age (has not yet
             reached 72 months of age) at the enrollment visit.

          -  Free of obvious health problems, as established by the medical history and screening
             evaluations, including physical examination.

          -  Subject's parent or legal guardian is willing to provide written informed consent
             prior to the subject's first study vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any component in adjTIV or TIV (which include egg protein)
             or placebo.

          -  Receipt of any non-study vaccine within two weeks prior to enrollment or refusal to
             postpone receipt of such vaccines until after the Day 56 visit.

          -  Previous receipt of any influenza vaccine.

          -  Hypersensitivity after previous administration of any vaccine.

          -  Acute illness accompanied by a body temperature of 37.5°C or greater (axillary
             measurement) within 14 days of enrollment visit. (Enrollment and administration of
             adjTIV, TIV, or placebo should be postponed until at least 14 days after recovery.
             Minor illnesses, such as mild upper respiratory infection, with an axillary
             temperature of &lt;37.5°C, are not reason for exclusion or postponing study vaccination.)

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would pose a health risk to
             the participant if he/she participates in the study or would interfere with the
             evaluation of the study objectives.
