  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exudative age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is complicated by choroidal
      neovascularization (CNV). Although anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment is the
      gold standard treatment, recurrence is the main limitation of the treatment. The changes of
      the CNV vascular structure is expected to provide information regarding recurrence. In the
      eyes that the vascular structure is clearly seen in indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), the
      vascular changes after ranibizumab injections will be investigated prospectively.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients having exudative ARMD with CNV, whose vascular structures are clearly
      demonstrated in ICGA , ranibizumab is injected monthly three times, then pro re nata to 6
      months. Vascular structures of CNV is investigated at baseline, 3 and 6 months using ICGA.
      Expected number of patients are 48 eyes from 4 centers, competitively.

    <description>Caliber of the largest CNV is measured using a software of IVAN (developed by Wisconsin University) that measures a caliber of retinal vessels using a semi-automatic method. An indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) image showing the vascular structures of CNV was processed to invert black and white for the analysis. The image was loaded in the software, and the course of the arteriolar CNV was indicated manually. Then average thickness of the vascular segment was calculated.</description>

    <description>Visual acuity is measured at baseline and 6 months using ETDRS chart. The changes was calculated by visual acuity at 6 months minus visual acuity at baseline.
Positive values represent improvement of visual acuity, and negative values represent worsening of visual acuity at 6 months compared to baseline.</description>

          <population>Of 31 patients included in the baseline analysis, 7 patients had the thickest vessels under limitation of measurement.</population>
