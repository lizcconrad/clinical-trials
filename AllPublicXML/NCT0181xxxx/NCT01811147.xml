  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out what parts of the brain have increased or decreased
      activity and connectivity in individuals who have bipolar disorder, major depression, or no
      history of mood disorder. Another purpose of this study is to use MRI images to determine
      which young adults with major depression may be at greater risk for developing mild or more
      severe symptoms of mania which suggests a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.

      The study involves two phases, phase one includes the screening visit and MRI. The second
      phase, for depression participants, involves in person follow ups for up to two years. The
      second phase, for healthy and bipolar participants, involves phone follow ups, every three
      months for up to two years. The purpose of this study is listed above. We plan to enroll 200
      participants total.
