      Hypothesis:The Adnab-9 antigen is a predictive biomarker in individuals at risk of developing
      colorectal neoplasia.

      Study aim is to evaluate the potential of the Adnab-9 monoclonal antibody (MAb) as a marker
      of cancer risk in a population at increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC). This marker
      would be compared to other current and emerging diagnostic methods. 2,800 Veterans would be
      recruited into the study. In phase 1, candidates would be defined as having increased CRC
      risk by a short questionnaire. Stool samples would be obtained and a semi-quantitative
      Adnab-9 antigen assay (ELISA) would be determined. Patients with differing high and low
      estimations of fecal Adnab-9 would undergo colonoscopy at which time other samples of
      effluent and colonic mucosa would be taken, and a detailed lifestyle and nutritional
      questionnaire would be completed. The characteristics of the Adnab-9 fecal test as a
      diagnostic test would be critically determined using the outcome of the colonoscopic and
      other test results. The patients will be contacted through the mail and by word of mouth.
      Informed consent will be obtained before the samples are obtained. The participants are
      clinically defined as high-risk and therefore screening colonoscopy would be likely performed
      in any event. A number of assays for Adnab-9 are feasible including slot-blot, Western blot,
      and ELISA. Other stool studies include conventional fecal occult blood tests (FOBT or FIT)
      that will be performed in tandem. The investigators therefore began this method of collection
      and obtained consent from over 2000 patients with a similar overall compliance rate with FOBT
      screening procedures to that reported previously of approximately 50%. Currently the study is
      no longer enrolling patients at the Detroit VA and is now finalizing data entry. Another 450
      patients to be recruited at the Philadelphia VAMC.

      The primary objectives is to test the efficacy of Adnab-9 stool testing in a population at
      high-risk for colorectal neoplasia and directly compare it to that of the FOBT and
      secondarily, identify the source of the Adnab-9 antigen to determine influences of diet and
      environment on its expression. The design is a prospective cross sectional (Part 1) and a
      case-control longitudinal follow-up study (Part 2) using a brief questionnaire to assess risk
      for cancer in a total of 2800 Part I patients will be enrolled designed to achieve a database
      of high risk individuals and measure fecal Adnab-9 levels before a clinically indicated
      colonoscopy is performed. The patients submit 4 FOBT cards in a routine manner by mail, 3 are
      used for the FOBT and stool is extracted from the last card for the Adnab-9 ELISA which is
      reported as OD/5ug protein/well. 100 Part 2 enrollees are then selected on the basis of
      positive fecal Adnab-9 test candidates matched with a like number of patients with negative
      stool results who have had their initial colonoscopy and who will have a 5-year follow-up
      colonoscopy. Detailed Adnab-9 testing (immunohistochemical Adnab-9 binding; blood biomarker
      estimations and Adnab-9 Western blotting) will be performed on various bodily fluids to
      perfect the method of testing and completion of the detailed questionnaire to check for
      reproducibility and interim lifestyle changes in these participants.
