  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this project is to evaluate the immunogenicity of TIV vaccination in
      HIV-infected non-pregnant women in 2013. Safety data including solicited local and systemic
      reactions to the vaccine will also be assessed.

    <measure>Immunogenicity of Trivalent Influenza Vaccine (TIV)by measuring Hemagglutination Inhibition Assays (HAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>one month post vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Humoral immunity will be measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay, which has been extensively used for this purpose. In healthy individuals, HAI titers ≥1:10 indicate presence of influenza-specific antibodies and ≥1:40 protection against infection and disease. In this study we will use the following definitions to assess the humoral immune response to TIV: HAI titers &lt;1:10 = seronegative; HAI titers ≥1:10 = seropositive; HAI titers ≥1:40 = sero-protective titers; and sero-conversion will be defined as HAI titers from &lt;1:10 to ≥1:40 or ≥4-fold increase if pre-vaccination titers were ≥1:10.</description>

    <measure>impact of vaccination on T-cell activation and on T- and B-cell subpopulations</measure>
    <time_frame>one month post vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>T-lymphocyte activation assays will be performed using state-of-the art polychromatic flow cytometry. The T- and B-cell phenotypes are assessed by flow cytometry using freshly thawed Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC). Cells are stained using monoclonal antibodies against the comparator molecules.</description>

    <time_frame>one month post vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Interferon(IFN)Enzyme Linked Immuno Spot (ELISPOT) responses will be used to assess CMI responses to influenza vaccines.PBMCs will be separated and stimulated with influenza virus corresponding to the vaccine strains. Spots will be visualized with a ELISPOT plate reader. Results will be reported as Spot Forming Cells(SFC)/106 PBMCs.</description>

    <time_frame>1 week and one month post vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will remain in the clinic for at least 30 minutes after vaccination so that clinic personnel can observe participants for any potential adverse reactions.Report of vaccine-related local (redness, swelling, tenderness, itching,) and systemic (fever, malaise, myalgia, nausea, headache, rash) adverse events will be solicited at day 7 and day 28.</description>
