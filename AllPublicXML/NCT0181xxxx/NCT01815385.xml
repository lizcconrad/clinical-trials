  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes are modern day epidemics. Early life exposure
      to an adverse developmental environment, including environmental toxins, are linked to
      increased susceptibility to obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Although the
      mechanisms underlying the fetal origins of metabolic disease are poorly understood, strong
      evidence suggests that alterations in the epigenome play a critical role in this process. The
      central hypothesis of this proposal is that intrauterine exposure to benzo[a]pyrene leads to
      epigenetic changes which will have functional consequences and may be a marker for, or may
      contribute to, increased susceptibility to adverse outcomes in childhood including increased
      adiposity and the subsequent development of obesity, metabolic syndrome or diabetes. The
      goals of this proposal are to: 1) determine benzo[a]pyrene levels in umbilical cord blood of
      newborns, 2) determine whether benzo[a]pyrene exposure during pregnancy correlates with early
      onset of obesity and metabolic disease by examining the children at 12 and 24 months of age,
      3) determine whether in utero benzo[a]pyrene exposure programs metabolic disease through
      alterations in DNA methylation and gene expression, and 4) determine the plasticity of the
      DNA methylation patterns in the same offspring at 12 months of age. The long-term goal of
      this project is to define biomarkers that identify neonates at &quot;high-risk&quot; for diminished
      attainment of full health potential, who can then be targeted for preventative measures.
