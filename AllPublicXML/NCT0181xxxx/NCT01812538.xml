  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of DIC075V on ventricular
      repolarization in healthy subjects compared to placebo after a single dose of DIC075V
      administered intravenously (IV) and to evaluate ECG assay sensitivity by evaluating the
      baseline-adjusted effect of a single oral (PO) moxifloxacin 400 mg dose on ventricular
      repolarization in healthy subjects compared to placebo. Other secondary objectives are as
      follows:

        -  To evaluate the effect of DIC075V on ventricular repolarization in healthy subjects
           compared to placebo at the Tmax of diclofenac and hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD).

        -  To determine if there is a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship between
           the duration of the QTc intervals and diclofenac and HPβCD plasma concentrations.

        -  Obtain additional pharmacokinetic (PK) information on diclofenac and HPβCD in healthy
           subjects.

        -  Provide additional safety information.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-dose, comparative, positive and placebo controlled, 4 period,
      4-way crossover study evaluating the effect of DIC075V on QTc intervals in healthy subjects.
      Two doses of DIC075V are tested and include moxifloxicin as a positive control and normal
      saline as the placebo arm. On 4 separate occasions separated by at least 72 hours, subjects
      are given single IV or oral (moxifloxicin) treatments. ECGs are acquired from a continuous
      Holter monitor and selected timepoints will be evaluated. These ECGs will be 15 seconds in
      duration and extracted in triplicate. Monitoring will continue for 24 hours with each
      treatment. The primary ECG endpoint is the baseline-adjusted QTc using the Fridericia
      correction (QTcF). Secondary endpoints include the baseline-adjusted QTc using the Bazett
      correction formula (QTcB). In addition, a population-specific regression model will be
      constructed with QT plotted against RR (the time elapsed between 2 consecutive R-waves).
      Finally, QT parameters are explored graphically in relation to PK variables Cmax, Tmax and
      AUC.
