  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether iron-fortified TPN is effective in the
      preventative and treatment of preterm infants. Preterm infants are at risk for anemia
      especially in preterm infants. Generally the smaller Birth weight and gestational age the
      higher anemia rate in infants. About 25% to 85% of preterm infants develop evidence of anemia
      during infancy，77% VLBW（very low birth weight） infants developed anemia during the hospital
      stay. The effects of iron deficiency are pervasive and involve multiple organ systems. Poor
      physical growth, gastrointestinal disturbances, thyroid dysfunction, altered immunity and
      temperature instability has been attributed to iron deficiency in very low birth weight
      infants. So it is important to provide iron for preterm infants.

      As enteral nutrition is not feasible soon after birth in most preterm infants, Parenteral
      iron administration is an efficacious method for us to select. For most preterm infants the
      use of TPN(total parenteral nutrition) is very common during the first ten days of life, so
      we hypothesis that iron-fortified TPN may have a preventative and treatment effect on preterm
      infants using TPN as a supplementation of oral nutrition; Iron-fortified TPN(total parenteral
      nutrition) can also improve iron store status of preterm infants. The higher concentration of
      iron used in this study the larger preventative or treatment effect on preterm infants
      anemia; It is safe to add Small dose of iron agent to TPN.

      Preterm infants are at high risk of anemia especially low birth weight infants, so it is
      important to supply iron with infants of this group.

      90 preterm infants BW(birth weight) less than 2kg,entered neonatal intensive care unit(NICU)
      less than 72 hours and meet the Inclusion Criteria of this study will be Randomly divided
      into three groups, control group、 treatment group1 (200μg/kg/d,and the highest concentration
      of iron is ≤0.8g/100ml TPN)、treatment group2 （400μg/kg/d,and the highest concentration of
      iron is ≤0.8g/100ml TPN）. iron supplementation period for more than ten days. For three
      groups, complete blood counts, differential counts, and reticulocyte counts were measured
      weekly in samples obtained, serum iron, iron protein, total iron binding force were measured
      at baseline and after 2 weeks. Through comparative analysis of three groups, to find
      iron-fortified TPN whether affect anemia rate and iron storage in preterm. we also selected
      malondialdehyde (MDA)and 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α(8-iso-PGF2α) as our concerns about iron used
      in TPN induces oxidative stress index.

      Iron protein determination use radioimmunoassay method, serum iron and total iron binding
      force determination use chemical method, MDA and 8-iso-PGF2α determination use enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay method.
