    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the administration of the PhytoMed™
      complement reduces CRP in women with histologically confirmed AJCC Stage 0-IIIA breast cancer
      which has been completely surgically resected and without evidence of disease as determined
      by their physician
