  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first randomized trial comparing Early post-operative intraperitoneal
      chemotherapy (EPIC) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) for appendiceal and
      colorectal cancer. The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad,
      EPIC and HIPEC after cytoreductive surgery have on the patient and the appendiceal, rectal or
      colon cancer.

             metastasis.

          -  Patient must be planning to undergo complete cytoreduction of all peritoneal disease.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 1.

          -  Hematology: ANC ≥ 1,500/ μL; Platelets &gt; 75,000/ μL.

          -  Adequate Renal function Creatinine &lt;1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) or
             calculated creatinine clearance of ≥ 50ml/min.

             Gilbert's Syndrome, who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0mg/dL).

          -  Women with childbearing potential who are negative for pregnancy test (urine or blood)
             and who agree to use effective contraceptive method. Reliable contraception should be

             pregnant.

          -  A man participating in this study must agree to utilize reliable barrier form of
             contraception for the duration of the study.

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent to participate in this clinical trial must
             be obtained prior to any study procedure.

          -  Subjects with a history of endometrial cancer are eligible only if they presented with

             nodes or peritoneal surfaces.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease that would limit study compliance or
             place the patient at unacceptable risk for participation in the study.

          -  History of cerebrovascular disease. that would limit study compliance or place the
             patient at unacceptable risk for participation in the study.

          -  Subjects with other concurrent severe medical problems unrelated to the malignancy
             that would significantly limit full compliance with the study, or places them at an
             unacceptable risk for participation in the study.

          -  Patients with known floxuridine, leucovorin ,or mitomycin allergy.

          -  Evidence of extensive intraperitoneal adhesions at the time of surgery which prohibits
             intraperitoneal therapy, as determined by the operating surgeon.

          -  Any condition that would preclude the ability to deliver appropriate IP therapy.

          -  Use of an oral medication, lacking a suitable non-oral substitute, that if held for up
