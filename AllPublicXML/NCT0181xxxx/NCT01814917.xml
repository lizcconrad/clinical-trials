      The Primary Objectives of this study are to assess the long-term efficacy of treatment with
      colestilan (MCI-196) (including combination therapy) and to assess the long-term safety of
      treatment with colestilan (MCI-196) (including combination therapy).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject and/or parent(s)/guardian(s) must be capable of providing informed
             consent, and assent when applicable, in agreement with regional requirements.

          -  The subject has completed either of the short-term studies, MCI-196-E14 or MCI-196-E16

        or

          -  The subject has been withdrawn from MCI-196-E14, but is eligible to enter this study
             according to the following rules, as defined in MCI-196-E14:

               -  Hyperphosphataemia: Subjects who experienced hyperphosphataemia, defined as any
                  increase in serum phosphorus [P] levels above the age-related upper limit of
                  normal(ULN) on two consecutive occasions, and was withdrawn by the Investigator
                  in order to proceed to this study, where flexible dosing with colestilan
                  (MCI-196) is available. Subjects withdrawn from MCI-196-E14 due to
                  hyperphosphataemia may only enter this study after Week 6 of the short-term
                  study, following two consecutive out-of-range P values (one obtained at Week 3
                  and one obtained at Week 6). After Week 6, subjects meeting the above criteria
                  may enter this study at any time (the two consecutive out-of-range P values
                  having been obtained any time after Week 6 from a scheduled or unscheduled
                  visit).

               -  Hypercalcaemia: Subjects treated with CBPB and experiencing hypercalcaemia may be
                  withdrawn from the short-term study at the discretion of the Investigator in
                  order to proceed to this study at any time, where flexible dosing with colestilan
                  (MCI-196) is available.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has current clinically significant medical co-morbidities, which may
             substantially compromise subject safety, or expose them to undue risk, or interfere
             significantly with study procedures and which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             make the subject unsuitable for inclusion in the study (e.g., the subject currently
             has or has had a history of seizure disorders, dysphagia, swallowing disorders,
             predisposition to or current bowel obstruction, ileus or severe gastrointestinal [GI]
             disorders such as chronic or severe constipation [as judged by the Investigator],
             intestinal stenosis, intestinal diverticulum, sigmoid colitis, GI ulcers, current or a
             history of GI bleeding, or major GI tract surgery).

          -  The subject is expected to receive immunosuppressant treatment during the course of
             the study.

          -  The subject is considered unstable on his/her current treatment for CKD within one
             month prior to enrolment (e.g., subjects starting treatment with vitamin D or its
             analogues, or other agents/procedures that may influence bone mineral metabolism
             [i.e., serum P and calcium (Ca) levels]).

          -  The subject is considered to be non-compliant with study procedures in the opinion of
             the Investigator.
