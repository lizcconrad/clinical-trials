  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being offered to patients who are post-menopausal, have breast cancer with a
      positive estrogen and/or progesterone hormone receptor test and are currently awaiting
      surgery for breast cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether abiraterone acetate has different hormonal
      and genomic effects than non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors in the treatment of
      post-menopausal hormonal receptor positive primary operable breast cancer
