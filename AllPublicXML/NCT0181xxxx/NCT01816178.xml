  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was proposed that in order to teach these children to use a Voice Output Communication Aid
      (VOCA), it should be introduced through a play-based situation using parents as the primary
      interventionist.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research will test the effectiveness of using the communication board to improve the
      frequency of communication and social engagement for these children, and the level or
      sophistication of that engagement. The study will test the effectiveness of using the
      communication board in a variety of settings and a variety of practitioners. The study will
      have sites in and near Jonesboro, Arkansas.

    <description>Data were gathered from the parents on the number of words spoken by their son and the way they &quot;felt&quot; the intervention was proceeding. Essentially we had parents report on the effectiveness of using the VOCA to improve the frequency of communication and social engagement for these young children with ASD.</description>
