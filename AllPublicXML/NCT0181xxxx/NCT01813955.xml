    <textblock>
      Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors represent a new group of potential antipsychotic compounds
      currently under development. One of these is papaverine, an inhibitor of the PDE 10 family.
      The class of PDE10 inhibitors have been reported as possible candidates in the treatment of
      schizophrenia, and may prove an attractive antipsychotic alternative due to the many
      side-effects of the currently available antipsychotics. It has been proposed from preclinical
      studies that PDE10 inhibitors have the potential to reduce cognitive deficits in
      schizophrenia and these findings need to be confirmed in a human population, in view of the
      fact that no other currently registered drug posses these unique properties.

      The currently proposed project is designed to investigate whether the PDE10 inhibitor
      Papaverine indeed have the capacity to reduce cognitive deficits in schizophrenia patients.
      In order to accomplish this effect, Papaverine will be investigated in schizophrenia, with
      regards to symptomatology, hemodynamic, neurocognition and early information-processing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has a double blind, balanced crossover design. Randomized, half of the subjects
      will be given Papaverine (PDE10 inhibitor, 300 mg orally) in the first session followed by
      placebo in the second, and the other half will be treated in the reverse order. There is a
      minimum of one month between the two test-sessions. After each of the two treatments, the
      subjects will be tested with both a psychophysiological (the Copenhagen Psychophysiological
      Test-Battery) and neuropsychological test-battery (tests from the Cambridge
      Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, or &quot;CANTAB&quot;). The project has three phases: In the
      first phase 10 healthy subjects will be included to determine the kinetics of
      Papaverine-contained release capsules ; in the second phase 30 schizophrenia patients and 30
      healthy subjects will be included to determine the impact on cognitive and sensory gating
      related deficits; Finally 10 Healthy subjects will be included to determine the effect of
      Papaverine on hemodynamical parameters by the means magnetic resonance scannings.
