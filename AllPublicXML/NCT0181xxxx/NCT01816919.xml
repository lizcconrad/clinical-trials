  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck tumors are common in the general population especially in high risk groups of
      smokers and alcohol abusers, as well as after exposure to various environmental factors.
      Diagnosis is based on identification of patients gross disease after a physical examination
      and various imaging methods, and characterization of tissue mainly by fine-needle puncture
      (FNA) and biopsy. Determining the stage of disease is based on physical examination, imaging
      and tissue samples.

      Using the electronic nose technology we hope to identify microscopic disease when it is
      suspected or in populations in risk, thus diagnose patients in the initial stages of the
      disease. Obviously, early diagnosis and treatment decisions will hopefully improve the
      prognosis.

      Finding a positive correlation between the stages, levels and various tumor volume and
      respiratory specimens findings will classify patients more accurately and contribute to
      further characterization of the disease in a more accurate, rapid and non-invasive fashion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60,000 new cases of head and neck cancer are diagnosed in the U.S. each year,
      accounting for about 5% of cancer cases diagnosed in North America and approximately 1-2% of
      cancer deaths.

      Smoking and alcohol are the main risk factors for head and neck tumors and are recognized in
      75% of cases. In contrast, consumption of fruits and vegetables was found to be a protective
      factor. The symptoms are varied and can include sore throat and / or neck, difficulty or pain
      in swallowing, difficulty in breathing and hoarseness, facial movement disorder and other.

      Multidisciplinary decision making and treatment is important for these patients due to the
      complexity of treatment and short-and long-term complications resulting from chemotherapy,
      radiotherapy and surgical intervention.

      About a third of patients are diagnosed with disease at stage 1 or 2. These patients are
      treated by surgery or radiation. Five years survival for patients diagnosed with stage I is
      around 90% and 70% for patients diagnosed with stage 2. Despite surgical and radiation
      treatment when patients present with locally advanced disease, only 30% -50% of them survive
      after five years. Therefore, many studies have been conducted in an attempt to improve
      prognosis. Improved results are seen in combination therapy with chemotherapy and radiation
      treatment.

      Patient survival depends on the stage of the disease, hence the importance of early
      detection. Research Laboratory of Dr. Hossam Haick developed a device that simulates the
      human nose. The device reveals patterns of volatile organic compounds emitted by breathing
      cancer cells. This is why it is referred to as &quot;electronic nose&quot;. It includes an array of
      tiny nanometer sized sensors connected to an electronic computation unit. Because of their
      small size and electrical properties, the sensors are able to &quot;smell&quot; the changes in the
      composition of the materials that characterize cancer. Discovery of bio - cancer markers
      using breath samples offers several advantages: a) The breath samples are not invasive; b)
      air exhaled contains mixtures less complex than those found in blood or urine, and c) breath
      tests allow direct monitoring in real-time.

      In this study we want to test the reliability of the developed device in real clinical
      conditions. Another goal of these experiments is to characterize the differences between
      respiratory specimens for various disease stages and to examine whether there is a
      relationship between the results of the samples to tumor volume (calculated using diagnostic
      CT scans). Due to its simplicity, positive results will allow us to consider using the device
      as a screening device for head and neck cancer.
