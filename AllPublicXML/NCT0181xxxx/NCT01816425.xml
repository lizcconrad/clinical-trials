  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cobalt-chromium (CoCr) partial denture has been made for a long period. It respects
      biomechanical principles, providing harmony between mechanical and biological activities. The
      fundamental principles of biomechanics applied in the manufacture of steel structure are:
      retention, reciprocity, attachment and stability. To get the proper planning, we need to
      assess the dental support system, with its qualitative and quantitative values. But
      conventional dentures has a inherent problem which is the metallic elements apparent and in
      some cases the stiffness of the component support elements that generates stress.

      The Thermoplastic partial dentures increase aesthetics in replacement of metal structures in
      oral rehabilitation. So many treatments are being done in everyday practice without a defined
      concept on various aspects of its construction and oral applicability.

      This trial aims to assess the basic parameters of both dentures in: nutrition, speech
      therapy, chewing force, chewing efficiency and quality of life.

      60 years old or older patients who require removable prosthesis. These will be randomly
      selected for the fabrication and installation of removable partial dentures (Gold Standard -
      control group - CoCr partial denture) and thermoplastic partial denture(experimental group).

      Before beginning the work, selected patients will make some preliminary tests such as
      controlling the individual condition, they are:

        -  three questionnaires:

        -  instrument for assessing quality of life related to oral health, GOHAI - General Oral
           Health Assessment Index of Atchinson &amp; Dolan

        -  instrument for assessing the social and economic profile of ABEP (Brazilian Association
           of Research Companies) CCEB 2011;

        -  Instrument for assessing cognitive condition MINI-MENTAL;

        -  Speech evaluation

        -  Nutritional assessment;

        -  Evaluation of masticatory efficiency and

        -  Chewing strength. After preliminary assessments patients will be subjected to treatments
           for manufacture of partial dentures. After the installation (end of the technical
           construction of the dentures) and the adjustments appointment the tests will be repeated
           and in successive control periods of 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24
           months respectively, when the tests will do again now to see if there was a change in
           the initial condition.
