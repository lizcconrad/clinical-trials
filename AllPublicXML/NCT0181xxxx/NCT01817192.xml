  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal treatment for stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains controversial.
      Radiographic surveillance alone has been recommended for stage I patients after the tumor is
      removed surgically from the lung, and this standard has been based on the fact that no
      previous clinical trial has demonstrated a benefit for stage I NSCLC patients who receive
      post-operative chemotherapy. These patients, however, have a substantial risk of death within
      five years after operation, ranging from approximately 30% to 45%, largely due to metastatic
      disease that is present immediately after surgery but that is undetectable by conventional
      methods. Some leading organizations therefore currently recommend post-operative chemotherapy
      as an alternative standard of care in stage I NSCLC patients who are considered to be at
      particularly high-risk. Up until now, however, there has not been a well-validated means to
      identify stage I NSCLC patients at high risk of death within five years after operation. A
      new prognostic tool, the Pervenio™ Lung RS Assay, which has been validated and definitively
      demonstrated in large scale studies to identify high-risk stage I patients with non-squamous
      NSCLC, is now available to all clinicians through a CLIA-certified laboratory. It is
      therefore now possible to compare the outcomes of patients randomly assigned to one or the
      other of these competing standards of care.

    <description>This CLIA-approved assay is a standard tool that is now available to all clinicians to improve the prognostic evaluation of patients after resection of early stage non-squamous NSCLC. It will be performed on tumor specimens for patients who are potentially eligible for this study. Patients identified through the assay as high-risk will be randomized to either adjuvant chemotherapy or observation.</description>
