  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections are common and a cause of major morbidity. They are also more common
      in obese women. Cesarean sections are the most common surgery performed in the United States,
      therefore pregnant women are being faced with this problem frequently. There is evidence to
      show that prophylactically administered antibiotics, cefazolin specifically, to obese women
      prior to cesarean section do not reach adequate concentrations in adipose tissue to prevent
      infection. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if an increased dose of cefazolin will
      attain adequate tissue concentration in obese women. Our hypothesis is that three grams of
      cefazolin given no more than 60 minutes prior to the start of a cesarean section in an obese
      (Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30) woman will attain adequate adipose tissue
      concentration compared to two grams of cefazolin.

      Subjects will be selected if they are greater than 37 weeks gestation wiht a singleton
      pregnancy and require a cesarean section for any obstetrical indication. Women will be
      excluded if they have a suspected infection, have a multiple gestation, or have preexisting
      diabetes or hypertension with end organ damage. The subjects will be screened both by through
      the OR schedule as well as through the clinics. They will then be consented and enrolled by
      the primary investigator. Once enrolled the subjects will be randomized to receive either two
      grams or three grams of cefazolin as prophylactic antibiotics to be given no more than 60
      minutes prior to the start of the surgery.

      Two adipose tissue samples will be obtained at the time of surgery. The first at the start
      after skin incision and the second at the end prior to closure of the skin. There will also
      be a separate IV placed at the start of the procedure from which three blood draws can be
      collected. These three samples will be obtained at the start of the surgery but after
      antibiotic administration, at the time of the first adipose collection, and at the time of
      the second adipose collection. The samples will then be stored at -80 degrees and shipped to
      David P. Nicolau's lab in Hartford, CT for the tissue and serum analysis.

      While the subjects are in the hospital recovering from their surgery, a chart review will be
      performed to determine if there are any infections occuring post-operatively. A telephone
      survey will be conducted six to eight weeks postpartum again assessing for any infectious
      complications after the cesarean section.
