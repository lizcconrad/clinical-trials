  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine if Ranolazine treatment improves coronary
      microcirculation function among patients with coronary microcirculation dysfunction. We are
      also looking to learn if symptomatic improvement of chest pain during treatment with
      Ranalozine is related to improved coronary microcirculation function.
