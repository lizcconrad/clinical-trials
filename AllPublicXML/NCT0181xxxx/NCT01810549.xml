  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate, if postprandial fatigue symptoms after ingestion of a
      high-fat, high-carbohydrate meal are regulated by Interleukin (IL)-1 and can be prevented by
      inhibition of IL-1 using a single dose injection of a specific IL-1 receptor antagonist.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postprandial fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-study drug (180 minutes pre-meal), 30 minutes pre-meal and 30 minutes post-meal</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be assessed using the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC) pre-study drug (means 180 minutes before ingestion of the test meal), 30 minutes before ingestion of the test meal and again 30 minutes after ingestion of the test meal. The outcome measure for which data will be presented is the change in fatigue measured 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after ingestion of the test meal in participants receiving kineret vs. placebo. Fatigue will also be assessed before administration of the study drug (180 minutes before test meal) to unravel a possible influence of the study drug itself on fatigue symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postprandial depression</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-study drug (180 minutes pre test meal), 30 minutes pre-meal, 30 minutes post-meal</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be assessed using the Hospitality Anxiety and Depression Scale - german version (HADS-D) pre-study drug (means 180 minutes before ingestion of the test meal), 30 minutes before ingestion of the test meal and again 30 minutes after ingestion of the test meal. The outcome measure for which data will be presented is the change in depression measured 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after ingestion of the test meal in participants receiving kineret vs. placebo. Depression will also be assessed before administration of the study drug (180 minutes before test meal) to unravel a possible influence of the study drug itself on depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postprandial cognitive processing speed</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-study drug (180 minutes before test meal), 30 minutes pre-meal, 30 minutes post-meal</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive processing speed will be assessed using the oral version of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) version A before study drug (means 180 minutes before ingestion of the test meal), version B 30 minutes before ingestion of the test meal and version A 30 minutes after ingestion of the test meal. The outcome measure for which data will be presented is the change in cognitive processing speed measured 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after ingestion of the test meal in participants receiving kineret vs. placebo. Cognitive processing speed will also be assessed before administration of the study drug (180 minutes before test meal) to unravel a possible influence of the study drug itself on depression. Version A and B will be used alternately to prevent a learning effect in this test.</description>
