      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Provodine™ topical cream to 10%
      benzoyl peroxide topical body wash for the treatment of early stage hidradenitis suppurativa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, recurrent inflammatory disease of the skin. It
      typically manifests as nodules and abscesses that ultimately can progress to form deep sinus
      tracts, fistulas, and scarring. It affects areas of the body with apocrine gland bearing
      tissue, including the anogenital, axillary and inframammary regions. The lesions are often
      very painful and can chronically drain malodorous fluid, which can leave affected individuals
      uncomfortable and self-conscious, or even debilitated. The pathogenesis of this disease
      process is not fully understood, and the HS can be difficult to treat. Measures such as
      topical antibiotic and antiseptic washes are generally thought to be beneficial for the
      treatment of early stage HS. Although there have been no controlled trials for the treatment
      of HS, commonly used topical washes currently include benzoyl peroxide and chlorhexidine
      gluconate.

      Provodine™ topical cream was designed to actively kill microbes on the skin for up to 6 hours
      without resulting in the irritation often associated with repetitive use of antimicrobial
      products. A blinded controlled comparison of Provodine™ versus the current standard of
      benzoyl peroxide wash will not only allow for an alternative treatment for early stage HS but
      also provide an additional tool in the arsenal of treatments for this disease process.

    <description>Assessment of the degree of involvement of HS will be performed at each study visit using the Hidradenitis Suppurativa European Research Group (HISERG) scale outlined below:
Anatomical region involved (axilla, groin, gluteal or other region or inframammary region left and/or right: 3 points per region involved).
Number and scores of lesions (abscesses, nodules, fistulas, scars: points per lesion of all regions involved: nodules 2, fistulas 4, scars 1, others 1)
The longest distance between two relevant lesions, i.e., nodules and fistulas, in each region, or size if only one lesion (&lt;5cm 2, &lt;10cm 4, &gt;10cm 8)
Are all lesions clearly separated by normal skin? In each region (yes 0/no 6)
Extent of erythema, edema, pain and purulent discharge of each anatomic site (0-3 for each clinical indicator)</description>

               2. Be otherwise healthy.

               3. Have a diagnosis of HS.

               4. Patients must have Hurley stage I or Stage II HS

               5. Be able to understand the requirements of the study, the risks involved, and be
                  able to sign the informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who meet the following criteria will be excluded:

               1. Patients with HS Hurley stage III will be excluded from participation in the
                  study

                  current study. For cohort I, no washout period for systemic and/or topical
                  medications will be required. For Cohort II, there will be a 14 day minimum
