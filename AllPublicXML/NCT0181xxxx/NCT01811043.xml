    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine whether a guided meditation intervention will reduce
      anxiety and distress as compared to a music intervention or radiologist supportive dialogue
      in women undergoing imaging-guided core needle breast biopsies. Both the guided meditation
      and music interventions are administered through use of headphones during routine outpatient
      imaging-guided core needle breast biopsies. Women in the guided meditation and music
      conditions will be given a CD with instructions for home practice. Women complete follow-up
      questionnaires in the 12 months after biopsy. Receipt of recommended follow-up care is
      examined for 60 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in anxiety from baseline (i.e., pre biopsy) assessment to post biopsy assessment will be examined. Participants will be followed for the duration of the biopsy, with an expected average of 1.5 hours between assessments.</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety is measured using the State Anxiety Scale of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. Women complete this self-report measure at baseline (i.e., immediately prior to biopsy in the biopsy clinic) and immediately post-biopsy. Change in anxiety will be measured as change from baseline to post biopsy (i.e., post biopsy anxiety - baseline anxiety.) The expected duration from baseline to post biopsy assessment is expected to be an average of 1.5 hours.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rates of adherence to recommended follow-up care</measure>
    <time_frame>60 months following biopsy</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to recommended mammography and clinical breast exam will be assessed for 60 months following biopsy. Adherence (i.e., repeated on schedule mammograms; repeated on schedule clinical breast exams) at 60 months post biopsy will be compared across study arms.</description>
