      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of
      Ipilimumab i.v. followed by NY-ESO-1 Protein vaccine with Poly-ICLC and Montanide s.c. (Arm
      A), or NY-ESO-1 OLP4 vaccine with Poly-ICLC and Montanide s.c. (Arm B), or NY-ESO-1 OLP4
      vaccine mixed with Poly-ICLC without Montanide s.c.(Arm C).

      This is a phase I, open-label, non-randomized study in 27 patients with unresectable or
      metastatic melanoma, for whom treatment with ipilimumab is indicated. Patients must have
      evidence of NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1 tumor positivity, radiologically measurable disease by
      immune-related Response Criteria (irRC), and meet all other eligibility criteria.
