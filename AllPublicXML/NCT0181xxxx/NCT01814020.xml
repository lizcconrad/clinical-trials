          2. 18 - 70 years

          3. DSO of at least one of the great toe(s) affecting 25 % to 75 % of the target nail.

          4. Positive culture for dermatophytes (i.e. Trichophyton species; T. rubrum or T.

          5. Signed written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Proximal subungual onychomycosis.

          3. &quot;Spike&quot; of onychomycosis extending to eponychium of the target nail

          4. Presence of dermatophytoma (defined as demarcated and localised thick masses of fungal
             hyphae and necrotic keratin between the nail plate and nail bed) on the target nail

          5. Other conditions than DSO known to cause abnormal nail appearance

          6. Topical antifungal treatment of the nails within 1 month before screening

          7. Systemic use of antifungal treatment within 3 months before screening

          9. Immunosuppression

         10. Participation in another clinical trial with an investigational drug or device during
             the previous 4 weeks before screening

         11. Known allergy to any of the tested treatment products

         12. A pregnancy test indicating pregnancy in a woman of childbearing potential at
             screening (visit 1)
