  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-frequency electroacupuncture (EA) can decrease serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP),
      androstenedione (A) and testosterone (T)of young women with polycystic ovary syndrome in the
      Human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) stimulation test ，also，we hypothesize that EA is more
      efficiency in improving ovulation rate and menstrual cycle than sham acupuncture.

      First, patients will be recruited according to the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria.

      Second, baseline measurements (including menstrual frequency,human chorionic gonadotropin
      (HCG) stimulation test,physical examination,trans-abdomen ultrasound of the uterus and
      ovaries, serum levels of sex hormone steroids) will be taken.

      Third, each patient will receive 32 sessions of acupuncture in 16 weeks, twice a week.

      Last, the above baseline measurements will be taken again as soon as the treatment is
      finished and menstrual frequency will be recorded during the 12 weeks of follow-up after the
      treatment.
