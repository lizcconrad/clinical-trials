    <time_frame>peri-procedural</time_frame>
    <description>Procedural success: combination of technical success, device success and absence of procedural complications.
Technical success: successful vascular access and completion of the endovascular procedure and immediate morphological success with less than 30% residual diameter reduction of the treated lesion on completion angiography.
Device success: exact deployment of the device according to the instructions for use as documented with suitable imaging modalities and in case of digital substraction angiography, in at least two different imaging projections.</description>
