    <textblock>
      The study is a single-center, open-label, safety and pharmacokinetic study in12 adult
      subjects with Anal Fissures. Subjects will be screened to determine eligibility within 7 days
      of treatment. There will be three parts to the study and all subjects will participate in
      each part.

    <description>Single- and multiple-dose PK parameters for topical DTZ and single-dose PK parameters for oral DTZ including AUC(0-t), AUC(0-∞), Cmax, tmax, t1/2 and CL/F. PK parameters for DTZ, and its two metabolites (N-desmethylditiazem and O-desacetyldiltiazem) will be presented in Data Listings and summarized by Day (Study Day 1, 7 and 14). Descriptive statistics will include n, mean, SD, %CV, geometric mean,median, minimum, and maximum.</description>

    <description>Adverse events, physical examination findings, vital sign measurements, ECG results, and clinical laboratory data will be reviewed and summarized to evaluate the safety profile of topical DTZ cream and oral DTZ. Safety data will be summarized by study time point, and by change from Baseline using descriptive statistics as appropriate. Data listings will also be provided.</description>
