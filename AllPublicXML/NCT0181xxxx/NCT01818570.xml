  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effect of a single PPC‐5650 dose in a human pain
      model including multimodal (mechanical, thermal, electrical, chemical) stimulations of the
      esophagus.

    <description>PPC‐5650 is a &quot;asic-sensing ion channel&quot;-1a antagonist that can block the acid-sensing ion channels, leading to a reduction in the pain signal under up-regulated conditions. A dose of 2.5 mg PPC-5650 in a 100 ml solution will be administered through an esophageal probe to assess local effects. 100 ml will be administered as an infusion with a rate of 7ml/min. Healthy volunteers will be treated with PPC-5650 in one out of three visit days.</description>
