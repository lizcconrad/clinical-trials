      Background:

      - LIFE-Moms (Lifestyle Interventions for Expectant Moms) is a national project that is
      studying pregnant women who are overweight or obese. It is looking at ways they can manage
      their weight gain in pregnancy and how this may affect them and their babies health at birth
      and through the first year. Researchers want to recruit pregnant women who are being treated
      at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center. They will participate in a two-part study.

      Objectives:

      - To study pregnant women who are in the LIFE-Moms project at the Phoenix Indian Medical
      Center.

      Eligibility:

        -  Pregnant women at least 18 years of age who are overweight or obese.

        -  Participants must be receiving care at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center.

        -  Participants must be having only one child in their pregnancy (no twins or other
           multiple births).

      Design:

        -  This study will have two parts. The first part will have three visits to obtain data
           about health early in pregnancy. It will also let participants and researchers find out
           if the participants are eligible and should continue in the second part of the study. In
           the second part, participants will be monitored throughout their pregnancy and during
           the first year after the baby s birth to test the effects of a lifestyle intervention to
           control weight gain during pregnancy.

        -  On the Part 1 study visits, participants will have a physical exam and medical history.
           They will provide blood, urine, hair, and other samples to be examined for possible
           genetic conditions.

        -  For the Part 2 study visits, participants will be placed in one of two treatment groups.
           Each group will receive the same prenatal and postnatal care that they would get if they
           did not join the study.

        -  The first group will have a lifestyle intervention program. They will spend about 2
           hours every week with other members of their group to learn diet and activity behaviors
           that may help with their health.

        -  The second group will have an enhanced care program. They will be given additional
           information about health and pregnancy and be invited to attend three classes to learn
           about staying healthy during pregnancy.

      LIFE-Moms (Phoenix center) is a randomized clinical trial in overweight and obese pregnant
      women that will test the effects of an intensive lifestyle intervention on gestational weight
      gain, control of maternal hyperglycemia, and post-partum return to pre-pregnancy weight. The
      Phoenix center will be conducted in collaboration between the Phoenix Indian Medical Center
      (PIMC) nurse midwifery and obstetrics services and the National Institute of Diabetes and
      Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). It is part of the LIFE-Moms Consortium consisting of
      six other clinical centers that will follow similar protocols and a research coordination
      unit.

      American Indians are at high risk for developing obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
      and its complications. A major factor responsible for this finding is exposure of the fetus
      in the womb to its mother s diabetes, which increases the risk of diabetes in the offspring
      particularly during childhood and adolescence. This study is designed to evaluate the effects
      of an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) in at least 200 adult (age greater than or equal
      to 18 years) pregnant women who are eligible for prenatal care at PIMC. Interventions will be
      provided to overweight and obese pregnant women who do not have pregestational diabetes but
      may have (GDM), i.e., diabetes that first develops or is first recognized in pregnancy, or
      are at high risk of developing GDM. The lifestyle intervention will be patterned after the
      Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) that prevented or delayed the onset of diabetes in non
      pregnant adults; the interventions will be modified to be appropriate in pregnancy. For women
      who develop diabetes, interventions will include coaching to optimize glycemic control.

      Women will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups, assigned with equal
      probability: an enhanced standard of care group or an intensive lifestyle intervention group
      (ILI). Following delivery, all the mothers and infants will be treated in the same way
      regardless of their initial treatment group. For example, all mothers will be encouraged to
      breast feed and follow other recommended practices for the health of themselves and their
      babies. After delivery the mother will be invited to bring the infant to the research clinic
      five times during the first 6 months and again at 1 year of age. These follow up visits for
      the infant are timed 1) to understand the patterns of change in neonatal body composition and
      2) to coincide, when possible, with well-child pediatric visits. We will also question the
      mothers and abstract data from the medical record regarding the child s feeding practice,
      overall health, hospitalizations, immunizations, and medicine use.

      Outcomes will be assessed on the same schedule for both intervention groups. Prenatal
      measurements include demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical data. The latter will focus
      on periodic measures related to blood glucose (sugar), including glucose tolerance tests.
      Diet and physical activity will be assessed by questionnaires and objective activity
      monitors. Many of these tests will be repeated in the mother at 6-12 weeks and 12 months
      post-partum. Infant data at or shortly after birth and at months 1 through 6 and 12 will
      include weight, length, head size, estimated body fat, feeding practices, and medical record
      abstraction.

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Adult pregnant women of any race or ethnicity may participate if they meet each of the
        following inclusion criteria:

          1. At least 18 years of age.

          2. Receive prenatal care at the nurse midwifery/obstetrics service of PIMC and plan to
             continue receiving such care throughout the pregnancy.

          3. Able to have an OGTT prior to 16 weeks gestation. Hyperemesis can preclude some
             pregnant women from successfully completing the OGTT; these women will not be excluded
             if the fasting blood samples can be obtained.

          4. Able to have an ultrasound examination to estimate fetal age.

          5. Complete initial run-in screening visits to determine whether the woman can manage the
             tasks required of participation in an intensive intervention if randomized to the
             intervention group.

          6. Able to commit the time required for the interventions and follow-up.

          7. Singleton viable pregnancy. A twin pregnancy reduced to singleton before 14(0) weeks
             by project gestational age is acceptable. An ultrasound must be conducted before
             randomization that shows a fetal heartbeat; there should be no evidence of more than
             one fetus on the most recent pre-randomization ultrasound.

          8. Gestational age at randomization no earlier than 9 weeks 0 days and no later than
             15(6) weeks based on an algorithm that compares the LMP date and data from the
             earliest ultrasound.

          9. Body mass index greater than or equal to 25 kilogram / square meter based on first
             trimester measured weight and on measured height. The earliest weight measurement
             before randomization, measured specifically for the study, will be used. Reported
             pre-pregnancy weight will not be used to determine eligibility because of the
             potential for inaccuracy. If the earliest weight measurement is conducted at 14(0) to
             14(6) weeks or 15(0) to 15(6) weeks, 1 pound or 2 pounds will be subtracted from the
             measured weight, respectively, to adjust to a first trimester weight. This weight and
             the resultant BMI are defined as the baseline weight and BMI, respectively.

             EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

               -  Diagnosis of diabetes prior to pregnancy or any of the following results of the
                  oral glucose tolerance test at visit #1 that suggest diabetes prior to pregnancy:

                  deciliter, or 2-hour post-load plasma glucose greater than or equal 200
                  milligrams per deciliter (75 grams oral glucose tolerance test). All potential
                  participants will have HbA1c and a 75 grams oral glucose tolerance test performed
                  prior to randomization.

               -  Women who meet the above criteria for diagnosed or presumed diabetes prior to
                  pregnancy will be excluded. Others who meet criteria for GDM will be eligible.
                  Criteria for GDM diagnosis will be based on ADA 2012 criteria (at least one of
                  FPG greater than or equal to 92 milligrams per deciliter, 1 hour PG greater than
                  or equal 180 milligrams per deciliter, or 2 hour PG greater than or equal to 153
                  milligrams per deciliter.)
