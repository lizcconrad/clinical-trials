  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) remains a significant contributor to cardiovascular morbidity.
      Amiodarone is a potent antiarrhythmic drug; however, patients receiving IV amiodarone are at
      high risk for phlebitis. Phlebitis may lead to infection, additional medical intervention,
      delay in treatment, and prolonged hospitalization. Therefore, examining new therapy approach,
      aimed to reduce the incidence of phlebitis is a valuable clinical and research goal.

      Aim: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral versus intravenous (IV) Amiodarone in the
      treatment of AF of recent onset (duration &lt; 48 h).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm abnormality worldwide. Three
      therapeutic goals should be considered for each patient: Rate control, maintenance of sinus
      rhythm and prevention of thromboembolism. In managing AF, numerous antiarrhythmic drugs have
      been used. Intravenous amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic agent which has been reported
      to be safe and most effective in various clinical settings, without an associated increase in
      mortality rate. In most of the cases, the method of administration is via peripheral
      infusion. Phlebitis is the most common complication with peripheral infusion of amiodarone.
      Phlebitis adversely affects patient care; it may interfere with the continued infusion of
      amiodarone, necessitate insertion of another peripheral intravenous or central catheter, and
      extend hospitalization. Furthermore, patients who develop phlebitis, experience pain,
      swelling, and inflammation. Phlebitis can be prevented by oral administration.

      The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the incidence rate of phlebitis following IV
      administration of amiodarone and to investigate whether the oral administration of amiodarone
      in patients with recent onset AF (duration &lt; 48 h), is safer than, and as efficient as, the
      IV administration of the same drug in the ICCU and ICU setting.
