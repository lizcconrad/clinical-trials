    <textblock>
      Phase 1 of this study involves determining how consumption of dairy fat fractions rich in
      milk fat globule membrane influences postprandial inflammation in participants with metabolic
      syndrome or obesity during a high dietary fat challenge in a six-hour period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 is a randomized crossover study designed to determine how inclusion of dairy
      fractions rich in milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) to shakes rich in dairy or palm fat
      influence postprandial inflammation. Participants who have 2 or more risk factors of
      metabolic syndrome or BMI â‰¥ 30 will consume four shakes on separate days. The four shakes
      are: high dairy fat, high dairy fat + MFGM, high palm fat, high palm fat + MFGM.

      Eligible participants will arrive to the Western Human Nutrition Research Center (WHNRC) at
      the University of California (UC) Davis campus on the morning of each test day after a
      10-12-hr overnight fast. Upon arrival participants will fill out a questionnaire about their
      dietary and medication intakes and physical activity for the past 72 hours to ensure
      compliance. Compliant participants' weight and blood pressure will be measured and a fasting
      blood draw will be taken before participants consume their test meal. Participants will only
      consume this test meal and water freely for the duration of the test day. Blood will be drawn
      serially at 1, 3 and 6 hours postprandially. Participants will be tested on the additional
      three arms on three different spaced apart by two weeks.

      On the third or fourth test day, participants' body composition and bone mineral density will
      be measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry.
