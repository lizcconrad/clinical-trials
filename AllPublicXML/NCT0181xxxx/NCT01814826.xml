    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1b, dose-escalation study of MLN4924 in
      combination with azacitidine in adult patients with AML. The patient population will consist
      of patients 60 years of age or older, previously diagnosed with World Health
      Organization(WHO)-defined AML, who are unlikely to benefit from standard induction therapy
      and who have not received definitive treatment for AML or prior treatment with azacitidine or
      decitabine.
