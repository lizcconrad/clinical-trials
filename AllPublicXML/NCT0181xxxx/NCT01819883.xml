    <textblock>
      This study investigates fat distribution in people with acromegaly. The investigator is also
      investigating the change of fat distribution before and after treatment of acromegaly. The
      investigator will compare the results of people with acromegaly to the results of healthy
      volunteers.

        Thirty-two study subjects will be studied: 1) patients with active acromegaly, and 2)
        healthy controls. Study subjects with acromegaly will be prescribed treatment for
        acromegaly by their healthcare providers, and this study will not interfere in anyway with
        clinical care and will not provide surgery, medications or other forms of clinical care.
