  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unruptured saccular intracranial aneurysms larger than 7 mm can be treated with endovascular
      occlusion using detachable coils, with or without expendable stent assistance. A new
      endovascular technique has recently been developed, using flow diverter stents without
      associated coils. Clinical results already published are encouraging but have to be
      confirmed. Furthermore, these medical devices are expensive in comparison to the coiling
      strategy. The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical efficacy, safety, and
      cost-effectiveness of endovascular coiling and endovascular flow diversion for unrupted
      saccular intracranial aneurysms.

      Main Outcome Measure: Percentage of patients with an aneurysm with complete occlusion,
      defined as the absence of visible blood flow to the consideration of angiography performed 12
      months post-endovascular intervention.
