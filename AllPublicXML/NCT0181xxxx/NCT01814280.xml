  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Medication reviews performed on admission to hospitals reduce medication errors; however,
      evidence of effect on morbidity and mortality is currently inconsistent. It is known that
      patients' risks of experiencing medication errors are dependent on both patient- and drug
      factors, e.g. age, co-morbidity, number of drugs, risk of side effects.

      Aim and hypothesis:

      The aim of this pilot study is to study acute medical patients' risk of getting a medication
      error based on an algorithm that takes into account both patient and drug related factors.
      Secondary, the investigators will explore whether our methods are applicable in a randomised
      controlled trial. The investigators will also decide the number of patients in a randomised
      controlled trial based on this pilot study.

      The hypothesis is that an algorithm that has already been developed can stratify patients
      according to their risk of experiencing a medication error.

      Methods:

      100 acute admitted patients will be risk stratified at admission (&gt;8 hours after). The
      patients who have highest risks of medication errors will receive a medication review
      performed by either a clinical pharmacist or a clinical pharmacologist.

    <description>The patients' electronic medical record will be assessed for medication errors during the patients' hospitalization. It will be assesed by a clinical pharmacologist to assess the validity of the algorithm. Medication errors are defined as errors in prescriptions that either harm or have the potential to harm the patients.</description>
