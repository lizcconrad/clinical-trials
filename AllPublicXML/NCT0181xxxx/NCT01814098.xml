  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long term escitalopram
      treatment in participants with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with associated anxiety
      symptoms.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single arm,
      prospective (study following participants forward in time), post-marketing, multi-center
      (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of escitalopram in participants with MDD with associated
      anxiety symptoms. The duration of the study will be 24 weeks at a starting dose of
      escitalopram 10 milligram per day (mg/day). The dose will be flexibly adjusted (maximum 20
      mg/day) after 2 weeks of treatment depending on Investigator's discretion. The study will
      consist of 9 visits: Baseline, Week 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. Assessments of efficacy
      and safety will be performed at each visit. The primary efficacy evaluation will be done by
      Montgomery-Asbery Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale(HAM-A).
      Participant's safety will also be monitored throughout the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Remission According to Montgomery-Asbery Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Remission is defined as MADRS total score =&lt;10 and HAM-A score =&lt;7. MADRS measures depression severity and detects changes due to antidepressant treatment. It consists of 10 items, each scoring from 0 (not present) to 6 (severe). Total score= 0-60. Higher scores indicate more severe condition. HAM-A is 14-item scale measuring anxiety in individuals. Each question reflects a symptom of anxiety (physical and mental symptoms). The answers range from 0 (complete lack of symptom) to 4 (very severe show of anxiety with that symptom). Total score= 0-56. Higher scores indicate a more severe condition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Showing Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Response is defined as having more than or equal to 50 percent decrease from baseline of MADRS total score. The MADRS is a scale designed to measure depression severity and detects changes due to antidepressant treatment. The test consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in MADRS Total Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a scale designed to measure depression severity and detects changes due to antidepressant treatment. The test consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline of Single Rating Item in MADRS Total Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a scale designed to measure depression severity and detects changes due to antidepressant treatment. The test consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD)-17 Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The depressive symptoms will be assessed using the 17-item HAMD scale, which provides a total score (0-52) (sum of the scores of all 17 items ). For total score of each item, higher score indicates severity of depressive symptom.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-A is a 14-item scale designed to measure anxiety in individuals,which provide a total score of 0-56. Higher scores indicate a more severe condition. Each question reflects a symptom of anxiety and physical as well as mental symptoms are represented. The answers range from 0 which signifies a complete lack of that symptom to 4, which indicates a very severe show of anxiety with that symptom.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline of Single Rating Item in HAM-A at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-A is a 14-item scale designed to measure anxiety in individuals,which provide a total score of 0-56. Higher scores indicate a more severe condition. Each question reflects a symptom of anxiety and physical as well as mental symptoms are represented. The answers range from 0 which signifies a complete lack of that symptom to 4, which indicates a very severe show of anxiety with that symptom.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression Score (CGI-S) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7 point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Short Form-12 (SF-12) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. The eight sections are: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health Each item is scored into on a 0-100 range. All items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state.</description>
