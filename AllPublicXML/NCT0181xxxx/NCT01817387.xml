    <textblock>
      This project will result in the development of a personalized intervention strategy to
      improve motivation for treatment engagement and functional outcomes in individuals with a
      recent onset of schizophrenia. Motivational impairment is arguably the single most important
      factor that determines a patient's ability to engage in and adhere to effective treatment. In
      our study, sixty participants will be enrolled in a randomized controlled trial comparing the
      feasibility and tolerability of two types of motivational interventions (Daily Goals or
      PRIME), and a neuroplasticity-based cognitive training program. Participants are randomized
      to either receive Daily Goals or PRIME for 8 weeks, after which, both conditions will also
      receive an 8-week course of cognitive training delivered via iPads. Participants will undergo
      pre/post-testing and a 6-month follow-up to determine feasibility and efficacy of the
      interventions. By enhancing motivation, schizophrenia patients would be able to engage more
      fully with treatment and develop full and productive lives. This study may also pave the way
      forward for other health conditions in which motivational impairments impede health outcomes.

      All assessments will be conducted at the University of California, San Francisco; however, we
      offer some assessments to be done remotely.
