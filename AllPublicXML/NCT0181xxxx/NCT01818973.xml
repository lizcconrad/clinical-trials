  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We presumed that the addition of a monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab into radiation therapy and
      combination chemotherapy could results in improved pathologic tumor regression grade (TRG) in
      locally advanced nonmetastatic rectal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Giving
      bevacizumab together with radiation therapy and combination chemotherapy before surgery may
      achieve promising improvements in pCR rates, we designed this Phase II study in patients with
      T3/4 or N1/2 loco-regionally advanced rectum cancer, to examine the efficacy and safety of
      the addition of bevacizumab to a regimen of capecitabine and oxaliplatin in combination with
      pre-operative radiation.

    <description>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with XELOX: Xeloda, po, 1000mg/m2/12h daily, day 1 in the afternoon until day 15 in the morning; Oxaliplatin, iv, 130mg/m2, day 1; and Bevacizumab, iv, 7.5 mg/kg, day 1, during the first cycle (each cycle has 3 weeks).
Followed by chemoradiotherapy, 50 Gy/25 fractions during 5 weeks plus 2 cycles XELOX and Bevacizumab: Xeloda, po, 1000mg/m2/12h daily, day 1 in the afternoon until day 15 in the morning; Oxaliplatin, iv, 100mg/m2, day 1; and Bevacizumab, iv, 7.5 mg/kg, day 1.
6-7 weeks from the last radiation therapy, Total Mesorectal Excision (TME) surgery will be performed.
3-4 weeks after operation, 3 cycles XELOX (the same as the neoadjuvant chemotherapy) and 2 cycles Xeloda (po, 1000mg/m2/12h daily, day 1 in the afternoon until day 15 in the morning) will be administered.</description>
