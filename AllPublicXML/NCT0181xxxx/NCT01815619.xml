    <textblock>
      This study will test two different methods for processing biopsy specimens taken from the
      bile duct. Patient;s who are asked to participate int his study have a growth (mass) in the
      bile duct that needs a biopsy so a diagnosis can be made. Standard of care includes
      performing 5-7 biopsies in the bile duct and sending the tissue to the lab for testing to
      make a diagnosis. Using this method the investigators can establish a diagnosis only about
      50% of the time. The investigators believe that if a pathologist is available in the
      endoscopy suite during the procedure, the investigators can improve the test results. The
      purpose of this study is to compare the two methods for processing biopsies obtained from the
      bile duct.

    <textblock>
      The diagnostic accuracy rate of cholangioscopy-guided biopsy is only 50%. This translates to
      the need for performing repeat procedures to establish a diagnosis and therefore delays
      patient treatment. The biopsy specimen obtained at cholangioscopy are usually processed in an
      offsite pathology lab. We believe that if a pathologist can assess the tissue sample during
      the procedure itself (onsite) and provide feedback, the diagnostic accuracy rate will
      improve. This translates to better (faster) diagnosis and early treatment. Therefore, we will
      be comparing onsite versus offsite evaluation of bile duct biopsy specimens to determine
      which method yields a better diagnosis.
