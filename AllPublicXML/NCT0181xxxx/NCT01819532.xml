  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anemia in preterm neonates is a significant problem encountered frequently in the neonatal
      intensive care unit. Most preterm neonates born at less than 33 weeks gestation will require
      at least one blood transfusion during their hospital course and many will require repeated
      transfusions. Blood transfusions, albeit necessary, carry increased risk of viral infections
      and transfusion reactions as well as increase the cost of healthcare. The umbilical cord and
      placenta harbor up to 40% of blood available during fetal life. The current standard of care
      is immediate umbilical cord clamping. The investigators are performing a randomized
      controlled trial comparing immediate cord clamping to milking the umbilical cord prior to
      clamping in neonate born preterm less than 33 weeks gestation. The investigators hypothesize
      that milking the umbilical cord will demonstrate the same benefits as delayed cord clamping,
      without delaying neonatal resuscitation.

  <why_stopped>
    extremely poor recruitment &amp; since the study was approved, medical practice has evolved to
    where cord milking is now common practice.
