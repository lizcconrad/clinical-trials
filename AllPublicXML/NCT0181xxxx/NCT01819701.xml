  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of Taiwan. L-carnitine (LC) and coenzyme
      Q10 is recognized as lipid soluble antioxidants. The purposes of this study are going to
      investigate the relation of LC and coenzyme Q10 with the markers of lipid peroxidation,
      antioxidant enzymes activities, and the inflammatory markers in coronary artery disease (CAD)
      patients. The study is designed as a three-year study. The first year is an observation
      study. We will recruit CAD patients who are identified by cardiac catheterization as having
      at least 50% stenosis of one major coronary artery, and age-gender matched healthy subjects.
      The concentrations of LC, coenzyme Q10, lipid peroxidation markers (TBARS and ox-LDL),
      antioxidant enzymes activities (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and
      superoxide dismutase), and inflammatory markers are going to analysis. The second year is a
      single-blind, single dose intervention study. CAD subjects are recruit form the first year
      and randomly assigned to placebo, coenzyme Q10-150 (150 mg/d), coenzyme Q10-300 (300 mg/d),
      LC-1000 (1000 mg/d) or LC-2000 (2000 mg/d) groups. Intervention is going to administration
      for three months. Fasting blood will be obtained in each month and determine the
      concentration of LC, coenzyme Q10, lipid peroxidation markers, antioxidant enzymes
      activities, and inflammatory markers after intervention. The third year is a single-blind,
      multiple doses intervention study. We are going to measure the CAD subjects from the second
      year intervention study. After three months washout period, the subjects are assigned to
      placebo, coenzyme Q10-150 plus LC-1000, coenzyme Q10-150 plus LC-2000, coenzyme Q10-300 plus
      LC-1000, and coenzyme Q10-300 plus LC-2000 groups. Intervention is going to administration
      for three months. Fasting blood will be obtained in each month and determine the
      concentration of LC, coenzyme Q10, lipid peroxidation markers, antioxidant enzymes
      activities, and inflammatory markers after intervention. Hopefully, the results of this study
      could provide information of LC and coenzyme Q10 supplementation for clinical dietitian in
      advising CAD patients.
