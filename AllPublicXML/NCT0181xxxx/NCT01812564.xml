      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of utilizing complex growth
      factor preparations (Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) in the management of acute hamstring
      injuries.

      The hypothesis is that the time to return to sport is shorter in the patient group treated
      with Complex Growth Factor Preparations (PRP) in combination with exercise therapy in
      comparison with 2 control groups:

        -  the patient group treated with Platelet Poor Plasma (PPP) injections in combination with
           exercise therapy (control injection AND usual care).

        -  the patient group treated with exercise therapy (usual care)
