  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We plan to examine the gastrointestinal (GI) physiologic profile of Exenatide, a
      glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) analog as a possible intestino-trophic growth factor capable of
      inducing small bowel adaptation and regeneration in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS),
      with the potential to decrease parenteral nutrition dependence.

    <description>Qualifying participants will be assigned to 2 different treatment arms consisting of placebo or exenatide 5 mcg administered subcutaneously twice: the first dose during fasting and the second four hours later. Subsequently, participants will switch over to the alternate treatment arm. In both arms participants will undergo a series of measurements including 24 hour GI transit, permeability measurements by using mannitol and lactulose, and 24 hour urine and stool collections.</description>
