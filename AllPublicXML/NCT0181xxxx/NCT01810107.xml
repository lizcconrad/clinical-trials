  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to develop a growth and development chart (similar to a
      height or weight chart for children) that identifies the pattern of development of the
      pediatric vocal cord lamina propria from a single to a three layer structure. A secondary aim
      is to identify whether this growth chart shows a pattern of linear development or whether
      there are clear critical periods of development.

      The goal of this study is to identify critical periods of development when the lamina propria
      structure of the pediatric vocal fold matures. A Universal Modular Glottiscope will be
      utilized for adequate laryngeal exposure. An operating microscope will be used for
      magnification. This setup will allow for the Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging probe
      to be introduced using a laryngoscope to provide stability. The optical imaging probe will
      then be directed, or gently applied towards, the glottal surface, and an image field of 500
      microns x 500 microns x 350 microns will be obtained. As the probe is moved along the medial
      and superior mucosal surfaces of the vocal folds, &quot;real-time&quot; images will be obtained and
      digitally stored for review. The digitally stored images will be assessed and analyzed for
      their optical characteristics. The optical imaging probe will then be withdrawn from the
      patient and the original operative procedure will then be performed. Images can be attained
      in both &quot;non-contact&quot; mode (where the probe tip remains in the space between each vocal fold)
      and &quot;contact&quot; mode (where the probe tip is gently placed against the glottal tissue to
      compress it). The contact mode allows for deeper imaging (much like an ultrasound), which
      would be useful in situations involving larger (thicker) vocal folds. The study will end when
      images are acquired from a range of developmental ages to be able to refine the optical
      characteristics of the optical imaging system.

      Adults have also been included in this study for comparison as OCT imaging in adults may
      confirm the number of vocal fold layers compared to children.

    <description>The goal of this study is to identify critical periods of development when the lamina propria structure of the pediatric vocal fold matures. The major analysis will be to validate the age dependent laminar structure using a cohort of 720 subjects between age 0-18 as well as estimate the probability of future events of developing two- or three laminar structure given a subject's age. We will perform one-sided two-sample binomial tests to examine as well as model the patterns of the rates of bi- and tri-laminar structure patterns by using logistic model or discrete or continuous time Cox's proportional hazards model of which the predictor variables are determined based on the discriminant model described above. In addition, as a parallel approach we will analyze the Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) data of each of the trilaminar system by using linear or curve-linear regression models which will provide a prediction model of the mean OCT at various critical ages.</description>

        Children ages 1 month to 18 (and adults &gt;18) undergoing laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy for
        airway evaluation where the patients will be already scheduled for general anesthesia with
        intravenous catheter placement as part of standard routine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children ages 1 month to 18 (and adults &gt;18) undergoing laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy
             for airway evaluation where the patients will be already scheduled for general
             anesthesia with intravenous catheter placement as part of standard routine.

          -  Children (and adults) undergoing any otolaryngology procedure where there is no
             indication of airway obstruction or risk of abnormal vocal chords. For instance,
             children undergoing adenoidectomy, sinus surgery or tracheotomy are all good
             candidates for studying the normal vocal chord development.

          -  Children whose parents have given and signed an informed consent and Health Insurance
             Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Authorization and who have signed an assent
             form (if they are 7 and older) agreeing to participate in the study. Eligibility will
             be determined by the Principal Investigator.

          -  Adults who have given and signed an informed consent and HIPAA Authorization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children (or adults) with any form of laryngeal anomaly or pathology.

          -  Children who have previously been intubated.

          -  Children, adolescents, and adults who smoke. Exclusion will be determined by the
             Principal Investigator.
