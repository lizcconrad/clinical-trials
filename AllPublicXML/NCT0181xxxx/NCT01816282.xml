      A randomized controlled study is performed to address the question of whether the topical
      application of a novel fibrin sealant, Evicel (Johnson &amp; Johnson Wound Management, Ethicon,
      Somerville, NJ) in patient undergoing total knee replacement (TKR) reduce the perioperative
      blood loss and the need for allogenic blood transfusion compared to a control group. We
      hypothesize that fibrin sealant decrease the drop in post-operative hemoglobin level after
      total knee replacement.

      Total knee replacement is an invasive surgical procedure that can expose patients to massive
      perioperative bleeding. This hematic loss results in a high rate of blood transfusion after
      total knee replacement (TKR) with an incidence from 10% to 58%.Methods to prevent the need
      for allogenic blood transfusion after TKR include hemodilution, perioperative blood salvage
      and reinfusion, hypotensive anesthesia, preoperative autologous blood donation and
      intravenous administration of tranexamic acid.

      In the last decade, the topical use of fibrin sealant has become a logical surgical stratagem
      for reducing blood loss in total knee arthroplasty.Fibrin sealants mimic the final step of
      the coagulation cascade reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements.

      A novel hemostatic agent derived from banked allogenic human plasma (EVICEL, Johnson &amp;
      Johnson Wound Management, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) is recently available on the market for a
      variety of surgical specialty.

      A randomized controlled study is conducted to test if the post-operative reduction in
      hemoglobin level would be lower in the fibrin sealant group compared to a control group.

    <description>Calculation of perioperative blood loss is based on changes in hemoglobin (Hb) level. Assuming that the blood volume V0 on the seventh day after surgery is the same as that before surgery the loss of Hb is estimated according to the following formula:
Hb-loss (g) =V0 (l)×(Hbpre-op (g/l)-Hb7day post-op(g/l))+Hb-transfused (g) where:
Hb-loss (g) is the amount of hemoglobin lost
Hbpre-op (g/l) is the hemoglobin level before surgery
Hb7day post-op (g/l) is the hemoglobin level in postoperative day 7
Hb-transfused (g) is the total amount of allogeneic hemoglobin transfused; a unit of banked blood is considered to contain 52 g of hemoglobin.
V0 (l) is the total blood volume of patient and it is calculated using the formula of Nadler:
V0male(l)=0.3669×height(m)3+0.03219×weight(Kg)+0.6041 V0female(l)=0.3561×height(m)3+0.0338×weight(Kg)+0.1833
The total blood loss is calculated as follows:
Blood loss(l)=Hb-loss(g)/Hbpre-op(g/l)</description>
