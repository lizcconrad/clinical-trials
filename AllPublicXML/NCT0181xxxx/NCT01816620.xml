      The purpose of this prospective study is to determine the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide
      plus dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed POEMS syndrome.

    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to use the adverse effects as well as the need for dose reduction
      as a criterion to judge tolerability of treatment.

      The primary endpoint would be hematological response rate according to international myeloma
      working group (IMWG) response criteria for amyloidosis and neurological response rate defined
      by overall neuropathy limitation scale (ONLS) score.

      This study expects to enroll approximately 41 subjects.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that
             would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form.

          2. Pregnant or lactating females.

             Renal failure requiring dialysis. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) &gt;3 times of the normal upper limit.

          4. Prior history of malignancies, but not including basal cell carcinoma of the skin,
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, carcinoma in
             situ of the breast, and T1a or T1b prostate cancer.

          5. Known hypersensitivity or prior history of uncontrollable side effects to
             dexamethasone therapy.
