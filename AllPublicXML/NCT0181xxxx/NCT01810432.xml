    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure how much of the drug gets into the blood stream and
      how long it takes the body to get rid of it when given to healthy participants. Information
      about any side effects that may occur will also be collected.

      The study has 2 periods. In each period, participants will take the study drug for 10 days,
      either with or without a meal. There is a minimum 14 day washout between each period.

      This study is approximately 50 days, not including screening. Screening is required within 28
      days prior to the start of the study.
