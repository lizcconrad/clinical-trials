    <textblock>
      This study was advocated by Institute of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, China Academy
      of Chinese Medical Sciences in January 2013.

      It was funded by China major scientific and technological specialized project for
      'significant new formulation of new drugs'.

      DanshenDuofensuanyan is kind of Chinese Medicine injection used for treating coronary heart
      disease and angina pectoris in many Chinese hospitals.

      The purpose of this study is to determine adverse drug events or adverse drug reaction in
      large sample size 30,000 patients.

      It is very common that Chinese Medicine Injection used in hospitals in mainland China.
      However safety problems rose in recent years. There could be many uncertain factors influence
      Chinese Medicine Injection in clinical practice.

      In order to ensure the safety of public drug use and lower drug-induced risks, a registry
      study for DanshenDuofensuanyan injection safety surveillance with 30000 patients will be
      conducted from Jan.2013 to Dec.2015.

      Eligibility criteria Patients who will use DanshenDuofensuanyan injection in selected
      hospitals.

    <time_frame>to assess DanshenDuofensuanyan's 'adverse event' and 'drug adverse reaction' during patients' hospital stay. The registry procedure will last 2 years only for patients using DanshenDuofensuanyan</time_frame>
    <description>All patients will be measured and assessed at the time DanshenDuofensuanyan is administered to them until they discharge. Patients using DanshenDuofensuanyan will be registered on a registration form including disease background, DanshenDuofensuanyan's administration, and extraction information from hospital information system. An adverse event or drug adverse reaction form also will be used to describe any doubted symptoms or signs from patients. A judgment will be made by doctors directly and a further analysis will be conducted by researchers to decide those potential side effects of DanshenDuofensuanyan.</description>
