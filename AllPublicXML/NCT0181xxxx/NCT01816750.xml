  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recently introduced Computed tomography (CT) scanner, Discovery CT750 HD (GE Healthcare,
      Milwaukee), incorporates a battery of innovations aimed at improving diagnostic image
      quality, evaluating perfusion and assessing for scar, in an effort to address the current
      shortcomings of Computed tomographic coronary angiography (CTCA) in patients with significant
      coronary artery disease. The new scanner will use a novel method of scanning (Cardiac
      Gemstone Spectral Imaging - Cardiac GSI) and image reconstruction (Adaptive Statistical
      Iterative Reconstruction- ASIR) as opposed to standard definition 64-slice CT Multi-detector
      row computed tomography(MDCT)and Filtered Back Projection (FBP) used by the conventional CT
      scanners. The Cardiac GSI protocol enables the scanner to acquire images at two different
      x-ray energies almost simultaneously, which can be post-processed to selectively reduce beam
      hardening artefacts and delete materials with specific attenuating properties from the
      images, such as coronary calcium. ASIR offsets the potential increase in radiation dose
      required for Cardiac GSI scanning. This will potentially result in images of higher
      diagnostic quality with an equivalent or perhaps lower dose of radiation compared to present
      technology.

      Furthermore, it is hypothesised that dual-energy acquisition may improve the accuracy of the
      assessment of perfusion.

      Although initial in-vitro results are encouraging, this technology has not been rigorously
      assessed with regards to its feasibility and diagnostic quality, limiting its applicability
      in routine clinical practice. This assessment will require a trial comparing the accuracy of
      Cardiac GSI CTCA with that of Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) for anatomical assessment
      of stenosis, Myocardial Perfusion Imaging with Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography
      (MPI-SPECT) for assessment of perfusion and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) for assessment
      of myocardial scar. We have designed a pilot study in this regard which will help us assess
      the feasibility of the scan protocol and provide data to power a larger study to assess the
      diagnostic remit of Cardiac GSI scanning in the assessment of patients with high-risk of
      significant coronary artery disease and myocardial scar.

    <description>Assessment of rates of recruitment, acceptability of the procedure to patients, ease of CT acquisition. This pilot study will add to this assessment with specific information about the diagnostic performance of the novel scanning technique:
Are images of sufficient quality to be diagnostic?
Is diagnosis likely to be non-inferior to current comparable techniques, sufficient to justify a formal study?</description>

    <measure>radiation burden of the Cardiac GSI techniques</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Discovery CT750 HD scanner uses a new image reconstruction technique called Adaptive Statistical Iterative Reconstruction (ASIR). ASIR uses more complex mathematical modelling for image reconstruction, thus reducing the need for statistical assumptions and reducing image noise and artefact. It also requires the less raw data and thus significantly less radiation dose. Studies suggest that using ASIR can achieve up to 40% dose reduction compared to Filtered Back Projection (FBP).
However, the effect of ASIR and radiation dose reducing algorithms on image quality and accuracy has not been assessed and the difference in image quality and artefact suppression using the new technology remains to be established before its widespread dissemination into clinical practice.</description>
