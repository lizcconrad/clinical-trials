  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and the possible mechanisms underlying
      music-based multitask training (i.e., Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics) in older people, compared
      to multicomponent exercise training.

      This study is designed as a 12-month, prospective, single-centre, single-blind, 2-arm,
      parallel group, randomized controlled trial in which 140 community-dwelling older adults at
      high risk of falls are randomly assigned to receive either a music-based multitask training
      intervention (i.e., Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics) or a multicomponent exercise training
      intervention, for 12 months. A 12-month follow-up is planned with outcome measures assessed
      at three time points: baseline (before intervention initiation), 6-month (intervention
      mid-point), and 12-month (intervention termination). Outcomes of interest include physical
      and cognitive performances, and falls. In addition, the investigators specifically address
      brain circuits in an exploratory sub-study. Volunteer trial participants from both study arms
      are invited to undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline and 12-month.

    <description>12 months of weekly, i) supervised, structured, progressive, 60-min multicomponent exercise classes, supplemented by ii) 30-min home-based exercise sessions. Briefly, the multimodal exercise program is based on core components for successful fall prevention in older adults. It contains balance, gait, coordination and strength training, with balance as a core component.</description>
