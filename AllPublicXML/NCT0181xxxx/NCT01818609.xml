    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle mass declines with inactivity (casting is a good example) and increases with
      activity (such as weightlifting). Whether muscle mass increases or decreases, is determined
      by whether more new proteins within muscle are made than are broken down. The investigators
      know that feeding protein increases the synthesis of new proteins but that the response of
      older muscles to protein feeding is blunted compared with the young. This resistance of the
      elderly to muscle building stimuli may be the primary reason that muscle mass is lost in
      aging. The investigators also know that periods of muscle disuse such as casting result in a
      person's muscle shrinking due, the investigators believe, to a lower rate of synthesis of new
      muscle proteins. Age-related muscle loss begins around 50 years old and proceeds at
      approximately 1% for every year after. Elderly persons would likely fare well with advancing
      age if their muscle loss were simply linear; however, a rate of muscle loss of 1% annually is
      a 'population view' and does not represent what occurs during short periods of muscle disuse
      (i.e. during hospitalization or illness), which occur with increasing frequency in elderly
      persons. During periods of disuse, the resistance of elderly muscles to protein nutrition may
      be worsened. The investigators will measure how quickly new proteins are made at rest and
      after protein feeding in elderly men, before and after a 14 day period of reduced activity
      brought on by having people reduce their daily step count.
