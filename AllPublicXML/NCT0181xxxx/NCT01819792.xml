  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infectious morbidity and mortality is a major complication of AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia)
      induction and consolidation chemotherapies related aplasia. The main aim of this study is to
      measure incidence of respiratory viral infections during AML induction and consolidation
      chemotherapy related aplasia. Primary end point is a positive polymerase chain
      reaction(PCR)associated with clinical signs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial and fungal infection treatment is well defined with guidelines. Few data are
      available for viral infections and concern essentially allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
      These infections are associated with a high mortality and morbidity rate. Data concerning AML
      are essentially retrospective, pediatric and with a little number of patients. Respiratory
      viral infections incidence is not known. These infections may be responsible for a higher
      mortality rate. Different risk factors are found: age superior to 65 years, lymphopenia,
      co-infections. Treatment is subject to a controversy: surveillance or starting an antiviral
      therapy. This study aims at understanding viral infections epidemiology during long term
      aplasia and optimizing their management.
