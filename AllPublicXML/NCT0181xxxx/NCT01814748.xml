  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and efficacy of once-weekly omarigliptin in participants
      18 to &lt;45 years of age with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycemic control. The
      study hypothesis is that treatment with omarigliptin compared with placebo provides greater
      reduction in hemoglobin A1c (A1C) in participants after 24 weeks.

    <description>A1C (%) is used to report average blood glucose levels over prolonged periods of time.
The unexpected absence of a treatment effect in this study led to investigations that included measurement of metformin levels in available samples collected for future research during the study. Of the 92 participants with samples who had not been rescued with metformin, 57% (25/44) in the placebo group and 29% (14/48) in the omarigliptin group had detectable metformin, indicating the use of metformin that was prohibited by the protocol. The use of metformin prohibited by the protocol was without investigator knowledge and is a confounding factor impacting the ability to draw any conclusions regarding the efficacy results from this study.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Adverse Event (AE)</measure>

    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure, that occurs during the course of the study. Data presented exclude data following the initiation of glycemic rescue.
The safety database was analyzed in a standard fashion in the all participants as treated (APaT) population for all participants who took at least one dose of study medication. This analysis may have been confounded by the use of metformin prohibited by the protocol (see efficacy results description above).</description>

        <description>A1C (%) is used to report average blood glucose levels over prolonged periods of time.
The unexpected absence of a treatment effect in this study led to investigations that included measurement of metformin levels in available samples collected for future research during the study. Of the 92 participants with samples who had not been rescued with metformin, 57% (25/44) in the placebo group and 29% (14/48) in the omarigliptin group had detectable metformin, indicating the use of metformin that was prohibited by the protocol. The use of metformin prohibited by the protocol was without investigator knowledge and is a confounding factor impacting the ability to draw any conclusions regarding the efficacy results from this study.</description>

        <description>Blood glucose was measured on a fasting basis.
The unexpected absence of a treatment effect in this study led to investigations that included measurement of metformin levels in available samples collected for future research during the study. Of the 92 participants with samples who had not been rescued with metformin, 57% (25/44) in the placebo group and 29% (14/48) in the omarigliptin group had detectable metformin, indicating the use of metformin that was prohibited by the protocol. The use of metformin prohibited by the protocol was without investigator knowledge and is a confounding factor impacting the ability to draw any conclusions regarding the efficacy results from this study.</description>
