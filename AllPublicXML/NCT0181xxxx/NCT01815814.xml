  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that children with spastic cerebral palsy will show greater
      improvements in gross motor function, associated developmental skills and growth after the 3
      months of myofascial structural integration treatment, a form of deep massage, than they
      showed after a 3- or 6-month pre-treatment waiting period.

      The investigators further hypothesize that children with spastic CP will maintain their gains
      in gross motor function for â‰¥ 3 months after completion of MSI treatment.

      -  The investigators will talk to you by telephone to determine if your child is eligible
           for the study.

        -  The study lasts for a total of 12 months with the massage treatment period lasting 12
           weeks.

        -  The study entails a total of 10 sessions of Myofascial Structural Integration therapy
           over the 12-week period. Each session will last one hour.

        -  The child will have an evaluation of motor functions and development on enrollment and
           at three-month intervals for a total of 5 evaluations.
