  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, longitudinal observational study of adult human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV) participants at academic and community-based practices in the United States who
      are switching from first-line to second-line therapy. The study's primary hypothesis is that
      HIV participants switching to raltegravir-based regimens will have better Medical Outcomes
      Study-HIV (MOS-HIV) Health Survey scores than participants switched to non-nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based or protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens.

    <measure>Medical Outcomes Study-HIV (MOS-HIV) Health Survey Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The MOS-HIV scale is a 35-item measure of health related quality of life (QOL) questionnaire which assesses 10 dimensions of health (general health perceptions, pain, physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, mental health, energy/fatifue, cognitive function, health distress and QOL), as well as a single item to assess health transition. In addition to these subscales, a Physical Health Summary score (PHS) and a Mental Health Summary score (MHS) is calculated using a method where the summary scores are transformed to a standardized scale with a norm of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 in the sample in which the summary scores were developed. The subscales of the MOS-HIV are scored as summed rating scales ranging from a minimum of 0, to a maximum of 100, where higher scores indicate better health.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4 Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>DASS-21 is comprised of questionnaires for three separate scales measuring Depression, Anxiety and Stress. The depression scale is scored by summing the responses of each question, multiplying by 2 and then scoring on a scale ranging from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 28+, with higher scores indicating greater severity. The anxiety scale is scored by summing the responses of each question, multiplying by 2 and then scoring on a scale ranging from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 20+, with higher scores indicating greater severity. The stress scale is scored by summing the responses of each question, multiplying by 2 and then scoring on a scale ranging from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 37+, with higher scores indicating greater severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in HIV Symptom Index (HIV-SI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4 Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>HIV-SI measures the frequency and level of bothersome HIV and HIV treatment-related symptoms, including nervous symptoms (dizziness, somnolence, trouble remembering), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, gas/bloating, diarrhea) and pain (hand/foot, muscle/joint). The 20-item questionnaire asks whether respondents experienced any one of these symptoms within the past 4 weeks, and if they did, what the relative level of bother for each symptom was, based on a 5-point Likert scale. The maximum sum of scores is 80; the minimum is 0; with a higher score indicating greater symptom distress.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4 Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>DLQI is a 10-question dermatology-specific QOL questionnaire, which is calculated by summing the score of each question, resulting in a maximum of 30, and a minimum of 0. Higher scores mean the QOL is more impaired.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21)</title>
          <description>DASS-21 is comprised of questionnaires for three separate scales measuring Depression, Anxiety and Stress. The depression scale is scored by summing the responses of each question, multiplying by 2 and then scoring on a scale ranging from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 28+, with higher scores indicating greater severity. The anxiety scale is scored by summing the responses of each question, multiplying by 2 and then scoring on a scale ranging from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 20+, with higher scores indicating greater severity. The stress scale is scored by summing the responses of each question, multiplying by 2 and then scoring on a scale ranging from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 37+, with higher scores indicating greater severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HIV Symptom Index (HIV-SI)</title>
        <description>HIV-SI measures the frequency and level of bothersome HIV and HIV treatment-related symptoms, including nervous symptoms (dizziness, somnolence, trouble remembering), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, gas/bloating, diarrhea) and pain (hand/foot, muscle/joint). The 20-item questionnaire asks whether respondents experienced any one of these symptoms within the past 4 weeks, and if they did, what the relative level of bother for each symptom was, based on a 5-point Likert scale. The maximum sum of scores is 80; the minimum is 0; with a higher score indicating greater symptom distress.</description>
