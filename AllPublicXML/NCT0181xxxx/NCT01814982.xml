  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (explores
      what the body does to the drug) and pharmacodynamics (the study of the action or effects a
      drug has on the body) of JNJ-17299425 in participants with traumatic brain injury (acute and
      chronic injuries to the brain, including the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, and brain
      stem).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center
      (conducted in more than one center), and exploratory study of single and repeat, escalating,
      intravenous (injection of a substance into a vein) doses of JNJ-17299425 in participants with
      traumatic brain injury. The study consists of 2 parts (Part 1 and Part 2), and each part will
      have 2 stages (Stage 1 and Stage 2). In Stage 1 of each part only standard care will be
      given, through sedation, analgesia and ventilation. If Intra cranial pressure (ICP) rises to
      greater than 20 millimeter of mercury (mmHG) after ventricular drainage, participants will
      enter Stage 2 of each part and will receive JNJ-17299425 (single dose in Part 1 and repeated
      dose in Part 2). During Part 1, safety and efficacy of JNJ-17299425 will be evaluated and
      during Part 2, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of repeated doses
      will be evaluated. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by reduction in ICP. Blood samples
      will be collected for pharmacokinetic evaluation at pre and post administration of study
      treatment. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Percentage Reduction in Intracranial Pressure (ICP)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes post administration of JNJ-17299425</time_frame>
    <description>The ICP is defined as the pressure within the cranial cavity. It is influenced by brain mass, the circulatory system, cerebrospinal fluid dynamics, and skull rigidity. Percentage reduction in ICP and reduction in ICP below 20 millimeter of mercury (mmHG) and a reduction of at least 15 percent ICP will be evaluated. Percentage reduction in ICP means ICP value at Baseline minus ICP value post administration of JNJ-17299425, divided by 100.</description>

    <measure>Absolute Intracranial Pressure (ICP) Reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes post administration of JNJ-17299425</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute ICP reduction is defined as difference between pre dose ICP and lowest ICP value achieved where ICP is pressure within cranial cavity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration To Achieve ICP Reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes post administration of JNJ-17299425</time_frame>
    <description>Duration to achieve ICP reduction will assess the time at which ICP value is less than 20mmHg, and the time to achieve 50 percent and below 50 percent of absolute ICP reduction, and time at which lowest ICP value is achieved. Percentage reduction in ICP means ICP value at Baseline minus ICP value post administration of JNJ-17299425, divided by 100 and absolute ICP reduction is defined as difference between pre dose ICP and lowest ICP value achieved where ICP is pressure within cranial cavity.</description>
