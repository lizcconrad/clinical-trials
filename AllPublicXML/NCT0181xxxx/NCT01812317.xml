  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fire-fighters are at increased risk of death from heart attacks when compared to other
      emergency service professionals whose jobs involve similar components such as emergency
      call-outs and shift work. The unique risk to fire-fighters is likely to reflect a combination
      of factors including extreme physical exertion, mental stress, heat and pollutant exposure.

      In the largest analysis of cause of death amongst on-duty fire-fighters, fire-fighter deaths
      were classified according to the duty performed during the onset of symptoms or immediately
      prior to any sudden death. The majority of deaths due to a cardiovascular cause (i.e. heart
      attack) occurred during fire-suppression whilst this activity represented a relatively small
      amount of a fire-fighters professional time. Fire simulation training centers offer a unique
      opportunity to assess the heart, blood and blood vessel response to fire suppression in a
      controlled environment.

      In this study the investigators will assess healthy career fire-fighters on two occasions:
      following a fire-suppression training exercise in a purpose built real-fire training center,
      and following a sedentary period as a control. The investigators will take blood samples to
      measure platelet activity (platelets are the particles in blood that help blood clot) and
      will examine how blood clots outside of the body. The investigators will then perform studies
      placing small needles in the arm to assess blood vessel function following fire suppression.
      By undertaking this comprehensive assessment of blood, blood vessel and heart function we
      hope to understand the mechanisms whereby the risk of a heart attack is influenced by fire
      suppression. The investigators hypothesize that following the fire-suppression exercise
      firefighters blood will clot more readily and their blood vessels will not relax properly
      which are two of the main processes in the development of a heart attack.
