    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial pilot study to test the efficacy of a pelvic muscular training
      intervention led by a physiotherapist on urinary incontinence, quality of life and sexual
      health in women who report urinary urgency and incontinence following surgery and radiation
      treatment for gynecological cancer vs. usual care (a 1-page sheet on Kegel exercises).

    <description>The participants randomized to the pelvic floor muscle training intervention will receive pelvic floor muscle training (0-12 weeks) delivered by a physiotherapist with clinical expertise and training in treating pelvic floor dysfunction. The intervention is 9 individual, one-on-one, 45-minute sessions; weekly for weeks 0-6 and bi-weekly for weeks 7-12 (first session will be 60 minutes). The sessions will provide pelvic floor muscle training based on the latest evidence, including biofeedback, to teach the correct technique for pelvic floor contractions, and participants will be asked to complete daily pelvic floor exercises at home.</description>
