  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma is the most frequent primary malignant brain tumor in adults (3,000 new cases
      per year) and is characterized by a poor prognosis (median survival 12 months). Treatment is
      based mainly on surgical excision as complete as possible followed by an additional
      radiochemotherapy. The prognosis depends mainly on the quality of resection when it is
      macroscopically complete. Different techniques to support the surgical resection have been
      developed over the past 20 years. The reference technique is currently the intraoperative
      neuronavigation for guiding excision by matching the intraoperative tumor boundaries with
      those of the preoperative MRI. Its main drawback is the loss of precision during the
      resection related to changes in anatomical limits of the tumor.

      The per-operative fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) is an innovative alternative technique to
      support the surgical resection. The 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), a molecule absorbed by the
      patient before surgery is captured specifically by the tumor cells and transformed into a
      fluorochrome revealed intraoperatively by a light source length adapted wave with a set of
      lenses included in the microscope. Resection is thus guided by this fluorescence whose
      disappearance translates complete tumor resection.

      Its interest is twofold:

        -  Increase the percentage of complete tumor resection.

        -  Improve disease-free survival and overall survival. The objective of the study is to
           compare the FGS to the intraoperative neuronavigation for the resection of glioblastoma,
           on a medical and economical level through a randomized, prospective, multicenter trial.

      The annual number of patients likely to benefit of this technique in France is estimated at
      2200 new cases.
