    <textblock>
      Objective:

      Due to high mortality rates the capillary leakage and the acute abdomen are important risk
      factors of the probability of survival. The aim of an optimal therapy of the acute abdomen
      within the neonatal period is beside the cure of the underlying disease the prophylaxis of
      capillary leakage with the help of optimised intra- and postoperative volume therapy.

      Question:

      Do the neonates with very low birth weight and a surgery therapy of acute abdomen benefit
      from early increase of the haemoglobin/haematocrit by optimised volume therapy with
      crystalloid and colloidal volume as prophylaxis of the capillary leakage?
