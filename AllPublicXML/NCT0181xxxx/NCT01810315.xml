      Purpose of the study is to assess tenofovir (TFV) PK and PD endpoints, cervicovaginal safety
      parameters, susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, and objective measures of vaginal applicator
      use in premenopausal and postmenopausal women.

      Premenopausal women: Baseline blood and genital samples will be taken in the follicular and
      luteal phase (visits 2 and 3). The participant will be given TFV gel and instructed to insert
      two doses, separated by 2 hours, and return to the clinic 3 hours after the second insertion
      for blood and genital samples (visits 4/4a and 5/5a).

      Postmenopausal women: Premenopausal women: Baseline blood and genital samples will be taken
      (visit 2). The participant will be given TFV gel and instructed to insert two doses,
      separated by 2 hours, and return to the clinic 3 hours after the second insertion for blood
      and genital samples (visit 3/3a). Estradiol cream will be distributed at visit 4. Post
      estradiol blood and genital samples will be taken at Visit 5. The participant will given TFV
      gel and instructed to insert 2 doses as before, while continuing to use the estradiol cream.
      Post TFV gel and estradiol cream blood and genital samples will be taken (visit 6/6a).
