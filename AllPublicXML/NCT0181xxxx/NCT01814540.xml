  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to elucidate tolerability and effectiveness in consumption of
      the complex indigestible sugars from dairy products called bovine milk oligosaccharides (BMO)
      to enrich intestinal microflora toward beneficial populations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind crossover study designed to determine if BMO at two different doses
      selectively enrich beneficial bacteria in the human gut and will be tolerated in healthy
      participants compared with a placebo control supplement. Each participant will consume two
      sachets of supplement for eleven days, separated by a two-week washout before starting the
      second and third arms. To determine the effect of dose, the placebo-control supplement will
      be administered in the first arm, followed by the low and high dose. Participants will
      collect stool and first morning urine and study personnel collected blood from each
      participant at baseline (day 0) and at the end (Day 11) of each study arm for all three arms.

    <description>The BMO powder will be isolated from whey streams by Hilmar Ingredients (Hilmar, California 95324). Hilmar Ingredients employs the same membrane filtration, and centrifugation processes used to purify whey protein in their commercial practice to extract and purify BMO from whey permeate. Furthermore, the same sterilization processes used on the equipment to purify whey products will be used to purify BMO. This method uses a novel high-throughput food-grade isolation protocol that leads to purification of specific BMOs with bifidogenic activity as prebiotic oligosaccharides that mimic the activities observed for Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMO). This strategy of developing methods for their large scale fractionation allows us to obtain a final product that mimics the naturally beneficial oligosaccharides present in human milk.</description>
