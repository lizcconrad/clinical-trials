  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the study about carbon monoxide in human inflammatory and other beneficial
      physiological function , now we'll be going to research its application in neonates .Phase 1
      Study as a foundation for the further test is, the safety and Adverse reaction study of
      newborn to inhaled CO

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have demonstrated that, carbon monoxide has showed the effectiveness such as
      in inflammation ,apoptosis as well as relaxation of smooth muscle of the body. Now we have a
      hypothesis to use carbon monoxide in pulmonary hypertension of the newborns, to observe
      whether it will decrease pulmonary artery hypertension on newborns. Phase 1 study is ,the
      safety and Adverse reaction study of newborn to inhaled CO , after this,we can master the
      application of carbon monoxide dose
