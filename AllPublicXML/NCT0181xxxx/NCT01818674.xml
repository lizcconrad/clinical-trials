      The &quot;Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Trial for Obesity and Metabolic Risk Factor
      Control in Jordan&quot; spans 51 months and aims to test the effectiveness of the Microclinic
      Social Network Behavioral Health Program in influencing lifestyle behavioral risk factors to
      improve diabetes management that effect weight and metabolic outcomes through social
      networks. The Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Program provides microclinic (MC)
      groups—consisting of approximately 2-8 individuals from pre-existing social networks
      (friends, relatives, coworkers, neighbors, etc)—with shared access to diabetes education,
      technology, and group support to promote weight and metabolic control through diet, exercise,
      medication adherence, and blood pressure management. MC members play a role in the collective
      effort to combat diabetes and solidifying self-management behavioral skills through
      peer-monitoring and encouragement of lifestyle behaviors.

      This Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Trial was established in collaboration with
      the Royal Health Awareness Society (RHAS) and the Jordanian Ministry of Health (MoH).

      This objective of the Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Trial, the first
      randomized control study of its kind, is to test the effectiveness of the Microclinic Social
      Network Behavioral Health Program. The study will yield valuable information on the impact of
      social relationships with diabetes education on weight and metabolic control among
      individuals with type 2 diabetes.

      I. Objectives

        1. To assess the effectiveness of the Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Program,
           on biomedical, behavioral, knowledge, and psychosocial outcomes compared to patients
           receiving a modified Microclinic Behavioral Health Program without the social network
           components.

        2. To assess the effectiveness of the Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Program,
           on biomedical, behavioral, knowledge, and psychosocial outcomes compared to patients
           receiving standard care.

        3. To assess the impact of utilizing existing social networks in improving biomedical and
           behavioral outcomes.

        4. To assess the long-term impact of Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Program
           on improving sustained clinical, behavioral, knowledge, and psychosocial outcomes.

      II. Study Design

      Randomized Control Study: This study is a randomized control study that will aim to recruit
      500 female and male adults (&gt;= 18 years old) with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, pre-diabetes, or
      at risk for diabetes, who will be randomly assigned to an intervention group (n=~300 as Group
      A), a group who will receive a modified Microclinic Behavioral Health Program without the
      social network components (n=~100 as Group B) , and controls receiving standard care (n=~100
      as Group C).

      III. Study Procedures

        1. Participant Recruitment (1-3 months) The aim of recruitment is to inform individuals
           with diabetic, pre-diabetic, or at risk for diabetes in the community about the
           microclinic study, and encourage patients to participate. The recruitment process will
           consist of interconnected strategies including: 1) the distribution of posters and
           invitations in four catchment areas, and a broader media campaign, and 2) recruitment by
           nurses through clinics in two pilot locations around Amman.

             1. Phase 1. Recruitment: Outreach strategies to recruit patients at risk for diabetes
                and with Type 2 diabetes include:

                  -  The Royal Health Awareness Society will lead an outreach effort to spread the
                     word about the Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Trial. The effort
                     will involve distribution of posters and flyers in the public sphere, and, if
                     possible, airing of radio or television spots.

                  -  At the three assigned Ministry of Health local health centers, a Project
                     Officer for each center will work with Project nurses trained in research,
                     Institutional Review Board approved protocol, and data collection to recruit
                     patients at risk for diabetes, pre-diabetes, and with Type 2 diabetes to the
                     Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Trial. Potential participants
                     will be contacted by phone or referred to the trial in person during their
                     visit to the health center and asked if they would be willing to participate.

             2. Phase 2. Randomization: Patients registering to participate in the trial will be
                entered into a sampling pool (n=~140 nodes - those originally recruited who then
                bring friends and family - per cohort) database that contains all the names of
                potential participants and unique identifying numbers for each person. Computer
                generated stratified randomization will occur on nodes to three study arms: a)
                Group A receiving the Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Program, b)
                Group B receiving a modified Microclinic Behavioral Health Program that has the
                same educational curriculum but without social network components and participants
                attend sessions as individuals, or c) Group C receiving no intervention and
                therefore, standard care as the control group.

             3. Microclinic Groups: Microclinics are self-selected groups of family and friends who
                are diabetic, pre-diabetic, or at risk for diabetes and come to meet regularly to
                support one another in setting and meeting goals for improving their health, to
                learn tools for managing diabetes, and to share much-needed medical supplies and
                equipment. Only participants assigned to the group A will be asked to bring in
                friends and/or family members with Type 2 diabetes, pre-diabetes, or at risk for
                diabetes to participate in the Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Program
                together. In comparison, participants assigned to group B and group C will have
                data collected as individuals.

        2. The Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Program (approximately 7 months) Only
           Group A will receive this program. Control group B will receive a modified version that
           contains the same educational curriculum but does not emphasize the importance of social
           support and social networks. Control group C will receive standard care and only be
           followed-up for parallel measurements in the same schedule.

           Group A participants receiving the Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health Program
           will be followed by a trained Project Nurse and receive an approximately 7-month program
           (sessions and educational materials) that will increase the knowledge and skills in
           diabetes self-management and peer support and monitoring. The curriculum includes
           sessions on the causes of diabetes, prevention of complications, symptoms,
           self-management strategies, diet, exercise, peer monitoring and support by trained
           Project nurses from MoH health centers, local physicians, and university professors.
           Each session will provide 2-3 hours of discussion to foster active class participation
           and engagement for ~28 participants.

        3. Evaluation and Data Collection A critical component of this project is systematic data
           gathering, analysis, and evaluation aimed at assessing the short and long term efficacy,
           sustainability and feasibility of the Microclinic Social Network Behavioral Health
           Program. The program evaluation will collect demographic, socioeconomic, medical
           history, medical data, behavioral data, psychosocial data, and social network data from
           all participants during the program as well as post-program (up to 2 years after
           baseline). Participants are assigned an identification number during recruitment and all
           identifying participants characteristics are kept a secure computer database that is
           both firewalled and password protected.
