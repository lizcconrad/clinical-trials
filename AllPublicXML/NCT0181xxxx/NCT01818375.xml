  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite Goal Directed Fluid Therapy (GDFT) has shown a reduction of hospitalization and
      overall complications in patients undergoing abdominal surgery, there is a need to address
      the effect of implementing GDFT on the incidence of specific surgical complications and in a
      context of en enhanced recovery program (ERP). Specifically, studies investigating the impact
      of GDFT on primary postoperative ileus (POI) in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal
      surgery and using an ERP are missing.

      It is hypothesized that the incidence of primary POI will be reduced in patients receiving
      intraoperative GDFT compared to patients receiving Standard Fluid Therapy (SFT) after
      elective laparoscopic colorectal surgeries with an ERP program.

      Randomized Controlled Trial. Study population: elective laparoscopic colorectal resections
      with an Enhanced Recovery Program (ERP) Sample size: 128 patients (140 accounting for drops
      out)

      Two arms:

      GDFT: patients will receive GDFT esophageal doppler guided; SFT: patients will receive SFT
      based on standard anesthesia formula and international guidelines to calculate fluid
      requirements.

      Study Hypothesis: the incidence of primary POI will be reduced in patients receiving
      intraoperative GDFT compared to patients receiving SFT after elective laparoscopic colorectal
      surgeries with an ERP program.

      ERP: all patients will receive the same perioperative care according to the Enhanced Recovery
      After Surgery ERAS® program guidelines. Intravenous fluid will be stopped the first day after
      surgery. Patients will be allowed to have clear fluids the same day of surgery and diet, as
      tolerated, the first day after surgery.

    <description>During surgery, patients in the Goal Directed Fluid Therapy (GDFT) will receive:
maintenance infusion of intravenous infusion of ringer lactate at a rate of 1.5 ml/Kg/hr to compensate insensible blood loss and fluid shift during surgery as recommended by perioperative fluid management guidelines for patients undergoing surgery with an enhanced recovery program and receiving a GDFT approach;
intraoperative intravenous boluses of colloids (6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 in 0.9% sodium chloride-Voluven) guided by an algorithm based on Esophageal Doppler (ED) estimation of the stroke volume (SV) provided by the manufacture, and also used in other clinical trials.</description>

    <description>During surgery, patients will receive a maintenance infusion of intravenous infusion of ringer lactate as recommended by international guidelines and anesthesia text-books (Standard Fluid Therapy). In the Standard Fluid Therapy arm, the Esophageal Doppler (ED) monitor will be turned away from the anesthesia care provider, and the screen will be covered with an opaque card. The ED variables will be collected by an independent research personnel. Hemodynamic variables triggering extra fluid administration (Ringer Lactate or Voluven) will be decided based on the clinical judgment of the anesthetist in charge and will include: urinary output less than 0.5/ml/kg/hr, an increase in heart rate more than 20% above baseline or more than 110 beats/min, a decrease in mean systolic blood pressure less than 20% below baseline or less than 90 mmHg and intraoperative blood loss. Boluses of 200 ml of intravenous fluid will be administered until the above targets will be restored</description>
