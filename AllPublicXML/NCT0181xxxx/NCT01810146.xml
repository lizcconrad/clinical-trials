  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      60 patients scheduled for bariatric surgery will be included into 3 categories (20 patients
      with non complicated obesity, 20 patients with metabolic syndrome and 20 patients with a type
      2 diabetes or hypertension). 20 volunteers will be enrolled as normal referents. The patients
      and the volunteers will have a classical pre-operative check-up (fibroscopy, oesophageal
      pHmetry and manometry) and extra investigations as isotopic gastric empty exam, lactulose
      oro-caecal transit exam, intestinal permeability test calculated by lactulose-manitol ratio
      urinary excretion. Intestinal and colonic biopsies will be also provided for studying
      permeability. For only patients, samples from the gastric resection will be provided for
      analysing the enteric nervous system and motricity.
