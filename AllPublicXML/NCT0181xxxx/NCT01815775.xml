  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The idea is to assess the predictive value of flow magnetic resonance imaging (flow MRI) for
      patient suffering normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) planned for surgery. By now, the
      depletive lumbar puncture is the best test assessing the efficacy of a forthcoming surgery.
      The idea is to demonstrate that flow MRI can be as effective as lumbar puncture in term of
      predictive value of surgery response.

      In that way, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics are evaluated by a single non invasive
      examination. CSF flow is measured at the Sylvius' aqueduct, cervical, arachnoid space and 4th
      ventricle levels.

    <description>Quantitative CSF flow study was performed by 2D phase-contrast velocity-encoded cine MRI (repetition/echo time, 15/7 ms; field of view = 140 x 140 mmÂ²; matrix size = 256 x 128, flip angle = 25 degrees,one excitation, slice thickness = 5 mm). Cerebrospinal fluid flow was measured with a velocity-encoding value of 10-20 cm/s. Peripheral gating was used to cover the entire cardiac cycle with retrospective cardiac synchronization of 32 quantitative flow-encoded images per cycle.
Clinical examination consists in neuropsychological assessment (including mini mental state examination test and Bradley's scale) as well as Hakim's triad evaluation</description>
