    <textblock>
      Patients with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) suffer from episodes of acute
      exacerbations leading to additional morbidity and mortality, and also a further decline in
      lung function. It has been well-established that bacterial colonization is prevalent in COPD,
      especially in moderate to severe COPD, and airway bacterial colonization is known to play an
      important role in the development of pneumonia and exacerbations. On the other way, inhaled
      corticosteroid (ICS) and long acting β2 agonist (LABA) were recommended in the treatment of
      moderate to severe COPD. Though there were some evidences that ICS had some protective
      effects on airway mucosa against bacteria invasion, the locally immunosuppressive effects of
      ICS is still a concern. Indeed, the incidence of pneumonia was higher than the control group,
      not only in the Towards a Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH) study but also in various studies
      and meta-analyses.We hypothesized that airway bacteria colonization is associated with
      disease severity, and that disease status can be identified by CAT (COPD assessment
      test)scores and changes of CAT scores. We therefore conducted this prospective, observational
      study in which CAT scores and sputum cultures were assessed in moderate to severe COPD
      patients with the combination therapy of ICS and LABA every three months during the study
      period. The primary end-point is the condition of potential pathogenic microorganisms (PPM)
      colonization in view of CAT scores. The second end-point was the changes of PPM colonization
      in association with CAT changes during follow-up. By the mean of CAT follow-up, it could
      possibly provide a surrogate about the risk of exacerbation and pneumonia under the
      combination therapy of ICS and LABA.
