  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to determine whether genetic information can be used to predict
      response to an internet-based treatment of depression. Several studies now indicate that
      completing an internet-based treatment for depression, called Deprexis, can significantly
      improve symptoms of depression. However, not everyone improves. The purpose of this study is
      to determine whether genetic profile can predict who is likely to improve.

    <intervention_name>Computerized self-help program for depression</intervention_name>
    <description>For 8 weeks, participants will engage in a computerized self-help program for depression, called deprexis. This program consists of 10 content modules representing different psychotherapeutic approaches broadly consistent with a cognitive-behavioral perspective. Modules are organized as simulated dialogues in which the program explains and illustrates concepts and techniques, engages the user in exercises, and continuously asks users to respond by selecting from response options. Subsequent content is then tailored to the users' responses, resulting in a simulated conversational flow. Participants can access the self-help program as often as they would like and since it is self-guided, they will determine how often they access the material. Each module can be completed in 10 to 60 minutes, depending on the user's reading speed, interest, motivation, and individual path through the program.</description>
