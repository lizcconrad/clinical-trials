      The investigators hypothesize that includes patient weight and glucocorticoid dose can be
      used to safely initiate insulin treatment in diabetic/hyperglycemic patients who are to be
      treated with pharmacological doses of glucocorticoids.

      The target fasting serum glucose (FSG) and pre-meal SG was 90-140 mg/dL, and the random SG
      was less than 180 mg/dL, taking into consideration the ADA/AACE target glucose levels in
      non-ICU patients (15).

      The Glargine/Lispro Protocol included 0.2 unit/kg/day as insulin glargine once daily if the
      dose was between 40-80 units, or twice daily if the dose was less than 40 or more than 80
      units; plus 0.2 unit/kg/day as lispro divided between three meals for all insulin-naïve
      patients. A &quot;coverage&quot; dose of 0.1 unit/kg/day of lispro for each 10 mg of prednisone or its
      equivalent was divided between 3 meals. The maximum starting &quot;coverage&quot; dose was 0.4 units/kg
      per day.

      The prandial dose of lispro was increased by 10% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner, or bedtime SG
      was between 141-200 mg/dL, and by 20% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner or bedtime SG is &gt;200
      mg/dL. The prandial dose of lispro was decreased by 10% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner, or
      bedtime SG is between 70-89 mg/dL, and by 20% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner or bedtime SG was
      less than 70 mg/dL.

      The Glargine/Lispro/NPH Protocol included 0.2 unit/kg/day as insulin glargine as per G/L;
      plus 0.2 unit/kg/day as lispro divided between three meals for all the insulin-naïve
      patients. A &quot;coverage&quot; dose of 0.1 unit/kg/day of Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) for each
      10 mg of prednisone or its equivalent was given twice daily with the administration of the
      glucocorticoid. The maximum starting &quot;coverage&quot; dose was 0.4 units/kg per day.

      The NPH dose was increased by 10% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner, or bedtime SG is between
      141-200 mg/dL, and by 20% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner or bedtime SG was greater than 200
      mg/dL. The NPH dose was decreased by 10% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner, or bedtime SG was
      between 70-89 mg/dL, and by 20% if the pre-lunch, pre-dinner or bedtime SG was less than 70
      mg/dL.

      In both protocols glargine dose was increased by 10% if the fasting glucose value is 141-200
      mg/dL and by 20% if the fasting glucose value was more than 200 mg/dL, and decreased by 10%
      if the FSG was 70-89 mg/dL and by 20% if the FSG was less than 70 mg/dL.

      If the patient had an outpatient regimen which includes a total daily dose of insulin (TDI)
      that exceeded 0.4 unit/kg/day, then the same TDI was continued with 50% given as glargine
      once daily if the dose was between 40-80 units, or twice daily if the dose was less than 40
      or more than 80 units; and 50% given as lispro divided between three meals. The patient was
      still randomly assigned to either one of the two protocols as described previously.

      If the patient were on a TDI less than 0.4 unit/kg/day in addition to oral antidiabetic
      medications as an outpatient, then all the oral antidiabetic medications were discontinued
      and the patient was started on 0.5 unit/kg/day divided as 50% glargine given once daily if
      the dose was between 40-80 units, or twice daily if the dose was less than 40 or more than 80
      units; and 50% lispro divided between three meals. The patient was randomly assigned to
      either one of the two protocols based upon even and odd hospital numbers.

          <title>Glargine/Lispro Insulin Arm</title>
          <description>The G/L Arm received 0.2 unit/kg/day as insulin glargine daily if the dose was between 40-80 units, or twice daily if the dose was less than 40 or more than 80 units; plus 0.2 unit/kg/day as lispro divided between three meals for all insulin-naïve patients. A &quot;coverage&quot; dose of 0.1 unit/kg/day of lispro for each 10 mg of prednisone or its equivalent was divided between 3 meals. The maximum starting &quot;coverage&quot; dose was 0.4 units/kg per day.
Glargine/Lispro insulin: In both protocols glargine dose was increased by 10% if the fasting glucose value was 141-200 mg/dL and by 20% if the fasting glucose value was more than 200 mg/dL, and decreased by 10% if the fasting FSG was 70-89 mg/dL and by 20% if the fasting FSG was less than 70 mg/dL.</description>

A &quot;coverage&quot; dose of 0.1 unit/kg/day of NPH for each 10 mg of prednisone or its equivalent was given twice daily with the administration of the glucocorticoid. The maximum starting &quot;coverage&quot; dose was 0.4 units/kg per day.</description>
