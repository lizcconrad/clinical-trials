  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to improve the diagnostic accuracy and specificity of
      MRI in detecting the degree of bone involvement and invasion in oral cancer. The presence and
      degree of bone invasion determines the extent of surgery and has great effect on the
      morbidity of patients with oral cancer and bone/soft tissue tumors.

      MRI scanning in 3 Tesla (3T) and 4Tesla (4T) MR magnet will be performed on up to 10 patients
      with possible maxillofacial and/or mandibular bone invasion. We will then compare the
      conventional imaging results of the patients with 3T and 4T MRI results and post operative
      pathology results.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unfortunately, detecting bone invasion and extension of bone involvement prior to surgery is
      often difficult with the currently available imaging techniques. MRI with high contrast
      resolution and the ability to perform multiplanar imaging plays an integral role in the
      delineation of tumoral involvement of the bone. Although MRI is an excellent tool in the
      assessment of bone invasion in carcinoma, its overestimation of cortical invasion and tumor
      extent to the bone marrow have been a diagnostic challenge, leading to false positive
      results. Like many of the musculoskeletal system tissues, cortical bone produces no signal
      with conventional MRI techniques, limiting the characterization of image contrast and
      differentiation of adjacent soft tissues. A novel MRI technique called Sweep Imaging with
      Fourier Transformation (SWIFT) appears to be a suitable tool to overcome this challenge. The
      main advantage of SWIFT is to obtain signal from the cortical bone. We believe that the SWIFT
      technique will overcome the false positive results.

      Patients enrolled in this study will be asked to come to the Center for Magnetic Resonance
      Research (CMRR) at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota for a scheduled MRI.
      Brief scans will be obtained (less than 1 minute) to localize the area of interest. Longer
      MRI scans (around 5-15 minutes each) will then be obtained. The total time required for
      scanning will be about 1 hour.

      To determine how well our MR images will predict the presence of mandibular invasion, we will
      compare our results with clinical, operative, radiological and pathological findings. Thus,
      patients will be asked to give permission to the investigators to access the relevant medical
      records.
