    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the proposed research is to evaluate the behavioral and genetic
      mechanisms of smoking risk in non-smoking young adults (aged 18-25 years of age) with and
      without ADHD using a novel laboratory-based model of intranasal nicotine administration.

      Study Hypotheses:

        1. that nicotine will produce greater positive and fewer negative/aversive subjective
           effects in individuals with ADHD. The study team also hypothesizes that nicotine will
           improve performance to a greater degree in those with ADHD.

        2. that individuals in the ADHD group will exhibit an increase in choices for nicotine vs.
           placebo in both conditions (i.e., main effect) and that this effect will be more
           pronounced in the High Demand vs. Low Demand conditions (i.e. Group x Condition
           interaction). Also that greater performance enhancing effects of nicotine will be
           associated with greater nicotine choice during the high demand cognitive condition.

        3. that the main effects of ADHD status on nicotine reinforcement will be heightened in the
           presence of certain genotypes. Also that the main effects of ADHD status on nicotine
           reinforcement will be heightened in the presence of certain genotypes. Finally that
           exposure to nicotine will alter epigenetic patterns in DNA

      Individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are more likely to smoke
      cigarettes than the general population, start smoking at a younger age, progress to regular
      use and dependence more quickly, and have a harder time quitting. The specific factors that
      confer risk for smoking-related outcomes among those with ADHD have not been thoroughly
      evaluated, though a range of possibilities exist. The overall goal of the proposed research
      is to evaluate the behavioral and genetic mechanisms of smoking risk in non-smoking young
      adults (aged 18-25 years of age) with and without ADHD using a novel laboratory-based model
      of intranasal nicotine administration. Target completion population of the study is 150 (75
      ADHD, 75 CTRL), although the population potentially screened will be 200. The investigators
      will systematically assess the effects of two doses of intranasally administered nicotine
      versus placebo. In addition, nicotine self-administration will be evaluated under conditions
      that are likely to be more cognitively challenging among individuals with ADHD. If the
      subject passes screen and their status as never smoking up to 1 cigarette in their lifetime,
      they will be scheduled for a the first of five experimental sessions: 3 fixed dose sessions,
      followed by 2 choice sessions. Each of the 3 fixed dose sessions will be identical except for
      the dose of nicotine evaluated. During choice sessions, the nicotine reinforcement procedures
      will be implemented. Finally to assess the moderating effects of genotype on the reinforcing
      effects of nicotine in non-smokers analyses will focus primarily with hierarchical regression
      models that covary gender and population substructure to assess effects of genotype on
      nicotine sensitivity outcomes. Further epigenetics analysis will be conducted, related to the
      initial nicotine exposure at the Fixed Dose Sessions.

    <description>The study team will use the Conners Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and n-Back Task to assess the effects of two doses of intranasally administered nicotine versus placebo on cognitive performance. Planned timeframe for measuring outcome (total 2 months). 1 month: Screen, 3 Experimental Sessions and 2 Sampling Sessions. 2nd month: Phone Follow-up</description>

    <time_frame>Session 1 (within 30 days of screening), Session 2, Session 3, Session 4, Session 5 (approximately 3 months).</time_frame>
    <description>The study team will use 3 questionnaires to assess the subjective effects of two dose levels of intranasally administered nicotine versus placebo. The DEQ (Drug Effects Questionnaire) will assess a range of reward, sensory, and mood effects. The Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) and The Profile of Mood States (POMS) will also be used to assess mood and affect. Length of time between each of the 5 sessions may vary from 1 day up to several weeks. All 5 sessions are expected to be complete in approximately 90 days.</description>

    <description>Throughout the study, vitals and urinary cotinine levels will be assessed. This will first be conducted to develop baseline participate data for the overall study, and also each particular session. Heart rate and blood pressure will be collected multiple times during each session to see any changes in physiological response to two dose levels of intranasally administered nicotine versus placebo. Urinary cotinine will then continue to be assessed, at the beginning of each session to assess levels post nicotine exposure as subjects progress through study. Length of time between each of the 5 sessions may vary from 1 day up to several weeks. All 5 sessions are expected to be complete in approximately 90 days.</description>

    <time_frame>Study visits 4 and 5, both within 90 days of screening.</time_frame>
    <description>In both Choice Sampling Sessions, subjects are exposed to both the full (i.e. 2 sprays of nicotine nasal spray) and placebo (i.e. 2 sprays of placebo spray) levels of nicotine exposure. In 1 of 2 of sessions, they then perform a High Cognitive Demand task (i.e. the PERMP or 10 minute math test). Potential monetary reward, based on performance (i.e. number problems correct), is noted to subject. Post the exposure trials of the session, the subject can then choose (blinded) 1 of 3 dose levels, via self-administering 2 sprays of either or both bottles. This Choice Sampling trial part the session occurs 5 times, and then an actual monetary performance reward is given.</description>

    <description>Agenetic analyses will be conducted, from serum samples collected from subjects. This will assess specific polymorphisms of DAT1, DRD2, DRD4, 5HTTLPR, and MAO genes to determine if they are linked to moderating the association between ADHD diagnostic status and subjective/mood, performance, and reinforcing effects of nicotine.</description>
