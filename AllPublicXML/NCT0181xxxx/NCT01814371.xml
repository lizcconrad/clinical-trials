  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of commonly used
      decolonization treatments (application of mupirocin antibiotic ointment to the nose and
      bleach baths) when performed by individuals with a history of skin and soft tissue infection
      (SSTI) in the prior year (individualized approach) in comparison to decolonization of all
      household members (household approach) in an attempt to prevent Staphylococcus aureus skin
      infections. The investigators hypothesize an individualized decolonization approach will be
      equally as effective as a household approach to prevent SSTI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was once uniformly associated with
      hospital-acquired infections; however, MRSA strains have emerged that thrive outside the
      hospital environment, causing significant morbidity and mortality among immunocompetent
      individuals, leading to their designation as community-acquired methicillin resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA).

      There is no available vaccine against S. aureus. Thus, other preventive measures, including
      topical antimicrobial therapies, have been used in an attempt to prevent staphylococcal
      infections. These therapies include mupirocin (a topical antibiotic with activity against
      MRSA) and dilute bleach water baths. The effectiveness of these measures directed at patients
      colonized with traditional MSSA and HA-MRSA strains in an attempt to prevent nosocomial
      infections varies across studies, and maintenance of eradication diminishes over time. With
      the emergence of the CA-MRSA epidemic, these measures have been extrapolated to patients in
      community settings. We aim to find a practical approach to decolonization which patients can
      feasibly perform at home to reduce the incidence of skin and soft tissue infections(SSTI).

      Specific Aim: Compare the effectiveness of decolonization of individuals with a history of
      SSTI in the prior year (individualized approach) to decolonization of all household members
      (household approach) in reducing the incidence of recurrent SSTI. Primary hypothesis: An
      individualized decolonization approach will be equally as effective as decolonization of all
      household members to prevent SSTI. Secondary hypothesis: Application of mupirocin to the
      anterior nares twice daily for 5 days will not result in a higher prevalence of colonization
      with mupirocin-resistant strains at subsequent longitudinal samplings.
