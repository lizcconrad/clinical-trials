  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Default options represent the events or conditions that are set into place if no alternatives
      are actively chosen. The setting of default options has well-established effects on a broad
      range of human decisions, but its influence on patients' preferences for end-of-life care is
      only beginning to be understood.

      This is a 3-armed randomized clinical trial in Veterans at high risk for critical illness,
      assessing the impact of Advance Directive (AD) forms framed with different default options.
      The central goals are to assess how default options in ADs influence the end-of-life care
      choices made by patients at risk for critical care, and these patients' hospital and ICU
      utilization.

      The investigators hypothesize that setting defaults in real ADs will increase the proportion
      of Veterans selecting comfort-oriented plans of care, decrease selections of life-extending
      therapies such as mechanical ventilation and dialysis, and reduce the proportion of time
      during follow-up that Veterans spend in the hospital and/or ICU, without affecting patient
      satisfaction with end-of-life care planning.
