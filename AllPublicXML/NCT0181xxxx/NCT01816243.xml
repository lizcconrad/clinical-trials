      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Transdermal Therapeutic
      System (TTS)-fentanyl patch (transdermal patch containing a drug that is put on the skin so
      the drug will enter the body through the skin) in Thai participants with chronic (lasting a
      long time) non-malignant (non-cancerous) pain.

    <textblock>
      This is an open label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single arm study to
      assess the efficacy and safety of TTS-fentanyl in Thai participants with chronic
      non-malignant pain (except for headaches or central spinal cord mediated pain). The study
      will consist of 2 phases: stabilization phase (up to 7 days before starting the treatment)
      and treatment phase (30 days). The first patch will be applied by Investigator then by
      participants themselves until 30 days. All participants will start the treatment with patch
      releasing 25 micrograms per hour (mcg/h) of fentanyl . The patches will be replaced every 3
      days. On Day 3, and every 3 days thereafter, the TTS-fentanyl dose can be titrated (slow
      increase in drug dosage, guided by participant's responses) as per participant's need. The
      duration of the treatment will be 30 days after first patch application. The dose of
      TTS-fentanyl can be slowly increased if needed, by 25 mcg/h to achieve adequate pain control.
      No increase in TTS-fentanyl dose will be performed within the 72-hour dosing interval.
      Participants will be allowed the use of oral morphine syrup for the duration of TTS-fentanyl
      treatment to enable appropriate TTS-fentanyl dose titration. Primary efficacy assessment will
      be pain control rated by participants. Assessment time points will be Day 0 (Baseline), Day
      15 and Day 30 (trial end). At the end of study, global preference on efficacy, side effects
      and overall satisfaction will also be rated by Investigator and participants. Participants'
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.

The initial dose of fentanyl TTS will be calculated based on each participant's opioid requirement. Patches will be usually replaced every 72 hours. Doses will be escalated in steps of 25 mcg/hr, if pain cannot be controlled. Oral morphine syrup is allowed to titrate the dose of TTS-fentanyl. The study duration will be 30 days after first patch application.</description>

          <description>Transdermal Therapeutic System (TTS) - fentanyl patches releasing fentanyl in the range of 12.5 to 100 microgram per hour (mcg/hr) rate. The initial dose of fentanyl TTS was calculated based on each participant’s opioid requirement. Patches were usually replaced every 72 hours. Doses were escalated in steps of 25 mcg/hr, if pain cannot be controlled. 90 milligram per day (mg/day) of oral morphine was allowed as supplementary analgesic. The study duration was 30 days after first patch application.</description>
