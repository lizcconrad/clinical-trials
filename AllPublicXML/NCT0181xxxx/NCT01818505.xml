  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hyperuricemia were confirmed to have higher risks of cardiovascular disease,
      but the exact mechanism remained to be elucidated. Many connective tissue diseases such as
      rheumatoid arthritis are often associated with antiphospholipid antibodies-associated
      endothelial impairment. In the present study, the investigators will analyze the presence of
      antiphospholipid antibodies in the serum of the patients with gout/asymptomatic
      hyperuricemia, with a comparison to the patients of osteoarthritis but without hyperuricemia
      and gout. The investigators expect to find a correlation between these pathogenic antibody
      and those cardiovascular co-morbidities.
