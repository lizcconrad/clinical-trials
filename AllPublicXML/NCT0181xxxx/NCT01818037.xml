  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cataract surgery in infantile eyes, which are microphthalmic, can be even more demanding.

      In addition, the frequent presence of other ocular and systemic anomalies such as nystagmus,
      glaucoma, amblyopia, and higher rate of postoperative complications may limit the success of
      cataract surgery.

      In our previous study, the investigators examined the intraoperative performance and
      postoperative outcomes of bilateral cataract surgery in microphthalmic eyes of patients
      before their first birthday. At 1 year, the postoperative results showed that good visual
      outcomes could be obtained in microphthalmic eyes.

      Since only a few studies have reported outcomes, and that too only short term of cataract
      surgery on microphthalmic eyes, in this prospective observational study we evaluated the
      long-term impact of bilateral cataract surgery on eyes with microphthalmos. The investigators
      examined the outcomes, complication rates, influence of age at surgery on pattern of axial
      growth and central corneal thickness and visual and orthoptic assessment in these eyes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of microphthalmos and congenital cataract.

          -  Microphthalmos was defined as an eye with an axial length (AL) that is more than 2 SD
             smaller than the normal for that age group according to Gordon and Donzes

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Children with congenital anomalies such as posterior persistent fetal vasculature causing
        stretching of the ciliary processes or a tractional retinal detachment, aniridia, and
        chorioretinal coloboma were excluded.
