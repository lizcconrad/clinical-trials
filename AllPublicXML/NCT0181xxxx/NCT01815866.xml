  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are opportunistic pathogens normally found in soil and
      water that are being cultured from Cystic Fibrosis (CF) airways at an increasing frequency.
      They have been demonstrated to cause clinically significant lung disease in some cases and
      the transmission of NTM, from person to person has been proposed. There are currently no
      standardized guidelines for isolation of those colonized or infected with NTM.

      The investigators will measure particle droplet size from patients with CF who have positive
      sputum cultures for NTM with the hypothesis that they will be in a range that can spread
      infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a positive NTM sputum culture will be asked to participate in the study. If
      they agree to participate they will sign an informed consent and will be scheduled to come to
      the University of Florida Clinical Research Center for the testing.

      The test will consist of the following: pulmonary function test, collecting a sputum culture
      if possible, coughing for 5 minutes into a tube connected to a canister, hypertonic saline
      and albuterol will be given after the 5 minutes of coughing and then they would repeat with
      another 5 minutes of coughing. There can be a break inbetween the coughing if needed.

      Patients maybe asked to come back a second time if they develop a different type of NTM or
      start treatment for NTM.

    <measure>The number of CF patients who produce culturable aerosols of NTM during coughing.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with CF and a positive sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture for NTM will cough into a chamber filled with culture plates that can measure droplet size. The investigators are looking for large droplets, that could land on surfaces and be a source for infection transmission, as well as fine droplets(5 microns or less)that are consistent with airborne transmission.</description>
