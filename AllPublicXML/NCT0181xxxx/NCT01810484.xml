  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled. Enrolled subjects will receive one of three study
      treatments in the abdominal region: Ultherapy® only, Ultherapy® and CO2 laser treatment, or
      CO2 laser treatment only. Follow-up visit will occur at 14, 90 and 180 days post-treatment.
      Study images will be obtained pre-treatment, approximately 30 minutes post-treatment, and at
      each follow-up visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, pilot clinical trial to evaluate the use
      of the Ulthera® System in combination with the 70W Alma Pixel CO2 laser for efficacious
      results in the treatment of abdominal striae rubra and striae alba. Subjects will be
      randomized to one of three treatment groups. Study personnel conducting efficacy measures
      will be blinded to the assigned treatment groups.

      Changes from baseline in overall skin texture and appearance of abdominal striae will be
      assessed at study follow-up visits. 2D images, 3D images and patient satisfaction
      questionnaires will be obtained.
