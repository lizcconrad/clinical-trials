    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory, single-armed, open label study on the efficacy and safety of
      sequential S-1 therapy after SOX in unresectable metastatic or locally advanced biliary
      system or periampullary cancer or pancreatic cancer patients. The primary endpoint is
      Objective response rate and secondary endpoint is progression free survival , overall
      survival ,1 year survival rate and safety.
