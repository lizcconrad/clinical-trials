      The purpose of this non-interventional, retrospective study of existing data is to evaluate
      clinical outcomes related to Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus hospital based
      pneumonia by treatment and among subpopulations.

    <measure>Time to 30-day Mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (1 January 2001) up to 3559 Days (30 September 2010)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to death (all-cause mortality) occurring within 30 days of treatment initiation was reported. Mortality was assessed from admission vital status databases.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Therapy Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (1 January 2001) up to 3559 Days (30 September 2010)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to therapy change was calculated from initiation of therapy (index date) to change in therapy (event date). Therapy change was defined as the discontinuation of linezolid or vancomycin and initiation of a different agent with activity against MRSA (clindamycin, daptomycin, doxycycline, linezolid, minocycline, tigecycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin). As such, therapy change included switching from linezolid to vancomycin, switching from vancomycin to linezolid, or switching from either linezolid or vancomycin to another anti-MRSA antibiotic.</description>

    <measure>Time to Discharge From the Hospital</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (1 January 2001) up to 3559 Days (30 September 2010)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to discharge from hospital was calculated from initiation of therapy (index date) to hospital discharge (event date).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Transfer Out From the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (1 January 2001) up to 3559 Days (30 September 2010)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to discharge from the ICU was calculated from the initiation of therapy (index date) to the time the participant was transferred out from ICU (event date). Transfer out of an ICU was assessed among those participants who had initiated linezolid or vancomycin therapy in the ICU.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Intubation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (1 January 2001) up to 3559 Days (30 September 2010)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to intubation was calculated from the initiation of therapy (index date) to intubation (event date).</description>

    <measure>Time to 30-day Re-admission</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (1 January 2001) up to 3559 Days (30 September 2010)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to readmission to any veterans affairs hospital facility within 30 days after hospital discharge was reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to 30-day Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Re-infection</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (1 January 2001) up to 3559 Days (30 September 2010)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to MRSA re-infection was defined as readmission with MRSA infection to any veterans affairs hospital facility within 30 days after hospital discharge.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Success</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (1 January 2001) up to 3559 Days (30 September 2010)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical success, a composite outcome defined as discharge from the hospital or ICU by day 14 after treatment initiation, in the absence of death, therapy change, or intubation by day 14. Percentage of participants with clinical success was reported.</description>

        <title>Time to Therapy Change</title>
        <description>Time to therapy change was calculated from initiation of therapy (index date) to change in therapy (event date). Therapy change was defined as the discontinuation of linezolid or vancomycin and initiation of a different agent with activity against MRSA (clindamycin, daptomycin, doxycycline, linezolid, minocycline, tigecycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin). As such, therapy change included switching from linezolid to vancomycin, switching from vancomycin to linezolid, or switching from either linezolid or vancomycin to another anti-MRSA antibiotic.</description>
