      The purpose of this study is to increase access for rural Veterans to evidence-based,
      person-centered, individually tailored treatment for alcohol use problems. The primary aim is
      to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of using mobile technology deliver treatment
      for alcohol use disorder. A mobile application will be used replacing the usual setting of
      clinical visits that accompanies standard face-to-face CBT therapy. The application will be
      loaded onto an iPod, which will be distributed to each participant that has been found to be
      eligible to participate.

      Many Veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan experience problems with drinking. There
      are treatments for alcohol use disorders that can be very helpful, but sometimes it can be
      hard for Veterans to find or participate in the treatments. This can be because of the amount
      of time the treatments take and the long distance to places where substance abuse treatments
      are offered. For Veterans who live in rural areas, these types of issues can pose even bigger
      problems. To address these issues, new types of treatments and ways of delivering care are
      being studied.

      We have developed a mobile application that will be accessed through the use of a mobile
      device such as an ipod. The application will contain an application dedicated to the
      treatment of substance abuse disorders. This application will provide the coping skills and
      educational information to aide in helping with problems associated with drinking alcohol.
