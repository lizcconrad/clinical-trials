  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim is to reduce overall allogeneic transfusion requirements during cardiac
      surgery when compared to standard management.

      To evaluate this the investigators will test the hypothesis that intraoperative, autologous
      platelet apheresis will primarily avoid allogeneic platelet transfusion. Following induction
      of anesthesia and intravascular line insertion, the patient will be randomized to control or
      treatment arms by sealed envelope technique where computer generated, randomization numbers
      are assigned prior to enrollment based on study patient number which is never reused.

      The control arm will have central venous access &quot;sham&quot; connected to the apheresis machine
      TrimaÂ® (Terumo BCT, Denver CO); the treatment arm will be connected and undergo pheresis. The
      clinical team will be blinded by a sterile sheet acting as a curtain and a recorded playback
      of the typical sounds of the operation of the apheresis machine. At the end of the pheresis,
      the platelet units will be disguised with opaque coverings and agitated at room temperature
      in compliance with the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) recommendations for
      platelet storage. On separation from CPB, the blinded administration of autologous platelets
      or allogeneic (blood bank) platelets will occur after protamine administration, if the
      surgeon requests platelet transfusion (this is typically the case for these operations). The
      surgeon will be blinded and he will order subsequent transfusions based on clinical evidence
      of microvascular bleeding in accordance with standard guidelines, as is the investigators
      practice for these operations.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All elective, aortic reconstruction surgery and other patients at high risk of
             receiving platelet transfusions such as: combined CABG/valve, more than one valve
             surgery via median sternotomy, left ventricular assist devise, and pulmonary
             thromboarterectomy with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest cases.

          -  Over 18 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  renal disease (dialysis dependent, end-stage renal disease or a baseline Cr &gt;3mg/dl)

          -  known coagulopathy/bleeding tendency (such as von Willebrand disease)

          -  platelet count of &lt;150x109 /liter at baseline

          -  Hct &lt; 30%

          -  platelet inhibitory drugs within 5 days prior to surgery or Aspirin 325 mg within 48
             hrs of surgery

          -  inability to provide written, informed consent

          -  patients receiving pre-operative parenteral, non-heparin anticoagulants will be
             excluded

          -  pregnancy is not an exclusion criterion for the study but, typically, pregnancy is a
             contraindication to elective cardiac surgery hence pregnant patients are unlikely to
             be encountered.
