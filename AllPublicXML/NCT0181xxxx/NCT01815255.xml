      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of generic TDF from Governmental
      Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) in HIV-infected children

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TDF is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) which can be taken only once per
      day and continues to have good efficacy even in patients who have resistance to other NNRTI
      in the absence of K65R mutation. TDF is a choice for patients with NRTI resistance, or those
      that require once-daily regimen to improve adherence. Currently, TDF has not been approved by
      the US FDA for children less than 18 years, but pediatricians has been using TDF in children
      who have treatment failure because of limitation of a more appropriate pediatric ARV. The
      Thai national guideline for pediatric 2009 recommend the use of TDF in children who have
      failed the first line therapy with multi-NRTI mutation and are more than 30 kilograms or have
      tanner stage 4 or more. However, the problem is that there is no pediatric TDF formulation.
      The available preparation of 300 mg tear drop tablet, if cut in half, may increase dosing
      errors, more or less by 18-37%. This will affect the blood level and/or toxicities.
      Therefore, the Thai Governmental Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) has produced a generic TDF
      formulation that can be used in HIV-infected children. This study will assess the safety and
      efficacy information in children using this generic pediatric TDF formulation.
