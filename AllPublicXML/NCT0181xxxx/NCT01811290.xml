  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether Multiple Sclerosis patients treated with
      Gilenya show a beneficial change over time in bone mass density and bone turnover markers as
      compared to matched controls treated with alternative FDA approved therapy or no therapy.

      To assess the effect of Gilenya on the rate of decline in bone mass density and expression of
      selected bone turnover biomarkers in ambulatory subject with a relapsing form of Multiple
      Sclerosis compared to control subjects matched for age, race, gender, duration of disease,
      and disability on an alternative FDA approved disease modifying therapy or no therapy at 24
      months compared to baseline.

      <textblock>
        Men and women aged 21 or older diagnosed with a relapsing form of Multiple Sclerosis.
        Minimum age was defined due to the limitations of site's current DXA bone scan software in
        scanning any person under 21 years of age. A total of 36 subjects will be recruited, with
        estimated 20% screen failure/early termination to allow for 30 subjects enrolled to
        complete the study. Racial composition of the regional population (Puget Sound of the
        Pacific Northwest, USA) from which study candidates will be recruited over-represents
        Caucasian individuals, and thus this pilot study may not be balanced for race.
