  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this sub-study is to determine whether healthy individuals over 90 years of age
      possess immune cells that are involved in protection from chronic disease. The immune system
      is well known to produce anti-cancer and other immune cells, called antibodies that can be
      beneficial to our health. In this study the investigators will evaluate the immune status of
      the healthy individuals over 90 years of age. The investigators will be focused on studying
      molecules known to be involved in cholesterol, cancer like those for prostate cancer and
      breast cancer, inflammatory diseases, and infectious diseases like influenza.

      The aim of this sub-study is to determine whether the Wellderly posess neutralizing
      antibodies targeting antigens involved in chronic disease. The humoral immune system is well
      known to produce anti-cancer and other antibodies that can be long lived in vivo. In this
      study we will evaluate the antibody status of the Wellderly with respect to neutralizing (i)
      molecules known to induce cholesterol like PCSK9, (ii) antibodies against cancer antigens
      like PMSA (prostate cancer) or Her2 (Breast cancer), (iii) antibodies against inflammatory
      molecules like TNFa or IL-6, (iv) antibodies that have broad neutralizing activity against
      infectious diseases like influenza.

    <description>We have made phage display libraries from the antibody genes derived from Wellderly B-cells. Remarkably, we could identify specific antibodies against several targets involved in multiple chronic diseases including PCSK9, inflammatory cytokines, and influenza hemaglutinin. We hypothesize that the Wellderly may contain antibodies targeting antigens involved in chronic disease, and that these antibodies may be protective and health-promoting.</description>
