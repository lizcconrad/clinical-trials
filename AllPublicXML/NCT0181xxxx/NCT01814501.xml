  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well panitumumab and combination chemotherapy works in
      treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer previously treated with combination
      chemotherapy and bevacizumab. Monoclonal antibodies, such as panitumumab, can block tumor
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others
      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and irinotecan hydrochloride, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving panitumumab and combination chemotherapy together may kill more
      tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the median progression-free survival in patients treated with leucovorin
      calcium, fluorouracil, and irinotecan hydrochloride (FOLFIRI) and panitumumab for K-ras and
      NRAS wild-type, metastatic colorectal carcinoma who have already progressed on FOLFIRI +
      Bevacizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the frequency and severity of toxicities of the regimens. II. To determine
      overall response rate. III. To determine the median overall survival and the overall survival
      rate at 1 year.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive panitumumab intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV
      over 90 minutes, fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours, and irinotecan hydrochloride IV
      over 90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
