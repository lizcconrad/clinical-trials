  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase Ia study, to assess the safety of two novel malaria vaccines,
      ChAd63 PvDBP, with or without MVA PvDBP. Heterologous prime-boost with ChAd63-MVA is, to our
      knowledge, one of the most potent T cell-inducing subunit vaccine regimens which can
      importantly also induce antibodies. Previous clinical trials using this regimen expressing
      ME-TRAP, AMA1 &amp; MSP1, have shown that administering ChAd63 as a prime followed 8 weeks later
      by MVA as a boost is a very immunogenic schedule (32-34). For this reason, and to provide
      comparability with previous ChAd63-MVA trials, we propose to use a similar administration
      schedule.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The safety in healthy volunteers of two new candidate malaria vaccines, ChAd63 PvDBP administered alone, and with MVA PvDBP, in a prime-boost regime.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 20 weeks post first vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the safety of ChAd63 PvDBP when administered alone and in heterologous prime-boost with MVA PvDBP. Safety will be assessed by the frequency, incidence and nature of adverse events and serious adverse events arising during the study as well as abnormalities in Hematology and Biochemistry lab tests.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The humoral and cellular immunogenicity of ChAd63 PvDBP, when administered to healthy volunteers alone and with MVA PvDBP.</measure>
    <time_frame>U to 20 weeks post first vaccination.</time_frame>
    <description>PvDBP_RII-specific immunogenicity will be assessed by a variety of immunological assays. These may include ex vivo ELISpot assays for interferon gamma and flow cytometry assays, as well as antibody ELISAs. Other exploratory immunological assays including cytokine analysis, antibody assays, anti-adenovirus antibodies, DNA analysis of genetic polymorphisms potentially relevant to vaccine immunogenicity and gene expression studies amongst others may be performed at the discretion of the investigators.
Other exploratory immunology may be carried out in collaboration with other specialist labs, including labs outside of Europe. This would involve transfer of serum/plasma, but samples will be anonymised. Volunteers will be consented beforehand.</description>
