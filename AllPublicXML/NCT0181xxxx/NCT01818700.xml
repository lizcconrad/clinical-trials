      The purpose of this study is to assess the pain reduction rate after 8 weeks treatment of
      NORSPAN® from baseline.

      And secondary purpose are: pain reduction rate after 4 weeks treatment from baseline(week 0)
      the EQ-5D, the pain and sleep questionnaire, physician's overall satisfaction subject's
      overall satisfaction, and safety

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon providing written informed consent, subject will be screened in the study and assessment
      will be performed at that time such as safety laboratory assessments, physical examination,
      vital sign, medical history taking, 24 hours pain intensity score, EQ-5D, pain and sleep
      questionnaire, physician's overall satisfaction and subject's overall satisfaction.

      If patient is eligible in inclusion/exclusion criteria at the time of visit 1, the patient
      will receive treatment with NORSPAN®.

      Treatment with NORSPAN® will be started from 5 μg/h (1 patch a week) for 2 weeks, and proper
      titration (up-titration) will be allowed at visit 2(wk 2) and at visit 3(wk 4) according to
      the investigator's decision.

    <description>The Euroqol Health Survey (EQ-5D, 3-level) was completed on five dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) to measure health-related quality of life on a scale from 0-1. A higher score indicates better quality of life.
EQ-5D score = 1 - 0.081 - (relevant score by level for the relevant item)-0.269 (only if there is at least one level 3).
Table of scores by level for EQ-5D items mobility(level 1=0, level2=0.069,level 3=0.314), self care(level 1=0, level2=0.104,level 3=0.214), usual activities(level 1=0, level2=0.036,level 3=0.094), pain/discomfort (level 1=0, level2=0.,level 3=0.386) and anxiety/depression(level 1=0, level2=0.071,level 3=0.236).</description>

    <description>This trial is single arm with Norspan patch. Treatment with NORSPAN Ò will be started from 5 μg/h (1 patch a week) for 2 weeks, and proper titration (up-titration) will be allowed at visit 2(wk 2) and at visit 3(wk 4) according to the investigator's decision. The up-titration will be considered by investigator's judgement as follows; (1) if the rescue medication was used more than 2 times per day, on average or (2) based on the daily average NRS(Numeric Rating Scale), if the NRS was changed to worsen since the previous visit, (3) Investigator's judgement by considering any titration needed situation (e.g. dose, frequency of rescue medication).</description>

            <description>This study is single arm for Norspan(buprenorphine) patch. Treatment with NORSPAN Ò will be started from 5 μg/h (1 patch a week) for 2 weeks, and proper titration (up-titration) will be allowed at visit 2(wk 2) and at visit 3(wk 4) according to the investigator’s decision. The up-titration will be considered by investigator’s judgement as follows; (1) if the rescue medication was used more than 2 times per day, on average or (2) based on the daily average NRS(Numeric Rating Scale), if the NRS was changed to worsen since the previous visit, (3) Investigator’s judgement by considering any titration needed situation (e.g. dose, frequency of rescue medication).</description>
