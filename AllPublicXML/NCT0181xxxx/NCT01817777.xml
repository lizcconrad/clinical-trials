    <textblock>
      MTF116086 is an open-label, randomised, parallel-design study in subjects with type II
      diabetes. The study is site-based, with local pharmacies serving as the sites and pharmacists
      as principal investigators for the sites. All subjects will enter an initial 8-week
      observational phase during which purchase behaviour and compliance with usual metformin use
      will be observed and recorded. At the end of the observational phase, subjects will be
      randomised to one of the two arms (metformin small pack vs. metformin large pack) for a
      20-week interventional phase. The medication in the interventional phase is provided to the
      subjects free of charge. HbA1c will be collected for all subjects during Week 0, Week 8, and
      Week 28. Subjects will be asked questions about their tablet compliance, their satisfaction
      with the pack size they received and reasons for missing doses throughout the interventional
      phase by the pharmacist. The pharmacy visit on Week 28 will be end of the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in HbA1c Values at Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 8) and Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c was tested with a point-of-care device, which required a finger prick to obtain blood and provided an immediate result upon analysis in the device. HbA1c was tested at pharmacy visits corresponding to three time points: enrollment (Week 0), Baseline (Week 8), and End of Study (Week 28). The difference in the mean change from Baseline was to be calculated between the treatment arms (small pack minus large pack), and the 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in mean change in HbA1c was to be calculated. However, because the study was terminated early, and the sample size was reduced, the statistical hypotheses defined in the protocol were not tested due to insufficient power. Therefore, the final analyses were limited to descriptive statistics. The percentage HbA1c is a measure of how much of the hemoglobin in the blood has become glycated (chemically bounded to glucose).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Percent Compliance Throughout the Interventional Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>From Randomization to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>Compliance for the study was estimated as a percentage, with the denominator defined as the number of pills dispensed by the pharmacist and the numerator defined as the number of pills taken, accounting for remaining pills at subsequent pharmacy visits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Percent Compliance Throughout the Observational Phase, Per Treatment They Were Randomized to in the Interventional Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Compliance was estimated during the 8-week Observational Phase for usual metformin treatment. During the Observational Phase, compliance was measured by monitoring the number of pill dispensed and the return of the pills or tablets.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>Throughout the duration of the study, participants remained on their recommended metformin dosing regimens, unless a change in metformin dose was prescribed by their physician. The number of participants who received additional diabetes therapy for the management of diabetes was summarized.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HbA1c Values at Week 28</title>
        <description>HbA1c was tested with a point-of-care device, which required a finger prick to obtain blood and provided an immediate result upon analysis in the device. HbA1c was tested at pharmacy visits corresponding to three time points: enrollment (Week 0), Baseline (Week 8), and End of Study (Week 28). The difference in the mean change from Baseline was to be calculated between the treatment arms (small pack minus large pack), and the 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in mean change in HbA1c was to be calculated. However, because the study was terminated early, and the sample size was reduced, the statistical hypotheses defined in the protocol were not tested due to insufficient power. Therefore, the final analyses were limited to descriptive statistics. The percentage HbA1c is a measure of how much of the hemoglobin in the blood has become glycated (chemically bounded to glucose).</description>
