  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine whether a stratified medication review performed in
      patients at highest risk of experiencing medication errors have impact on numbers of
      medication errrors during hospitalization.

      Acutely admitted medical patients will be included after admission. After inclusion and
      randomization the patients will be risk stratified with an existing algorithm according to
      risk of medication error. The patients in the intervention group will receive a medication
      review performed by a clinical pharmacist if they are in high medication error risk. Patients
      in highest medication error risk will recieve a medication review performed by a clinical
      pharmacologist.
