  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are frequently associated with an elevated risk for
      obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and other metabolic
      disturbances. Second Generation Antipsychotics (SGA) have a demonstrated efficacy in acute
      and long term treatment of these disorders and are considered a first option on most
      treatment guidelines. Unfortunately the use of SGA is associated to drug induced weight gain,
      disturbed glucose and lipid regulation and an increase of cardiovascular risk and mortality
      as well as non- adherence to treatment. There are several hypotheses attempting to explain
      the complex pathways that lead to antipsychotic therapeutic effects and their accompanying
      adverse effects. Recently, in animals receiving SGA, melatonin prevented to a large extent
      the body weight increase, which indicates a possible role for biological rhythms in SGA
      induced body weight accumulation. Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland that
      follows a circadian rhythm with an increased secretion in the middle of the night. This
      hormone acts importantly on the suprachiasmatic nucleus and other areas in the brain and
      periphery. Thus melatonin is involved in a series of biological functions such as sleep
      regulation, blood pressure, regulation of circadian rhythms, mood, behavior, and more
      recently in the regulation of metabolic processes including insulin, leptin, and lipid
      regulation.

      Given previous results in experimental animals, the purpose of the present study is to test
      the potential effect of melatonin in reducing or preventing some of the metabolic
      disturbances associated with SGA
