  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV+ patients are considered at risk for excessive bone fragility. Several factors could
      contribute: age, male sex, low body mass index (BMI), HIV infection per se, vitamin D
      deficiency, using tenofovir/a protease inhibitor (time on and/or current use). Tenofovir is
      used in a backbone of nucleosides/nucleotides analogues with emtricitabine (FTC), licensed as
      TRUVADA®, or without this analogue, licensed as VIREAD®. FTC closely resembles lamivudine
      (3TC) but is 5-fluorinated, the daily intake of fluoride is ~15 mg. Fluoride induces bone
      formation by stimulating osteoblasts, of often impaired bone quality.

      The aim of the study is to compare in a cross-sectional design fluoride levels, bone renewal,
      bone mineral density (BMD) in HIV+ male patients treated by TRUVADA® or VIREAD® for more than
      60 months. The patients will be randomly selected, then matched according to age, ethnic
      origin, BMI.

    <textblock>
      Fluoride metabolism will be studied by measurement of fluoride in blood and in daily urine,
      bone remodelling by measurement of P1NP. Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) will be used to
      determine the areal bone mineral density (aBMD) of the lumbar spine, femoral neck and distal
      radius. Volumetric BMD (v-BMD) and micro-architecture of distal radius and tibia will be
      studied using a HR-pQCT scan (Xtreme, Scanco).
