  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AGV implant is designed to open when the IOP is between 8 mmHg and 10 mmHg, and thus
      maintains an IOP of 8 mmHg or higher. In the early period after glaucoma drainage device
      (GDD) surgery the intraocular pressure (IOP) classically goes through 2 phases. The
      hypotensive phase occurs immediately after surgery, lasts around 1 week. This is followed by
      the hypertensive period where the IOP tends to rise steadily above 21mmhg.

      The hypertensive response seems to occur more commonly after Ahmed GDD surgery than nonvalved
      implants, It was reported to occur in 40% to 80% of cases. Although the hypertensive phase
      can last as long as 6 months it is usually during the first 1 to 4 weeks, when there is
      intense congestion of the bleb wall, that IOP is highest.

      Previous study showed that when aqueous comes into contact with conjunctiva and Tenon's
      capsule,an inflammatory reaction occurs.Factors such as prostaglandins, eicosanoids, tissue
      growth factor beta (TGF β)has been shown to occur in glaucomatous aqueous. These mediators
      induce an inflammatory reaction, and if excessive, will result in fibrosis and poor
      functioning of the bleb. High pressure within the bleb also results in the secretion of TGF β
      by the bleb lining. It may result in inflammation of the bleb wall and subsequent fibrosis
      and poor bleb function. The investigators supposed that with early use of aqueous suppressant
      medication after AGV implantation, the concentration of inflammatory mediators decreased in
      subconjunctival space and may lead to better IOP control after shunt surgery.
