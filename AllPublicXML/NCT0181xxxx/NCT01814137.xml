    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted globally. The aim of the trial is to compare efficacy of insulin
      degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) twice daily (BID) + insulin aspart (IAsp) once daily (OD)
      versus basal bolus with insulin degludec (IDeg) OD + IAsp three times a day (TID) in
      controlling glycaemia by evaluating glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c). The trial is an
      extension to trial NN5401-3941 (NCT01680341).

    <measure>Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>During 26 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment emergent adverse event was defined as an event that had onset date on or after the first day of trial product administration, and no later than 7 days after the last dose of the trial product.</description>

    <measure>Number of Treatment Emergent Hypoglycaemic Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>During 26 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as episodes that are either:
severe (i.e., an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions) or
biochemically confirmed by a PG value of &lt;3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL), with or without symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.</description>

    <measure>Number of Treatment Emergent Nocturnal (00:01-05:59) Confirmed Hypoglycaemic Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>During 26 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as nocturnal if the time of onset was between 00:01 and 05:59 hours inclusive. Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as severe hypoglycaemic episodes and/or a measured PG below 3.1 mmol/L (below 56 mg/dL).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in FPG after 26 weeks of treatment. FPG was analysed on blood samples from fasting subjects which were analysed centrally.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 20 sites in 4 countries as follows: Germany: 1 site; Malaysia: 2 sites; Turkey: 1 site; United States: 16 sites. The subjects in this trial were to continue from trial NN5401-3941 (NCT01680341).</recruitment_details>

          <description>Subjects randomised to insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) twice daily (BID) + insulin aspart (IAsp) once daily (OD) , at the discretion of the investigator, started the doses of IDegAsp at week 26 in trial NN5401-3941 with breakfast and main evening meal and added 4 units of IAsp at lunch. IDegAsp was administered subcutaneously (s.c.) by injection in the thigh, the upper arm (deltoid area) or the abdominal wall. The chosen area of injection had to be the same throughout the trial, with rotation within a given region recommended. IAsp was injected s.c. with the main meal OD, preferably into the abdominal wall in accordance with local labelling. Additional doses of IAsp were only allowed, if needed due to intercurrent illness. Titration (self-titration) of both IDegAsp and IAsp was done once weekly. Titration of IAsp could also be done based on carbohydrate counting but at the investigator's discretion. IAsp dose reduction had to be done based on the investigator's discretion.</description>

IDeg was administered s.c. by injection in the thigh, the upper arm (deltoid area) or the abdominal wall and the chosen area of injection had to be the same throughout the trial.
