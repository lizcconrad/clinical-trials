  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (explores
      what the body does to the drug) of JNJ-37822681 in participants with stable schizophrenia
      (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often
      with delusions and hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the
      participant receives), multi-center (conducted in more than one center), randomized
      (treatment group assigned by chance), and multiple-dose titration study of JNJ-37822681 in
      participants with stable schizophrenia. The total study duration will be approximately of 8
      weeks per participant, consists of 4 parts: Screening (that is, 21 days before study
      commences on Day 1); Double-blind treatment (14 days); Follow-up (7 to 14 days after last
      dose administration). Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment with ascending dose
      levels of JNJ-37822681 once daily and twice daily. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale. Safety
      will be Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale, Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale and Simpson Angus
      Rating Scale. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) Total Score at Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The AIMS rates the severity of involuntary movements from 0 (none) to 4 (severe), including facial and oral movements, extremity movements, trunk movements, global and judgments, and 2 additional items concerning dental status (yes/no). A total score (ranging from 0 to 28) will be calculated as the sum of items 1 to 7.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The BARS includes an objective rating, 2 subjective ratings of symptoms of akathisia (awareness of restlessness and reported distress related to restlessness: range 0 to 3), and a global clinical rating of akathisia, ranging from 0 (absent) to 5 (severe). The global rating score, that is scored separately, is the most relevant measure of severity of akathisia. Higher scores denote worsening akathisia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Simpson Angus Rating Scale (SAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The SAS rates 10 items from 0 (normal) to 4 (extreme), including gait, arm dropping, shoulder shaking, elbow rigidity, wrist rigidity, leg pendulousness, head rotation, Glabellar tap, tremor and salivation. The SAS global score is the average score (total sum of items score divided by the number of items) and ranges between 0 and 4, where the higher score denotes more severe condition of extra pyramidal symptoms.</description>

    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 to 210. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
