  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the efficacy of fluticasone propionate (FP) on ocular
      symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (AR).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the current FP approved indication for GSK marketed formulation is limited to the
      treatment of nasal symptoms, several large well-controlled studies in which FP maintained
      adequate control of nasal symptoms when administered in a dose of 200 micrograms (mcg)
      once-daily (QD) also suggested improvement in ocular symptoms. This study will employ a
      randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multi-center design that compares FP and placebo
      nasal sprays in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) to assess the effectiveness on
      ocular symptoms associated with AR.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Reflective Total Ocular Symptom Score (rTOSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Reflective Total Ocular Symptom Score (rTOSS) is the sum of 3 individual participant-assessed symptom scores (eye itching/burning, eye tearing/watering, and eye redness), each evaluated using a scale of 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, or 3=Severe, for a possible score of 0-9. Subjects completed rTOSS in the evening (PM rTOSS; 12 hours post morning nasal spray use) and once in the morning (AM score: prior to nasal spray use). Daily (i.e. during one dosing interval) rTOSS is defined as the average of the PM rTOSS and the AM rTOSS of the next day prior to AM dosing. The mean change from baseline in (daily, AM, PM) TOSS was calculated as the subject's treatment period mean (over 14 days; from Day 0 PM to Day 14 AM) minus the baseline period (placebo run-in) mean.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Reflective Total Ocular Symptom Score (rTOSS)</title>
        <description>The Reflective Total Ocular Symptom Score (rTOSS) is the sum of 3 individual participant-assessed symptom scores (eye itching/burning, eye tearing/watering, and eye redness), each evaluated using a scale of 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, or 3=Severe, for a possible score of 0-9. Subjects completed rTOSS in the evening (PM rTOSS; 12 hours post morning nasal spray use) and once in the morning (AM score: prior to nasal spray use). Daily (i.e. during one dosing interval) rTOSS is defined as the average of the PM rTOSS and the AM rTOSS of the next day prior to AM dosing. The mean change from baseline in (daily, AM, PM) TOSS was calculated as the subject’s treatment period mean (over 14 days; from Day 0 PM to Day 14 AM) minus the baseline period (placebo run-in) mean.</description>

        <population>All subjects who were randomized into the study and received at least one dose of study product were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. This analysis was conducted on ITT population.</population>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Individual AM Reflective Ocular Symptom Scores for Eye Itching/Burning</title>
        <description>The AM Reflective Ocular Symptom Score was assessed individually for eye itching/burning using a scale of 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, or 3=Severe, for a possible score of 0-9. For evaluation, subjects completed the scoring in the morning, prior to nasal spray use. The mean change from baseline in AM Reflective Ocular Symptom Score (eye itching and burning) was calculated as the subject's treatment period mean (over 14 days) minus the baseline period (placebo run-in) mean.</description>

        <population>All subjects who were randomized into the study and received at least one dose of study product were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. This analysis was conducted on ITT population.</population>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Individual AM Reflective Ocular Symptom Scores for Eye Redness</title>
          <description>The AM Reflective Ocular Symptom Score was assessed individually for eye redness using a scale of 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, or 3=Severe, for a possible score of 0-9. For evaluation, subjects completed the scoring in the morning, prior to nasal spray use. The mean change from baseline in AM Reflective Ocular Symptom Score (eye redness) was calculated as the subject's treatment period mean (over 14 days) minus the baseline period (placebo run-in) mean.</description>
          <population>All subjects who were randomized into the study and received at least one dose of study product were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. This analysis was conducted on ITT population.</population>

        <title>Mean Changes From Baseline in Mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (MiniRQLQ) Scores</title>
        <description>MiniRQLQ is a 14-item, disease-specific instrument for assessing the impact of allergic rhinitis on activities of daily living and overall well-being. It measures five domains of functional impairment that are most important to subjects with SAR: practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, activity limitations, and other symptoms. Participants scored their degree of impairment on a seven-point scale. (0 - 6). Mini RQLQ final score is the average of sub-scales, ranges from 0 (best possible outcome) to 6 (worst possible outcome).</description>

        <population>All subjects who were randomized into the study and received at least one dose of study product were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. This analysis was conducted on ITT population. For analysis of nose symptoms, eye symptoms, and other symptoms, data of one participant each from the two groups are unavailable.</population>
