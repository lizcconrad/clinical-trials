  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lifestyle habits during pregnancy have long-term effects of baby's as well as mother's
      health. Pregnancy period is a favorable time for lifestyle changes, as the parents usually
      have motivation and assets to change lifestyle. Maternity welfare clinic is the place to
      promote healthy lifestyles because most Finnish families expecting child visit there at
      regular intervals.

    <description>The intervention is completed by public health nurses who will be trained to provide family-centered empowering and motivational lifestyle counseling at the normal health check visit.

Web application consists of dietary questionnaire from which the parents will receive immediately automatic feedback. Feedback concerns the quality of diet in relation to the Finnish nutrition recommendations. Feedback will be given in an encouraging format. Own targets of food changes can also be recorded in the application, and the application can be used to monitor how they are achieved.</description>
