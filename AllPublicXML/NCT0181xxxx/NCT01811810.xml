  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common treatment for men with high risk prostate cancer is radiation therapy (XRT)
      followed by long term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Long-term AD is toxic, with
      substantial metabolic, physical, mental and sexual side-effects. In this study, the
      investigators propose a treatment strategy to optimize the control of high risk prostate
      cancer by using dose-escalated external beam radiation (proton therapy or IMRT) concurrent
      with docetaxel and adjuvant short-course AD. The investigators hypothesize that this approach
      will be superior to the current standard of care and obviate the need for long term AD. In
      this study, subjects will be randomized to either XRT with long term ADT or XRT and
      chemotherapy and short term ADT.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma (within 365 days of randomization).

          -  High-risk for recurrence as determined by evidence of at least one of the following:
             Gleason Score 8-10 PSA 20 T stage T3

          -  Histological evaluation of prostate biopsy with assignment of a Gleason score to the
             biopsy material; Gleason score must be in the range 2-10. 6 cores are strongly
             recommended.

          -  Clinical stages T1a- T3 N0 M0 as staged by the treating investigator. (AJCC Criteria
             7th Ed.-appendix III).

          -  PSA values 50 ng/ml within 90 days prior to randomization. Must be completed prior to
             biopsy or at least 21 days after prostate biopsy.

          -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) 1,800 cells/mm³ within 90 days prior to randomization.

          -  Platelets 100,000 cells/mm³ within 90 days prior to randomization.

          -  Hemoglobin 10 g/dl within 90 days prior to randomization. 3.1.9 ALT, AST, and total
             bilirubin within 1.5 X institutional upper normal limits within 90 days prior to
             randomization.

          -  ECOG status 0-1 (appendix II) documented within 90 days of randomization.

          -  Patient must sign study specific informed consent prior to randomization. Note:
             consent for legally authorized representative is not permitted.

          -  Completed all requirements listed in section 4.0 within the specified time frames.

          -  Able to start treatment within 56 days of randomization.

          -  At least 18 years old and less than or equal to 75 years of age.

          -  Men of child-producing potential must be willing to consent to use effective
             contraception while on treatment and for at least 3 months afterwards.

          -  Medical oncology consultation prior to randomization and medically approved for
             chemotherapy treatment per protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of distant metastasis.

             biopsied and negative.

          -  Prior prostate cancer surgery including but not limited to prostatectomy, hyperthermia
             and cryosurgery.
