      This randomized phase III trial studies chlorhexidine gluconate cleansing to see how well it
      works compared to control cleansing in preventing central line associated bloodstream
      infection and acquisition of multi-drug resistant organisms in younger patients with cancer
      or undergoing donor stem cell transplant. Chlorhexidine gluconate may help reduce bloodstream
      infections and bacterial infections associated with the central line.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) cleansing decreases central line
      associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) in children with cancer or those receiving an
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether CHG cleansing decreases acquisition of multi-drug resistant organisms
      (MDRO: vancomycin resistant enterococci [VRE], methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      [MRSA], etc.) in children with cancer or those receiving allogeneic HCT.

      II. To determine whether CHG cleansing in children with cancer or those receiving allogeneic
      HCT is associated with cutaneous bacterial isolates with reduced susceptibility to CHG.

      III. To determine whether CHG cleansing decreases positive blood cultures in children with
      cancer or those receiving allogeneic HCT.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive CHG cleansing with topical skin wipes once daily (QD) for 90 days.

      ARM II: Patients receive control cleansing with topical skin wipes QD for 90 days.

    <description>Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the responses to the patient satisfaction survey collected at the end of the study. Counts/percentages of patients who consider the study cleansing easy/difficult to use and those of patients satisfied/unsatisfied with the cleansing cloths will be tabulated.

These descriptive statistics will be generated for the entire study population across the 2 arms first and then by each arm.</description>
