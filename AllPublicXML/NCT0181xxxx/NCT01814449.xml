      The aim of our current study was to analyze whether 18F-labeled Fluoromisonidazole
      (1-(2-nitro-1-imidazolyl)- 2-hydroxy-3-fluoropropane [18F-FMISO]) PET/CT and expression of
      HIF-1-alpha could predict response of primary endocrine therapy in ER-positive breast cancer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30% of ER-positive breast cancer will unfortunately display primary resistance
      to hormonal therapy, and some may develop acquired resistance to the therapy after initial
      treatment. Hypoxia is a normal phenomenon in solid tumors that arises, in part, from
      uncontrolled proliferation and immature blood vessels. Previous studies have demonstrated
      hypoxia significantly reduced both the growth-promoting effects of estradiol (E2) and the
      growth-inhibitory effects of an antiestrogen on ER-positive breast cancer cell lines. A
      recent study comparing neoadjuvant letrozole with letrozole plus metronomic cyclophosphamide
      found that increased levels of HIF-1a were significantly associated with resistance to
      treatment. Taken together, these data indicate that hypoxia might be associated with
      endocrine resistance in breast cancer.

      With PET/CT, radiolabeled hypoxia-avid compounds can be applied to evaluate oxygenation
      status in experimental or human tumors. 18F-labeled fluoromisonidazole (1-[2-nitro-
      1-imidazolyl]-2-hydroxy-3-fluoropropane [18F-FMISO]) PET/CT is the most widely used one in
      the clinic. Studies have demonstrated an excellent correlation between the 18F-FMISO uptake
      and oxygenation status of several cancers including breast cancer.

      The major aim of our study was to analyze uptake of 18FFMISO as well as the IHC expression of
      HIF-1-alpha in ER-positive breast cancers, and to predict the clinical, pathological and
      biological response of primary endocrine therapy.

      Each patient underwent diagnostic core-needle biopsy on the primary site at baseline. A
      therapeutic surgery or a second core-needle biopsy on the primary site was planned in a
      subset of patients after at least 3 months of primary letrozole therapy. Both biopsy and
      surgical samples of primary tumors were routinely embedded in paraffin wax and cut to 3- to
      5-mm thickness and dried overnight for immunohistochemistry testing.Immunohistochemistry
      staining for HIF-1-alpha and Ki67 were performed on 3- to 5-mm serial sections on coated
      slides.
