  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if AutoloGel platelet rich plasma used on non
      healing diabetic foot ulcers Wagner gd. 1 and 2 is more effective then the usual and
      customary care

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autologel is a platelet-rich plasma gel used in the treatment of no-healing chronic wounds.
      Prospective observational studies of the effectiveness of Autologel have demonstrated
      promising results in regard to the healing of diabetic foot ulcers including severe Wagner
      grade 3 and 4 ulcers. The aim of the current trial is to compare the efficacy, measured as
      wound healing in a single-blind (assessor) randomized controlled trial, of usual and
      customary care with and without Autologel in treating Wagner 1 and 2 diabetic foot ulcers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Medicare eligible

          2. ≥18 years of age

          3. Type I or II diabetes requiring medical treatment as determined by the physician

          4. The largest non-healing wound, if multiple wounds are present, or the single wound to
             be treated (index ulcer) is a Wagner 1 or 2 Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU; see Appendix 9
             for Wagner Classification) that is located on the plantar, medial, or lateral aspect
             of the foot (including all toe surfaces but not on the heel). Subjects who have heel
             ulcers may be included if another, eligible wound is the index ulcer

          5. For subjects with potentially multiple eligible DFUs, the largest ulcer will be
             selected. There must be at least 4 cm between the index ulcer and other ulcers; if all
             ulcers are closer than 4 cm, the subject should not be enrolled (screen failure)

          6. Debrided ulcer size between 0.5 cm2 and 20 cm2

          7. Demonstrated adequate offloading regimen

          8. Duration ≥ 1 month at first visit (screening period)

          9. Subject must be willing to comply with the Protocol, which will be assessed by
             enrolling clinician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects known to be sensitive to AutoloGel components (calcium chloride, thrombin,
             ascorbic acid) and/or materials of bovine origin

          2. Wagner 3, 4, or 5 DFU (see Appendix 9 for Wagner Classification) Page 15 of 58

          3. Any clinically infected index ulcer that is apparent on Day 0. The presence of
             infection is defined by ≥ 2 classic findings of inflammation (erythema, warmth,
             tenderness, pain, or induration) or purulent secretions (Lipsky, 2012, or see Appendix
             4)

          4. Presence of another wound that is concurrently treated and might interfere with index
             wound

          5. Ulcer not of DFU pathophysiology (e.g., venous, vasculitic, radiation, rheumatoid,
             collagen vascular disease, pressure, or arterial etiology)

          6. Presence of underlying osteomyelitis, or if osteomyelitis is suspected

          7. Received systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents, hyperbaric oxygen
             therapy (HBOT), electrostimulation, growth factors, or any cell or tissue-derived
             products for wounds during the 30 days preceding the screening visit; received
             radiation therapy or chemotherapy within previous 6 months

          8. Any malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer

          9. Ischemic ulcer defined as an ankle brachial index (ABI; handheld or Arterial Doppler)
             &lt; 0.8 (note: if ABI is ≥ 1, then an skin perfusion pressure (SPP) or transcutaneous
             oximetry (TCOM) must be performed or the subject cannot be enrolled), TCOM &lt; 30 mm Hg,
             or SPP &lt; 30 mm Hg; toe pressure &lt; 45 mm Hg. These measurements may be concurrent with
             the initial evaluation of the index ulcer or obtained within 90 days of study
             enrollment if done prior to that concurrence.

         10. Subject has radiographic evidence consistent with diagnosis of active Charcot foot

         11. Untreated Charcot foot or DFUs associated with a treated Charcot deformity in which
             reconstruction or offloading has not taken place

         12. Ulcer expected to be treated with any advanced therapeutics (e.g., HBOT)

         13. Ulcer area decreases by ≥ 30% during 2-week screening/run-in period

         14. Subjects who are cognitively impaired and do not have a healthcare proxy

             Administration

         19. Subject requires or is anticipated to require interventions directed at improvement of
             arterial perfusion to affected area.
