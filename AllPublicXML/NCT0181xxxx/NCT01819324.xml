      1. The purpose of the study is to test the effectiveness of a new mail-based intervention
           for breast cancer survivors compared with standard lifestyle management and
           no-treatment.

        2. This intervention addresses both lifestyle factors such as dietary and physical
           activities and psychological issues specific to breast cancer survivors to improve
           healthy behaviors.

      Participants will be assigned randomly to one of three groups: 1) newly developed mail-based
      intervention (Targeting the Teachable Moment Intervention; TTMI), 2) standard Lifestyle
      Intervention (SLM), and 3) usual care. Both TTMI and SLM focus on health behaviors, however
      TTMI additionally addresses psychosocial issues specific to breast cancer survivors.

      All participants will complete questionnaires at the time they start the study, the end of
      the 4 months, and 3 months later for a follow-up.

      If participants are assigned to any of the intervention group, they will receive materials
      every other week for 4 months. If participants are assigned to the usual care group, they
      will receive the same materials as the standard lifestyle intervention et the end of the 7
      months.
