  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether AFQ056 as an add on therapy to SSRIs can
      have beneficial effects by reducing the total score of Y-BOCS (Yale and Brown Obsessive
      Compulsive Scale) in OCD patients resistant to SSRI treatment (failed SSRI over 12 weeks at
      appropriate doses).

    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, 12-weeks 200 mg
      b.i.d oral dose treatment of AFQ056 (following a 4 week up-titration period and followed by a
      3 week down-titration period) or matched placebo in patients diagnosed with OCD and on
      background SSRI treatment for at least 12 weeks. Study was prematurely terminated at the time
      of the first Interim Analysis (IA) as the study did not meet its primary efficacy objective.

    <measure>Yale - Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) Absolute Change From Baseline at Week 17 (End of 16-week Dosing).</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 17</time_frame>
    <description>The Y-BOCS is a 10 item clinician-rated scale used to both determine the severity of OCD and to monitor symptom improvement throughout the course of the study. The Y-BOCS, specifically measures the severity of symptoms of OCD without being biased towards the type of obsessions or compulsions present. The scale includes questions about the amount of time spent on, how much impairment or distress experienced from, and how much resistance and control over these obsessive thoughts and compulsions. Each item is rated from 0 (&quot;no symptoms&quot;) to 4 (&quot;extreme symptoms&quot;) and yields a total possible score range from 0 to 40, with the following ranges indicating degree of severity:
0-7 = sub-clinical 8-15 = mild 16-23 = moderate 24-31 = severe 32-40 = extreme Baseline was compared to week 17 (end of week 16 dosing) to produce an absolute change.</description>

        <title>Yale - Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) Absolute Change From Baseline at Week 17 (End of 16-week Dosing).</title>
        <description>The Y-BOCS is a 10 item clinician-rated scale used to both determine the severity of OCD and to monitor symptom improvement throughout the course of the study. The Y-BOCS, specifically measures the severity of symptoms of OCD without being biased towards the type of obsessions or compulsions present. The scale includes questions about the amount of time spent on, how much impairment or distress experienced from, and how much resistance and control over these obsessive thoughts and compulsions. Each item is rated from 0 (&quot;no symptoms&quot;) to 4 (&quot;extreme symptoms&quot;) and yields a total possible score range from 0 to 40, with the following ranges indicating degree of severity:
0–7 = sub-clinical 8–15 = mild 16–23 = moderate 24–31 = severe 32–40 = extreme Baseline was compared to week 17 (end of week 16 dosing) to produce an absolute change.</description>
