  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to improve the evidence-based management of fever cases seen in outpatient
      clinics in malaria endemic countries, through a better understanding of the value of accurate
      malaria diagnosis, and through an improved understanding of the other causes of fever in
      children. The objective is to describe systematically (as much as possible) the etiologies of
      fever in children in an urban and in a rural environment of sub-Saharan Africa.
