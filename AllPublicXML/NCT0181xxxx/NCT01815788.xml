  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A personal sound amplifying device (PASP) like Teo First is a wearable electronic product
      that is not intended to compensate for impaired hearing, but rather is intended for
      non-hearing impaired consumers to amplify sounds in the environment for a number of reasons,
      such as for recreational activities. Nevertheless, a lot of mild and moderate impaired
      hearing people don't want to buy and wear all day a real hearing aid.

      The goal of our study is to evaluate the benefit of such a device for mild and moderate
      presbycusis patient 60 years of age and older, with no previous hearing aid.
