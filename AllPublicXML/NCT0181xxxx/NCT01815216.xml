  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After obesity surgery gastric bypass (GBP) patients usually lose more than 50% of its former
      preponderance in relative short time (~ 2 years). But knowledge of the underlying biological
      mechanisms of decline in body weight is still inadequate.

      This project intends to examine patients' background activity in the brain (i.e. &quot;the resting
      state activity&quot;) and brain volume using MRI both before and one year after surgery.

      We will also investigate whether hormonal changes in response to food intake after obesity
      surgery is associated with patients' impulsive control when exposed to pictures of food in
      the MRI.
