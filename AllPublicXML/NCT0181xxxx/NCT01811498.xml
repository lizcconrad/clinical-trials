  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high-grade malignant brain tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), comprise the majority
      of all primary brain tumors in adults. This group of tumors also exhibits the most aggressive
      behavior, resulting in median overall survival of only 9-12 months. Initial therapy consists
      of either surgical resection, external beam radiation, or both. All patients experience a
      recurrence after first-line therapy, so improvements in both first-line and salvage therapy
      are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging survival. It is unknown if currently
      used intravenous (IV) therapies even cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). We have shown in a
      previous phase I trial that a single Superselective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion (SIACI)
      of Bevacizumab (up to 15mg/kg) is safe and effective in the treatment of recurrent GBM.
      Therefore, this phase I/II clinical research trial is an extension of that trial in that we
      seek to test the hypothesis that repeated dosing of intra-arterial Bevacizumab is safe and
      effective in the treatment of newly diagnosed malignant glioma. By achieving the aims of this
      study we will also determine if repeated intra-arterial Bevacizumab improves progression free
      and overall survival in newly diagnosed patients. We expect that this project will provide
      important information regarding the utility of repeated SIACI Bevacizumab therapy for
      malignant glioma, and may alter the way these drugs are delivered to our patients in the near
      future.

      The experimental aspects of this experimental plan will include:

        1. Subjects will first be treated with Mannitol prior to chemotherapy infusion (Mannitol
           20%; delivered IA, 12.5 mL over 2 minutes) in order to disrupt the blood brain barrier.
           This technique has been used in several thousand subjects in previous studies for the IA
           delivery of chemotherapy for malignant glioma.

        2. Subjects will then be treated with repeated intraarterial delivery (SIACI) of
           Bevacizumab. Each subject will receive one dose of IA Bevacizumab on day 30, followed by
           chemoradiation. SIACI of Bevacizumab will be repeated every three months for a total of
           3 infusions.

        Criteria for Inclusion:

          -  Male or female patients of ≥18 years of age.

          -  Patients with documented histologic diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme (newly
             diagnosed)

          -  Patients must have at least one confirmed and evaluable tumor site.∗

             *A confirmed tumor site is one which is biopsy-proven. NOTE: Radiographic procedures
             (e.g., Gd-enhanced MRI or CT scans) documenting existing lesions must have been
             performed within three weeks of treatment on this research study.

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status ≥70% (or the equivalent ECOG level
             of 0-2) and an expected survival of ≥ three months.

          -  Patients must agree to use a medically effective method of contraception during and
             for a period of three months after the treatment period. A pregnancy test will be
             performed on each premenopausal female of childbearing potential immediately prior to
             entry into the research study.

        Criteria for Exclusion:

          -  Previous treatment with Bevacizumab.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and fertile men who decline to use effective
             contraception during and for a period of three months after the treatment period.

          -  Patients with significant intercurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that would
             place them at increased risk or affect their ability to receive or comply with
             treatment or post-treatment clinical monitoring.
