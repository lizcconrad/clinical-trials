  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many young people who are homeless have cognitive deficits which impede their ability to
      secure and maintain employment. This study looks to see if targeting cognitive deficits can
      improve cognition and vocational outcome.

      The aim of this research is to conduct a controlled study of cognitive remediation, to
      provide feasibility data on adapting an established empirically-based cognitive intervention
      for homeless youth to help them attain vocational goals. The ultimate purpose is that youth
      will improve in cognitive functioning and have better functional outcomes including jobs to
      sustain independent living.

      The results of this study will inform a larger trial on the efficacy of cognitive remediation
      in homeless youth to improve cognition and vocational outcomes. Hypotheses are that, compared
      to those in an active control group receiving computerized work-skills training, individuals
      who receive cognitive remediation will show greater cognitive benefits on proximal measures
      of neurocognition and evidence better vocational outcome as defined by greater number of
      hours worked. This study will address the service gap in the use of integrated psychosocial
      interventions for homeless populations as the first investigation of cognitive remediation in
      homeless youth.

    <description>Neuropsychological Educational Approach to Remediation (NEAR) is an evidence based, manualized cognitive remediation program that targets cognitive deficits (eg memory, processing speed, executive functioning, working memory and attention) with the intent of improving daily functioning.NEAR is conducted in a small group setting, allowing for supportive social interaction while participants work at their own computer station on engaging computerized activities that are selected to address their unique profile of cognitive deficits. Then, as a group they discuss how their respective cognitive activities will help them achieve their vocational goals.</description>
