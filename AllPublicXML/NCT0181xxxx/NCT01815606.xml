  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test two different needles for performing a biopsy of the pancreas during
      endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) procedures. Patients who are asked to participate in this study
      have a growth in the pancreas measuring greater than 35mm that needs a biopsy so that a
      diagnosis can be made. The biopsy can be performed using either a 19 or 25-Gauge needle. The
      purpose of this study is to compare which of the two needles is better for performing
      biopsies of the pancreas on masses that are greater than 35mm.

    <textblock>
      Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) can be performed using the 25,
      22 or 19 gauge (G) needles. Randomized trials have shown that all three needles are safe and
      perform equally well. However, in a retrospective study, the diagnostic sensitivity of
      EUS-FNA for pancreatic masses that measured more than 35mm was less compared to smaller size
      masses. This is because larger size tumors have more necrosis and it is difficult to identify
      cancer cells in them to make a diagnosis. Therefore, more biopsies must be performed in
      larger size tumors to establish a diagnosis. In previous studies it has been shown that the
      larger 19G needles procure larger and better quality tissue. Therefore, our hypothesis is
      that, when a larger 19G needle is used to FNA tumors more than 35mm, a diagnosis can be
      achieved with fewer passes.

    <description>The use of a 19G FNA needle reduces the number of passes required to establish a diagnosis in pancreatic tumors that are greater than 35mm in size. This translates to less sedation, faster patient recovery, better safety and time efficiency.</description>

    <description>To compare the rate of complications associated with the 19G and 25G needles when sampling pancreatic tumors greater than 35mm in size.
Also, the rate of needle dysfunction will be compared. Needle dysfunction is defined as, the need to use more than one needle per pancreatic tumor in an individual patient.</description>
