  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomised observational phase 1 study in 48 healthy volunteers aged 18-50.
      The study is assessing safety and immunogenicity of viral vectored vaccines ChAdOx1 NP+M1 and
      MVA NP+M1 in heterologous prime-boost regimens. A crossover design will allow comparison of
      the two vaccines. Volunteers will be divided into 4 groups (n=12 in each group). Groups will
      be recruited simultaneously to control for seasonal changes in influenza. This is because at
      certain times of year there is likely to be a higher naturally acquired T cell response to
      influenza than at other times due to circulating influenza virus in the community.

      The study has been extended to include 2 additional groups (group 5 &amp; 6), each containing 12
      healthy adults aged 50 years or above. Group 5 will receive ChAdOx 1 NP+M1 on day 0, and
      group 6 will receive this with an additional boost of MVA-NP+M1 8 weeks later.

    <measure>To assess the safety of prime/boost vaccination regimens employing MVA-NP+M1 and ChAdOx1 NP+M1.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 78 weeks post first vaccination.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be assessed by the nature, frequency, severity, seriousness and duration of adverse events arising during the study combined with analysis of hematology and biochemistry lab tests for abnormalities.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the cellular immune response generated by prime/boost vaccination regimens employing MVA-NP+M1 and ChAdOx1 NP+M1.</measure>
    <time_frame>78 weeks after first vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcomes of peak immune response after first vaccination and peak immune response after second vaccination will be analysed by calculating the area under the curve of the immune response (IFN-γ SFC/ million PBMCs) for each volunteer from baseline to week 78. The mean area under the curve in the 4 groups will then be compared using an analysis of variance, or in the case of skewed data a Kruskal Wallis test. Further pairwise comparisons will be made if a significant difference is found between groups.</description>
