    <textblock>
      Myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is an X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the myotubularin
      gene (MTM1). The clinical spectrum is variable and ranges from individuals who require a
      wheelchair and full time breathing support to those who are able to walk and breathe on their
      own. Symptoms of myotubular myopathy include long faces, facial weakness with eye muscle
      weakness, breathing support with a muscle biopsy demonstrating central nucleated fibers.
      These symptoms may be caused by mutations or changes in the MTM1, BIN1 (bridging integrator
      1), DNM2 (dynamin 2) and RYR1 (ryanodine receptor 1) genes. However, the majority are caused
      by mutations in the MTM1 gene. Some patients with symptoms consistent with myotubular
      myopathy who initially have negative testing of the MTM1 gene were later found to have a
      unique type of change in the MTM1 gene. This unique change, called a deletion or duplication,
      can be found with a different type of genetic test called a CGH (comparative genomic
      hybridization) array.

      Investigators do not know how frequent deletions and duplications are in patients with
      X-linked myotubular myopathy. Recently, there have been advances in identifying potential
      treatments for XLMTM. The next step will be to proceed with clinical trials of potential
      treatments. In order to be ready for clinical trials, it is important that investigators find
      the specific genetic change that is causing XLMTM in people with this diagnosis. This study
      will attempt to find changes in the MTM1 gene in individuals who have clinical symptoms
      consistent with a diagnosis of XLMTM. Participants will be asked to enroll in the CMDIR
      (Congenital Muscle Disease International Registry), complete a brief clinical survey, provide
      access to medical records, and provide a saliva or blood sample for genetic testing. Results
      of genetic testing will be communicated to participants by the physician specified in the
      consent by the signing person.

      Study Hypothesis:

      Not all individuals with a clinical diagnosis of XLMTM have access to genetic testing.
      Investigators know that deletions and duplications of the MTM1 gene can cause XLMTM.
      Investigators will find more individuals with XLMTM by performing genetic testing of the MTM1
      gene, including CGH array for deletions and duplications.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Prospective participants will complete registration in the CMDIR.

        -  The CMDIR genetic curator will review CMDIR data for study eligibility.

        -  If eligible, participant will be called and consented to participate in the study.

        -  Sequencing can be done with a saliva sample. However, if this method does not detect a
           mutation or change in the MTM1 gene, a further test, called CGH Array, has to be
           performed. For the CGH Array test, a saliva sample may deliver a clear result in terms
           of a deletion/duplication mutation. In the event, CGH Array with the saliva sample does
           not provide a result, a the blood sample is necessary to repeat CGH Array.

        -  The study participant will receive a kit and instructions for saliva specimen collection
           for genetic testing from the CMDIR in the mail.

        -  If a mutation or change in the MTM1 gene could not be found by genetic testing and CGH
           Array with a saliva sample, the study participant will receive a second kit in the mail
           from the CMDIR with instructions for a blood draw to be used for CGH Array.

        -  The family will coordinate collection of the saliva specimen or a local blood draw, if
           necessary, and will be responsible for mailing the specimen in a pre-paid parcel to the
           University of Chicago. There will be a $40 reimbursement for the cost of the blood draw.
           Mailing the specimen to the testing site is at no cost for the participant. A two-week
           turn-around from receipt of the kit to sending it to the testing laboratory is
           requested.

        -  Genetic testing will start with standard sequencing of the MTM1 gene, isolated from the
           saliva specimen, followed by CGH Array if sequencing of the MTM1 gene isolated from the
           saliva sample or further from a blood sample if a variant consistent with the symptoms
           could not be detected using the saliva sample.

        -  Test results will be 1) reported to a physician specified by the study participant and
           2) uploaded into the study participant's profile in the CMDIR and 3) if concurrently
           enrolled in the Beggs Laboratory or other IRB-approved clinical study, test results will
           also be made available to that study provided appropriate informed consent has been
           given.

    <description>Investigators will compare mutations characterized by sequencing and CGH array (if necessary) with the following data in the study participant's CMDIR profile: age of onset, ventilatory support needed post-natal and ongoing, maximal motor function achieved, current motor function, need for gastrostomy tube and rate of ER visits and hospitalizations. The individual genotype - phenotype relation will then be compared to that of other study participants. In the event that a genotype-phenotype pattern can be established, this may help predict the course of the disease and prepare for appropriate care.</description>
