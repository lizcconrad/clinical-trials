  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of liver lesions causes patients acute pain during and
      after the procedure. During the procedure patients need deep sedation and cannot be
      collaborative. Furthermore post-operative analgesia is necessary. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate if the ultrasound-guided paravertebral block (TPVB)with a single injection can
      provide anesthesia and post-operative analgesia in these patients.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if single injection TPVB, ultrasound guided, ENS
      assisted, is advantageous compared to deep sedation (DS)in patients undergoing percutaneous
      radiofrequency ablation of liver lesions with respect to post-operative analgesia (at rest
      and in movement)and vomiting. Furthermore we collect data on operator and patient
      satisfaction.

      In this study patients are randomly divided into two groups (20 patient each): TPVB and DS.
      In TPVB group the block is performed in lateral position at level of T7 with bupivacaine
      5mg/ml. In DS group the procedure is conducted under local and intravenous anesthesia, and a
      post-operative analgesia is assigned. Data on patient, on procedures (duration, number and
      position of lesions etc.), complications with the anesthesiological technique are collected.
      The intensity of post-operative pain is assessed at 3-6-12 and 24 hours after procedure in
      both group using VRS pain scale at rest and in movement. Any concomitant event like nausea,
      vomiting, respiratory complications etc are recorded.
