  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute allograft dysfunction is often observed in the first weeks after kidney
      transplantation. Renal biopsy is universally considered the gold standard procedure for
      differential diagnosis of acute allograft dysfunction secondary to intraparenchymal causes.
      Kidney biopsy, however, is an invasive procedure that is time and cost consuming. Moreover,
      it may but not contribute to clinical diagnosis in about 10% of cases because of the
      impossibility to perform the analysis or of inadequacy of the biopsy sample. Availability or
      readily applicable non-invasive procedures might therefore allow increasing the performance
      of differential diagnosis of allograft dysfunction. In the recent years, a novel US imaging
      technique, namely contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CE-US),has been developed. The agent used in
      this study, Sonovue microbubbles consist of a central sulphur hexafluoride core with a
      surrounding phospholipid monolayer and last for several minutes in the systemic circulation
      before spontaneous degradation with absorption of the gaseous component by the lungs and the
      phospholipid shell by the liver. With the use of gasfilled microbubbles that act as
      scatterers within the blood stream and the development of low-MI ultrasound techniques that
      allow the visualization of the bubbles without destroying them, it is possible to improve the
      depiction of vessels and have access to structural and functional information on the
      microcirculation. Moreover SonoVue microbubbles are not nephrotoxic and can be safely used to
      evaluate kidney disfunction.

      Thus, whether a. different patterns of parenchymal perfusion detected by CE-US can be
      associated with different patterns of renal graft involvement during acute renal function
      deterioration and b. whether, conversely, different patterns of parenchymal perfusion
      detected by CE-US may help predicting different patterns of renal involvement will be
      investigated in 20 deceased or living donor kidney graft recipients.

    <description>Ce-US is performed by contrast agent infusion SonoVue. The acquisition protocol will consist of two different administrations of SonoVue, performed 10 minutes apart. In the first session, SonoVue microbubbles will be administered as a fast 1.5 ml bolus immediately followed by 5 ml saline solution. In the second session, max 2 vials (9.6 ml) of SonoVue will be infused at an infusion rate between 0.5 and 1.0 ml/min.</description>
