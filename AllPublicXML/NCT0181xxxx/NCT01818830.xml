    <textblock>
      The patients with sepsis are in the state of hypermetabolism, increased resting energy
      expenditure, protein and fat catabolism disorder, negative nitrogen balance, insulin
      resistance, hyperglycemia, and amino acid metabolism disorders. However, it is remain unclear
      the changes of amino acids expression profiling in sepsis patients. In this study, the
      investigators has planned to enroll 100 subjects, including 20 cases with systemic
      inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), 20 cases with sepsis, 20 cases with severe sepsis and
      20 with septic shock. In addition, this study also include 20 normal cases as control. The
      serum sample of patients with sepsis is draw on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 after first ICU
      admission. High-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry was used to
      detect the quantification of amino acids. The amino acids expression profiling contain
      Arginine, Ornithine, Histidine, Cystine, Isoleucine, Cystathionine, Leucine, Homocystine,
      Lysine, α-Amino-n-Butyric Acid, Methionine, Alanine, Phenylalanine, Anserine, Threonine,
      β-Alanine, Tryptophan, β-Amino-Isobutyric Acid, Valine, Carnosine, γ-Amino-n-Butyric Acid,
      Ethanolamine, Glycine, δ-Hydroxylysine, Serine, Hydroxy-L-Proline, Taurine,
      1-Methyl-L-Histidine, Tyrosine, 3-Methyl-L-Mistidine, α-Amino-Adipic, Phospho-Ethanolamine,
      Asparagine, Phospho-L-Serine, Aspartic acid, Proline, Citrulline, Sarcosine, Glutamic acid,
      Argininosuccinic Acid, Glutamine, Homocitrulline. The investigators speculate that
      measurement of amino acids expression profiling could be taken as an indicator for assessment
      in critically ill patients.
