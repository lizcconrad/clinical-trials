  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the marginal improvements in survival of patients suffering from malignant glioma
      treated with gene therapy vectors, the clinical trials conducted so far using viral vectors,
      in particular adenoviral vectors, have proven that the use of adenoviral vectors is a safe
      therapeutic approach, even in large, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trials. Treatment of
      malignant glioma using gene transfer modalities typically consists of surgical debulking of
      the tumor mass followed by the administration of the viral vectors into the brain tissue
      surrounding the tumor cavity. This study will combine direct tumor cell killing (TK) and
      immune-mediated stimulatory (Flt3L) gene transfer approaches delivered by first generation
      adenoviral vectors.

      This is a Phase 1, multiple center open label, dose escalation safety study of Ad-hCMV-TK and
      Ad-hCMV-Flt3L delivered to the peritumoral region after tumor resection. This study will
      combine direct tumor cell killing (TK) and immune-mediated stimulatory (Flt3L) gene transfer
      approaches delivered by first generation adenoviral vectors. Treatment with HSV1-TK is
      expected to kill transduced brain cells, thus exposing tumor antigen. Treatment with Flt3L, a
      cytokine known to cause proliferation of dendritic cells, should cause the migration of
      dendritic cells to the peritumoral brain and remaining tumor. There, they will be exposed to
      tumor antigens released from dying glioma cells through TK + valacyclovir-induced glioma cell
      death, and thus mediate a specific anti-malignant glioma immune response against remaining
      malignant glioma cells.

    <description>This protocol is a dose escalation study of Ad-hCMV-TK and Ad-hCMV-Flt3L infused at the time of surgical resection followed by systemic oral administration of valacyclovir in addition to current standard of care with temozolomide and radiotherapy. Eligible subjects will be enrolled in six sequential dosing cohorts:
Cohort A= Ad-hCMV-TK: 1x1010 vp and Ad-hCMV-Flt3L: 1x109 vp
Cohort B= Ad-hCMV-TK: 1x1011 vp and Ad-hCMV-Flt3L: 1x109 vp
Cohort C= Ad-hCMV-TK: 1x1010 vp and Ad-hCMV-Flt3L: 1x1010 vp
Cohort D= Ad-hCMV-TK: 1x1011 vp and Ad-hCMV-Flt3L: 1x1010 vp
Cohort E= Ad-hCMV-TK: 1x1010 vp and Ad-hCMV-Flt3L: 1x1011 vp
Cohort F= Ad-hCMV-TK: 1x1011 vp and Ad-hCMV-Flt3L: 1x1011 vp
Subjects will be treated sequentially with a minimum of 21 days before treatment of new subjects within a cohort or before dose escalation. Once the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is determined, or after all subjects have been evaluated and found to tolerate the highest dose, the study will end.</description>

    <intervention_name>Dose Escalation of Ad-hCMV-TK and Ad-hCMV-Flt3L</intervention_name>
    <description>Two adenoviral vectors will be used, each to deliver one of the therapeutic genes. Both vectors are human serotype 5, replication-defective, first generation adenoviral vectors deleted in E1a and E3 viral encoding regions. Each vector will constitutively express their respective therapeutic transgene (i.e. HSV1-TK or Flt3L) under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter (hCMV). Valacyclovir treatment will begin 1-3 days after vector administration at a dose of 2 grams given orally 3X per day for 14 days. A second course of valacyclovir will be given beginning Week 10.
Radiation and chemotherapy will be administered as per standard of care.</description>
