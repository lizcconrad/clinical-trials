      A. the controlling of the blood pressure, especially the variation of blood pressure, can
      slow down the development of the small vessel disease.

      B intensive BP control is more effective than normal control of blood pressure in slowing
      down the small vessel disease.

      C drugs of Calcium Channel Blocker(CCB) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor(ACEI)
      have no significant difference in lowing the blood pressure and variability of blood pressure

      The selected patients were diagnosis of stroke caused by small vessel disease due to
      hypertension recently.

      The patients had been divided into two groups by random principle and given ACEI or CCB
      separately for treatment. At the same time, given intensive or regular controlling of the
      blood pressure by stratified random. In the regular controlling group, the BP should be in
      the range of 130-139 mmHg and in the intensive controlling group, the BP should be below 130
      mmHg. To the acute ischemic stroke patients who were accord with the lacunar infarction
      syndrome, it is rule to do the examination for exclusive selection of exclusion of
      hemodynamic dysfunction due to the artery stenosis ( stenosis &gt;50%, the examination of
      intracranial artery was by the methods of Transcranial Doppler (TCD)/Magnetic Resonance
      Angiography(MRA)/Computed Tomographic Angiography(CTA)/Digital Subtraction Angiography(DSA),
      the examination of carotid artery was by the methods of colorful ultrasound / MRA/ CTA/ DSA )
      at the baseline.

      It should be proved of lacunar infarction by brain imaging. All patients had a MRI scan at
      the baseline and the beginning of the research, including T1-Weighted
      Imaging(T1W1),T2-Weighted Imaging(T2WI), T2-FLAIR, Diffusion-Weighted Imaging(DWI),
      Gradient-Recalled Echo(GRE) T2*, the Perfusion-Weighted Imaging(PWI) would complete
      conditionally (100 cases). The details should be followed by the instruction in the appendix.

      Research about the variability of blood pressure: all patients show complete the examination
      of 24-hour blood-pressure monitor (at the baseline, the first month after the beginning,
      every three months and the end of the research), complete the head-up tilt test if
      conditionally ( at the baseline, each 3 months later and the end of the research ) The
      automatic regulation function of the small vessel should be evaluated if conditionally (the
      C02 reaction, TCD head-up tilt) and also the function of endothelium-derived relaxing of the
      brachial artery (at the baseline, each 3 months later and the end of the research) The
      reservation of the blood was for further research on genetic study.
