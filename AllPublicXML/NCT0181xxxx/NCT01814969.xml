    <textblock>
      Clinical objective of the study is to compare the rates of pathologic response, acute
      toxicity and sphincter preservation with two schedules of preoperative regiment in patients
      with locally advanced rectal cancer.

    <textblock>
      Overview of randomized trials conducted in patients with advanced colorectal cancer with the
      use of preoperative radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy clearly shows the superiority of
      combined therapy over surgery alone. In these studies documented a significant reduction in
      tumor mass as a result of preoperative radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy theoretically
      increases the chance of performing operations with sphincters preservation, even in cases
      originally eligible for abdomino - perineal resection. There is the question whether the
      combination of preoperative hyperfractionated radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy may
      cause the further improvement of treatment outcome in patients with locally advanced rectal
      cancer. Published in 2012 by Gerard et al. meta-analysis of randomized trials dedicated to
      the treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer, confirms a higher percentage of
      sphincters preservation in patients operated after more than 5-week interval between
      neoadjuvant therapy and surgery.

      Analysis of these issues will be taken in the current study. Comparison of the two treatment
      regimens as preoperative phase III study with stratification for time interval between the
      end of radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy and surgery may show differences that have not been
      seen in previously published data.
