  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This small study is to investigate the efficacy of Acthar in the treatment of chronic
      migraine in patients who have failed multiple treatments, including Botox (which is defined
      as having &lt;30% reduction from baseline in the number of headache days per month). Despite the
      widespread use of anti-seizure medications, there remain a significant number of patient
      whose migraines are refractory to these agents. The pathophysiology of migraine is such that
      the neural substances calcitonin G related protein (CGRP), substance P, and neurokinin A are
      released at the trigeminal nerve endings innervating the large cranial and dura mater blood
      vessels and this neurotrasmission generates migraine associated pain. Because of this,
      treatment for migraine can be directed towards down regulating those receptor sites
      accordingly. Acthar may provide pain relief through this mechanist, as ACTH has been shown to
      inhibit the release of CGRP and may also provide relief through a negative feedback loop as
      exogenous ACTH inhibits CRH release and mast cell degranulation.

             Classification, ICHD-2R (i.e. must demonstrate an average of &gt;=15 headache days per
             month, of which &gt;=8 must be migraine days or &gt;=8 days of migraine-specific acute
             medication-ergotamine or triptans for at least 3 months prior to study.

          -  Must demonstrate at least &gt;=8 migraine days or &gt;=8 days of migraine specific acute
             medications- ergotamine or triptans during 30 day baseline screening.
