  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mitral prolapse is a common cardiac disease whose patients are at higher risk for serious
      complications. Mitral valve (MV) repair offers several important advantages compared with
      valve replacement and it achieves excellent midterm and long-term results. Two major problems
      of using pre-measured expanded polytetrafluoroethylene(ePTFE) neochordae (the loop technique)
      are deciding the length of the neochordae and tying the knot at the intended length.
      Therefore, a great need still exists to find new method to simplify and precise the length of
      neochordae. 20 patients with mitral valve prolapse who undergo mitral valve repair using
      neochorda will be recruited in this study. Trans thoracic echocardiography (TTE) will be done
      preoperatively for all patients. Two, three, and four chamber view of each patient will be
      pre-operatively recorded. The device will be set with extracted measurements. Artificial
      corda loops are made using CV-4 ePTFE sutures. After artificial chordae replacement, the ring
      annuloplasty will be done. Follow up: A leakage test after attaching the 1st loop; Post
      operative trans esophageal echocardiography (TEE) and determining the severity of mitral
      regurgitation [Wall motion Score Index (WMSI), Mitral Annulus Area (MAA), LVEF, End Systolic
      Volume (ESV), End Diastolic Volume (EDV), Iso-Volemic Relaxation Time (IVRT), (IVRT/(QE-QE^')
      ,Chamber Relaxation velocity)/(Myocard relaxation velocity(E/E^' ), HR]; TEE 3 months after
      discharge; Cross clamp time; Intubation period in ICU.

    <description>Transthoracic echocardiography(TTE) is done for all patients. The new device will be setup using the TTE measurements.The artificial Chordae loops will be made at the operation room before starting the surgery. These loops will be attached to the respective papillary muscle's head and the free edge of respective prolapsed scallop.</description>
