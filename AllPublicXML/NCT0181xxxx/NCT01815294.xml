      The purpose of this study is to support the qualification of a replacement manufacturing site
      for DOXIL/CAELYX (doxorubicin HCL).

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (individuals will be assigned in a random order to study treatment
      sequences), open-label (identity of assigned treatment sequences will be known), single dose,
      2-cycle, crossover (patients will receive both treatments in a random order) bioequivalence
      study of DOXIL/CAELYX (doxorubicin HCL) in patients with advanced or refractory solid
      malignancies (including patients with ovarian cancer). This study has an adaptive 2-stage
      design. Bioequivalence based on encapsulated doxorubicin will be tested at the end of Stage 1
      using data from at least 24 ovarian cancer patients. An interim analysis of free doxorubicin
      will be performed at the end of Stage 1 using data from 42 patients of all cancer types. The
      study may continue into Stage 2 with additional patients of all cancer types; and final
      evaluation of bioequivalence for free doxorubicin will be performed at the end of Stage 2.
      The study will include a screening phase followed by an open-label treatment phase consisting
      of 2 doxorubicin treatment cycles and an end-of-treatment visit on Cycle 3, Day 1.
      Participants may enter an optional extension phase after 2 cycles. Safety will be monitored
      throughout the study. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be obtained from all
      participants at specified times over 29 days after starting each study drug administration in
      Cycles 1 and 2 for determination of plasma concentrations of encapsulated and free
      doxorubicin.

          -  Has any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make participation
