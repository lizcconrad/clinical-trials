  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of GSK1322322 following intravenous (IV) and oral administration. GSK1322322
      shows broad spectrum antibacterial activity against pathogens involved in respiratory tract
      infections as well as methicillin-resistant S. Aureus (MRSA).

      This study consists of three parts (Part A, Part B and Part C). The results from Part A of
      this study will enable use of large-scale, commercial tablets produced for administration to
      patients in pivotal clinical trials of GSK1322322. The results from Parts B and C will
      support enrolment of Japanese subjects in future clinical studies. Additionally, the results
      will support the dose selection for further clinical development of GSK1322322 in
      hospitalized patients with severe bacterial infections in Japan and other Asian populations.

      In Part A, subjects will undergo screening, 4 treatment periods receiving single dose of each
      of: 1500 mg Initial, fit-for-purpose tablet (product code AP), 1500 mg Over granulated tablet
      (product code AR), and the 1500 mg and 2000 mg of intended commercial tablets (product code
      AU).

      In Part B of the study subjects will undergo screening, and be randomized to receive 3 doses
      of GSK1322322 oral cohort (100 mg, 1500 mg and 2000 mg) or IV cohort (600 mg, 900 mg and 1200
      mg) each in 3 treatment periods.

      Part C will be a single-blind, placebo-controlled, repeat dose study of GSK1322322 in healthy
      Japanese male subjects. GSK1322322 will be administered (fasted) via IV for 4 days BID,
      followed by administration of GSK1322322 orally (fed) for 6 days BID. A follow-up evaluation
      will be conducted 7-10 days following last dose of for each subjects in each Part of the
      study.

      Approximately 12 subjects will be enrolled in each part of the study such that approximately
      8, 6, and 9 subjects complete dosing and critical assessments in part A,B, and C
      respectively.

          -  Part A: Pregnant females as determined by positive [serum or urine] human chorionic
             gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing.

          -  Part A: Lactating females.

          -  Part A: Cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history or regular use of tobacco- or
             nicotine-containing products within 3 months prior to screening.

          -  Part B and C: Subjects with a smoking history of &gt;10 cigarettes per day in the last 3
             months.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  Unable to refrain from consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or
             grapefruit juice [and/or pummelos, exotic citrus fruits, grapefruit hybrids or fruit
             juices] from 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication.

          -  Screening Holter monitoring shows one or more of the following: Evidence of previous
             myocardial infarction (does not include ST segment changes associated with
             repolarization) and/or Any conduction abnormality on Holter monitoring (including but
             not specific to left or right complete bundle branch block, AV block [second degree or
             higher in an awake state; similar findings in sleeping subjects would not represent
             holter based exclusion, provided that they represent physiologic rhythm variants],
             Wolf Parkinson White [WPW] syndrome), sinus pauses&gt;3 seconds, non-sustained or
             sustained ventricular tachycardia (&gt;=3 consecutive ventricular ectopic beats) or any
             significant arrhythmia which, in the opinion of the principal investigator and GSK
             medical monitor, will interfere with the safety of the individual subject.

          -  Exclusion criteria for screening ECG (a single repeat is allowed for eligibility
             determination): Male subjects with Heart rate &lt;40 and &gt;100 beats per minute (bpm), PR
             interval &lt;120 and &gt;220 msec, QRS duration &lt;70 and &gt;120 msec, QT interval corrected for
             heart rate (Bazett) &gt;450 msec.

        Evidence of previous myocardial infarction (does not include ST segment changes associated
        with repolarization).

        Any conduction abnormality (including but not specific to left or right complete bundle
        branch block, AV block [second degree or higher], WPW syndrome, sinus pauses &gt;3 seconds,
        non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia (&gt;=3 consecutive ventricular ectopic
        beats) or any significant arrhythmia which, in the opinion of the principal investigator
        and GSK medical monitor, will interfere with the safety of the individual subject.
