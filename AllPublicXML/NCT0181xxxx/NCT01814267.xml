    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine in the care of
      chronic diabetic foot ulcers.

      Patients will be randomized into 2 groups: 1/conventional care group with iterative visits to
      diabetes specialist or 2/innovative care (telemedicine group).

      the health insurance system perspective is adopted.

    <measure>Assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from the french health system perspective</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is elaborated from:
Main cost criteria: transport, outpatient costs (home nursing care, physicians consultations...), loss of productivity (absence from work)
Main clinical effectiveness criterion: wound healing time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the Impact of telemedicine care from the hospital perspective</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is calculated from the hospital perspective:
Main cost criteria will be collected according to the micro-costing method: costs of innovative medical device (implementation and maintenance of telemedicine platform), telemedicine physician consultations, standard consumables, cost of care rooms and cost of medical and paramedical staff and, standard consumables for wound treatment.
Costs will not include structural costs
