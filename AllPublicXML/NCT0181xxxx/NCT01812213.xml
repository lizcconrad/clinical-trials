      To investigate whether [18F]NAV4694 positron emission tomography (PET) scan findings have the
      ability to distinguish subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who progress to
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) from those who do not.

             effects of the psychoactive medication and the subject's underlying cognitive
             impairment (e.g., benzodiazepines, sedatives, antipsychotics)

          -  Has received any contrast material (X-ray, MRI) or radiopharmaceutical within 48 hours
