  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial to obtain preliminary data for the design
      of a future definitive efficacy study. A randomized controlled trial is needed because
      comparison to historical data would be biased. The investigators will use sham acupuncture as
      the control to account for effect from attention from and interaction with the therapist.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>In patients undergoing chemotherapy prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The primary endpoint is the area-under-curve (AUC) for MDASI total score from Day -2 to Day 5. MDASI scores are assessed daily by having the patient fill out the questionnaire. Severity is assessed for the 13 core MDASI symptom items (pain, fatigue, nausea, disturbed sleep, distress etc..) AUC for MDASI total score from Day -2 to Day 5 will be compared between the acupuncture group and the sham acupuncture group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Effect size for each symptom will be calculated descriptively. To determine whether baseline characteristics predict response to acupuncture, each will be added as an interaction term to the primary model. The following predictors will be explored: inpatient vs outpatient treatment, upfront vs. salvage transplantation, age, baseline MDASI score, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and use of symptom control medications (yes / no).</description>

    <description>Patients with multiple myeloma undergoing conditioning myeloablative chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patients will be randomized to acupuncture or sham acupuncture. Acupuncture treatment will be delivered once daily starting on Day -1 (Day -2 is the day chemotherapy starts). Acupuncture will continue for 5 days, or, when the patient's absolute neutrophil count drops below 200/microliter or platelet count drops below 20,000/microliter, whichever is sooner. Sham acupuncture will be delivered on the same schedule. Regardless of group assignment, every patient will receive the same usual prevention and treatment regimen for nausea, vomiting, anxiety, insomnia and fatigue that other patients who are undergoing conditioning chemotherapy in preparation for HSCT will receive in the Transplant Service.</description>
