  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have demonstrated that RAS inhibitors/calcium channel blockers are superior to
      RAS inhibitors/diuretics for reducing cardiovascular outcomes in hypertension. As such, RAS
      inhibitors/calcium channel blockers are recommended as first line combination treatment for
      hypertension. However, the mechanism for the superior efficacy of RAS inhibitors/calcium
      channel blockers are not well defined. This study will compare the efficacy of RAS
      inhibitors/calcium channel blockers vs RAS inhibitors/diuretics in terms of glucose tolerance
      and insulin resistance in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome. The primary endpoint
      will be that RAS inhibitors/calcium channel blockers will be more efficacious in reducing
      2hour post prandial glucose compared to RAS inhibitors/diuretics.

    <description>This is a phase IV clinical study. The study is a 24 week, prospective, randomized open labeled multicenter study to compare the efficacy of amlodipine/valsartan combination vs telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination in reducing post prandial sugar. The study will be performed in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome.
Active group: Starting dose of amlodipine 5mg/ valsartan 80mg comparator group: Telmisartan 40mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg When the blood pressure is above the target goal of 140/90mmHg, up titration to amlodipine 5/valsartan 160 and/or telmisartan 80/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg is allowed.
When the blood pressure is above 140/90mmhg at the 12th week, addition of doxazosin 4mg is allowed.</description>
