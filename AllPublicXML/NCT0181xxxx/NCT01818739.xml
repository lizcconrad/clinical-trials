    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies lymph node mapping in patients with endometrial cancer. Lymph
      node mapping may allow for limited removal of lymph nodes in as part of endometrial cancer
      staging and treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate the negative predictive value of pelvic sentinel lymph node (SLN) in
      endometrial cancer to predict nodal metastasis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      II. To examine the ability of sentinel lymph nodes to increase the detection of metastatic
      disease through ultra-sectioning and immuno-histochemical (IHC) staining by comparing IHC
      results and standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) results.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo sentinel lymph node detection using fluorescence imaging with indocyanine
      green solution and isosulfan blue and sentinel lymph node biopsy and detection of sentinel
      lymph nodes is noted in the within 30 minutes of injection of the dye, followed by full
      pelvic lymph node dissection and aortic lymph node dissection as indicated, and standard
      hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years for a total of 5 years according to the standard surveillance
      guidelines for endometrial cancer.

    <time_frame>average of 1-14 days after the procedure when final pathologic evaluation has been completed</time_frame>
    <description>The detection rate is calculated as the number of patients with bilaterally detected pelvis SLN divided by a total number of patients who undergo labeling and SLN mapping. Sensitivity estimated as the proportion of true positives among the patients with pelvic lymph node metastases. NPV is found by dividing the number of true negatives by the number of all patients without pelvic lymph node metastases. Exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the proportions will be calculated, and subgroup analysis is done with a two-sided chi-square test or Fischer's exact test.</description>
