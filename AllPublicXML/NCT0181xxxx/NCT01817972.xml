  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind trial of combination therapy (Cimzia plus Azathioprine)
      versus mono therapy (Cimzia alone) and the improvement in mean SES-CD (Simple Endoscopic
      Scoring in Crohn's Disease) score.

      It is a trial where the investigators are administering biological therapy by itself and
      biological therapy plus an immunosuppressive medicine in combination to see which form of
      therapy has a better effect on healing ulcerations in the small intestine and colon that are
      due to a flare up of Crohn's disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has signed an Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          2. The patient is ambulatory, community-dwelling male or non-pregnant female and is aged
             between 18 and 70 years at the Screening Visit. Lactating females must agree not to
             breastfeed.

          3. Sexually active female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use one of the
             following methods of birth control from the date they sign the ICF until the
             conclusion of the trial:

             a. Hormonal contraception (i.e. oral contraceptive, contraceptive implant, or
             injectable hormonal contraceptive) b. Double-barrier birth control (e.g. condom plus
             intrauterine device, diaphragm plus spermicide) c. Surgical sterilization (i.e.
             bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, or tubal ligation) d. Maintenance if a
             monogamous relationship with a male partner who has been surgically sterilized by
             vasectomy

          4. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at the
             Randomization Visit (first study treatment visit) prior to dosing.

          5. Patient has no clinically significant findings on a physical examination, 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests (clinical chemistry panel,
             complete blood count [CBC], urinalysis [UA]) after signing the ICF but before
             receiving the first dose of study drug. (Note: The Investigator will determine if a
             particular finding is clinically significant. In making this determination, the
             investigator will consider whether the particular finding could prevent the patient
             from performing any of the protocol-specified assessments, could represent a condition
             that would exclude the patient from the trial, could represent a safety concern if the
             patient participates in the trial, or could confound the trial-specified assessments
             of safety or efficacy.)

          6. Patient is fluent in English.

          7. Are considered eligible according to the following TB screening criteria:

             • Have no history of latent or active TB prior to screening. An exception is made for
             patients with a history of latent TB and documentation of having completed appropriate
             treatment for latent TB within 3 years prior to the first administration of study
             agent. Appropriate documentation to verify that there had been treatment with a
             antituberculous treatment must be established prior to study participation.

             • Have no signs or symptoms suggestive of active TB upon medical history and/or
             physical examination.

             • Have no recent close contact with a person with active TB.

             • Subject has a negative purified protein derivative test within 30 days prior to the
             first dose. Tuberculin skin tests should be considered positive when they have greater
             than or equal to 5 mm of induration at 48 to 72 hours after test is placed. Subjects
             with a positive tuberculin skin test (if less than or equal to 14 mm of induration)
             are allowed if they have a history of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination with a
             negative Quantiferon test in the past year, no symptoms per tuberculosis workup, and a
             negative chest X-ray.

          8. Be able to adhere to the required study visit schedule and comply with noted protocol
             requirements.

          9. Subject has established ileal, ileo-colonic, or colonic Crohn's disease for a minimum
             of 3 months.

         10. Subject has moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, as defined by a Crohn's
             Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score from 225 to 450 at screening and baseline and must
             also have an SES score that falls under the auspice of moderate to moderately severe
             disease (10-15).

         11. Subject has evidence of active inflammation, as demonstrated by any of the following:

               -  Elevated C reactive protein (CRP) at screening (&gt;2.87 mg/L, or upper limit of
                  normal (ULN) as set by local laboratory)

               -  Endoscopic evidence of inflammation during the screening period or within 8 weeks
                  prior to the screening period

         12. Subjects are allowed to continue on concurrent treatment with the following agents:

               -  5-aminosalicylates, if stable dosage for at least 2 weeks prior to screening
                  (same dosage to be maintained throughout the trial)

               -  Probiotics, provided that the dose has been stable for the 2 weeks prior to
                  enrollment

               -  Antidiarrheals (eg, loperamide, Imodium) for control of chronic diarrhea; as per
                  standard CDAI protocols, the use of antidiarrheals will be assessed at each
                  visit.

        Additional eligibility information

        SES-CD The subject has a diagnosis of active moderate to severe CD at screening with these
        specific findings: the presence of large ulcerations (0.5cm is the minimal diameter in size
        to be categorized as large - this also constitutes between 2-3 points on the SES-CD score),
        the extent of ulcerated surface (the minimal percentage has got to be at least 10% - this
        also constitutes between 2-3 points on the SES-CD score), the extent of the affected
        surface (50% is the minimal percentage to fall in the moderate category - would constitute
        between 2-3 points on the SES-CD score) and finally the presence and type of narrowing
        found (number of strictures found and if the colonoscope can be passed or cannot be passed
        - this also constitutes between 2-3 points on the SES-CD score). The minimal score will be
        between 10 and 15. The local endoscopist (investigator) will determine whether subjects
        meet the entrance criteria from the SES scoring perspective. An appendix will be attached
        to define in a table the simple endoscopic scoring for Crohn's Disease (Appendix 1).

        CDAI Crohn's Disease Activity Index scoring: this consists of eight variables including
        five subject reported outcomes. Variables 1,2,3,4 and 5 will be obtained from the patient's
        diary (see table 2a, subject diary, under Appendix 2, Crohn's Disease Activity Index
        Variables) completed by the patient during the 7 days prior to each CDAI evaluation. The
        Standard Height and Weight Table (Table 2b) must be used to calculate variable 8. The score
        from each variable is weighted by applying the multiplier shown. The total CDAI score is
        then determined by calculating the sum of the individual, weighted scores. A minimum score
        of 225 points is required and cannot exceed 450. These are the two primary criteria for
        entry that have to do with the study outcomes proposed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has any condition, including clinically significant abnormalities on
             Screening laboratory test and/or medical history found during Screening assessments,
             or any acute or chronic condition, that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             constitutes a risk for the patient or a contraindication for participation in and
             completion of the study, or could interfere with study objectives, conduct, or
             evaluations (such as unstable diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, vascular disease,
             end-stage coronary disease, pulmonary disease, liver disease, renal disease and any
             metabolic disorders that are also uncontrolled).

          2. The patient has major surgery scheduled during the study period.

          3. The patient has a history of cancer, except for adequately treated basal cell
