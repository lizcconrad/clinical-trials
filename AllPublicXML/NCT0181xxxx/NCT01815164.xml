      Aim: Gut directed hypnotherapy can reduce IBS symptoms but the mechanisms underlying this
      therapeutic effect remain unknown. We determined the effect of hypnotherapy and educational
      intervention on brain responses to cued rectal distensions in IBS patients. Methods: 44 women
      with moderate to severe IBS and 20 healthy controls (HCs) were included.. Blood oxygen level
      dependent (BOLD) signals were measured by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) during
      expectation and delivery of high (45 mmHg) and low (15 mmHg) intensity rectal distensions.
      Twenty-five patients were assigned to hypnotherapy (HYP) and 16 to educational intervention
      (EDU). 31 patients completed the treatments and the post treatment fMRI. Results: Similar
      symptom reduction was achieved in both groups. HYP responders demonstrated a pre-post
      treatment BOLD attenuation in both anterior and posterior insula during high intensity
      distension, while EDU responders had a BOLD attenuation in prefrontal cortex. Pre-post
      differences for the low distension and for the two expectation conditions were almost
      exclusively seen in the HYP group. For all responders there was a significant correlation
      between treatment induced reduction of GI related anxiety and BOLD decrease in the anterior
      insula. Following treatment, the brain response to distension was similar to that observed in
      HCs, suggesting that the treatment had a normalizing effect on the central processing
      abnormality of visceral signals in IBS. Conclusions: The abnormal processing and enhanced
      perception of visceral stimuli in IBS can be normalized by psychological interventions.
      Symptom improvement in the treatment groups may be mediated by different brain mechanisms.
