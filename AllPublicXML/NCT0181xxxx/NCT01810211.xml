    <textblock>
      This study will look at which, if any, active stretching procedure is most effective at
      correcting posterior shoulder tightness (PST) in the post-operative population. Posterior
      shoulder tightness can influence shoulder mobility and function within both a symptomatic and
      an asymptomatic population. There are previous studies that have examined the effectiveness
      of different active stretching procedures and their ability to correct PST but only in the
      asymptomatic population. As clinicians it will be helpful to investigate their effect within
      a symptomatic population in order to prescribe appropriate and effective stretches within an
      individual's home exercise program. The study design is a double blinded randomized control
      trial. During evaluation a passive measurement of PST and internal rotation will be
      performed. Another therapist, blinded to the measurements, will randomly select which
      subgroup the individual will be placed in for the first three individuals and this sequence
      will be followed for the remainder of the participants. At this time the therapist will
      instruct the individual on the corresponding exercise which they will perform in front of
      that therapist. The individual will perform this exercise one more time that day and twice
      the following day and once again upon follow up prior to having internal rotation and PST
      measured once again. At this point this will be the conclusion of that individuals
      involvement in the study.

      Null Hypothesis1: Stretches are no more effective than no treatment for reducing PST acutely
      in the post-operative shoulder population.

      Hypothesis1: Stretches are more effective than no treatment for reducing PST acutely in the
      post-operative population.

      Null Hypothesis2: There is no significant difference in the reduction of PST between the
      horizontal adduction stretch and the modified sleeper stretch acutely in the post-operative
      shoulder population.

      Hypothesis2: There is a significant difference in the reduction of PST between the horizontal
      adduction stretch and the modified sleeper stretch acutely in the post-operative shoulder
      population.

    <time_frame>Initial evaluation 3 days following surgery and follow up (no longer than 72 hours from initial evaluation)</time_frame>
    <description>During the initial evaluation and first follow up, PST of the operative shoulder will be measured in sidelying using an inclinometer that is attached to the mid-humerus of the patient's involved upper extremity using a Velcro strap. An inclinometer is a small device that is used to measure degrees of motion.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Horizontal Adduction Stretch- Individual standing with their operative scapula against a wall and rotating toward the side to be stretched to stabilize scapula and the operative arm is relaxed. The opposite hand is placed under the elbow of the involved extremity and assists the operative shoulder into horizontal adduction attempting to bring the hand to the opposite shoulder.
Pendulum -Individual leans over with support from uninvolved extremity placed on an immovable object while involved extremity is relaxed. The individual than rotates their hips in order to allow the involved extremity to create small circles passively in a clockwise direction.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Modified Sleeper Stretch and Pendulum</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Modified Sleeper Stretch: Individual in supine with operative shoulder abducted to approximately 45 degrees and elbow at 90 degrees of flexion with neutral rotation of the glenohumeral joint. The individual then places other hand on the wrist of the involved extremity and passively moves the glenohumeral joint into internal rotation.
Pendulum Exercise: Individual leans over with support from uninvolved extremity placed on an immovable object while involved extremity is relaxed. The individual than rotates their hips in order to allow the involved extremity to create small circles passively in a clockwise direction.</description>
