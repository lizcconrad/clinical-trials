      Background: A discrepancy between strength gain and gait changes following various training
      programs aimed at improving gait function after stroke has been noted. A mismatch between the
      training program and gait parameters could explain this finding.

      Objective: To evaluate the impact of an isokinetic-strengthening program, matching the
      requirements of the affected lower-limb muscle groups involved in the energy generation of
      gait, to a control intervention, on gait performance and muscle strength.

      Hypothesis: The isokinetic training program of the affected lower-limb muscles would produce
      greater changes in gait performance and strength than a control intervention not aiming at
      training these muscle groups.

      Design: Single-blinded randomized controlled trial.

      Participants: A convenient sample of 30 individuals with chronic hemiparesis.

      Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned into two groups (n=15), each training
      three times/week for six weeks. The experimental group trained the affected plantarflexors,
      hip flexors and extensors concentrically, while the control group trained the affected
      upper-limb muscles.

      Main outcome measures: Baseline values and post-training values, taken at the end of the
      training program, of maximal voluntary concentric strength, gait speed and peak positive
      power.
