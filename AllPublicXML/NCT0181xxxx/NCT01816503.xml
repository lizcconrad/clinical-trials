  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show the clinical usefulness of fentanyl matrix by measuring
      satisfaction with pain treatment after administering fentanyl matrix in patients whose pain
      was not controlled sufficiently with the previous analgesic use in real practice at the
      investigator's discretion.

      This is a multi-center, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      prospective (the patients are identified and then followed forward in time for the outcome of
      the study) observational study. The study population comprises patients who are admitted to a
      study center during the study period and are receiving a strong oral long-acting opioid
      analgesic but deemed to control pain insufficiently. Since this study is an observational
      study conducted in real practice, a dose of fentanyl matrix should be adjusted depending on
      an individual patient's response at the investigator's discretion. However, for the patients
      whose pain is not sufficiently controlled despite administration of strong long-acting opioid
      analgesics, the minimum initial dose will be fentanyl matrix 75 micrograms/h and the
      investigator can adjust dosage according to the degree of the patients' pain control during
      the 9 days of the study period.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The percentage of patients who are very satisfied or satisfied with the pain treatment after the study drug administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>The overall satisfaction is measured by a 5-point scale. Patients' answers are rated as: &quot;very satisfied&quot;, &quot;satisfied&quot;, &quot;fair&quot;, &quot;dissatisfied&quot;, or &quot;very dissatisfied&quot;.</description>

    <measure>The change from baseline in pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>The mean pain intensity the patient experienced over the last 24 hours will be measured through Numeric Rating Scale (NRS); 0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable.</description>

    <measure>The change from baseline in Karnofsky Performance Status Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Karnofsky Performance Status Rating Scale is a tool to assess cancer patients' physical functioning. Scores range from 0 per cent (dead) to 100 per cent (normal, no complaints, no evidence of disease) in a unit of 10 per cent to indicate a level of overall daily activity performance status.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep disturbance caused by the number of awakening caused by pain the patient experienced over the last night</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients indicate in a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) the number of awakening from sleep due to pain in the previous night: not awakened, once, twice, more than 3 times, or could not sleep.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep disturbance caused by pain the patient experienced over the last 24 hours</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients indicate in a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) the sleep disturbance caused by pain experienced over the last 24 hours, where 0= not disturbing at all, and 10= very disturbing.</description>

    <measure>The change from baseline in Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-I measures the overall improvement of the patient's condition compared to baseline, as follows; 1 = Improved very much, 2 = Improved a lot, 3 = Improved a little, 4 = No change, 5 = Aggravated a little, 6= Aggravated a lot, 7= Aggravated very much.</description>

    <measure>Patient's Global Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>This tool assesses how effective the study drug has been in pain treatment during the study period. The patient will assess the effectiveness from his/her viewpoint at visit 10 on a 5-point rating scale; 1 = not effective, 2 = fair, 3 = effective, 4 = very effective, 5 = very much effective.</description>

    <description>This is an observational study. The minimum initial dose will be fentanyl matrix 75 micrograms/h and the investigator can adjust the dosage according to the degree of the patients' pain control during the 9 days of the study period. Fentanyl matrix is a transdermal patch that is applied on the patient's skin.</description>
