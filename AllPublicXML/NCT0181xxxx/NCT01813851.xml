  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedentary behavior and protein-energy wasting (PEW) are well known risk factors of adverse
      outcome and low quality of life in chronic renal failure patients treated by dialysis.
      Treatment strategies of PEW by different types of nutritional support (as dietary counseling,
      oral nutritional supplements or intradialytic parenteral nutrition) have limited efficacy.
      Physical activity has been shown to have numerous positive impacts in pathologic conditions
      associated to end stage renal disease.

      Concomitant prescription of physical activity and nutritional support might mutually enhance
      the anabolic effects of these interventions and improve the rate of remission of PEW.

      The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of a programmed, progressive endurance
      training performed during the dialysis session on a cycle ergometer under the supervision of
      a qualified trainer, on protein energy wasting and physical functioning of chronic
      hemodialysis patients.

      Aim 1: To determine the percentage of patients in remission from the state of protein- energy
      wasting. Hypothesis 1: Patients in the exercise group will more frequently reverse the PEW
      than in the control group Aim 2: To determine the patterns of change in body composition (fat
      free mass). Hypothesis 2: Patients in the exercise group will maintain or increase their fat
      free mass and patients in the control group will decrease their fat free mass Aim 3: To
      determine the effects of exercise on muscle strength. Hypothesis 3: Patients in the exercise
      group will maintain or increase their quadriceps strength while patients in the control group
      will decrease their muscle strength Aim 4: To determine the effects of exercise on postural
      balance. Hypothesis 4: Patients in the exercise group will maintain or increase their body
      balance while patients in the control group will decrease their body balance Aim 5: To
      determine the effects of exercise on quality of life as assessed by the SF-36. Hypothesis 5:
      Patients in exercise group will maintain or increase their quality of life form while
      patients in the control group will decrease their quality of life
