    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well carfilzomib and dexamethasone work in treating patients
      with multiple myeloma who previously underwent a stem cell transplant. Carfilzomib may stop
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Immunosuppressive therapy, such as dexamethasone, may improve bone marrow function and
      increase blood cell counts. Giving carfilzomib together with dexamethasone may be an
      effective treatment for multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the complete response (CR) rate with carfilzomib and dexamethasone consolidation
      following an upfront single stem cell transplant (SCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity of carfilzomib and dexamethasone when used as consolidation therapy
      in patients post SCT.

      II. To determine the progression free rate at 1 and 2 years post SCT. III. To evaluate
      progression-free survival and overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of patients achieving a minimal residual disease (MRD)
      negative status.

      II. To assess the HevyLite assay prior to and during treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and dexamethasone orally (PO)
      on days 1, 2, 15, and 16. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years and
      then every 6 months for 2 years.
