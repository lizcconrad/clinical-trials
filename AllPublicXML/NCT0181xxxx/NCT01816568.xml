  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic techniques have allowed surgeons to perform complicated intrabdominal surgery
      with minimal trauma. In numerous studies, when conventional laparoscopic appendectomy using 3
      ports is compared with open appendectomy, it has advantages of reduced pain, reduced hospital
      stay, and enhanced cosmetic effects. Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) was
      developed with the aim of reducing the invasiveness of conventional laparoscopy. In this
      study the investigators aimed to compare results of SILS appendectomy and three port
      conventional laparoscopic appendectomy prospectively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total of 50 patients who undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis will
      randomly assign to undergo SILS appendectomy group (n = 25) or Three port laparoscopic
      appendectomy group (n= 25) according to a computer-generated table of random numbers.
      Demographics (ie, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiology
      (ASA) score, need for conversion to a standard or three port laparoscopic appendectomy, need
      for conversion to an open appendectomy will be recorded. Outcome measures include operative
      morbidity, operative time, pain score, hospital stay. Morbidity will be evaluated by rates of
      colonic leak, wound infection, intrabdominal abscess hospital readmission, and hernia.
