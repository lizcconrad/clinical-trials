  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to recent technological improvements, it is now possible to record the electrical
      activity of the diaphragm (Eadi), a direct expression of the central nervous system
      respiratory center activity. By providing a relatively easy-to-use technique to record Eadi
      the NAVA (Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist) technology offers a new opportunity to
      explore the effects of various interventions on neural inspiratory activity in human subjects
      during spontaneous and assisted ventilation both for normal and simulated abnormal
      respiratory mechanics.

      The main aim of this project is to measure and compare the components of Eadi signal, the
      direct reflect of the respiratory centers activity, under various conditions of normal and
      simulated altered respiratory mechanics (either obstructive or restrictive respiratory
      mechanicsÂ° in order to better understand the neuroregulation of breathing. The second aim of
      the present project is to perform a similar analysis regarding the effects of various modes
      (Pressure Support and NAVA) and various levels of assisted ventilation both in case of normal
      and abnormal respiratory mechanics. Based on the information recorded on Eadi and flow and
      pressure signals, the last aim of this project is to correlate Eadi and pneumatic derived
      parameters both during spontaneous breathing and assisted ventilation.

      Practically, by using the NAVA recording technology, the investigators will perform a
      physiological study on normal volunteers to explore the effects of normal and simulated
      abnormal respiratory mechanics on Eadi, flow and pressure signals (airway, oesophageal and
      transdiaphragmatic pressures) in order to better understand the neuroregulation of breathing.
      Thirty healthy volunteers with documented normal lung function tests will be included in the
      study (obstructive respiratory mechanics will be simulated in 15 healthy volunteers and
      respiratory mechanics will be simulated in 15 healthy volunteers).
