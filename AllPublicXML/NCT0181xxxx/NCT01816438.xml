      The main purpose is to describe clinical practices nowadays prospectively about patients with
      a dysplasia diagnosis or another histological lesions.

      It will be identified colic situation during the initial colonoscopy after dysplasia
      diagnosis or atypical lesion.

      Also the frequency and the type of monitoring conducted about these patients(surgical and
      endoscopic treatments).

      The main criterion evaluation will be the surgical and endoscopic rates during the time.

      The treatments offered such as surgical, endoscopic ones or none of them will be followed.

      Finally, the outcome of these patients: stability, lesion disappearance, surgery or
      development of cancer with frequencies for each of them and relationships with histological
      abnormal colorectal lesion will be measured.
