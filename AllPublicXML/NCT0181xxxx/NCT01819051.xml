      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of treating human toenails with
      atmospheric plasma (MOE Antimicrobial Plasma Treatment System) and get an initial evaluation
      of the efficacy of this treatment for toenail fungus (onychomycosis).

          -  Subject must have distal subungual infection that affects approximately 25% to 50% of
             at least one great toenail, both clinically and mycologically diagnosed;

          -  Subject must have at least 2 mm of the proximal end of the target toenail free of
             infection;

          -  Subject must have a target toenail that is assessed as capable of growing
             approximately 1 mm/month, (e.g., the subject needs to report cutting his or her
             toenails at least once per month);

          -  Subject must be willing to give written informed consent and able to adhere to
             procedures and visit schedules;

          -  Woman of childbearing potential who is currently sexually active must agree to use a

             (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent, diaphragm or cervical cap with
             spermicide, medically prescribed intrauterine device, oral or systemic hormonal
             contraceptive (plus an additional reliable barrier method), and surgical sterilization
             (e.g., hysterectomy or tubal ligation).

          -  Woman of child-bearing potential who is not currently sexually active must agree to
             use a medically accepted method of contraception should she become sexually active
             while participating in the study.

          -  Woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 72
             hours prior to start of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with one or more of the following conditions on the target toenail:

          -  proximal subungual onychomycosis,

          -  white superficial onychomycosis,

          -  dermatophytoma or &quot;yellow spike/streak&quot;,

          -  exclusively lateral disease,

          -  inability to become normal in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Subject with psoriasis, severe moccasin-type tinea pedis requiring treatment,
             symptomatic interdigital tinea pedis, lichen planus, or other abnormalities that could
             result in a clinically abnormal nail;

          -  Subject with peripheral vascular disease or peripheral circulatory impairment;

          -  Subject with history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus;

          -  Subject with known chronic or active liver disease;

          -  Subject with any known immunodeficiency;

          -  Any pacemakers, or any metallic implants or prostheses in the vicinity of the
             treatment site (such as ankle, foot, etc.).

          -  Subject with any clinically significant condition or situation, other than the
             condition being studied that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with
             study evaluations or optimal participation in the study;

          -  Subject who has received systemic antifungal therapy within 6 months or topical
             antifungal therapy applied to the foot or toenails within 1 month of study entry;

          -  Subject who has received radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or immunosuppressive
             drugs within 6 months of study, and/or oral corticosteroids for &gt;1 month within the 6
             months of study (exception: inhaled steroids);

             prior to enrollment into this study;

          -  Subject who is unable to communicate or cooperate with the investigator due to
             language problems, poor mental development, or impaired cerebral function

          -  Subjects who may be unreliable for the study including subjects who engage in
             excessive alcohol intake or drug abuse (no testing required), or subjects who are
