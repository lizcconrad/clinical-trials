  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if the administration of platelets will improve
      outcome in patients with ICH who are being treated with either aspirin, a thienopyridine
      (ticlodipine, clopidogrel, prasugrel) or a combination of both. The study has four specific
      aims:

        1. To determine what affect platelet administration will have on bleeding in the brain.

        2. To determine what affect platelet administration will have on brain function. Several
           assessments to test the functioning of the brain will be performed at enrollment and
           throughout the study. Comparing the results of these assessments between the
           experimental and control groups should allow us to determine if platelet administration
           improves outcomes in patients with bleeding in the brain exposed to antiplatelet
           therapy.

        3. An important risk of reversing antiplatelet therapy is exposing the patient to the very
           complications this therapy was designed to prevent. Therefore, tracking complications
           will be a very important part of this study. The investigators will compare the rates of
           death, heart attack, stroke and clots in the veins between groups.

        4. Some patients (10-40%) have limited responsiveness to antiplatelet therapy. While
           platelet responsiveness, as measured by a special platelet blood test, will not affect
           enrollment, the investigators feel it will be important to measure.

    <textblock>
      Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), or bleeding in the brain, is the major cause of death in
      trauma patients. The initial volume and early growth of the hematoma are critical
      determinants of mortality and functional outcome. As our population ages, a significant and
      growing number of patients present with ICH while on antiplatelet therapy. Bleeding is a well
      known complication of this therapy. It is likely that patients with ICH who are exposed to
      antiplatelet therapy would have an increased risk of hemorrhage growth and poor outcome
      compared to patients that are not using antiplatelet therapy. There are no pharmacologic
      agents that can reverse the antithrombotic effect of aspirin or the thienopyridines. There is
      a paucity of published data, one small phase one trial and two retrospective studies that
      address the use of platelets as a means to reverse the effects of antiplatelet therapy in
      patients suffering ICH. In addition, transfusion of platelets may be associated with
      transfusion reactions, such as infection and fluid overload. Furthermore, these patients are
      then exposed to the very thromboembolic complications the antiplatelet therapy was designed
      to prevent.

      Given the lack of data, which is primarily retrospective and likely underpowered, The
      investigators feel it's important to conduct a trial to more definitively study the efficacy
      of antiplatelet reversal in patients with life threatening ICH. Furthermore, it would be
      important to understand that, if there is a benefit to antiplatelet reversal in patients with
      ICH, that this benefit will outweigh the risks of antiplatelet reversal.
