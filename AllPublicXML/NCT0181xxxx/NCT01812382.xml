      This feasibility study will allow for the determination of the in vivo recovery and time of
      dialysis to optimize a future thorough microdialysis study. This is a single session, open
      label study to evaluate the feasibility of microdialysis for Retapamulin in healthy subjects.
      Three healthy subjects will be enrolled and complete the study procedures. Subjects will be
      admitted to the research unit on Day 1 and three microdialysis probes will be placed in the
      thigh of each subject prior to the start of the microdialysis procedure. After normal saline
      solution infusion for 30 minutes, a Retapamulin solution will be infused for 90 minutes.
      Saline perfusion will occur during the washout period. Microdialysis sampling will be done
      for 30 minutes (during the last 30 minutes of drug perfusion) and dialysate sample collection
      will continue every 30 minutes for 4 hours. The approximate duration of study including
      follow-up is 4 days.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
        evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests. A subject
        with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the
        population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GlaxoSmithKline
        (GSK) Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk
        factors and will not interfere with the study procedures. Subjects with clinically
        significant lab values outside the normal range should always be excluded from enrollment.

          -  The subject is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions
             and protocol-stated restrictions and is likely to complete the study as planned.
             Subject is willing to provide informed consent.

          -  Does not use medications containing Retapamulin while participating in the study.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  Body Mass Index within the range 18.5 to 32 kilogram/ meter^2 (inclusive).

          -  The following normal ranges for blood pressure and heart rate are given as a guide:
             Systolic blood pressure 90 to 140 milimeter of Mercury (mmHg), Diastolic blood
             pressure 60 to 90 mmHg, and Heart rate 45 to 100 beats per minute (bpm). The
             investigator may interpret screening vital sign data based on the subject's age,
             physical state and level of fitness. Subjects with vital sign readings marginally
             outside the normal range may be included in the study if in the investigator's opinion
             these values are not clinically significant and will not present a safety risk or
             affect study assessments.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential
             (defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy;
             or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable
             cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone &gt; 40 milli
             international unit/mililiter (mL) and estradiol &lt; 40 picogram/ml [&lt;147
             picomoles/Liter] is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy and whose
             menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception
             methods) or Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods
             for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator)
             prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that
             point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until study completion (i.e.
             follow-up phone call). Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential
             must agree to use one of the contraception methods. This criterion must be followed
             from the time of the first dose of study medication until study completion (i.e.
             follow-up phone call).

          -  Alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;= 1.5x Upper limit of
             normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated
             and direct bilirubin &lt;35 percent).

          -  QT interval corrected for Heart rate (QTc), QTcB (Bazett's formula) or QTcF
             (Fridericia's formula) &lt; 450 millisecond (msec); or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with
             Bundle Branch Block.

             bronchospastic respiratory disease, asthma, diabetes mellitus, renal or hepatic
             insufficiency, or any other illness that the investigator deems clinically significant
             for exclusion of the subject from the study.
