      Over the last few years the chance of dying from a heart attack in England and Wales has
      reduced dramatically. Even so, there remain huge differences in mortality between hospitals.
      For example, up to a third of patients with a heart attack who attend hospitals in England
      are more likely to die than would be expected. That is, the type of treatment and the risk of
      death depend upon where a patient lives and which hospital they attend. In part, the
      variation in death may be due to the services available at the hospital or to factors such as
      socioeconomic deprivation. It may also relate to other factors such as depression, cardiac
      rehabilitation, patient experience of hospital care and whether patients take their
      medication after discharge from hospital.

      Notably, the challenges posed by poor drug adherence to secondary prevention medications are
      recognised by the World Health Organisation as the highest area of priority for improving
      individual health throughout the world. In addition, Patient Reported Outcome Measures
      (PROMs) are set to be the cornerstone of the evaluation of patient experiences of National
      Health Service quality of care.

      Using statistical approaches that include measures of quality of life, we propose to examine
      data about heart attacks in England and investigate the 'postcode lottery of care'. Our aim,
      using regional data about heart attacks is to identify and measure the effects of hospital
      care. This research will identify hospital qualities that promote improved patient care. In
      doing so, best practice will be highlighted and healthcare policy changed so that all
      patients will have an equal chance of surviving a heart attack.
