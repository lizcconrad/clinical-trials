  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if patients who receive an 8 week, comprehensive, multi-component rehabilitation
      program (CMC) have better strength and functional performance compared to a control group
      (CON).

      The investigators hypothesize that functional performance and strength in the muscles
      surrounding the hip and the knee will be greater in the multi-component rehabilitation group
      compared to the control group.

      The participants will be enrolled and following surgery, randomized into one of two treatment
      groups (CMC or CON). Prior to randomization, both groups will participate in two weeks of
      home rehabilitation consisting mobility training and activities of daily living. After
      randomization, the CMC group will receive physical therapy 2x/ week for 8 weeks from a
      licensed physical therapist and member of the investigative team starting 2 weeks after Total
      Hip Arthroplasty (THA). The CON group will continue activities provided by their home
      rehabilitation therapist for 8 weeks. The CON group will then participate in the CMC
      intervention beginning 10 weeks after THA. These patients will complete pre-operative and
      post-operative testing as described above.

      The CMC group will receive a multi-component program focused on rehabilitation of the
      abdominal and core musculature, neuromuscular re-education through therapeutic exercise as
      well as hip and knee muscle strengthening beginning 2 weeks after THA. The CON group will
      participate in physical therapist recommended activities based on their home rehabilitation
      and then will complete the same multi-component rehabilitation intervention beginning 10
      weeks after THA.
