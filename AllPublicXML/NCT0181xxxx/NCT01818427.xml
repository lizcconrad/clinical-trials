      To determine the effect of the prehospital infusion during air transport of 2 units of AB
      plasma on 30 day mortality in patients with hemorrhagic shock as compared to conventional
      care.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Although advances in the care of the severely injured patient have occurred over
      the last decade, patients continue to be plagued with uncontrolled hemorrhage resulting in
      significant early mortality and the development of multiple organ failure and associated
      complications. A primary driving force for this unbridled hemorrhage has been shown to be the
      early coagulopathy which complicates severe injury. Increasing evidence suggests that blood
      component transfusion protocols that address this early coagulopathy, once a patient arrives
      at a trauma center, are associated with lower mortality and a reduction in blood component
      transfusion requirements. Prehospital interventions which quell this early coagulopathy in an
      earlier setting have the potential to minimize or even prevent this vicious hemorrhagic
      cascade, further lowering blood component transfusion requirements and reducing the resultant
      morbid sequelae which complicates severe injury.

      Objective/Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis will be that prehospital infusion of plasma
      during air medical transport in patients with hemorrhagic shock will lower 30 day mortality.
      The secondary hypotheses include that prehospital infusion of plasma will reduce 24 hour
      blood transfusion, multiple organ failure, nosocomial infection, and acute lung injury,
      reduce or prevent the early coagulopathy as demonstrated by improving presenting coagulation
      and thromboelastography parameters, and reduce the early inflammatory cytokine response,
      thrombomodulin and increase protein C levels.

    <measure>Twenty Four-Hour Blood Transfusion Requirements</measure>
    <time_frame>at twenty four hours</time_frame>
    <description>24-hour blood transfusion requirements will be determined by recording blood volume (mls) and number of Units transfused from the time of trauma bay arrival or upon completion of pre-hospital initiated plasma infusion. For survival bias analysis, volumes and number of blood transfusion Units received at 3, 6, 12, and 18 hours will also be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>In-hospital mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>during hospitalization</time_frame>
    <description>In hospital mortality will be prospectively recorded from the time of trauma bay arrival. Over the first 24 hours we will document and record the time of death in hours, while after the 24 hour time point, we will document and record the time of death in days from arrival. We suspect that patients in hemorrhagic shock will have a significant percentage of mortality occurring in the first 24 hour period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multiple organ failure</measure>
    <time_frame>during hospitalization</time_frame>
    <description>Organ dysfunction will be evaluated via a well-validated scoring system referred to as the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODScore). Patients who are never admitted to the ICU or those with a length of ICU stay of less than 48 hours will be considered to have a MODScore of 0. A summary of the MODScore may be calculated by summing the worst scores of each of the individual systems over the course of the ICU stay (Table 1). A summary MODScore &gt; 5 will be classified as multiple organ failure (MOF). Scores will be determined daily up until post injury day 28 or ICU discharge.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acute lung injury (ALI) and Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)</measure>
    <time_frame>hospitalization</time_frame>
    <description>Development of ALI will be assessed which includes: 1) bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, 2) a capillary wedge pressure &lt; 18mmHg, and 3) Pao2/Fio2 ratio &lt; 300 via blood gas analysis. In those patients without a Swan-Ganz catheter to determine capillary wedge pressure, the absence of signs of, or clinical concern, for elevated left sided atrial pressures will be used for the diagnosis. All patients who remain intubated beyond the first 24 hours post-injury will be evaluated using blood gas analysis and chest x-ray evaluation. Those patients who remain intubated at 48 hours through 7 days will be reevaluated for this outcome at these time points. The diagnosis of TRALI will be defined as when ALI occurs within the first 6 hours from arrival at the trauma center as it is clinically defined.</description>
