      A multicenter prospective single arm interventional trial in hospitals where therapeutic
      hypothermia is standard practice. This trial will enroll 50 subjects to evaluate the ability
      of the ZOLL Intravascular Temperature Management (IVTM) System to induce, maintain, and
      reverse mild therapeutic hypothermia and maintain normothermia post cardiac arrest.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent

          2. 18 years of age or older

          3. Out-of-hospital witnessed cardiac arrest with any rhythm [Ventricular
             Fibrillation/Tachycardia (VF/VT), Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA), or Asystole
             (AS)] during EMS phase of treatment

             OR:

             Out-of-hospital unwitnessed cardiac arrest with VF upon EMS arrival

          4. Lack of meaningful response to verbal commands upon arrival to hospital after
             suffering non-traumatic cardiac arrest in an out-of-hospital setting

          5. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) within 30 minutes of EMS arrival

          6. Able to maintain a SBP &gt; 90mmHg for 30 minutes post ROSC without the use of pressors
             OR with stable dose of pressors (if escalation of pressors is required, patient is not
             eligible)

          7. Undergoing Therapeutic Hypothermia using ZOLL's IVTM System within twelve hours of
             ROSC BUT should have been initiated as soon as possible

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Traumatic cardiac arrest [due to blunt trauma, penetrating injury (e.g., stabbing,
             gunshot, etc.), burns, exsanguinations, strangulation, smoke inhalation,
             electrocution, hanging, drowning, etc.]

          2. Toxicological etiology (e.g., inhalation of toxic substances, drugs, etc.)

          3. Known or suspected pregnancy

          4. Do Not Attempt to Resuscitate (DNAR) order in force

          5. Ward of the state or prisoner

          6. Anatomy, previous surgery or disease state contraindicating femoral venous access

          7. Received neuromuscular blocking agents or central nervous system sedatives whose
             effects have not worn off prior to assessing level of consciousness following ROSC

          8. Hypothermia initiated at a transferring facility prior to arrival at the enrolling
             hospital (excludes pre-hospital IV fluids or cold packs for cooling by EMS)

          9. Current Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) filter

         10. Known history of acute neurological illness or severe functional disabilities prior to
             arrest (e.g., seizures, traumatic brain injury, increased intracranial pressures,
             intracerebral hemorrhage, etc.)

         11. Known heparin allergy

         12. Known allergy to any adjunctive pharmacologic agent required for induction or
             maintenance of therapeutic hypothermia

         13. Known history of bleeding or blood disorders such as coagulopathy, cryoglobulinemia,
             sickle cell or thrombocytopenia with a platelet count below 40,000.

         14. Known hypersensitivity to hypothermia including a history of Raynaud's disease

         15. Evidence of intracranial bleed

         16. Terminal illness or life expectancy of less than 3 months prior to arrest

         17. Currently enrolled in another investigational drug or device trial that has not
             completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with this trial's
             endpoints Note: For the purpose of this protocol, subjects involved in extended
             follow-up trials for products that were investigational but are currently commercially
             available are not considered enrolled in an investigational trial.
