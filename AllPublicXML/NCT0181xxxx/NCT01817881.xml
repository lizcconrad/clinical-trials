    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether temporal artery thermometers are accurate
      tools in temperature measurements of patients presenting to the Emergency Department. The
      investigators´ hypothesis is that there is a difference of &gt; 0,3 degrees centigrade
      (Bland-Altman) between the temperatures measured with the temporal artery thermometers used
      at the investigators´ hospital (Exergen TAT-5000) and those measured with rectal thermometers
      (OMRON MC-341-E), which is considered to be the gold standard in Denmark defined by the
      Danish Center for Clinical Guidelines. The investigators furthermore hypothesize that the
      difference between these measurements is greater if measured in a patient with hyperthermia
      (temperature &gt; 37,9 degrees Centigrade).

      Accurate temperature measurement on patients presenting to the Emergency Department is of
      great importance since it has significant influence on the further treatment of the patient.
      At Bispebjerg Hospital temporal artery thermometers are being implemented as they provide a
      fast and comfortable temperature measurement compared to rectal thermometers, who are
      considered to be the gold standard, defined by the Danish Center for Clinical Guidelines. The
      scientific proof for their accuracy compared to rectal thermometers in adult patients is
      insufficient though. The purpose of this study is to determine the difference between
      temperatures measured by a temporal artery thermometer (Exergen TAT-5000) and a rectal
      thermometer (OMRON MC-341-E) in patients presenting to the Emergency Department at Copenhagen
      University Hospital: Bispebjerg. The investigators hypothesize that there will be an average
      difference of at least 0,3 degrees centigrade between those two types of measurements
      (Bland-Altman). Based on a significance of 5% and a power of 80% the number of patients was
      calculated to 385, including an estimated 10% dropout.
