    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (explores what the body does to
      the drug) and safety of darunavir, and will be administered in combination with Ritonavir in
      healthy adult Japanese male participants.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single oral-dose
      and post-marketing study of darunavir administered in combination with low-dose ritonavir in
      healthy adult Japanese male participants. The total study duration will be approximately of
      14 days per participant. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (that is, 28 days before
      study commences on Day 1); Treatment (that is, Day 1-5); and Follow-up (that is, up to Day
      13). The participants will be hospitalized for 6 nights and 7 days. All the eligible
      participants will receive Darunavir oral tablet on Day 3 and ritonavir capsule orally twice
      daily from Day 1-5. Participants will keep upright position until 4 hours after study drug
      administration. Both the drugs will be administered within 15 minutes after completion of
      meal. Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetics at pre-dose and
      post-dose of study treatment. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
