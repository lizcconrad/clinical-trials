    <textblock>
      In patients with acute ischemic stroke: the sooner the thrombolysis treatment is administered
      after symptom onset - the better the outcome. This delay can be dissected into onset-to-door
      time and door-to-needle time (DNT). SITS-WATCH aims to reduce median DNT in participating
      centres.

      In patients with acute ischemic stroke: the sooner the thrombolysis treatment is administered
      after symptom onset - the better the outcome. This delay can be dissected into onset-to-door
      time and door-to-needle time (DNT). Of the two, DNT can be directly influenced within the
      hospital by stream-lining of acute stroke care. The aim of our study is to reduce in-hospital
      delays (DNT) in self-selecting centers recruiting patients into the the Safe Implementation
      of Treatments in Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register (SITS-ISTR) , comprising
      currently more than 80 000 patients from 1338 centers. Current median of DNT in all SITS
      centers is 65 minutes (compared with 20 minutes in Helsinki Univer-sity Central Hospital). An
      itemized detailed questionnaire, including all factors known to influence DNT, has been sent
      to all SITS centers to identify the reasons for long in-hospital delays. Based on the
      replies, we have prepared a list of interventions that can be considered by individual SITS
      centers in order to reduce DNT with interventions that are in line with national legislation.
