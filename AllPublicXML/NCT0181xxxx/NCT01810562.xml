    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether tactile stimulation for reduced sensibility
      of the affected extremities after stroke has effect.

      Hypothesis:

      Stimulation of sensibility after stroke will have a significant contribution for improved
      sensibility. Without any stimulation, no signal is sent to the brain and there is no need for
      the healthy parts of the brain to adapt this function. Stimulation of the sensibility over a
      period of time on both sides of the body, gives the brain signals and the opportunity to
      compare how the signals should be recognized. New connection will be able to interpret
      signals correctly.

      Through stroke rehabilitation, function from damaged areas can be replaced by healthy parts
      of the brain. It is important for rehabilitation to take advantage of this compensatory
      qualities whit early intervention and mobilization. Only small gains can lead to big
      improvements.

      About half of stroke survivors gets reduced sensibility caused bye the stroke, and
      sensibility is considered to be an important part of rehabilitation of function and
      activities.

      A Norwegian guideline concludes that the scientific knowledge is to week to recommend this
      kind of treatment. There is some evidence for improvement of sensibility when specific
      training and stimulation is given. Achievements in sensibility can lead to some improvement
      in function.

      The project will be carried out as a randomized controlled trial. In this project, the
      intervention group receive tactile senses stimulated twice daily over a period of 3 months,
      while the control group receives standard treatment. The results from both groups are
      measured before and after treatment.

Isstimulering achieved by an ice cube melted on each of the affected ektremitetene evenly distributed.
Brushing on thin clothing or directly on the skin, 10 times rapidly for each location. On the back of m. deltoideus from right to left side of the body, laterally along the humerus, frontally, along the radius / ulna laterally, frontal and dorsal palm, along the femur first laterally and frontally, along the tibia / fibula laterally, frontally and the footplate dorsal side.
Scrolling with spiked ball over the same area as brushing for two minutes evenly.
Firm pressure for two minutes evenly in the same area.</description>
