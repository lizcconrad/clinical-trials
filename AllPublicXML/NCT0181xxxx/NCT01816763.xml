      In light of the importance of pain and widespread interest in patient-centeredness, the
      Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has been emphasizing and successfully making pain and its
      management a routine feature of the health record and a focus of care. Awareness of pain and
      efforts to improve pain management rest on the VA's '5th Vital Sign' - a policy and practice
      of nursing staff routinely screening for 'pain now' at every health encounter using a 0-10
      Numeric Rating Scale (NRS).

      The team's previous research on VA's '5th Vital Sign' informs the specific design of this
      Effective Screening for Pain (ESP) study as well as the proposed research products.

      Alternatives to the current pain screening approach may improve the sensitivity and
      specificity of screening for chronic pain. These alternatives include the nurse administered
      NRS with a one week look back period and a three item scale (PEG) incorporating intensity and
      emotional and physical interference. The PEG is very similar to the gold standard Brief Pain
      Inventory (BPI) from which it is derived, in its sensitivity, specificity, and sensitivity to
      change in detecting clinically important, functionally impairing pain.

      The investigators plan to evaluate alternatives to the VA's current '5th Vital Sign' for pain
      screening, focusing on simple, feasible measures that can be used cross-sectionally for pain
      screening. In the setting of a primary care clinic, the investigators plan to
      cross-sectionally evaluate three arms - a nurse documented NRS now, a tablet computer-based
      NRS one week, and a tablet computer-based PEG.

      Background:

      In light of the importance of pain and widespread interest in patient-centeredness, the
      Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has been emphasizing and successfully making pain and its
      management a routine feature of the health record and a focus of care. Awareness of pain and
      efforts to improve pain management rest on the VA's '5th Vital Sign' - a policy and practice
      of nursing staff routinely screening for 'pain now' at every health encounter using a 0-10
      Numeric Rating Scale (NRS).

      The team's previous research on VA's '5th Vital Sign' informs the specific design of this
      Effective Screening for Pain (ESP) study as well as the proposed research products.

      Alternatives to the current pain screening approach may improve the sensitivity and
      specificity of screening for chronic pain. These alternatives include the nurse administered
      NRS with a one week look back period and a three item scale (PEG) incorporating intensity and
      emotional and physical interference. The PEG is very similar to the gold standard Brief Pain
      Inventory (BPI) from which it is derived, in its sensitivity, specificity, and sensitivity to
      change in detecting clinically important, functionally impairing pain.

      The investigators plan to evaluate alternatives to the VA's current '5th Vital Sign' for pain
      screening, focusing on simple, feasible measures that can be used cross-sectionally for pain
      screening. In the setting of a primary care clinic, the investigators plan to
      cross-sectionally evaluate three arms - a nurse documented NRS now, a tablet computer-based
      NRS one week, and a tablet computer-based PEG.

      Objectives:

      1) Qualitatively evaluate Veteran and multidisciplinary provider perspectives on pain
      screening and the use of the NRS vs. the PEG items, point of care vs. mobile reporting,
      clinician-assessed vs. patient-reported pain, and usefulness of medical chart and
      patient-derived health information in screening, assessment, management, and follow-up of
      pain.

      2a) Quantitatively assess, in a 3-arm randomized controlled primary care clinical team-based
      trial using tablets, the feasibility and completion rates, validity, and variability of pain
      information obtained comparing: Tablet-based vs. nurse-documented pain (e.g., 5th vital sign
      by tablet vs. clinician assessed) and the rate and severity of pain detected in tablet-based
      'NRS one week' (Arm 1), tablet-based PEG (Arm 2), and usual 5th vital sign (Arm 3). Also
      pain, self-reported disability, and Veteran satisfaction with pain screening mode for chronic
      pain detection.

      2b) Informed by Aims 1 and 2a, qualitatively evaluate provider perspectives on different pain
      reports and features of informatics prototypes to facilitate better pain management.

      Methods:

      The investigators are conducting a two phase mixed method study that will build on prior work
      to develop and test enhanced pain screening approaches for primary care and Patient Aligned
      Care Teams (PACTs). In the first (development) phase of the study, the investigators will
      conduct semi-structured qualitative interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians,
      other primary care team members including non-provider staff, and primary care Veteran
      patients, to understand what patient-reported pain assessment data are most useful for
      clinical decision-making and how this pain information can best be integrated into primary
      care team processes, including the role of informatics to optimize primary care pain
      management and link pain screening to management. This will inform the development of the
      enhanced pain screening approaches used in the Aim 2 randomized controlled trial (RCT). The
      investigators will also submit the enhanced tablet-based pain screening approaches to
      usability testing by the University of California Office of Information Technology.

      The second (testing) phase of the study will include a multisite RCT to test the final
      enhanced pain screening approaches (Arm 1 PEG; Arm 2 NRS 'pain now') compared with the NRS
      one week (Arm 3), on patient and primary care clinician outcomes. The investigators will
      assess whether the approaches improve detection of pain-related impairment, and also the
      feasibility, acceptability, and provider and patient experience with enhanced screening.

      Status:

      The investigators have completed Aim 1 data collection, coding, and analyses. They have
      presented some findings as conference posters and presentations at two conferences. Two
      manuscripts are currently under review and others are being prepared for submission.

      Findings from Aim 1 were used to guide the development of a tablet-based pain screening
      survey that the investigators tested in Aim 2a as a randomized control trial. The
      investigators have have completed data collection, and are currently analyzing results.

      For Aim 2b, the investigators have completed qualitative semi-structured interviews with
      providers about their perspectives on pain reporting processes, and have begun analyzing
      those transcripts. The investigators have conducted several interviews with patients and will
      continue collecting and analyzing those interviews.
