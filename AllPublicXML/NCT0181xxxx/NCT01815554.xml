    <textblock>
      This is an observational longitudinal study designed to identify and describe long term
      outcomes for patients with high tetraplegia who use a Diaphragmatic Pacing System (DPS). As
      this is not a randomized or experimental study, no specific hypotheses are proposed. The data
      collected will enable us to answer the following research questions:

        1. What are the patterns of long-term DPS use (hours per day using DPS, changes in DPS
           stimulus parameters, abandonment of DPS and related reasons).

        2. What mechanical problems have DPS users encountered (system failure, repairs needed)?

        3. What are the frequency of and reasons for rehospitalization following DPS implant?

        4. What levels of care are needed at home to manage the DPS?

        5. How do DPS users feel about the system (satisfaction, comfort, vocalization, taste,
           swallowing)?

    <textblock>
      Ventilatory dependent high tetraplegia is a relatively rare but devastating condition. Review
      of National Spinal Cord Injury Database statistics show that only 3.6% of patients with
      tetraplegia are ventilator dependent at one year post injury.1 A subset of individuals who
      are ventilatory dependent in the long term and have upper motor neuron paralysis of the
      diaphragm are candidates for electrophrenic respiration (EPR) which can create inspiratory
      function through electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerves, resulting in diaphragmatic
      contraction. The use of this technology in ventilatory dependent tetraplegia was first
      described almost 40 years ago with a pacing system using cuff electrodes surgically placed
      around the phrenic nerve in the neck.2 The concept of EPR via minimally invasive
      laparoscopically placed diaphragmatic electrodes was first reported in 2002.3 This new
      Diaphragmatic Pacing System (DPS) had the distinct advantage of requiring less invasive
      surgery for electrode implantation compared to the phrenic cuff electrode system which
      required surgical exploration of the neck. In some settings, the DPS system has been
      implanted as an outpatient surgery. The DPS had a potential disadvantage however in that,
      unlike the traditional EPR system, the stimulating electrode leads are externalized posing an
      infection risk and the electrodes are attached to a moving muscle creating a risk for
      dislodgement. Once the system achieved FDA Humanitarian Use Device (HUD) exemption status in
      2008, there was adoption of the Diaphragm Pacing System (DPS) among a number of SCI centers
      as a treatment option for patients with ventilatory dependent high tetraplegia. Reporting of
      long-term outcomes of DPS in the SCI population is limited to a 2009 report authored by the
      system inventor on 50 patients with average follow-up of 2.0 Â± 1.5 years (median 1.6 years,
      range 0.5-8.0 years).4 The six SCIMS centers participating in this module research propose to
      collect long-term follow-up data on DPS patients implanted and/or followed at their centers
      since 2007. This project will enable the reporting of independent long-term utilization,
      effectiveness, satisfaction, durability and safety outcomes of this innovative technology.

        collaborating study sites, including individuals who undergo DPS implantation during the
        funding cycle through October of 2014. Currently, there are approximately 60 individuals
