    <textblock>
      An open-label phase to assess the frequency and severity of adverse events in recurrent
      glioblastoma patients receiving Sativex in combination with dose-intense Temozolomide (Part
      A). A randomisation phase to assess the safety of Sativex compared with placebo (Part B).
      Part A will be reported here.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive Sativex and dose-intense Temozolomide in an open-label phase. The
      incidence of adverse events will be monitored (Part A). An investigator led Safety Review
      Team will assess the safety profile of the open-label patients and decide whether the study
      can progress to the randomisation phase (Part B). Patients who enrol in the randomisation
      phase patients will receive either Sativex or placebo. The safety of Sativex compared to
      placebo will be assessed by pharmacokinetic analysis of Temozolomide and its metabolites,
      clinical laboratory tests, adverse events and vital signs.
