    <textblock>
      Testicular torsion is the spontaneous twisting of the testis and its blood vessels, resulting
      in acute pain, vascular compromise and death of the testicle if unrelieved quickly. In this
      study, investigators will test a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device that rapidly and
      non-invasively measures deep tissue oxygen saturation.

      The main goal of this prospective, non-randomized pilot study is to assess the utility of
      NIRS for the clinical diagnosis of the acute scrotum and testicular torsion. Near-Infrared
      spectroscopy (NIRS) is a simple and non-invasive technique that assesses the oxygen
      saturation of deeper body tissue. It has a variety of adult and pediatric human health
      applications but has not been tested in testicular torsion. Investigators propose to evaluate
      the usefulness of this modality in human testicular torsion. The overall objectives and
      specific aims are: 1) To evaluate the utility of NIRS in the diagnosis of testicular torsion
      versus other causes of the acute scrotum, 2) To assess the sensitivity and specificity of
      Doppler/ B-mode Ultrasound versus NIRS, and 3) To evaluate the utility of NIRS as an
      intraoperative and postoperative test for predicting testicular viability after surgical
      detorsion.The sensitivity and specificity of NIRS for testicular torsion will be defined
      relative to surgical exploration, scrotal Doppler/B-mode ultrasound, and clinical follow-up.
      Last, investigators will assess the utility of intraoperative and postoperative NIRS for
      predicting testicular viability after testicular detorsion. To achieve this, standard care
      will be provided for all patients and at two or five time points NIRS measurements will be
      obtained in a blinded fashion so standard care is not biased by NIRS data. Outcome variables
      will include NIRS StO2 measurements, torsion status (yes/no), ultrasound parameters
      (testicular size, volume, echogenicity, presence/absence of Doppler flow, whirlpool sign,
      hydrocele, scrotal wall thickness) duration of pain, and duration of torsion. Study endpoints
      will include early withdrawal, screen failures, orchiectomy for torsion, and 1 week or 3
      month post-surgical follow-up. In this 5 year single center study, the maximum number of
      local subjects to be consented will be 750 subjects. No existing charts will be used in this
      prospective study.

      Patients with acute scrotum will be evaluated by history, physical examination, and
      urinalysis per standard of care by staff in the ER, pediatric urology or pediatric surgery. A
      gray scale/color Doppler testicular ultrasound or surgical exploration will be performed as
      the next step per standard of care. While waiting for the next step, the patient and guardian
      will be informed and invited for study participation. Those that refuse study participation
      will receive standard of care treatment for the acute scrotum. Those that accept study
      participation after informed consent will receive standard of care therapy for the acute
      scrotum and will be evaluated by NIRS. At all time points in the study, the NIRS measurements
      will be blinded to the researchers by the manufacturer's computer software and placed in the
      NIRS database. Thus, the NIRS measurements will not bias clinical care, permitting standard
      of care treatment unbiased. The clinical data collection sheet will be completed
      prospectively for each patient (attachment) and entered into the non-NIRS database.

      While waiting for the gray scale/color Doppler testicular ultrasound or surgical exploration,
      the NIRS #1 measurement will be obtained. NIRS #1 is a series of 6 transcutaneous scrotal
      measurements, three on the left and three on the right. Each measurement is completely
      non-invasive, painless and takes ~15 seconds each. Thus, no sedation or supplemental
      analgesia will be needed for NIRS. The NIRS probe will be placed on the anterior, lateral and
      posterior scrotum on the left and right sides, immediately overlying and parallel to the long
      axis of the testis but on the skin, to obtain the six total measurements. Thus, the
      unaffected testis will serve as the patient's own control. In this study, the study
      coordinators will be performing the ER transscrotal NIRS testing. To achieve uniform testing,
      all will be trained for testicular probe placement methods. NIRS #1 will not delay the gray
      scale/color Doppler testicular ultrasound or surgery.

      If the surgeon decides against surgical exploration, then standard care for the other causes
      of acute scrotum will be provided, the diagnosis will be no testicular torsion and the
      patient will be discharged home with a standard care 1 week follow-up outpatient urology
      clinic appointment.

      If the gray scale/color Doppler testicular ultrasound identifies testicular torsion, then
      emergent surgical exploration will be performed. At surgery under general anesthesia per
      standard care, NIRS #2 will be performed. NIRS #2 is a series of 9 testicular tissue
      measurements performed sterile, six on the affected testis and three on the unaffected
      testis. The affected testis will receive six measurements because the first set of three will
      be immediately when the testis is exposed and still with testicular torsion while the second
      set of three measurements will be 5 minutes after the testis was detorsed. NIRS #1 and NIRS
      #2 measurements are different; NIRS #1 measurements are of the testis through the scrotal
      skin (transcutaneous) while NIRS #2 measurements are not through the skin but are directly
      obtained on the exposed testis without testicular puncture. The probe will be laid on the
      exposed testis intraoperative testicular tissue) after the scrotum has been surgically
      opened. Each measurement is painless and takes ~15 seconds each. The NIRS probe will be
      placed on the anterior, lateral and posterior testis to obtain the three sets of three
      measurements. Thus, the unaffected testis will serve as the patient's own control. NIRS #2
      will not delay the detorsion of the affected testis. Surgeons will be blinded to these NIRS
      results by the same special software as well, thus the decision during the operation will not
      be affected. If testicular torsion is found and the detorsed testis is deemed nonviable, the
      orchiectomy with contralateral orchiopexy will be performed. The patient will be discharged
      home and will reach study endpoint. If testicular torsion is found and the torsed testis is
      viable after detorsion, then bilateral orchiopexy will be performed as is standard. One hour
      after the NIRS #2 measurements were completed, NIRS #3 will be performed using the method
      described for NIRS #1 only on postsurgical patients that went bilateral orchiopexy for
      testicular salvage.

      One week later, non-surgical patients and surgical patients having bilateral orchiopexy will
      return for an outpatient urology clinic evaluation of ~1 hour duration.

        1. After standard care clinical evaluation, if the diagnosis is still no testicular
           torsion, then the patient is discharged home and reaches study endpoint.

        2. After standard care clinical evaluation, if there is a clinical concern over testicular
           viability (missed testicular torsion), then a repeat standard care gray scale/color
           Doppler testicular ultrasound will be obtained immediately and NIRS #4 will be performed
           using the method described for NIRS #1. The patient will be categorized as torsion or no
           torsion based on clinical findings and reaches study endpoint.

        3. As per standard of care, if testicular torsion was present and the testis underwent
           detorsion with orchiopexy, then NIRS #4 will be performed using the method described for
           NIRS #1. At 3 months postoperatively, a gray scale/color Doppler testicular ultrasound
           will be obtained to assess testicular volume and dimensions. The affected testis will be
           categorized as normal, &lt;20% testicular volume loss, 20-50% volume loss, or &gt;50% volume
           loss based on ultrasound parameters. At that ~1 hour visit, NIRS #5 will be performed
           using the method described for NIRS #1 and the patient reaches study endpoint.

      If the patient does not return at the designated one week or three month follow-up outpatient
      urology clinic evaluation, then the PI and/or research nurse coordinator will telephone the
      guardian to encourage return to clinic and for verbal status report on the child's clinical
      state.

      Thus the total number of study visits, including the presenting emergency visit, is three
      (Emergency, 1 week post-operatively, and 3 months post-operatively). No medications will be
      administered in this study. No blood or tissue will be collected and no radiation exposure or
      questionnaires will be given. No subjects will be responsible for any research-related costs;
      however, they will be responsible for standard care costs. At the end of the study, standard
      care will be turned over to the primary care physician or pediatric urologist if needed. No
      sub-study procedures will be performed.
