      In the present study, the investigators want to evaluate if press needle acupuncture applied
      prior to surgery may contribute to the anaesthesiologic outcome. Acupuncture might improve
      fast-track anaesthesia in the PACU after general surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of complementary approaches, especially acupuncture, has gained momentum within the
      last decade. In this regard, it might be appropriate to develop a simply applicable (a) and
      effective (b) acupuncture regimen for the complementary support of fast-track anaesthesia.
      Regarding practicability (a), it might be of interest to reduce the amount of necessary
      acupuncture points. Trials have shown that single-point acupuncture is strong enough to cause
      relevant clinical effects (Fleckenstein et al., 2009; Lee and Fan, 2009). In addition,
      practicability means to reduce the amount of needling events; therefore the investigators
      suggest the use of press needles, making complete peri-anaesthetic availability possible.
      Regarding effectiveness (b), it has been reported that acupuncture at Governing Vessel 26
      (Du-26) may be successful in shock resuscitation (Hsu et al., 2006). In combination with
      other points it has been evaluated in a Chinese study improving the vegetative state after
      operation of acute subdural hematoma (Zheng, 2005).

All standardized medication according to the perioperative anaesthetic guideline, Department of Anaesthesiology, University of Munich, will be allowed. In special:
According to the guidelines, anxiolysis will be performed intravenously according to the standard guidelines with opioid immediately prior to the induction of anaesthesia.
Intraoperative anaesthesia will be performed according to our in-house guidelines: on general recommendations and guidelines of the German society for anaesthesiology (DGAI). Opioids and propofol will be administered via TCI pumps according to the standard protocol.
It is allowed to treat the subject for pain with metamizol (4*1.25 g/day) and additional piritramide (PCA; 2 mg each 10 minutes; maximum dosage 30 mg/4 hours) .
Variation of this guideline based regimen are allowed if medically indicated.</description>

The point regimen is based on consensus process of national and international experts. All needling will be documented by the acupuncturist. Application time is supposed to be 84-96 hours. Modification, especially less points according to the patients reaction during treatment is allowed.</description>
