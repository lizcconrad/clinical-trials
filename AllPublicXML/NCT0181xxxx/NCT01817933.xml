  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recovery of range of motion and muscle power after surgical intervention of the fracture
      will mostly affect patient's daily activities. So postoperative rehabilitation program will
      play the important role. Correct and effective physical therapy will reduce the functional
      impairment of limbs after long term casting or surgical fixation, and accelerate to recover
      the independent daily activities. There is no consensus between immediate or delay and the
      duration of continue physical therapy will improve the shoulder function、muscle power and
      degree of satisfaction( physiological function、social function、mental health、 pain、 general
      health status ) after surgical fixation of fractures. This study will evaluate the patients
      of the fracture that including of the humeral neck fracture, vertebral fracture, distal
      radial fracture and hip fractures after surgical fixation, to see the difference of fracture
      healing time, function recovery and pain sensation after intervention of physical therapy at
      different time point.

      From this study, we hope to discriminate the timing of intervention and duration of physical
      therapy which is the key factors for postoperative prognosis of fractures fixation, and to
      set up the perfect rehabilitation program in ChangHua Christian Hospital. The results of this
      study will improve the discomfort of fracture patient's recovery or reduce the complications
      rate, and set up the standard treatment policy of our hospital , also was the model of other
      hospitals.
