  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose to assess, retrospectively (from 1/7/2009) and prospectively (up to
      31/12/2013,) the safety and tolerability profile (number of participants with adverse events)
      of standard chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab (Avastin) as first line
      treatment of patients with metastatic Colorectal Cancer with or without KRAS mutation. All
      treatment schedules that are going to be assessed are considered by the international
      guidelines as standard therapy for patients with metastatic Colorectal Cancer.

      In addition investigators propose to assess the compliance of patients to treatment and the
      efficacy of treatment. That means percentage of objective responses, duration of response,
      frequency of curative liver resection after the administration of treatment, progression free
      survival and estimation of overall survival
