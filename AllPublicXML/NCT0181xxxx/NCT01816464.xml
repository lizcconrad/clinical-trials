    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this project is to evaluate the immunogenicity of TIV vaccination in
      HIV-uninfected pregnant women compared with HIV-uninfected non-pregnant women in 2013. Safety
      data will also be collected.THe Pregnancy outcomes and the transplacental transfer of
      antibodies will also be assessed.

    <measure>Compare the immunogenicity of Trivalent Influenza Vaccine (TIV) in pregnant compared to non-pregnant Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-uninfected women.</measure>
    <time_frame>one month post-vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Hemagglutination inhibition assays (HAI)will be performed to assess the immunogenicity of TIV. In this study we will use the following definitions to assess the humoral immune response to TIV: HAI titers &lt;1:10 = seronegative; HAI titers ≥1:10 = seropositive; HAI titers ≥1:40 = sero-protective titers; and sero-conversion will be defined as HAI titers from &lt;1:10 to ≥1:40 or ≥4-fold increase if pre-vaccination titers were ≥1:10.</description>

    <measure>Determine the impact of vaccination on T-cell activation and regulatory B and T cells subpopulations in pregnant and non-pregnant women.</measure>
    <time_frame>one month post vaccination and one week post delivery in pregnant cohort</time_frame>
    <description>T-lymphocyte activation assays will be performed using state-of-the art polychromatic flow cytometry. The T- and B-cell phenotypes are assessed by flow cytometry using freshly thawed Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC). Cells are stained using monoclonal antibodies against the comparator molecules</description>

    <measure>2.2.2. Determine the impact of vaccination on cell-mediated immune responses to each influenza strain in HIV-uninfected pregnant and non-pregnant women</measure>
    <time_frame>one month post vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Interferon (IFN)- Enzyme Linked Immuno Spot (ELISPOT) responses will be assessed on fresh PBMCs. PBMCs will be separated and stimulated with influenza virus corresponding to the vaccine strains.Spots will be visualized with a ELISPOT plate reader. Results will be reported as Spot Forming Cells (SFC) /106 PBMCs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the dynamics of transplacental transfer of maternal Hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies to their newborns.</measure>
    <time_frame>one week post delivery in pregnant cohort</time_frame>
    <description>The study will assess the effect of TIV administration during pregnancy on transplacental influenza-specific antibody transfer to the fetus. HAI titers will be measured in infants within one week of birth. Using the 1:40 HAI titer as a defining threshold of protection against wild type influenza, we will determine the proportion of infants protected against influenza at birth.</description>

    <measure>Determine antibodies against TIV present in breast milk</measure>
    <time_frame>in week post delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Influenza specific antibodies measures by HAI titres in the breastmilk will be measured. Mothers will express breastmilk into sterile containers to collect the samples.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare local and systemic solicited reactions to TIV in pregnant and non-pregnant HIV-uninfected women.</measure>
    <time_frame>one month post vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will remain in the clinic for at least 30 minutes after vaccination so that clinic personnel can observe for any potential adverse reactions to the vaccine.
Report of vaccine-related local (redness, swelling, tenderness, itching,) and systemic (fever, malaise, myalgia, nausea, headache, rash) adverse events will be solicited at day 7 and day 28 by means of a participant diary card. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Describe safety outcome measures (maternal and foetal) of TIV-vaccination of HIV-uninfected pregnant women.</measure>
    <time_frame>one month post vaccination and one week post delivery in pregnant cohort</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability of the study vaccine will be monitored by means of Adverse Events (AEs) and toxicity reports presenting laboratory and clinical data. The data to be reviewed by the protocol team will be pooled across treatment arms.In addition to monthly toxicity reviews by the Core Team, the study will be monitored by a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC). The Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events is used</description>

an A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like virus; - a B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like virus.
The vaccine to be used in the study in 2013 is Vaxigrip (Sanofi Pasteur), or other equivalent licensed vaccine should the latter not be available, which will be procured commercially in pre-filled syringes. Using aseptic technique, participants will be injected with 0.5 mL of TIV from pre-filled syringe.</description>
