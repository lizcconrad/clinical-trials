      To compare efficacy and safety of Gemcitabine versus S-1 adjuvant therapy after
      hemihepatectomy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no standard adjuvant therapy after liver hemi-hepatectomy due to bile duct cancer,
      because of high surgical morbidity ratio and high adverse event ratio of adjuvant therapy.
      For example, our preliminary results showed that regular gemcitabine administration
      (1000mg/m2, day 1, 8, 15 every 4 weeks) after hemihepatectomy was too toxic and induced
      severe leukocytopenia and/or thrombocytopenia. Formerly, the investigators planned the study
      to decide more safety adjuvant protocol (recommend dose: RD) for Gemcitabine or S-1 after
      hemihepatectomy using Continuous Reassessment Method (CRM) analysis and decided the recommend
      doses. Note: In the former study, the investigators decided that tolerable ratio of Dose
      Limiting Toxicity (DLT) would be less than 10%.

      Herein, the investigators planned the study to evaluate efficacy (recurrent free survival as
      primary outcome, and overall-survival as secondary outcome) and safety (as secondary outcome)
      in our recommended protocols, and to compare the efficacy as randomized control trial.
