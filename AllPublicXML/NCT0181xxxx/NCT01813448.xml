  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK)
      of single and multiple ascending doses of fidaxomicin in healthy subjects. This study will
      also compare the safety, tolerability and PK of single and multiple doses of fidaxomicin in
      healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects.

    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects will check into the unit on Day-2 and remain confined to the clinical unit
      until Day 17.

      Cohorts 2 and 3, which may run in parallel, will only be enrolled after review of the
      available safety data of Cohort 1 by the Safety Review Team.
