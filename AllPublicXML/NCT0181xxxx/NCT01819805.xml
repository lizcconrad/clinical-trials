  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center (study conducted at multiple sites), open label (all people know the
      identity of the intervention), prospective (in which the participants are first identified
      and then followed forward as time passes), observational study to assess the improvement of
      pain and health-related quality of life in patients with moderate to severe chronic
      non-malignant pain. The study will enroll patients who had already filled a prescription for
      extended release tramadol hydrochloride 75 mg and acetaminophen 650 mg (ULTRACET ER). The
      study medication will be administered according to local label insert. The study medication
      will be taken twice daily, 1 to 2 tablets each time, for a maximum of 4 tablets. Safety
      evaluations for adverse events will be performed throughout the study. The total duration of
      the study will be approximately of 12 weeks.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is an 11-point scale to measure the pain intensity and is used by patients to rate their pain from 0 (absence of pain) to 10 (extreme pain). Percentage PID =[(NRS score at baseline - NRS score at Week 12)/NRS score at baseline] X 100.</description>

    <description>The KEQ-5D is a validated generic measure of quality of life which usually requires less than 1 minute to complete (eg, the questionnaire may have questions about mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression).</description>
