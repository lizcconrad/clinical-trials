  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis of the knee is a degenerative joint disease that involves degradation of the
      joint. Symptoms include joint tenderness, pain, stiffness, locking, and occasionally an
      effusion. Over 40 million Americans also have cardiovascular disease in addition to their OA.
      Initiation and maintenance of even low-levels of physical activity is critical for management
      of cardiac risk. Patients with osteoarthritis have been shown to have poorer aerobic
      conditioning, lower daily physical activity levels and lower self-efficacy for exercise than
      non-OA cohorts.

      It has been established that there exists a consistent gradient across activity groups
      indicating greater longevity and reduced risk of CHD, CVD, and stroke, in more active
      individuals. Available research suggests the greatest gains in cardiovascular fitness occur
      in moving a sedentary individual to even low levels of physical activity, and 12 weeks is
      enough to demonstrate change in the risk profile of at-risk individuals.

      Finally, appropriate levels of aerobic and strength training have been shown to be beneficial
      in treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of
      hylan G-F 20 (single injection preparation) in promoting greater levels of physical activity
      and fitness as measured by MET level compared to an exercise-only cohort; evaluating both the
      change in physical function as well as the cardiovascular risk profile. This is a randomized,
      single-blinded clinical trial comparing injection of the knee joint with Hylan GF-20 to sham
      procedure. Subjects will undergo a regular exercise program for 6 months following
      randomization.
