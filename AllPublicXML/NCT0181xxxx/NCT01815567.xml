    <measure>DETECT neurocognitive outcome scores (Z-scores) in association with blood pressure measures and retinal pathology (isolated retinal hemorrhage, grade III/IV hemorrhagic retinopathy)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We aim to determine the correlation (if any) between the severity of blood pressure and DETECT neurocognitive outcomes as well as the correlation (if any) between known Hypertensive retinal disease and DETECT neurocognitive outcomes. Appropriate statistical analysis will be performed to compare clinical retinal findings, BP values, and DETECT neurocognitive test outcomes.
Subject level data will only be collected on the day of Emergency Department presentation. Subjects will not be followed after their initial enrollment. The study duration is projected for 12 months</description>
