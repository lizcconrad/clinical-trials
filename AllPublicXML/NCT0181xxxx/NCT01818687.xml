      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of colestilan (MCI-196)
      in paediatric subjects (aged 2 years to &lt;18 years) with CKD stages 3b to 5, diagnosed with
      hyperphosphataemia, who are not on dialysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children aged 2 years to &lt;18 years with CKD stages 3b to 5, not on dialysis (stage 3b
             is defined as a glomerular filtration rate below 45 mL/min/1.73 mÂ²).

          -  The subject has a documented diagnosis of hyperphosphataemia, as demonstrated by serum
             phosphorus (P) levels above the age-related upper limit of normal (ULN) (Kidney
             Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative [KDOQI] Clinical Practice Guidelines for Nutrition
             in Children with CKD updated 2008).

          -  The subject is on a stable P diet at baseline (as judged by the Investigator).

        Inclusion criteria for subjects not currently treated with phosphate binders:

          -  The subject, with serum P not controlled despite being on an appropriate P diet, must
             demonstrate serum P levels &gt;1.5 standard deviation (SD) above the KDOQI 2008
             age-related mean value at any time during the screening period. Such subjects do not
             require wash-out and should proceed to baseline for the next visit if additional
             screening visits are not required.

        Baseline inclusion criteria for subjects treated with phosphate binders:

          -  The subject must enter the wash-out period, during which he/she must demonstrate serum
             P levels &gt;1.5 SD above the KDOQI 2008 age-related mean value at any time during the
             wash-out period (after stopping phosphate binders), and;

          -  The subject must demonstrate an increase in serum P levels by at least 10% above the
             pre wash-out level (after stopping phosphate binders).

        Note: should a subject fail to meet any of the above criteria, the subject is permitted to
        be re-screened once after an interval of at least three months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has been diagnosed with hypocholesterolaemia (i.e., cholesterol levels
             below age-related normal ranges, per local practices)

          -  The subject has current clinically significant medical comorbidities, which may
             substantially compromise subject safety, or expose him/her to undue risk, or interfere
             significantly with study procedures and which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             make the subject unsuitable for inclusion in the study (e.g., the subject currently
             has or has had a history of seizure disorders, dysphagia, swallowing disorders,
             predisposition to or current bowel obstruction, ileus or gastrointestinal [GI]
             disorders such as chronic or severe constipation [as judged by the Investigator],
             intestinal stenosis, intestinal diverticulum, sigmoid colitis, GI ulcers, current or a
             history of GI bleeding, or major GI tract surgery)

          -  The subject cannot stop treatment (prescription or over the-counter) of any of the
             following orally taken medications during the wash-out period: any product containing
             calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), aluminium compounds, sevelamer, lanthanum, ketosteril

          -  The subject is receiving immunosuppressant treatment for any medical condition at the
             baseline visit or is expected to receive such treatment during the course of the study

          -  The subject is considered as unstable on his/her current treatment for CKD within one
             month prior to screening (e.g., subjects starting treatment with vitamin D or its
             analogues, or other agents/procedures that may influence bone mineral metabolism [i.e,
             serum P and Ca levels]

        Exclusion criteria for subjects treated with phosphate binders:

          -  The subject was treated with a combination of two or more phosphate binders within one
             month prior to screening
