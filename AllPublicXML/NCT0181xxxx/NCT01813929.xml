  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance (IR) is an important contributor to increased cardiovascular disease risk
      in type 1 diabetes (T1D). The purpose of this study is to measure the effect of metformin on
      insulin sensitivity, vascular function and compliance, and mitochondrial function in T1D. The
      long term goal is to identify novel non-glycemic approaches to managing cardiovascular
      disease risk in T1D. The results of this study may validate a novel approach to T1D treatment
      that could significantly improve current management of cardiovascular disease risk in this
      high risk population.
