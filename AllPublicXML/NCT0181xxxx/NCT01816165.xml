  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance (IR) is an important contributor to increased cardiovascular disease risk
      in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Non-esterified fatty acid elevation is a significant contributor to
      IR in T1D and may be a target of intervention. The hypothesis of the study is that isolated
      fatty acid lowering with acipimox will improve insulin action and blood vessel function and
      have the benefit of reducing mitochondrial oxidant generation and improving mitochondrial
      function in T1D. Targeting IR through fatty acid lowering is a novel approach to T1D
      treatment that may significantly improve current management of TID and of cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) risk in this high risk population.
