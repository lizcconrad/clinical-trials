    <textblock>
      Estimation of hydration state in dialysis patients is a major challenge in clinical practice.
      Although many methods have been studied, none have been established yet for clinical routine
      practice.

      The investigators have developed a method, using segmental and calf bioimpedance spectroscopy
      (cBIS) techniques to measure body hydration. The device we used based on the FDA-approved
      Hydra 4200 (Xitron Technologies, San Diego, CA). The Hydra 4200 was initially developed to
      measure whole body and segmental body fluid volumes but Hydra is approved only for measuring
      healthy subjects. The cBIS monitors hydration state by continuously measuring change in
      resistance and resistivity in the calf during hemodialysis (HD) or it can be used for simple
      measurement before, during and after dialysis. Preliminary results in clinical studies have
      shown that optimal hydration state of HD patients may be determined by the calf method. This
      study aims to compare the Hydra 4200 to two other devices: the FDA approved ZOE (100 kHz)
      Fluid Status Monitor (Noninvasive Medical Technologies, Inc, Las Vegas) and a modified
      version ZOE 5 kHz. The modified ZOE monitor (ZOE (5 kHz)) delivers frequency of 5 kHz and 0.8
      mA current instead of 100 kHz and 2 mA.

      The subjects of this study include a group of hemodialysis patients and a group of healthy
      controls. The healthy controls are used to identify a normal range within the healthy
      population for each method. Each hemodialysis patient will be studied twice in different
      hydration state. The study will not change the procedure of the patient's dialysis treatment.
      Since all devices are based on noninvasive bioimpedance technique, this study has minimal
      risk.
