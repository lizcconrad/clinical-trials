          -  Any other medical condition, that in the opinion of the investigator, poses an
             unacceptable risk for implant of a stent according to the study indications

          -  Pregnant, planning to become pregnant or nursing during the course of the study. Women
             of child-bearing potential must have a negative blood pregnancy (beta hCG) test.

             pregnancy test.

             silicon carbide

          -  Life expectancy of less than one year

          -  Participation in any other clinical investigational device or drug study. Subjects may
             be concurrently enrolled in a post-market study, as long as the post-market study
             device, drug or protocol does not interfere with the investigational treatment or
             protocol of this study.

          -  Documented diagnosis of an acute MI within 72 hours of the index procedure and an
             elevation of Troponin or CKMB above the URL (CKMB measurement is not required if CK is
