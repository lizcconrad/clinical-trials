      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of intra-articular
      hyaluronan (IAHA) injections for the treatment of symptomatic patellofemoral pain syndrome
      (PFPS) and determine if this treatment can provide incremental clinical benefits over
      standard care for patients with this diagnosis.

      Objective: To determine the safety and effectiveness of intra-articular hyaluronan (IAHA)
      injections for the treatment of symptomatic patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) and determine
      if this treatment can provide incremental clinical benefits over standard care for patients
      with this diagnosis.

      Study Design: Two-arm, single-center, parallel, pragmatic, randomized, non-blinded,
      effectiveness trial

      Indication for Use: For treatment of adult patients with Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS)
      who have failed to respond to conservative treatment and simple analgesics (e.g.
      acetaminophen).

      Setting: University Teaching Hospital, Faculty Practice

      Subjects: Male and female patients aged 18-40 diagnosed with symptomatic patellofemoral pain
      syndrome (PFPS) that meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Approximately 68 subjects
      will be enrolled based on a power analysis of sample size estimation.

      Methods: Patients signing informed consent will be randomized to one of two groups: (1)
      Standard Care, (2) Standard Care plus Intra-articular hyaluronan (IAHA) administered as a
      course of 3 consecutive weekly intra-articular injections.

      Standard Care is defined as consisting of physical therapy, activity modification (relative
      rest), and/or oral analgesic therapy. Upon entering the trial, a specific physical therapy
      (PT) protocol will be implemented.

      Data will be captured on the study knee history and symptoms. Radiographic examinations will
      be performed including weight-bearing anterior-posterior views with knees flexed 30 degrees,
      lateral, and sunrise views. The diagnosis of PFPS will be based on the subjects' being less
      than 40 years of age, and the occurrence of chronic retropatellar pain in the absence of
      other pain-causing abnormalities.

      Arthrocentesis will be performed before all intra-articular injections, and any synovial
      fluid collected will be visually inspected for signs of infection before performing any
      injections. The volume of synovial fluid will be measured, and the samples will then be
      retained for further biomarker analysis.

      A follow-up visit will be scheduled approximately 3 months after the baseline visit, to
      reevaluate patient condition.

      Study Duration: A period of approximately 15 months is anticipated from the time the first
      patient is enrolled to the completion of the last patient visit. A final study report will
      then be generated after this 18 month time point.

    <description>A 100mm visual analog scale (VAS) for activity related pain assessment will serve as the primary outcome measure</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PFPS Severity Scale (PSS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS was specifically designed and tested on patients suffering from patellofemoral pain syndrome. In its original form, it is a visual analog scale (100 mm) for pain while performing 10 different activities that reflect typically painful movements for physically active subjects with PFPS. For the purposes of this study, the PSS was modified from a 10 cm visual analog scale to a 10 point Likert scale. This modified PSS will be used by all subjects. In addition, patients will be asked to identify which activity within the PSS is most painful to them.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Tegner Activity Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Tegner activity scale will be used as an additional secondary outcome measure in this study because it has been demonstrated to be a valid clinimetric instrument for assessing function in patients with knee pain. The Tegner activity scale uses a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 10. Each value indicates the ability to perform specific activities. An activity level of 10 corresponds to participation in competitive sports, including soccer, football, and rugby at the elite level. Whereas an activity level of 0 is assigned if a person is on sick leave or receiving a disability pension because of knee problems.</description>

    <intervention_name>Intra-Articular Hyaluronic Acid-Euflexxa</intervention_name>
    <description>IAHA was approved by the FDA in 1997 as a synovial fluid replacement device to help relieve the pain associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA) in patients who fail to respond adequately to conservative treatment and simple analgesics. In this study, IAHA, specifically Euflexxa, will be used off-label to determine whether patients afflicted with PFPS will experience similar analgesic effects as seen in those with OA.</description>
