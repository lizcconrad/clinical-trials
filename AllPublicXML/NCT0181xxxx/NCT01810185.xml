      The investigators will compare the use of daily low dose naltrexone (LDN) (4.5 mg) compared
      with placebo in subjects that have symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our subjects
      will be those with diagnosed with IBD and are symptomatic, defined by an inflammatory bowel
      disease questionnaire (IBDQ) score &lt; 170. The subjects will be randomly assigned either
      placebo or LDN. They will take the IBDQ prior to starting the trial, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 6
      months after starting the medication. Participants have to remain on their current IBD
      regimen throughout the trial and cannot make any changes within 4 weeks of starting the
      trial. The investigators will have a safety phone call at 6 weeks and a follow up letter at
      12 weeks after starting the trial. The participants will be given a card to keep with them
      with a phone number and email address if any adverse effects arise.

    <description>Participants will fill-out a questionnaire called the IBDQ at enrollment, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after enrollment. The IBDQ is a validated instrument often used in routine care and studies of patients with IBD (Appendix E). The IBDQ measures the activity of IBD and quality of life. It includes 32 questions placed into 4 domains: bowel, social, emotional and systemic. Each question is ranked from 1-7, 1 being the poorest quality of life and 7 being the best quality of life8. A score of &gt;170 means that a patient is clinically in remission and an increase in score between 16 and 32 are considered a meaningful improvement in symptoms.</description>
