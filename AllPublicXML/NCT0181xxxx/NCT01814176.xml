  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During Anesthesia many patients require that a breathing be inserted into their windpipe.
      This is usually achieved using a direct laryngoscope, consisting of a retraction blade with a
      light near its end. When achieving a direct line-of-sight to the windpipe is difficult, more
      force is often applied, resulting in greater patient stress. A GlideScope video laryngoscope
      uses a camera and light source to see the windpipe. This enables the user to see objects that
      may not be in the direct line-of-sight. This likely results in less force being required,
      reducing patient stress. Because such stresses are often confounded by patient variables, we
      are comparing the forces required by the direct and video laryngoscopes on patients with at
      least one risk factor for difficulty, by directly measuring these with special sensors
      attached to the laryngoscope blades.
