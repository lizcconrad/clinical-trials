      The miRNA 107 gene is increasingly appreciated to serve key functions in humans. The miRNA
      regulate gene expression involved in cell division, metabolism, stress response, and
      angiogenesis in vertebrate species. But the relationship and diagnosis capability of miRNA
      107 and BACE1 mRNA gene expression in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of amnestic mild
      cognitive impairment (aMCI) and normal control is still a mystery.

        the subjects were collected from Shanghai Mental Health Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong
        University School of Medicine (Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Center, ADRDC) and
        the of Shanghai Changning district, Huangpu district and Putuo district.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) was diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria and the National
             Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease
             and Related Disorder's Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria.

          -  AMCI was diagnosed based on the following criteria (Petersen et al., 2001): 1) memory
             complaint, preferably corroborated by a spouse or relative, 2) objective memory
             impairment, 3) normal general cognitive function, 4) intact activities of daily
             living, and 5) absence of dementia. We have amended the aMCI diagnostic criteria of
             the Petersen Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) cut-off score in order to be
             consistent with the low level of education in elderly Chinese people. Research
             (mingyuan Zhang et al, 1988) found that with the Chinese version of MMSE, AD subjects
             who had not been educated (NO ED) exhibited MMSE scores of &lt;18, those with elementary
             school education exhibited MMSE scores of &lt;21, and those with higher than middle
             school education exhibited MMSE scores of &lt;25. In the present study, the aMCI analysis
             was carried out on NO ED subjects with MMSE cut-off scores of over 18, elementary
             school educated subjects with MMSE cut-off scores of over 21, and higher than middle
             school educated subject with MMSE cut-off scores of over 25.

          -  The cognitively-normal elderly formed the normal control (NC) group, was
             independently-functioning community dwellers with no neurological or psychiatric
             conditions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  All participants underwent a screening process that included a review of their medical
             history, physical and neurological examinations, laboratory tests, and MRI analysis.
             The clinical assessment of mild cognitive impairment or dementia included
             neuropsychological tests, as well as behavioral and psychiatric interviews conducted
             by the attending psychiatrist. AD patients recorded scores of &lt; 4 on the Hachinski
             Ischemia Scale and showed no history of significant systemic or psychiatric
             conditions, or traumatic brain injuries that could compromise brain function.
