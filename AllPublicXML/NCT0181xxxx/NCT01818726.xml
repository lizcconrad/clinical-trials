  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate Exjade efficacy and safety in patients with aplastic anemia and
      transfusion-dependent iron overload, undergoing treatment programs of immunosuppressive
      treatment (Cyclosporine A) , in comparison with a group of patients undergoing treatment
      programs of immunosuppressive treatment (Cyclosporine A) without chelation therapy.

    <description>In the investigational arm all patients recieve a standard immunosuppressant (Cyclosporine A). The starting dose of Exjade will be 20 mg/kg/day with up- and down-titration steps of 5-10 mg/kg/day if necessary, depending on serum ferritin, tolerability and comorbidities. Doses above 30 mg/kg are discouraged as such experience is limited in aplastic anemia. Patients are to take Exjade once daily at least 30 minutes before meals, on the same time each day. A combination of 250 mg and 500 mg tablets may be used to provide a specific dose level. The duration of treatment in this study is 12 months. The investigator muct emphasize complaince and will instruct the patients to take the Exjade exactly as prescribe.</description>
