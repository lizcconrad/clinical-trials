  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are developing a test that is expected to measure the amount of radiation a
      patient has been exposed to after a nuclear bomb. The investigator will do this by measuring
      the DNA in the patients blood from cells killed by the radiation.

      Many diseases and medical conditions can put DNA in the blood. The investigator needs to know
      how much DNA in order to better interpret our radiation detection test. Therefore, the
      investigator is collecting blood from several patients with different diseases or medical
      conditions and also healthy volunteers to measure their DNA content.

      Patients that will be included in this study are pregnant women, patients who have suffered a
      pulmonary embolism within the past 48 hours, patients who have suffered from myocardial
      infarction in the past 48 hours, patients with autoimmune diseases and health patients.

      The investigator will collect 8 mL (one and one half teaspoons) of blood one time only. The
      investigator may also collect the patient's past medical history, test results and disease
      treatment.
