      This particular trial is looking to compare the effectiveness of two types of foot bed/ sole
      materials used within diabetic footwear.

      DiaBSmart as a project aims to generate, transfer and exchange the clinical, academic and
      production knowledge between the partners to create a new generation of diabetic footwear
      through a newly developed patient assessment system. The transfer of knowledge between
      various sectors ensures that the need of patients is considered and transferred effectively
      to product development using a scientific approach. The objectives include:(1) the design and
      development of an integrated system of DIABetic foot assessment (2) to validate the newly
      developed system using experimental methods (3) to develop a suitable material to meet the
      mechanical and clinical requirements (4) to evaluate the mechanical and clinical
      effectiveness of material choice in reducing the potential risk of foot complications. The
      Numerical, Experimental and Mathematical Analyses system will integrate all aspects of
      diabetic footwear including; clinical and biomechanical assessment, material choice and
      aesthetic design. Proposed interdisciplinary, inter-sectorial approach is unique and brings
      together the expertise from research institutions, industry and clinics. This project while
      enhancing the knowledge base in diabetic assessment; will have a clear impact on new product
      development leading to both clinical and economic benefits. The products include a new
      generation of integrated SMART /multi material midsoles and/or orthoses for diabetic
      footwear. Properties of the materials will be optimised with a view to minimise/ redistribute
      the pressure and hence the stress on the soft tissue in the critical plantar areas of the
      foot. Whilst significantly affecting the course of the disease, the products will aim to
      reduce the risk of limb loss in patients with diabetes, the most frequent cause of
      non-traumatic lower-limb amputations.
