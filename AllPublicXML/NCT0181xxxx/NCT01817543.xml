  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to demonstrate the effectiveness of complete wound healing in a
      prospective, open-label, cohort-controlled trial in which venous leg ulcers (VLU)n will be
      treated using AutoloGel and case-matched against a concurrent cohort of patients receiving
      undefined Usual and Customary Care (UCC)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recurrence of ulcers in the leg is common; two-thirds of patients are likely to experience
      recurring ulcers after the first ulcer. While treatment of the underlying venous disease,
      depending on the mode of treatment, can lower the recurrence rate in many patients, it does
      not affect recurrence. AutoloGel is a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel used in the treatment of
      non-healing chronic wounds. The aim of this trial is to demonstrate the effectiveness,
      measured as complete wound healing, in a prospective, open-label trial in which venous leg
      ulcers will be treated using AutoloGel and standard of care and case-matched against a
      concurrent cohort of patients receiving undefined Usual and Customary Care

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Medicare/Medicaid eligible

          2. ≥18 years of age

          3. Proven venous disease

          4. The largest non-healing wound, if multiple wounds are present, or the single wound to
             be treated (Index Ulcer) that is located between and including the knee and the ankle

          5. For subjects with potentially multiple eligible VLUs, the largest ulcer will be
             selected. There must be at least 4 cm between the Index Ulcer and other ulcers; if all
             ulcers are closer than 4 cm, the subject should not be enrolled (screen failure)

          6. Debrided ulcer size between 2 cm2 and 200 cm2

          7. Demonstrated adequate compression regimen

          8. Duration ≥ 1 month at first visit

          9. Subject must be willing to comply with the Protocol, which will be assessed by
             enrolling clinician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects known to be sensitive to AutoloGel components (calcium chloride, thrombin,
             ascorbic acid) and/or materials of bovine origin

          2. Presence of another wound that is concurrently treated and might interfere with
             treatment of index wound by AutoloGel

          3. Ulcer not of VLU pathophysiology (e.g., pure diabetic, vasculitic, radiation,
             rheumatoid, collagen vascular disease, pressure, or arterial etiology)

          4. Any malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer

          5. Subjects who are cognitively impaired and do not have a healthcare proxy

          6. Serum albumin of less than 2.5 g/dL

          7. Plasma Platelet count of less than 100 x 109/L

          8. Hemoglobin of less than 10.5 g/dL

          9. Subject has inadequate venous access for repeated blood draw required for AutoloGel
             Administration
