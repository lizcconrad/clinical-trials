  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous vasculitis due to vascular deposition of large circulating immune complexes is a
      disease frequently seen by general practitioners and dermatologists. The clinical symptom is
      palpable purpura with predilection for the lower legs.

      In some cases vasculitis also affects systemic organs, such as the kidneys and the intestine.

      When the immune complexes contain immunoglobulin class A (IgA) and when there is systemic
      involvement, the disease has been referred to as Henoch Schönlein purpura.

      When there are no signs of systemic involvement, the disease has been referred to as
      cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis.

      The investigators hypothesize that palpable purpura with predilection for lower legs is a
      pathognomonic clinical sign for immune complex vasculitis in both IgA vasculitis and
      IgA-negative vasculitis, but that only the presence of IgA in immune complexes is likely to
      be associated with systemic involvement and therefore warrants more extensive diagnostic
      procedures Vice versa the investigators postulate that the presence of IgG or IgM without IgA
      in immune complexes excludes systemic involvement The investigators also want to investigate
      to which of the 2 groups patients with palpable purpura and negative immunofluorescence
      should be assigned.
