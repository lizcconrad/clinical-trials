  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent pharmacotherapy research in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has successfully focused
      on treatment of co-occurring symptoms, including inattention, hyperactivity, and irritability
      that commonly occur in persons with ASD. Despite over two decades of significant
      pharmacotherapy research, to date no medication has been shown in controlled trials to
      enhance the core social deficits of ASD. Based upon findings describing the neurobiology of
      ASD combined with our preliminary results, we believe the novel drug acamprosate will show
      evidence of reducing social skills deficits associated with ASD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject with ASD will receive 10 weeks of blinded treatment with acamprosate or matching
      placebo. After completion of the double-blind phase, all subjects will have an opportunity to
      receive acamprosate as part of the study procedures for 16 weeks.

    <description>The subscales of the ABC including the Social Withdrawal subscale have proven to be reliable measure of symptoms and behaviors associated with ASD. Specifically, the ABC-SW has been validated as a measure of social impairment that differentiates the social behavior of persons with ASD from those developmental delay without a comorbid ASD diagnosis.</description>
