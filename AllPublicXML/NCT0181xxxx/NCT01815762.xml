    <textblock>
      Patients will be selected from the Dialisys Centers in Iasi, Romania. Patients will be
      randomized 1:1 to have a dry-weight assessment based on clinical (control) or lung US and
      bioimpedance (active) guided protocol. In the control group post-dialysis dry weight will be
      adjusted based on clinical criteria only (blood pressure, presence of edema, intradialytic
      hypotension, cramps etc.) and in the active group the target weight will be prescribed using
      lung US and bioimpedance evaluation.

      In patients randomized to the active arm of the study, the US B-line score (BLS) will be
      measured before dialysis and these measurements will be used to titrate ultrafiltration
      prescription. In patients presenting moderate to severe lung congestion (≥15 BLS
      pre-dialysis) LUS measurements will be repeated once a week until the treatment goal was
      achieved (&lt;15 BLS pre-dialysis) and once a month thereafter. The same (monthly) monitoring
      frequency will be adopted also in patients without pulmonary congestion at pre-dialysis
      baseline (&lt;15 BLS). Furthermore, the use of the technique is allowed whenever its application
      is deemed useful to assume clinical decisions by attending physicians. Patients in the active
      arm of the study without evidence of lung congestion at baseline who developed pulmonary
      congestion (≥ 15 BLS) during the trial will received the same treatment contemplated for
      those with lung congestion at baseline during the trial. The treatment goal will be pursued
      by ultrafiltration intensification realized within the same HD schedule (3 sessions x 4
      hours/week) or, if not tolerated, by extra-dialyses, according to individual tolerance and
      feasibility. In case of clinical hypovolemia (persistent cramps, hypotension etc) additional
      dry-weight adjustments will be performed according to the bioimpedance measurement, provided
      that the patients are below 15 BLS. This addition will be necessary in order to be able to
      increase the dry-weight in patients with a persistent BLS &lt; 15 and avoid under perfusion.

      Patients in the control arm of the study will be followed up and managed strictly with
      standard criteria according to current recommendations (implying optimization of fluids
      volume control on the basis of clinical criteria and the use of carvedilol, ACE
      inhibitors/sartans whenever deemed necessary); the use of lung US / bioimpedanc assistance
      will not be messured in these patients.

      The main exclusion criteria will be the presence of severe cardiac failure (NYHA class
      III-IV), past myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina and acute coronary syndrome.
      Due to bioimpedance assessment limitation patients with metallic joint prostheses, cardiac
      stent or pacemakers, decompensated cirrhosis, pregnancy and limb amputations will be
      excluded, as BIS cannot be accurately performed in such cases. Due to lung US measurement
      limitation we will exclude patients with known persistent pleurisy, pulmonary fibrosis or
      pneumectomy. Other exclusion criteria will be malignancy, active infections, temporary or
      permanent catheter as a vascular access, mental incompetence and unwillingness to participate
      in the study.
