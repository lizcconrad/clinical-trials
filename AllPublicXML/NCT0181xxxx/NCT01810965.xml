  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemochromatosis type 1 is one of the most frequent genetic disease since the genetic
      predisposition (homozygosity for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene) is encountered in about
      3/1000 white subjects (5/1000 in Brittany, France).

      For the half of these predisposed subjects, the phenotypic expression of the disease needs a
      treatment. This treatment is based upon repeated bloodletting which is generally considered
      as simple, safe and effective.

      Nevertheless, it is still questioned as regard its physiopathological justification and its
      clinical implications. Indeed, bloodletting could cause an increase of non-transferrin bound
      iron (NTBI) particularly for its reactive form called labile plasma iron (LPI) This adverse
      physiopathological effect could have clinical consequences and could be linked with articular
      consequences which can be aggravated by the treatment.

      Hemochromatosis type 1 is one of the most frequent genetic disease since the genetic
      predisposition (homozygosity for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene) is encountered in about
      3/1000 white subjects (5/1000 in Brittany, France).

      For the half of these predisposed subjects, the phenotypic expression of the disease needs a
      treatment. This treatment is based upon repeated bloodletting which is generally considered
      as simple, safe and effective.

      Nevertheless, it is still questioned as regard its physiopathological justification and its
      clinical implications. Indeed, bloodletting could cause an increase of non-transferrin bound
      iron (NTBI) particularly for its reactive form called labile plasma iron (LPI) This adverse
      physiopathological effect could have clinical consequences and could be linked with articular
      consequences which can be aggravated by the treatment.

      The primary objective is to explore the effect of bloodletting upon plasmatic concentrations
      of NTBI.

      The secondary objectives are to:

        -  explore the impact of bloodletting upon different parameters of iron metabolism and in
           particular LPI, hepcidinemia and markers of erythropoiesis ;

        -  explore basal and nycthemeral characteristics of new parameters of iron metabolism
           (hepcidin, NTBI, LPI) in hemochromatosis patients.

      The demonstration of an adverse effect of bloodletting upon iron metabolism would allow for a
      therapeutic innovation based upon an association of bloodletting and oral chelation during
      the induction treatment of type 1 hemochromatosis and, more generally in hepcidino deficient
      forms of hemochromatosis.
