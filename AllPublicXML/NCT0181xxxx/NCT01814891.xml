    <textblock>
      Determination of liver stores of vitamin A will be determined before and after consumption of
      high pro-vitamin A orange maize, compared to low provitamin A white maize.

    <textblock>
      This study will determine the change in total body stores of vitamin A in response to feeding
      orange maize for 90 days. This will be compared to two other groups of children that are fed
      white maize, one of which will get a vitamin A supplement at the estimated average
      requirement.
