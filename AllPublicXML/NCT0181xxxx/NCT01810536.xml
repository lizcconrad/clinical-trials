      Respiratory exacerbations are frequent among cystic fibrosis patients and supplemental oxygen
      is usually required. We will compare a new high flow nasal cannula system with Venturi masks
      for oxygen supplementation to patients with CF hospitalized for respiratory exacerbation.

      Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that leads to chronic lung infections
      and recurrent respiratory exacerbations. Supplemental oxygen is usually required during
      respiratory exacerbations. Recently, a new high flow nasal cannula system that provides flows
      up to 40l/min at 100% humidification was developed and tested in neonates and children,
      providing greater comfort to the patient. The main hypothesis of the study is that this
      method has advantages for oxygen supplementation to patients with CF hospitalized for
      respiratory exacerbation. Methods: 40 patients with CF aged 6 to 18 years will be randomized
      to receive supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula or Venturi masks during hospitalization for
      respiratory exacerbation. Main outcomes will be the duration of hospitalization and oxygen
      supplementation, viscosity and transportability of sputum and personal impressions of
      patients regarding the method of oxygen administration (questionnaire). Spirometry and venous
      blood gas analysis will be performed after the second hospital day, and sputum samples will
      be obtained in the first and third day of hospitalization. Clinical treatment (antibiotics,
      etc) will be defined by the medical team of the institution, not involved in the study.
      Expected Results: The use of high flow nasal cannula will result in significantly less time
      of supplemental oxygen, with increased comfort for patients, without significant differences
      in the levels of PaCO2. Sputum samples obtained from the patients treated with the high flow
      nasal cannula will have lower viscosity and higher transportability as compared to those
      obtained from patients treated with Venturi mask.
