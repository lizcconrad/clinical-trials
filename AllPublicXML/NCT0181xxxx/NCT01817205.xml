      The objective is to evaluate the safety and therapeutic effect of combined hyperthermia and
      TACE for unresectable HCC

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are diagnosed at an intermediate and
      advanced stage when the tumors become unresectable. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization
      (TACE) has been shown to be effective in prolongation of survival for patients with
      unresectable HCC and generally adopted as a standard palliative treatment option for patients
      with intermediate stage HCC. However, the therapeutic effect of TACE in terms of objective
      tumor response is variable and modest (27%-40%), indicating that there is actually much room
      for improvement in the treatment. In many cases, patients with intrahepatic HCC uncontrolled
      after TACE treatment may not be suitable for other treatment options because of their
      physical condition. For these patients, repeat TACE combined with adjuvant systemic
      hyperthermia may offer a chance of disease control.

    <description>Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is performed under local anesthesia with right femoral puncture. The feeding lobar hepatic artery is selectively catheterized for drug delivery.
Systemic hyperthermia is induced with an external energy source using microwave electromagnetic energy, with the patient lying supine on the treatment bed of the hyperthermia equipment, exposing the abdomen to the microwave transmitter.</description>
