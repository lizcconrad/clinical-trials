      This study will determine the efficacy of High Intensity Laser Therapy (HILT) for the
      treatment of elbow epicondylosis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosed patients with epicondylosis will be treated with HILTERAPIA HIRO 3.O for a
      total of four sessions during the entire duration of the treatment protocol. Parameters to be
      evaluated are tenderness, pain upon active resistive motion and DASH scores. After every
      treatment session of HILTERAPIA HIRO 3.O, these said parameters will be recorded initially on
      the first treatment, one week after the initial treatment, two weeks after the initial
      treatment and four weeks after the initial treatment. Patient is advised to follow-up on the
      6th and 12 month post initial HILTERAPIA HIRO 3.O treatment for the reevaluation of the
      parameters. Tenderness is described as pain upon palpation and is further categorized into,
      0= no tenderness, 1 = mild tenderness, 2 = tenderness evident on facial expression and 3 =
      patient screams upon palpation. Pain is also noted upon active resistive motion of
      extension/flexion, supination/pronation. Classification includes; 0 = no pain and 1 = mild
      pain with full power, 2 = severe pain with full power, and 3 = muscle weakness with pain. And
      for functional scoring will be using the DASH which is a multidimensional disease specific,
      brief, self-administered measure of symptoms and functional status among subjects with upper
      limb disorders. The DASH consists of a 30-item questionnaire with 5 response options for each
      item with a scale ranging from 0, which indicates &quot;least disability,&quot; to 100, which indicates
      &quot;most disability.&quot; A change in 12.7 DASH score points is considered to represent clinically
      significant functional improvement.

    <description>The DASH is intended to measure how much difficulty a subject has when performing common functional tasks and activities. The DASH consists of a 30-item questionnaire with 5 response options for each item with a scale ranging from 0, which indicates &quot;least disability,&quot; to 100, which indicates &quot;most disability.&quot; It incorporates questions related to functional limitations, symptoms, and psychosocial problems. The DASH has been well validated and has a smaller standard error of measurement and a validity comparable to that of joint-specific measures. A change in 12.7 DASH score points is considered to represent clinically significant functional improvement.</description>

    <description>High Intensity Laser Therapy (HILTERAPIA HIRO 3.O)will be used among diagnosed patients with elbow epicondylosis. A five minutes duration of HILTERAPIA HIRO 3.0 along the epicondyle area in a targeted manner will be use on the initial treatment, one week after the initial treatment, two weeks after the initial treatment and four weeks after the initial treatment thereafter.</description>

    <description>High-intensity laser therapy (HILT), which involves higher-intensity laser radiation and which causes minor and slow light absorption by chromophores. This absorption is obtained not with concentrated light but with diffuse light in all directions (the scattering phenomenon), increasing the mitochondrial oxidative reaction and adenosine triphosphate, RNA, or DNA production (photochemistry effects) and resulting in the phenomenon of tissue stimulation called photobiology.</description>
