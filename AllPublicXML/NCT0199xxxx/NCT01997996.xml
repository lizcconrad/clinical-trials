  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transvaginal meshes (TVM) are indicated for the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse (POP)
      where surgical intervention is necessary. Due to a potential risk of de novo dyspareunia, TVM
      are mainly used in postmenopausal women and in case of recurrent POP. PROLIFT+M (Trademark)
      is based on a highly flexible material which is partially absorbable. We suggest that
      PROLIFT+M has less impact on the vita sexualis than conventional TVM and could also be used
      for the treatment of younger and/or sexually active women. This study observes women who are
      routinely treated with PROLIFT+M with regard to their sexual function before and after the
      surgery. The hypothesis is that there is no worsening in vita sexualis with PROLIFT+M.

(Facial expressions are put above the line to express satisfaction visually). In addition, the following two questions are asked: &quot;Would you have the operation done again?&quot; and &quot;In the past 12 months how would you rate your condition as opposed to before your recent pelvic floor operation: much better/a little better/about the same/a little worse/much worse&quot; (PGI question).</description>
