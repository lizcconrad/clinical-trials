  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies highlight the insufficiency of blood pressure control in treated
      hypertensive population [1].

      As shown in the MONICA study, increased cardiovascular mortality is found in Alsace compared
      to other french regions. The incidence and prevalence of diabetes and obesity are likely
      explanatory factors leading to this excess mortality [2].

      Furthermore, the incidence and prevalence of alsacian patients with end-stage renal failure
      (ESRD) is also higher than the national average. The high prevalence of diabetes,
      hypertension and obesity in this population is also probably responsible for the high
      prevalence of ESRD [3].

      Opportunities to prevent the progression of kidney disease involve an optimal control of
      treatable evolutionary factors.

      Beyond control of diabetes and obesity, optimization of blood pressure control are an
      important factor to consider, as national and international guidelines recommend lower blood
      pressure targets in this population [4]. Knowledge of the disease and treatment goals are a
      key component of hypertensive patient management. Studies have shown that the knowledge of
      hypertensive disease and therapeutic targets were correlated with treatment compliance and
      with the rate of blood pressure control [5]. Patient education and participation of
      non-medical actors (nurses, pharmacists, …) are likely to improve the management and
      treatment compliance of these patients [6]. To our knowledge, no investigation has been
      performed in our region to determine the epidemiological characteristics, the knowledge level
      and blood pressure control in the population of hypertensive patients. The main objectives of
      this observational study are to evaluate, in a treated hypertensive population:

      the knowledge level of the blood pressure treatment goals, the impact of patient knowledge on
      this blood pressure control, the potential impact of the patient's comorbidities on his blood
      pressure control.

      Such a study should provide the basis for the feasibility of a large survey.
