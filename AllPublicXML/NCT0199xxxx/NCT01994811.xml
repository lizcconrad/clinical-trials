      The Eastern Caribbean Health Outcomes Research Network (ECHORN) is a collaborative research
      study that examines the lifestyles, eating habits, and health behaviors associated with
      cancer, diabetes and heart disease in adult men and women living in the Eastern Caribbean.

      The Eastern Caribbean Health Outcomes Research Network (ECHORN) has two aims: (1) To form a
      research collaborative across the Eastern Caribbean islands of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin
      Islands, Barbados, and Trinidad &amp; Tobago to recruit and follow a community-dwelling adult
      cohort to estimate the prevalence of known and potential risk factors associated with the
      development of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes and (2) To enhance health outcomes
      research leadership capacity in the region through a series of dedicated activities locally
      and abroad. ECHORN will expand clinical research with racial/ethnic minority populations in a
      transitioning part of the globe now threatened with an epidemic of noncommunicable chronic
      diseases (NCD). ECHORN's findings will have direct implications for the health disparities
      research and policy agenda in the mainland United States. In the long term, the links ECHORN
      will facilitate with local health policy delegations and global strategic organizational
      partners will promote the translation of research to improve health outcomes across the
      region. The collection and storage of biological specimens will also contribute to national
      biomonitoring projects and has the potential to identify unique risk and protective factors
      in the development of NCD.

        We plan to enroll and follow a community-based sample of the 4 ECHORN sites combined (total
        n = 4,400). We seek to populate the cohort to roughly approximate the populations of the
        participating sites and deliberately oversample from Barbados and the U.S.Virgin
        Islands(USVI) to maximize sample heterogeneity along race/ethnicity/culture. Puerto Rico
        residents will comprise 40% of the cohort (n=1760 total), Trinidad and Tobago residents at
        30% (n=1320 total), Barbados residents at 20% (n =880) and the USVI at 10% (n=440).

    <ipd_description>A Data Access and Scientific Review Committee (DASR), was been established to oversee requests for research collaboration (e.g. ancillary studies, secondary data analyses, etc.) to ensure they are within the scope of ECHORN's research mandate. Per the ECHORN Data Access Policy, data from ECHORN's research studies will be available to only internal ECHORN researchers for up to 3 years post data collection completion. Following that period, de-identified, limited ECHORN datasets will be made available for public access.</ipd_description>
