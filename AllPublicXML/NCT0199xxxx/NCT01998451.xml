  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We found a new Double sphincter which located in the neck of gallbladder，we supposed it may
      be related to control pressure of bile duct.Its formation is related to genetic factors.

      To contrast the recurrence rate of gallstones between patients with gallbladder double
      sphincter and patients with general gallbladder sphincter who underwent the treatment of
      cholecystolithiasis by minimally invasive cholecystolithotomy with gallbladder reservation.
      Method:Patients with gallbladder double sphincter and patients with general gallbladder
      sphincter who underwent the treatment of cholecystolithiasis by minimally invasive
      cholecystolithotomy with gallbladder reservation in The Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang
      Medical College from May 2012 to December 2015. We collect these patients' bile during
      surgery.Patients with gallbladder double sphincter as trial group, patients with general
      gallbladder sphincter as control group.the overall follow-up period is 3 years. Then the
      investigators statistically analyze improvement of cholecystolithiasis symptoms, thickness of
      gall bladder wall, the gallbladder function and the rate of the recurrence of cholesterol
      gallstone in 2 groups.we also analysis of the genetic differences from bile between two
      groups.
