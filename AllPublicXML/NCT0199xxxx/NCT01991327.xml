      The primary objective of this study is to assess the drug-drug interactions of Androxal with
      cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 in healthy
      male subjects administered 25 mg Androxal once daily for 3 days. Secondly, the safety and
      tolerability of Androxal will be determined in healthy male subjects administered Androxal 25
      mg daily for 3 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Speak, read, and understand English or Spanish and is willing and able to provide

          -  All laboratory tests either within the normal range or assessed as not clinically
             significant by the Principal Investigator. Any clinically significant deviations
             outside of the normal range in the opinion of the Principal Investigator will require
             sponsor approval. A negative hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody or HIV
             antibody test result within the previous 3 months may be used instead of obtaining a
             screening laboratory sample for these laboratory tests;

          -  Ability to complete the study in accordance with the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to Clomid;

          -  A clinically significant laboratory abnormality or other clinical findings indicative
             of a clinically significant exclusionary disease including hepatic insufficiency,
             renal insufficiency, unstable coronary artery disease, malignancy other than basal
             cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or stroke;

          -  A positive hepatitis screen including hepatitis surface B antigen (HBsAg) and
             hepatitis C antibody;

          -  A positive test result for HIV;

          -  Positive results from a urine screen for substances of abuse;

          -  A recent history of alcoholism (&lt; 2 years) or of moderate alcohol use (greater than an
             average of 3 drinks per day or a total of 21 drinks per week) or use of alcohol within
             24 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication;

          -  Use of any recreational drugs within the past year or a previous history of drug
             abuse;

          -  Use of an investigational drug or product, or participation in a drug research study
             within 30 days prior to receiving study medication;

          -  A clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality;

          -  A history of difficulty with phlebotomy;

          -  Donation of blood (1 pint or more) within 30 days, or plasma within 7 days prior to

             medication;

             to receiving study medication; Use of dietary or herbal supplements 14 days prior to
             study or megavitamin supplements within 48 hours prior to receiving study medication;

          -  Consumption of any caffeine containing foods or beverages within 48 hours prior to
             receiving study medication;

          -  Consumption of any grapefruit or grapefruit-containing juices, vegetables from the
             mustard green family, and charbroiled meat within 72 hours prior to receiving study

          -  Current smoker or user of any tobacco products that has smoked in last 30 or 60 days;

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, could interfere
             with the subject's ability to provide informed consent, comply with study
             instructions, possibly confound interpretation of study results, or endanger the
             subject if he took part in the study;

          -  Classified as a cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2D6 (CYP2D6) &quot;poor metabolizer&quot; as
             determined by genotyping at the screening visit

          -  Use of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) Inhibitor in the previous 28 days prior to dose.

          -  Concurrent use of cimetidine, levodopa, amantadine, other antipsychotics or
