    <textblock>
      This study explores the effectiveness of chiropractic and neuromuscular reeducation as
      complementary and alternative medicine treatment approaches for autism. Our investigation
      maintains the following three hypotheses:

        1. Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) will reduce the presentation of autistic symptoms in
           children.

        2. Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) in conjunction with neuromuscular reeducation will
           reduce the presentation of autistic symptoms in children.

        3. The presentation of autistic symptoms in children will significantly differ between the
           treatment groups of spinal manipulative therapy and spinal manipulative therapy in
           unification with neuromuscular reeducation.

      We aim to describe and illustrate the roles of spinal manipulative therapy and neuromuscular
      reeducation in autistic children at a CAM university health center with regard to the
      following:

        1. To measure the safety and efficacy of spinal manipulative therapy for the autism
           spectrum disorders

        2. To measure the safety and efficacy of spinal manipulative therapy and neuromuscular
           reeducation for the treatment of the autism spectrum disorders

        3. To begin to establish or debunk debated SMT treatment for autism

        4. To evaluate, gauge, and improve current autism assessment tools by exploring face
           validity of the measures as indicated by ongoing data collection

    <description>Spinal manipulation is a therapeutic intervention performed on spinal articulations which are synovial joints. These articulations in the spine that are amenable to spinal manipulative therapy include the z-joints, the atlanto-occipital, atlanto-axial, lumbosacral, sacroiliac, costotransverse and costovertebral joints.
A neuromuscular re-education program will consist of repetitive movements, posturing, and stimulation designed to reinforce nerve signals for functional movements. It is theorized that when the nerve signals are &quot;retrained&quot; and appropriate muscle movements are repeated, movement patterns become automatic again. Neuromuscular re-education is usually done along with other types of treatment to promote functional muscle movement.</description>

    <description>Neuromuscular reeducation is a general term that refers to techniques that attempt to retrain the neuromuscular system to function properly. The basis of this idea is that the formation of certain patterns of communication between muscles and nerves allow people to perform simple everyday acts such as climbing stairs.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children diagnosed by a physician with an Autism Spectrum Disorder between the ages of
             5 and 15

          -  Children with parents able to bring their child to the university health center two
             times a week for 12 weeks

          -  Children assessed to have a level of functioning that is conducive to experiencing and
             undergoing chiropractic treatment at the university health center.

          -  Children without the presentation and diagnosis of comorbidity

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with comorbidity or multiple diagnoses (mental retardation, chromosomal
             disorders)

          -  Children undergoing another treatment for their disorder, other than a form of
             behavioral therapy (ABA or DTT) by a trained or licensed mental health professional.

          -  Children taking medication that is not deemed to be stabilized by a primary care
             physician, including medication dosages that is likely to be shifted and changed
             during the 12 weeks of treatment in this investigation.

          -  Children assessed to have severe behavioral impediments not conducive to chiropractic
             treatment at the university health center.
