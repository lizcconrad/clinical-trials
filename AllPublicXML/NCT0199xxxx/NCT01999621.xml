  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will evaluate determinants of the patients' care type : palliative, medical or
      intensive care. The place of patient or family on care's decision will be noticed.
      Investigators will evaluate 3 month-survival and patients' feelings (visit with a
      psychologist) according to type of care they benefited.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two hundred patients have to be enrolled in 2 years in the Grenoble Teaching Hospital and in
      the Saint Louis hospital in Paris between November 2010 and November 2012. Each lung cancer
      patient with at least one organ failure, admitted in emergency, thoracic oncology or directly
      in ICU will be included.

      The objectives are to identify patients' characteristics associated with proposition for
      intensive care unit admission and those associated with the decision of intensive care unit
      admission.
