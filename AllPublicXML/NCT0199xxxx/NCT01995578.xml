  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if 5'-Azacitidine will help to lower the risk of the
      disease coming back after a stem cell transplant in patients with MDS and AML. This study
      will also be looking at the side effects of this medicine.

      5'-Azacitidine is an FDA approved drug for treatment of MDS and AML, as well as patients
      whose disease came back after transplant, where it helped going into remission. It is unclear
      if 5'-Azacitidine can prevent the disease from coming back after transplant. This study will
      help show if getting 5'-Azacitidine soon after transplant can lower the risk of your disease
      coming back.

    <description>Relapse of MDS or AML will be analyzed as to type and genetic origin of the leukemic cells. These will be defined by morphologic and/or cytogenetic criteria: an increasing number of blasts in the marrow over 5%, by presence of circulating blasts, or by presence of blasts in any extramedullary site as well as presence of previous cytogenetic abnormalities. Other studies assessing for MRD, FACS and FISH assays will be evaluated but would not be considered disease relapse if positive since they are experimental.</description>

    <description>This is a single arm phase II trial to assess the efficacy and confirm the safety of maintenance therapy with 5'-azacitadine compared to historical control after TCD allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant for patients with MDS and AML who are at high risk of relapse.</description>

    <description>5'-azacitadine will be given at a low dose of 32mg/m2 S.C for 5 days every 28 days (a cycle). Dose de-escalation will be permitted for hematologic and non- hematologic toxicities. Patients will start taking the study drug between days 60-120 post TCD allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and up to a year post-transplant or until there is a toxicity that requires cessation of therapy. Therefore patients will get between 8-10 cycles. Patients who come off-study for reasons unrelated to toxicities before completing 4 cycles will be replaced Since most cases of relapse occur early post transplant, in the first year, this is the most appropriate time to intervene. Treatment will start as soon as possible.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients who have undergone T cell depleted allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
        transplantation at MSKCC for:

          -  De novo myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS): IPSS-1 with poor risk cytogenetics or higher
             IPSS.

          -  Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in first remission that required more than 1 cycle of
             treatment to achieve remission or with the following cytogenetic abnormalities: FLT3
             mutation, deletion/monosomy of chromosome 5 or 7, MLL gene rearrangement, or more than
             or equal to 3 cytogenetics abnormalities. Also patients in second or greater
             remission.

          -  Patients with Secondary MDS/AML.

          -  Patients will be considered eligible for the study if after transplant they achieved
             hematologic (&lt;5% blasts) and cytogenetic remission.

          -  Patients will be eligible to enter the study between 60-120 days post transplant.

          -  Age: pediatrics and adults patients - 1 year old-75 years old.

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt;=60% for patients &gt;16yo and Lansky performance status
             &gt;=60% for patients â‰¤16yo

          -  Stable blood counts (ANC&gt;1000/uL, Hb&gt;8gr/dL, Plt&gt;50,000/ uL) not supported by
             transfusions.

          -  Renal: Serum creatinine &lt;1.5 ULN

          -  Hepatic: &lt;3xULN ALT and &lt;1.5 total serum bilirubin, unless there is congenital benign
             hyperbilirubinemia.

          -  Cardiac: Adequate cardiac function measured by LVEF&gt;50%. If asymptomatic,
             pretransplant echocardiogram is adequate. If symptomatic, echocardiogram needs to be
             repeated.

          -  Each patient must be willing to participate as a research subject and must sign an
             informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be excluded from the trial if at time of enrollment:

          -  Active uncontrolled bacterial, fungal or viral infection.

          -  Evidence of uncontrolled graft-versus-host disease.

          -  Pulmonary: new onset hypoxia

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to 5'-azacitadine or mannitol.

               -  Evidence of residual disease either by increased blasts count (&gt;5%) or
                  persistence of previous known cytogenetics abnormalities.

          -  Peripheral blood neutrophil chimerism: less than 95% donor.
