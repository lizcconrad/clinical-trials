  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is an important lifestyle modification for individuals with high blood
      pressure. It is part of national cardiac care guidelines for hypertension management that
      recommends, along with prescribing medication, lifestyle modification be promoted for
      improved dietary intake, and participation in about 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.
      Native Hawaiians and other Pacific peoples (NHPP) have among the highest risk for the heart
      disease, with mortality rates twice other ethnic groups. In many minority populations,
      including NHPP, hypertension develops at an early age, is more severe and is less likely to
      be controlled. Despite the ability of physical activity to reduce blood pressure, the
      majority of U.S. population, do not meet physical activity recommendations and new
      interventions that can improve accessibility and adherence, particularly among at-risk
      minority populations are needed.

      In this research, Hypertension and Hula: Ola Hou Pilot Study, we plan to evaluate a
      culturally relevant intervention that uses hula and is consistent with the goals of
      recommended physical activity for improved lifestyle - moderate-intensity, prolonged physical
      activity cumulatively at about 150 minutes per week. Hula, the traditional dance form of
      Native Hawaiians, is commonly practiced in Hawai'i as a cultural practice, form of creative
      expression, and exercise that is structured on controlled, rhythmic movements. Combining
      aspects of meditation, music, self-awareness with low-impact aerobic exercise, traditional
      hula may be particularly suitable to individuals with limited mobility and fitness and within
      the recommended paradigm for exercise training and secondary prevention of coronary artery
      disease (CAD). We anticipate a hula and heart health education program will be particularly
      appealing to Native Hawaiians and other Pacific people (NHPP) including Pacific Islanders and
      Filipino who suffer from a significant disparity in cardiovascular health.

      Specifically, we will determine if individuals with poorly managed hypertension and
      randomized to a 12-week hula and heart health education intervention will demonstrate better
      blood pressure levels, functional capacity, and exercise tolerance (6-minute walk test) than
      individuals randomized to a usual care group. We will also assess if the individuals in the
      hula intervention report better health-related quality of life, stress management,
      perceptions of discrimination, and exercise self efficacy.
