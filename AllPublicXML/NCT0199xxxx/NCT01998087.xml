  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Croatia, between 95% and 99% of mothers initiate breastfeeding, but by 3 months a third
      have stopped, and by six months only half are still providing any human milk for their
      babies. Exclusive breastfeeding rates are even lower, with only about 9% of Croatian mothers
      exclusively breastfeeding at 6 months, despite the WHO recommendation of 6 months of
      exclusive breastfeeding. Currently, in Croatia, no breastfeeding information or other
      pregnancy and parenting related written information is routinely provided to expectant
      couples. In our study we would like to find out whether providing written breastfeeding
      information in pregnancy and breastfeeding focused support phone calls during pregnancy and
      after the birth of the baby result in better outcomes than providing general
      pregnancy/parenting information and support phone calls. This will be tested by randomising
      women, attending their primary health care provider for routine antenatal visits between 20
      and 32 weeks, to an intervention focused on promoting and supporting breastfeeding, to an
      intervention focused on general pregnancy and parenting issues, and to a non-intervention
      control group. Women will be followed-up for 6 months after the birth of their baby and data
      will be collected at 3 and 6 months on breastfeeding rates, breastfeeding self-efficacy,
      breastfeeding difficulties, social support and attitudes toward infant feeding.
