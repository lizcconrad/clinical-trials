  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise has been found to be effective in alleviating back and neck pain. Two exercise
      methods which are available in the community in a group format are Yoga and Pilates. While
      there is some research on the efficacy of these exercise methods for low back pain, there is
      no definitive research on the use of Yoga or Pilates group exercise for individuals with
      chronic cervical pain.This study investigated the effect of group Yoga and Pilates exercise
      compared to a wait-listed control group on impairments and function related to neck pain for
      individuals with chronic cervical pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals reporting chronic mild to moderate neck pain for more than 3 months were assigned
      to a pilates, yoga or wait-listed control group. The exercise group consisted of 12 one hour
      small group sessions instructed by experienced Physical Therapists with additional yoga or
      pilates training. Participants were evaluated at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Exercise
      participants also completed a follow up 6 weeks after completion.
