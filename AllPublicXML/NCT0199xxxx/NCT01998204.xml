    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. The
      investigators clinical experience showed a trend of delayed emergence among patients
      undergoing deep brain stimulator (DBS) implantation and pulse generator placement under
      general anesthesia. Abnormal pharmacodynamics might be present among these patients, which
      had never been investigated.
