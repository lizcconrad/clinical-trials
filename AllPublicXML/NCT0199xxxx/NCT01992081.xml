    <textblock>
      This study will test two instruments to measure physical activity in COPD patients: A
      questionnaire and two small physical activity monitors .Patients will be randomized to either
      receive the telecoaching program in addition to usual care or only the usual care. Study will
      include around 510 patients in 5 countries in Europe.

    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) has a negative influence on physical activity
      hence it may be beneficial for patients to increase physical activity levels. This study will
      test two instruments to measure physical activity: A questionnaire (completed on a personal
      digital assistant) and a physical activity monitor which patient wear during the day.
      Patients will be randomized to either receive the Telecoaching program in addition to usual
      care or only the usual care. The study will involve 4 clinic visits as well as some phone
      calls over duration of 6 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent

          -  Male and female patients ≥ 40 years of age

          -  Diagnosis of COPD (GOLD criterion: post bronchodilator FEV1/FVC&lt; 70%)

          -  Current or ex-smokers with a smoking history equivalent to at least 10 pack years (1
             pack year = 20 cigarettes smoked per day for 1 year)

          -  Patients should have at least 4 days of physical activity data recorded via activity
             monitor during 7 days prior to visit 101.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients fulfilling any of the following criteria are not eligible for inclusion in this
        study.

          -  Orthopedic, neurological or other complaints that significantly impair normal
             biomechanical movement patterns, as judged by the investigator. Specifically if the
             patients' condition/ co-morbidities are such that physical activity cannot be
             increased.

          -  Respiratory diseases other than COPD (e.g. asthma)

          -  Cognitive reading impairment and/or difficulties to manage electronic devices
             precluding interaction with the health base and PDA, as judged by the investigator

          -  Participating in or scheduled to start a rehabilitation program during the study. If
             the patient wishes to participate in pulmonary rehabilitation for any reason the
             patient can be enrolled in the study only at the end of rehabilitation.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who have the intention to become pregnant during the
             course of the study and pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is
             defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of
             gestation, confirmed by a positive β-hCG laboratory test.
