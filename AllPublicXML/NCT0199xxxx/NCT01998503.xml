  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial is studying the side effects and how well giving induction
      therapy with bortezomib and dexamethasone followed by autologous stem cell transplantation
      (ASCT) compared with ASCT alone in treating patients with newly diagnosed renal AL
      amyloidosis. In this prospective, randomized control study, patients with newly diagnosed AL
      amyloidosis who met the criteria for ASCT were randomized to receive 2 cycles of BD as
      induction therapy followed by ASCT (BD+ASCT) (arm 1) or to receive ASCT alone as an initial
      treatment (arm 2). Hematologic and organ responses were evaluated every 3 months after ASCT.
      All the patients should be followed up for 12 months.

    <textblock>
      Arm 1: The BD regimen included bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 i.v. and dexamethasone 40 mg p.o. on days
      1, 4, 8 and 11 of the 21 day cycle. This process was repeated for 2 cycles. After two cycles
      of BD therapy, the collection of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) should be completed
      within 4 weeks. Recommended dose of drug is as follows: granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
      (G-CSF) 5-10ug/kg on days 1-5 will be given, then peripheral blood stem cells will be
      collected on days 5-6 for 2Ã—10^6 CD34+ cells /kg. Patients will receive ASCT therapy in 8
      weeks after collection of PBSC (Recorded as day 0), while melphalan (day -2) with a dose of
      140 or 200 mg/m2 (choosing a dose according to the degree of risk for patients). Melphalan
      will be administered by central venous catheter.

      Arm 2: the patients who assigned to arm 2 will receive ASCT alone as an initial treatment.
      The process of ASCT is as same as arm 1.

    <description>The BD regimen included bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 i.v. and dexamethasone 40 mg p.o. on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of the 21 day cycle. This process was repeated for 2 cycles. After two cycles of BD therapy, the collection of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) should be completed within 4 weeks. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) on days 1 to 5 and undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) collection. Patients will receive ASCT therapy in 8 weeks after collection of PBSC (Recorded as day 0), while melphalan (day -2) with a dose of 140 or 200 mg/m2 (choosing a dose according to the degree of risk for patients).
