      Evaluate the feasibility of using FDOPA-PET/MRI pediatric patients with CNS tumors. Positive
      results in this small study would provide the data needed to expand the study to validate the
      use in a larger population of pediatric patients. Validating the use of FDOPA-PET imaging as
      an early predictor for response to anti-angiogenic therapy could greatly impact the standard
      of care for treating and evaluating pediatric brain tumors and provide a useful biomarker for
      assessing experimental therapeutics.

          -  Urine protein should be screened by dipstick analysis. If protein ≥ 2+ on dipstick,

             24-hour urine protein should be obtained and the level should be &lt;1000 mg/24 hours for
             patient enrollment.

        Note: UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation of the 24 hour urine protein excretion- a
        UPC ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a 24-hour urine protein of 1 gm. UPC ratio is
        calculated using of the following formulae:

        [urine protein]/[urine creatinine] - if both protein and creatinine are reported in mg/dL
        [(urine protein x 0.088]/[urine creatinine] - if urine creatinine is reported in mmol/L

          -  Patients with a seizure disorder are eligible if well-controlled on anticonvulsants.
             If on a non-enzyme inducing anticonvulsant, the irinotecan dose will be adjusted as
