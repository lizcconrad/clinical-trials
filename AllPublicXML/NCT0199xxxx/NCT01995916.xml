  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been funded by National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to compare two
      behavioral interventions for Menstrual Mood Disorders, including premenstrual dysphoric
      disorder (PMDD). Both of these interventions will be run in a group format, meaning that you
      will be part of a group of other women who have a menstrual mood disorder. Both of these
      interventions will be run by experienced mental health professionals and both interventions
      have been shown to be effective in reducing mood symptoms, increasing a sense of well-being,
      and helping individuals cope with stress. While it is expected that both interventions to be
      associated with some benefit, this study is designed to see which is better for women with a
      menstrual mood disorder.
