  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extramural venous invasion (EMVI) is the spread of microscopic tumour cells into the veins
      around the tumour. Rectal cancer treatment has improved greatly over recent years. However,
      it is important for us to learn as much about the tumours as possible in order to develop
      newer therapies. Current treatments may benefit from new genetic information relating to the
      cancer. We hope to identify genetic differences in certain types of rectal cancer which will
      allow future treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is widely accepted as beneficial to selected patients in
      terms of decreased risk of local recurrence and overall survival. Current management of
      rectal cancer involves risk stratification through pre-operative staging leading to
      formulation of treatment strategy. Very little is known about the long-term outcomes and
      response to CRT on MRI detected extramural venous invasion (mrEMVI). Although mrEMVI is
      accepted as a marker of poor prognosis, whether it has a predictive value and should be
      specifically treated is not known.

      Molecular and genetic profiling provides us with an opportunity to understand the underlying
      mechanisms which govern clinical behaviour in rectal cancer. Using high-throughput technology
      such as tissue microarray analysis allows large-scale analysis of specimens in a relatively
      short amount of time. It offers the ability to compare the molecular profiles of different
      subtypes of rectal cancer such as mrEMVI-positive and -negative tumours and whether any
      changes are observed following CRT. This can then be correlated with clinical behaviour over
      the medium and long-term with regards to local recurrence, distant metastases and overall
      survival.

      This study will identify important differences between key rectal cancer tumour subtypes.
      Identification of reliable pathological markers of EMVI pathways (from both the primary
      tumour sample, but more importantly from the pre-operative biopsies) has real potential for
      taking us a step closer to more personalised management of rectal cancer by establishing
      prognostic biomarkers reflective of disease type, but also through the underlying biology
      that may be highlighted (with its promise of therapeutic translation).

      Histopathology samples taken after rectal tumour removal surgery will be analysed using
      micrarray techniques. The pathological tissue microarrays (TMAs) will be generated using the
      Alphelys Tissue Arrayer MinicoreÂ®3 system. Markers that will be evaluated will be initially
      directed at epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) transition pathways, as our preliminary studies
      suggest that this phylogenetically conserved molecular program has important roles in tumour
      dissemination and resistance to conventional chemotherapy.
