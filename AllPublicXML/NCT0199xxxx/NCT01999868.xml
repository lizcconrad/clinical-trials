  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of ustekinumab, followed by abatacept,
      will prevent relapse in people with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic immune disease of the skin and joints that affects about 2% of the
      population. The most common form of psoriasis is plaque psoriasis, also called psoriasis
      vulgaris. A variety of drugs, including biologics, are available for treatment of moderate to
      severe psoriasis. When biologic agents are stopped, psoriasis can return (relapse) and often
      requires the biologic to be restarted and continued. No treatment program has been identified
      to prevent relapse of psoriasis.

      The study design has a lead-in period of weight-based ustekinumab treatment, with all
      participants receiving either 45 mg ustekinumab (&lt;= 100 kg) or 90 mg ustekinumab (&gt; 100 kg)
      administered subcutaneously at weeks 0 and 4. At week 12, participants will be assessed for a
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 response to ustekinumab. Participants who do not
      achieve a PASI 75 score will be discontinued from the investigation and permitted to seek
      standard therapy.

    <description>Ustekinumab interferes with the actions of proteins, interleukin 12 (IL12) and interleukin 23 (IL23), which reduces inflammation (swelling) in the skin. Stelara™ is the trade name for ustekinumab and is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat psoriasis.
Dose:
Participants who weigh &lt;= 100 kg at study entry will receive 45 mg of ustekinumab.
Participants who weigh &gt; 100 kg at study entry will receive 90 mg of ustekinumab.</description>
