      Background: Kinesiotaping (KT) is an elastic therapeutic tape developed in the 70's by Dr
      Kenso Kase for prevention and treatment of sports injuries. Research shows that through
      activation of skin receptors KT improves blood and lymph flow, increases proprioception,
      helps relieve pain, facilitates joint and muscle alignment, and enhances muscle function.
      Despite the increasing popularity of KT, uncertainty remains regarding, in particular, its
      effectiveness in improving strength.

      Purpose: The purpose of the current study was to investigate the short-term effects of KT on
      muscle strength when applied to the quadriceps muscles of healthy subjects.

      Methods: A randomized controlled trial with 52 healthy subjects was conducted. Subjects were
      tested under four different conditions: a) facilitating Kinesiotape, b) inhibiting
      Kinesiotape, c) classical tape with no elastic properties, and d) no-taping across four
      different sessions. The parameters of interest were: quadriceps and hamstrings maximal
      strength and power using vertical jump tests (squat jump and countermovement jump), and peak
      concentric and eccentric knee torque (using isokinetic test protocol).
