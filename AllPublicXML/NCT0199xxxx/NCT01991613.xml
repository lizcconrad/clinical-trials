  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that premature infants who receive their mothers' expressed breast milk
      supplemented with liquid protein early in their hospitalization will have a growth velocity
      in the first 28 days of life that is 20% greater than the growth velocity of premature
      infants that do not receive protein fortification.
