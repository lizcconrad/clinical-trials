  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators research project is a randomized, controlled, single-blinded, feasibility
      pilot study. The investigators will study the feasibility of a novel treatment for women with
      Provoked Localized Vulvodynia (PLV) with acupuncture and 5% lidocaine cream. Lidocaine is a
      numbing agent and common first treatment for this disorder. Acupuncture is a treatment
      commonly used for other pain disorders. The investigators will compare two types of
      acupuncture (classical and non-classical) as a treatment for PLV, in addition to 5% lidocaine
      cream. Researchers want to determine if acupuncture is acceptable and convenient to women
      with PLV. The investigators hypothesize that classical acupuncture and 5% lidocaine cream
      will be better than non-classical acupuncture and 5% lidocaine cream to decrease PLV pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, single-blinded, pilot trial to study the feasibility and
      acceptability of acupuncture and 5% lidocaine. Patients will be recruited from the patient
      population of the Oregon Health &amp; Science University Vulvar Health Clinic. Thirty (30)
      patients with PLV will be enrolled as study participants into the study. Fifteen (15) will be
      allocated in the treatment (classical) acupuncture + 5% lidocaine group and fifteen (15) will
      be allocated in the control (non-classical) acupuncture + 5% lidocaine group via a computer
      generated randomization program to balance allocation based on four variables: pain
      intensity, smoking status, body mass index, and pain duration.

      The acupuncturist will interview each patient and perform an exam of the pulse and tongue. A
      standardized acupuncture treatment will be assigned, and both groups will receive 18
      acupuncture treatments that follow a standardized protocol on classical or non-classical
      acupuncture points, with or without mild electrical stimulation. All study participants will
      self-apply lidocaine cream to their genital region four times daily during the study.

    <description>Secondary outcome variable will compare the &quot;Cotton Swab Test&quot; with a blinded assessor reported pain at three timepoints. 1) change in reported pain at (mean at Weeks -2, -1, 0, and 1) to the reported pain (mean at Weeks 12 and 13; 2) change in reported pain (means Weeks -2, -1, 0, and 1) to the reported pain (mean at Week 24); 3) change in reported pain (mean at Week 12) to (mean at Week 24).
Vestibular tenderness will be assessed by light touch with a cotton swab by a blinded assessor to the study participant's: 1) vestibule (cotton swab test) at four defined points (1:00, 5:00, 7:00, and 11:00); 2) the perineum; 3) labia majora (2:00 and 8:00), and 4) labia minora (4:00 and 10:00). Tenderness at each location will be rated by the Study Participant on a 10-point scale (0 indicating no pain, 10 indicating worst possible pain).</description>
