  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of HQ® Matrix Medical
      Wound Dressing for repair of donor site wounds. Half of participants will receive HQ® Matrix
      Medical Wound Dressing, while the other half will receive Sidaiyi® wound dressing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HQ® Matrix Medical Wound Dressing is a transparent, non-porous, pliable, gas-permeable, and
      waterproof film dressing which is comprised of silk fibroin protein of the Bombyx mori (B.
      mori) silkworm. It is intended to provide a moist, gas-permeable and sterile environment to
      facilitate the normal wound healing process. It is used in the management of non-infected
      skin defects and various dermal wounds.

      Sidaiyi® wound dressing (Suzhou Soho Biomaterial Science and Technology Co., Ltd, Suzhou,
      China) is a CFDA approved (Su2012-2640182), silk fibroin-based, two-layered spongy dressing.
      Upon the silk fibroin spongy dressing layer is a membrane made of medical silicone. It is
      used in the management of partial- and full-thickness wounds, donor site wounds and burns.
      Currently, it is the sole silk fibroin biomaterial for wound healing that has received
      regulatory approval worldwide.

    <description>Healing time was recorded when complete re-epithelialization had occurred. If the wound healed in advance, visit until the wound was completely healed. If the wounds were unable to heal for more than 21±3 days, unanticipated follow-ups were added until the wound was completely healed.</description>

    <description>Physician assessment of tissue with healthy granulation tissue defined as is granular and uneven in texture, does not bleed easily and is pink in color. Unhealthy granulation tissue is typically dark which can be indicative of poor perfusion, ischemia and/or infection.</description>

    <time_frame>Days 0, 3±1, 7±1, 10±2, 14±3, and 21±3 post-operation</time_frame>

    <measure>Pain Perceived by Patient</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0, 3±1, 7±1, 10±2, 14±3, and 21±3 post-operation</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of pain that a patient perceived was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS 0-10), which ranges across a continuum from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain).</description>

    <time_frame>Days 0, 3±1, 7±1, 10±2, 14±3, and 21±3 post-operation</time_frame>
    <description>Physician assessment determined presence of exudation by observing whether the gauze over the primary wound dressings was soaked by exudation:
Less than two gauze was soaked by exudation within 24h---No exudation (-);
Two to four gauze was soaked by exudation within 24h---Little exudation (+);
More than four gauze was soaked by exudation within 24h---Much exudation (++);</description>
