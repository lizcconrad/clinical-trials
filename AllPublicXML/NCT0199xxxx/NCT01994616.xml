      This prospective evaluation studies the effectiveness of IL cryotherapy in treating keloids
      and hypertrophic scars in a large population of mixed Fitzpatrick skin types.

    <textblock>
      Intralesional (IL) cryotherapy is a novel treatment for keloids and hypertrophic scars, in
      which the scar is frozen from inside. Published results are promising, however only Caucasian
      patient populations have been studied. This prospective evaluation studies the effectiveness
      of IL cryotherapy in treating keloids and hypertrophic scars in a large population of mixed
      Fitzpatrick skin types. All patients with keloid or hypertrophic scars meeting inclusion
      criteria were treated with a liquid nitrogen based device called Cryoshape Scar quality and
      possible recurrence are assessed pre- and postsurgery (3, 6 and 12 months) with objective
      devices determine scar color, scar elasticity, scar volume and patient's skin type. In
      addition, scars are evaluated using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Keloids, defined as excessive scar tissue raised above skin level and proliferating
             beyond the confines of the original lesion

          -  Hypertrophic scars1 older than 12 months and insensitive to other treatments. Keloids
             were distinguished from hypertrophic scars based on the clinical judgment of
             experienced plastic surgeons and on the age of the scar (&gt;1yr)

          -  A period between previous treatment and IL cryotherapy covered a minimum of 12 weeks

          -  Patients with all Fitzpatrick17 skin types

          -  Patients older than 10 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  pregnancy

          -  diabetes mellitus
