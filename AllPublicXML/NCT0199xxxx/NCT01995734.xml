    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with confirmed diagnosis of active acromegaly with elevated IGF-1 (&gt;ULN) and
             random GH (&gt;1 μg/L) within 30 days of screening.

          -  Patients who are not controlled by pituitary surgery or who are not eligible for or
             refuse surgery.

          -  For patients on medical treatment for acromegaly the following washout periods must be
             completed before screening assessments are performed:

               -  Dopamine agonists (bromocriptine, cabergoline): 4 weeks

               -  GH-receptor antagonists (pegvisomant): 8 weeks

               -  Somatostatin analogues: no washout period required

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concomitant treatment with somatostatin analogues unless concomitant treatment was
             discontinued 28 days before first pasireotide LAR injection is administrated.

          -  Concomitant treatment with growth hormone receptor (GHR)-antagonists or dopamine
             agonists unless concomitant treatment was discontinued and the washout period was
             completed before the screening assessments are performed.

          -  Patients with compression of the optic chiasm causing any visual field defect for whom
             surgical intervention is indicated.

          -  Patients who require a surgical intervention for relief of any sign or symptom
             associated with tumor compression.

          -  Patients who have undergone major surgery/surgical therapy for any cause within 4
             weeks of screening.

          -  Patients who have received radiotherapy of the pituitary within 4 weeks prior to
             screening or have not recovered from side effects of radiotherapy.

          -  Patients who have a history of hypothyroidism and who are not adequately treated with
             stable doses of thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

          -  Patients with active malignant disease within the last five years (with the exception
             of basal cell carcinoma or carcinoma in situ of the cervix).

          -  Diabetic patients whose blood glucose is poorly controlled.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
