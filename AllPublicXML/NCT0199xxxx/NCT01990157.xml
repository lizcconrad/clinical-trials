      This study is in two stages:

      Stage 1 purpose is to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy of multiple TAB08 doses in
      patients with active Rheumatoid Arthritis in which methotrexate (MTX) treatment is not enough
      effective.

      Stage 2 purpose is to assess efficacy parameters (ACR criteria) of at least one selected
      TAB08 dose in extended patient population with active Rheumatoid Arthritis in which
      methotrexate (MTX) treatment with at least 10 mg/week is not enough effective.

      Stage 1 is designed as standard phase 1 study with one arm and sequential dose cohorts with
      ascending doses. Each patient in each dose cohort will be administered TAB08 several times.
      After last TAB08 administration each patient will undergo investigational-treatment-free
      follow-up period.

      At Stage 2 at least one TAB08 dose, selected during Stage 1 will be studied during longer
      timeframe in extended patient population.
