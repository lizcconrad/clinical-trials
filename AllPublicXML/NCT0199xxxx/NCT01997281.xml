  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess whether dietary fiber-enriched cereals effect on
      postprandial glucose levels and plasma glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and/or
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) concentration in patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus.

    <textblock>
      Fifteen subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus will be provided with study meals based on
      either dietary fiber-enriched cereals or conventional cereals upon two separate admissions in
      a cross-over fashion. The study meals will be provided at 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. on the day of
      admission, and 8 a.m. on the next day. A hamburger with coke as mixed meal will be given for
      lunch at noon on the second day. Blood sampling will be done every 30 minutes from 8 a.m. to
      4 p.m. on the second day. The plasma levels of glucose, GLP-1, GIP, insulin, glucagon, and
      free fatty acid will be measured.
