  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain in the elderly is poorly evaluated and clearly under treated. Premixed nitrous oxide and
      oxygen is used in the emergency medical care of the trauma, burns, during transport of
      patient with pain. None randomized study has validated the use of premixed nitrous oxide and
      oxygen in the emergency department in the elderly. The aim of the study is to demonstrate the
      efficacy of premixed nitrous oxide and oxygen compared to medical air in elderly patient with
      out-of-hospital severe acute pain

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients with pain relief (with a numerical rating
      scale of 3/10 or lower) 15 minutes after randomisation. Secondary endpoints are treatment
      safety and adverse events, time to analgesia and duration of analgesia. This study will
      expect 108 patients assigned in two parallel groups, defined by a randomization scheme. Four
      sites will participate to the research. Eligible patients with a numeric rating scale (NRS)
      score higher than 6/10 are randomly allocated to receive either MEOPA, or medical air.
      Neither the investigator nor the nurse knows the treatment. Pain score will be measured at
      baseline and every 5 minutes until pain relief will be obtained. The safety evaluation will
      include non invasive monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation by pulse
      oximetry (SpO2) and adverse events collection.

    <description>The patient will be taken care by the physician SMUR or home emergency. Upon acceptance of participation in the study, the clock will be started at the time of the establishment of the face mask. Premixed 50% nitrous oxide and oxygen is administered for 30 minutes and an opioid titration is started 10 minutes after the introduction of gas, unless the patient expresses pain score EN &lt;3/10.</description>
