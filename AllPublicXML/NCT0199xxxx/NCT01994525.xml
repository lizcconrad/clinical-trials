    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and biomarkers of protection in healthy
      malaria-naïve adults, who will receive bites from Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes either
      infected with Plasmodium falciparum Sporozoites (PfRAS) (true-immunization) or noninfected
      (mock-immunization).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 open-labeled study. In addition to safety and tolerability of Plasmodium
      falciparum Sporozoites (PfRAS), this study is a comprehensive, systems biology-based effort
      to identify and validate biomarkers of protection with PfRAS immunization, comparing
      sterility protected to nonprotected study subjects. The goal of the trial design is to
      achieve approximately 50% sterile protection in order to facilitate the identification of
      biomarkers and correlates of protection.

      Following true-immunization or mock-immunization, study subjects and nonimmunized infectivity
      controls will receive a challenge via the bites of 5 An stephensi mosquitoes carrying
      infectious P falciparum sporozoites within a controlled clinical environment (controlled
      human malaria infection, CHMI) to determine the level of sterile protection.

          -  Has evidence of increased cardiovascular disease risk (defined as &gt; 5%-10%, 5-year
             risk) as determined by the method of Gaziano (2008). Risk factors include sex, age
             (years), systolic blood pressure (mm Hg), smoking status, body mass index (BMI,

             substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in the
             protocol or compromise the scientific objectives. This may include psychiatric
             disorders (such as personality disorders, anxiety disorders, or schizophrenia) or
             behavioral tendencies (including active alcohol or drug abuse) discovered during the
             screening process that in the opinion of the investigator would make compliance with

             days prior to the screening visit, or plan to participate in another investigational
             vaccine/drug research during or within 1 month following participation in this study.

             immunization or challenge.

          -  History of psoriasis or porphyria, which may be exacerbated after treatment with
             chloroquine.

          -  Anticipated use of medications known to cause drug reactions with chloroquine or
             atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone) such as cimetidine, metoclopramide, antacids, and

          -  Any other significant findings which, in the investigator's judgment, may
             substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in the
