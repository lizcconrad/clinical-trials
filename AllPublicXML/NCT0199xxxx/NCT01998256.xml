    <textblock>
      Though AV optimization has become a cornerstone in optimization of patients with a cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT) device, surprisingly the use of AV optimization in patients
      with a dual chamber (bicameral (BIC)) pacemaker is not fully implemented in daily clinical
      practice. Some patients with a BIC pacemaker have a too short AV delay (AVD), secondary to an
      important interatrial conduction delay (IACD), which can lead to an atrial dyssynchrony
      syndrome. Others have a too long AV delay, also leading to a suboptimal diastolic filling
      time. Some patients may not need an optimization. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of AV
      optimization in all comer ambulatory patients with a BIC pacemaker on clinical outcomes, with
      a correlation to atrial pathophysiology, since until now existing evidence only emphasizes a
      possible hemodynamic benefit of this non invasive intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the high prevalence of interatrial block (WHO definition: PWD on surface ECG &gt; 110 ms)
      in a general hospitalized population and especially in patient groups with tachyarrhythmias
      (18% and 52 % respectively), this phenomenon will be important to recognize in a BIC
      pacemaker patient population. Actually, the prevalence of advanced interatrial block (PWD &gt;
      120 ms with biphasic P wave morphology) is 10% in candidates for definitive pacing and 32 %
      in patients with a bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome. The main underlying mechanism is thought
      to lie in abnormalities of the Bachmann bundle resulting in partial or advanced interatrial
      conduction delay (IACD). A normal IACD varies between 60 and 85 ms. Two potential mechanisms
      are spatial dispersion of refractory periods or anisotropy resulting from scarce side-to-side
      electrical coupling and fibrosis disrupting the arrangement of atrial muscle fibers.

      Patients with an interatrial conduction delay may have a suboptimal left atrioventricular
      timing due to delayed contraction of the left atrium with foreshortening of ventricular
      filling. This may be an issue in pacemaker patients, with our without a substrate for heart
      failure. Beside the loss of reduction of left atrial contraction, it might even induce
      neurohormonal changes due to atrial stretch and pressure thus lowering blood pressure.
      Coronary sinus or multisite atrial pacing, both with the aim of synchronizing right and left
      atrial electrical activation, have shown to (i) improve hemodynamics in patients with an
      important IACD, both invasively and noninvasively, and to (ii) decrease recurrences of atrial
      fibrillation. In patients with a conventional BIC pacemaker, prevention of left
      atrioventricular asynchrony can be achieved by AV optimization (lengthening of the AV delay
      in case of too short nominal settings) as an alternative. Though all these interventions have
      proven to have positive hemodynamic results until now evidence about positive effects on
      clinical patient outcomes are lacking.

      On the other hand, some of the patients implanted with a bicameral pacemaker have a too long
      AV delay. As a consequence diastolic filling time is impaired. Without compromising left
      atrioventricular synchrony AV delay, optimal AVD (AVO) can be achieved by lengthening of the
      AVD with conventional methods.

      In contrast to the setting of CRT, AV optimization in patients with a bicameral (BIC)
      pacemaker is not fully implemented in daily clinical practice. Given the proven effect on
      mitral inflow on echocardiography, we wanted to evaluate the effect of this non invasive
      intervention on patient functionality and quality of life, based on a comprehensive
      assessment of atrial pathophysiology.

    <description>Ergospirometry protocol:
Symptom-limited exercise testing was performed on an electronically braked cycle ergometer (eBike 1.8, GE (General Electric) Healthcare) in a non-fasting condition and under medication. All exercise tests took place at a standardized time for each patient. After 1minute (min) of rest followed by 1min of unloaded cycling, the initial load was set at 20W (Watt) for 1 min, and was increased by 10 or 20W every 2 min until exhaustion. Cycle load increments were based on previous exercise testing, aiming to yield a test duration of approximately 10min. All tests were continued to volitional fatigue and no patients were limited by angina. The recovery period lasted at least 2 minutes. A 12-lead electrocardiogram was monitored continuously (Cardiosoft 6.6); maximum heart rate was registered.
The oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) was calculated using [VO2= m(log10VE)+b, where m= OUES]. VO2=oxygen consumption</description>
