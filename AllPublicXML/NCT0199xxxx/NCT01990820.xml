  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis, a common diagnosis in children, remains a poorly understood disease.
      Adenoidectomy (surgery to take out the adenoid pads- infection fighting glands in the back of
      the throat) is performed since the adenoid pad may trap germs that enter a child's body and
      can get so swollen with bacteria that they become infected themselves. Functional endoscopic
      sinus surgery (FESS) and adenoidectomy are currently the most common surgeries performed on
      children with this disease. Another treatment is adenoidectomy and irrigation of the
      maxillary sinus without FESS. New technology has emerged using a balloon catheter to dilate
      (open) the sinus passage in addition to the adenoidectomy and irrigation. This study seeks to
      answer if children with chronic rhinosinusitis who undergo adenoidectomy with balloon
      dilation of the maxillary sinus passage and irrigation experience improved quality of life
      outcomes compared to children with chronic rhinosinusitis who undergo an adenoidectomy with
      maxillary sinus irrigation without dilation of the sinus passage.

    <description>A rigid nasal endoscopy will be performed. After decongesting with oxymetazoline hydrochloride, the balloon catheter device will be inserted and the wire/balloon will be threaded through the maxillary sinus ostia. Confirmation of location will be per manufacturer's recommendation with either fluoroscopy or illumination. Following confirmation, the balloon will be dilated under visualization per manufacture's recommendation. After the visualization of the dilated ostia, cultures for aerobic/anerobic examination will be taken and irrigation with 10ml of isotonic sodium chloride will be performed.
Adenoidectomy will be performed using either the microdebrider or suction electrocautery in the usual manner.</description>

    <intervention_name>Adenoidectomy + Maxillary Sinus Irrigation</intervention_name>
    <description>A rigid nasal endoscopy will be performed. After decongesting with oxymetazoline hydrochloride, the maxillary sinuses will be entered via middle meati punctures using either a sterile spinal needle or a curved suction. Sinus contents will be aspirated and sent for aerobic/anaerobic cultures. Irrigation with 10ml of isotonic sodium chloride will be performed. If no material is aspirated initially, the sinus contents will be re-aspirated after irrigation and sent for aerobic/anaerobic cultures.
Adenoidectomy will be performed using either the microdebrider or suction electrocautery in the usual manner.
After adequate hemostasis, the patient will be awakened and brought to the recovery room. Depending on the recovery, the child will either be admitted or discharged home.</description>

             preparations or antihistamines as well as saline nasal irrigation

        Computer tomographic findings considered to be consistent with sinusitis include partial or
        complete sinus opacification.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             sinonasal tumors

          4. Pregnancy will be excluded.

          5. Patients with cystic fibrosis, craniofacial anomalies, metabolic disorders, or
             immunodeficiencies

          6. Patients who have had their adenoids removed and thus may be candidates for functional
             endoscopic sinus surgery will also be excluded.

          7. Patients with a history of sinus surgery or significant anatomic abnormalities on CT
             scan that would require endoscopic sinus surgery or septoplasty would also be
             excluded.

        Of note, children who will be undergoing concurrent surgeries will not be excluded.
