  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hormone replacement therapy(HRT) is the main therapy to climacteric symptoms. But HRT also
      has a lot of disadvantages, such as cardiovascular disease, breast cancer .In our previous
      investigation,we found that doing exercise is helpful for climacteric symptoms.So we want to
      make a detailed investigation to research it.
