  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PET/MR device components and accessories are under development in order to optimize,
      validate and improve the design including improving the quality of images. The purpose of
      this study is:

        -  Aim 1: Perform iterative evaluations of the device (including features and components)
           to optimize device performance and assess feasibility of new features;

        -  Aim 2: Perform activities in support of design validation as needed for regulatory
           submission;

        -  Aim 3: Evaluate device complaints and analyze potential causes.

      This is a non-randomized, non-statistically powered, single-site, prospective study designed
      to gather imaging data for design optimization, regulatory submission and future product
      development of an investigational hybrid PET/MRI scanner. Subjects will undergo a clinically
      indicated PET/CT exam subsequent to tracer administration. Once clinical imaging is complete,
      subjects will be transported to the PET/MR scanner at the GE Facility for additional imaging.
      No additional pharmaceuticals or ionizing radiation will be utilized as part of this study.

    <description>Perform iterative evaluations of the device to optimize device performance and assess feasibility of new features The evaluation is the actual image and how it performs with the software iterations. This is evaluated on an ongoing basis as scans are performed. The evaluation of the images is performed by the subject matter expert who confirms if images are of diagnostic quality and or if there is room for improvement. No diagnosis of the subjects health is performed from these images.</description>
