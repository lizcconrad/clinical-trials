      Treatment for Chronic HBV The objectives of HBV therapy are to improve upon the spontaneous
      rates of sustained disease remission (as defined by long-term HBeAg and HBsAg seroconversion
      rates off-treatment), thereby reducing the risk of disease progression, with resultant
      improvements in quality of life and reductions in healthcare costs. Seven drugs are presently
      approved in the USA and/or EU for the treatment of CHB in patients with HBeAg-positive and
      -negative disease. They fall into 2 classes: antiviral/immunomodulators (IFNα and pegIFNα-2a)
      and antiviral nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs).

      EASL and AASLD Treatment Guidelines (2009) recommend that HBV therapy may be initiated with
      any of the currently approved agents, but that IFNα (standard or pegylated), Tenofovir (TDF)
      or Entecavir (ETV) are preferred first-line options for treatment of CHB patients with
      HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative disease.

      Poor adherence to therapy is a complex challenge for physicians treating patients with
      chronic diseases. In clini¬cal practice, adherence rates averages 50%, falling most
      dramatically after the first 6 mo of treatment. Guidelines on CHB therapy emphasise the need
      for optimal adherence, with risk of resistant viral strains emerging if the virus has a drug
      free holiday. For example, antiviral resistance has been reported in up to 70% patients after
      4 years on Lamivudine, 29% after 5 years of Adefovir dipivoxil and 1% after 4 years of
      Entecavir monohydrate. The number of dose omissions that may lead to this is variable but any
      omission poses a po¬tential risk of viral replication breakthrough. Although, the data for
      CHB are lacking, it is evident from the HIV literature that near-perfect adherence (&gt; 95%
      adherence rates) is needed to achieve a non detectable viral load and avoid emergence of
      resistant strains. Hence, in the clinical setting of CHB therapy, the goal of adherence
      remains 100%.

      Unlike other chronic conditions, the rapid viral rep¬lication potential and mutation rates of
      hepatitis B virus require very high levels of adherence to achieve and maintain virological
      suppression. Suboptimal adher¬ence risks exacerbating existing liver disease, which can be
      life-threatening particularly in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Furthermore, it can lead
      to the development of drug-resistant strains, limiting therapeutic options and additionally
      poses the public health risks of transmission of drug-resistant viral strains to non-immune
      individuals in the community, or to those whose previous vaccina¬tion are no longer
      protective. Given the global burden of the disease, widespread transmission of drug-resistant
      strains may have serious and wide-reaching consequences.

      1.1 Study Rationale Non- adherence to treatment is a well known issue across many therapeutic
      areas. In Hep C, literature review shows that adherence in real life may reach 65%, with most
      drop-outs during first 3 months, mainly due to minor side effects. In Hep B, reported
      adherence studies show 50%-80% adherence, with an average of ~65%. Most drop-outs are during
      first 6 months of treatment. Non-adherence to treatment is believed to contribute not only to
      liver deterioration but also to emerging viral resistance.

      Studies for adherence support show an average improvement of around 10%-15% at the best.
      Assessed methods are:

        -  Patient education

        -  Patients empowerment

        -  SMS reminders

        -  Pills' boxes with electronic reminders

      The lack of symptoms along with chronicity of treatment, financial burden and lack of
      patient's education - are recognized as important factors for non-adherence.

      The abundance of new drugs for viral hepatitis, high disease prevalence and the close
      relation between effective treatment and clinical outcomes - create a clear need for not only
      providing treatment but also an efficient support system aimed at supporting patients'
      adherence.

      1.2 Research Question We expect that an ongoing patients' support system will contribute to
      adherence increase. The support should be provided by HCPs, be continuous and provide
      reminders, medical education and direct contact between patients and HCPs.

      Therefore, study hypothesis is:

        -  An ongoing 6 months adherence support will increase adherence rates for Hep B patients

        -  Adherence rate increase will be at least 20%.

        -  Direct weekly telephone contacts will contribute major improvement. Smart phone
           application daily reminders will contribute as well and there is need to assess its
           relative contribution.

           2 OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary Objectives At least 20% improvement in adherence rates for
           newly treated Hep B patients. Adherence rate will be defined as the per cent of days the
           patients took their hepatitis B virus medications during study treatment and the number
           of missed doses.

      2.2 Secondary Objectives

      The difference in adherence improvement among 3 types of adherence support:

        1. Weekly telephone call + daily text messages reminders.

        2. Weekly telephone calls.

        3. Daily text messages reminders.

        4. Control - no adherence support

      3 STUDY DESIGN 3.1 Overview of Study Design This is an epidemiological non-interventional
      study conducted in the community. Medical students (Hereinafter &quot;Supporters&quot;), attending
      senior years (4th or 5th year) will receive training about the Educational Support Program.
      In case not all vacancies can be filled with suitable medical students, senior years nursing
      students will be approached. Every supporter will be supporting a maximum of 10 recruited
      patients simultaneously. Every 5 supporters will report to a nurse. Every 2 nurses will
      report to a Hepatologist (Hereinafter &quot;Investigator&quot;). Overall, every Hepatologist shall be
      recruiting a maximum of 100 patients.

      During the pre-study phase, eligible patients, who are prescribed with HBV treatment with
      Entecavir by their respective Investigator, will be informed of the Support Program.
      Interested patients will receive ICF for signature. Upon signature, the recruiting
      Investigator will randomize the newly recruited patient into one of the four study groups.

      Randomization will be provided by CHS computerized system (Randomization engine).

      Patients in the supported groups (Groups 1; 2 and 3) shall undergo the procedure described
      hereby:

      Upon recruitment, the patient will be introduced to the nurse, who will appoint a supporter
      to the patient, install the smart-phone reminder application (to relevant groups - Group 1
      and Group 3) and explain the support format according to patient's group:

      Group 1:

      Receive weekly phone calls from their supporters who will monitor HBV treatment adherence and
      adverse events, respond to the patients' queries, suggest possible remedies to patients'
      basic complaints (per definition and qualification in training), refer more complex queries
      and/or complaints to respective nurse and refer patients to physicians for further treatment,
      if required. The Supporter will record the data on a Patient Follow-Up Form and report, on a
      monthly basis, to the respective nurse. In addition, patients in this group will install the
      reminder application on their smart-phones and will be reminded on a daily basis, by the
      application, to take their medication.

      Group 2:

      Receive weekly phone calls from their Supporters who will monitor HBV treatment adherence and
      adverse events, respond to the patients' queries, suggest possible remedies to patients'
      basic complaints (per definition and qualification in training), refer more complex queries
      and/or complaints to respective nurse and refer patients to physicians for further treatment,
      if required. The Supporter will record the data on a Patient Follow-Up Form and report, on a
      monthly basis, to the respective nurse.

      Group 3:

      Patients in this group will install the reminder application on their smart-phones and will
      be reminded on a daily basis, by the application, to take their medication.

      Group 4:

      Patients in the 4th group (control group) will continue the SOC without any further support.

      Every month, patients will receive a letter from their respective Investigators, summarizing
      their study status in the previous month (Appendix A). Every quarter (3 months), each nurse
      will report study progress to responsible Investigator and schedule a follow-up appointment
      for the patient with the investigator. The patient will bring the pill boxes to the follow-up
      appointment for counting.

      At the end of the supporting phase, the patients will continue HBV treatment according to
      standard care and their physician's instructions. During the follow-up phase, all groups will
      be handled as Group 4 patients.

      3.2 Study Population

      Approximately 250 Naïve Hep B patients are expected to participate in the study and will be
      divided into 4 study arms:

      Group 1: 63 pts receiving weekly telephone contact &amp; daily text messages for 6 months.

      Group 2: 63 patients receiving weekly telephone contacts for 6 months. Group 3: 63 patients
      receiving daily text messages for 6 months. Group 4: 63 patients receiving no adherence
      support.

        -  Must have access to a smart-phone.

        -  Written informed consent.

      3.2.2 Exclusion Criteria

        -  Patients with hepatitis C, hepatitis D or HIV co-infection.

        -  Co-infected patients who require additional medication.

        -  Patients who cannot take medication independently.

      3.3 Data Source/Data Collection Process

      Adherence to treatment will be assessed by 3 methods:

        1. Supporters' weekly documentations.

        2. Pill count - Patients will be instructed to bring the boxes to quarterly follow-up
           visits with the Hepatologist.

        3. Drugs dispense data from pharmacies - every 3 months.

      Safety assessment will be completed by:

        1. Supporters' weekly documentations.

        2. Documentation by treating hepatologists, during ongoing visits. 3.4 Definitions of Study
           Variables Adherence will be quantified into percentage and will be calculated as the
           percent of days in which the patient took the prescribed medication out of the number of
           days the patient was instructed to take the medication by prescription.

      3.4.1 Outcomes/Endpoint Variables

      Primary endpoint:

      Adherence rate will be defined as the percentage of days the patients took their hepatitis B
      virus medications during study treatment and the number of missed doses. Adherence will be
      measured as a combination of:

        1. Drug dispense at pharmacy (every month)

        2. Self report by patient (every week)

        3. Pills count (every 3 months)

      A responder will be defined as a patient with at least 80% adherence to drug treatment.

      Secondary endpoint:

      The difference in adherence improvement among 3 types of adherence support

        1. Weekly Phone Call + Daily Application Reminder

        2. Weekly Phone Call

        3. Daily Application Reminder

      4 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 4.1 Statistical Analysis Methods All measured variables and derived
      parameters will be listed individually and, if appropriate, tabulated by descriptive
      statistics.

      For categorical variables summary tables will be provided giving sample size, absolute and
      relative frequency and 95% CI (Confidence Interval) for proportions by study arm.

      For continuous variables summary tables will be provided giving sample size, arithmetic mean,
      standard deviation, coefficient of variation (if appropriate), median, minimum and maximum,
      percentiles and 95% CI (Confidence Interval) by study arm for means of variables.

      4.1.1 Primary Objective Responders will be defined as patients with at least 80% adherence to
      drug treatment. 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) will be calculated for the rate of
      responders per study arm (arms 1, 2 and 3).

      4.1.2 Secondary Objectives Chi-square test or Fisher's Exact test (as is appropriate) will be
      applied for testing the statistical significance of the difference in responders rate between
      study arms 1 (Weekly Phone Call + Daily Application Reminder), 2 (Weekly Phone Call) and 3
      (Daily Application Reminder) vs. group 4 (no support).

      The effect of telephone call will be tested comparing groups 1+2 vs. groups 3+4.

      The effect of daily SMS will be tested comparing groups 1+3 vs. group 2+4. Logistic
      Regression model will be applied for testing the statistical significance of the difference
      in responders' rate between study arms 1, 2 and 3 vs. group 4 and between the active groups
      with adjustment to suspected confounders related to study outcome which will be found
      different between the arms.

      Logistic regression will be applied for analyzing the effect of telephone call and daily SMS
      (as described above) with adjustment to suspected confounders.

      All tests will be two-tailed, and a p value of 5% or less will be considered statistically
      significant.

      The data will be analyzed using the SAS ® version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary North Carolina).

      4.2 Power/Sample Size Rational for Sample size calculation Sample size calculation is based
      on demonstrating a difference of at least 21% in response rate in the comparison between
      study arms 1, 2 and 3 vs. group 4. This difference reflects an odds ratio of 0.23 with
      statistical significance of 5% with statistical power of 80% when the sample size is 252, 63
      in each study arm.

      Sample Size Justification A two group continuity corrected Chi square test with a 0.050
      two-sided significance level will have 80% power to detect the difference between a Group 1
      proportion and a Group 2 proportion (odds ratio of 0.231) when the sample size in each group
      is 64.

      5 STUDY CONDUCT This study will be conducted in accordance with International Society for
      Pharmacoepidemiology (ISPE) Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practices (GPP) and
      applicable regulatory requirements.

      5.1 Ethics Committee Review and Informed Consent

      5.1.1 Ethics Committee Review The investigator must ensure that the required approvals from
      Ethics Committees, Independent Review Committees, Regulatory Authorities, and/or other local
      governance bodies are obtained before study initiation at the site.

      5.1.2 Informed Consent In accordance with local regulations, subjects should provide either
      written or oral consent before enrollment into the study. Investigators must ensure that
      patients, or, in those situations where consent cannot be given by patients, their legally
      acceptable representatives, are clearly and fully informed about the purpose of the study,
      potential risks, the patient's rights and responsibilities when participating in this study.
      If local regulations do not require an informed consent document to be signed by the patient,
      the site staff should document key elements of the informed consent process in the patient's
      chart.

      This study does not require that informed consent is obtained from patients.

      5.2 Responsibilities within the Study The study shall be conducted as described in this
      approved protocol. All revisions to the protocol must be discussed with, and be prepared by
      BMS.

      5.3 Confidentiality of Study Data The confidentiality of records that could identify patients
      within the database must be protected, respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules in
      accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s).

      For the purposes of protecting a patient's identity, a unique code will be assigned to each
      patient, such as a series of numbers and/or letters (for example, CA180330-0001-00001). The
      data that is recorded with the patient's assigned code is called &quot;key-coded data&quot;. Key-coded
      study data will be managed by the sponsor and/or its delegates in a study-specific electronic
      database (the &quot;study database&quot;). Only the investigator and the site staff have access to the
      link between patient's assigned code and the patient's identity. However, in case of an audit
      or inspection, subject to local laws and regulations, government officials, IRB/EC
      representatives and sponsor representatives may access this information at the study site. If
      the study requires on-site monitoring, subject to local laws and regulations, sponsor
      representatives will also access the primary data source at the study site (see section 6.4).
      Data that could directly identify the patient will not be collected in the &quot;study database&quot;.

      5.4 Quality Control Power/Sample Size Representatives of BMS and/or its delegates must be
      allowed to visit all study site locations to assess the data quality and study integrity. On
      site, they will review study files and, if allowed by local laws and regulations, patient
      medical charts to compare them with source documents, discuss the conduct of the study with
      the investigator, and verify that the facilities remain acceptable.

      In addition, the study may be evaluated by BMS internal auditors and government inspectors
      who must be allowed access to CRFs, source documents, other study files, and study
      facilities. BMS audit reports will be kept confidential.

      The investigator must notify BMS promptly of any inspections scheduled by regulatory
      authorities, and promptly forward copies of inspection reports to BMS.

      5.5 Database Retention and Archiving of Study Documents The investigator must retain all
      study records and source documents for the maximum period required by applicable regulations
      and guidelines, or institution procedures, or for the period specified by the sponsor,
      whichever is longer. The investigator must contact BMS prior to destroying any records
      associated with the study. Location of database and supporting documentation will be outlined
      in the final observational study report.

      6 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING The INSTITUTION/PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR must notify BMS with the
      related and non-related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and/or Pregnancies within 24 hours of
      becoming aware of the event.

      The INVESTIGATOR must notify BMS with the related and non-related non-serious Adverse Events
      within 7 days of becoming aware of the event.

      All Adverse Events and/or Serious Adverse Events must be reported to:

      Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Global Pharmacovigilance FAX Number: 609-818-3804 or Email:
      WorldWide.Safety@bms.com

      The INVESTIGATOR must notify BMS with all Adverse Events in aggregate in the Final Study
      Report (FSR).
