    <description>The primary endpoint was the degree of leakage under the baseplate, which was assessed using the three innermost rings of the 32-point leakage scale, corresponding to a total of 24 points (0 indicating no leakage and 24 indicating maximum leakage).
Results are given separately for subjects with colostomy and ileostomy. In the ileostomy group there were no SenSura Mio participants in the standard care group.</description>
