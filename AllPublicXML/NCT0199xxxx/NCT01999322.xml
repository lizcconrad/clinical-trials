  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe and the United States of America (USA). The aim of this
      trial is to evaluate compatibility and safety of FIAsp (faster-acting insulin aspart) and
      insulin aspart (NovoRapid®) with an external continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)
      system in adult subjects with type 1 diabetes.

    <measure>Number of Microscopically Confirmed Episodes of Infusion Set Occlusions</measure>
    <time_frame>During 6 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The number of microscopically confirmed episodes of infusion set occlusions during 6 weeks of treatment. Episodes of infusion set occlusions were confirmed by microscopic examination of the infusion sets at each routine weekly visit and infusion sets that had been changed prematurely because of leakage, unexplained hyperglycaemia or suspicion of occlusion (observation of a plug).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Unexplained Episodes of Hyperglycaemia (Confirmed by Self-measured Plasma Glucose (SMPG))</measure>
    <time_frame>During 6 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Unexplained hyperglycaemia was defined as a confirmed plasma glucose value ≥ 16.7 mmol/L (300 mg/dL) and was unexplained (i.e., no apparent medical, dietary, insulin dosage or pump failure reason)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Episodes of Possible Infusion Set Occlusions</measure>
    <time_frame>During 6 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Episodes of possible infusion set occlusions were defined as infusion sets changed due to suspicion of occlusion, leakage or unexplained hyperglycaemic episode. Possible occlusion excluded technical reasons. This endpoint was calculated from the recorded date/times of changes of infusion set combined with the subjects' own assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Premature Infusion Set Changes</measure>
    <time_frame>During 6 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A premature infusion set change was defined as not being a routine change. This was defined as an infusion set changed at home due to &quot;suspicion of occlusion&quot;, &quot;leakage&quot;, &quot;unexplained hyperglycaemic episode&quot;, &quot;infusion site reaction&quot;, &quot;technical reason&quot;, or &quot;other&quot;. The change of infusion set at a site visit was considered a routine change unless an occlusion was actually suspected at the site.</description>

          <description>Subjects received faster-acting insulin aspart for a duration of 6 weeks. Faster-acting insulin aspart was provided in 100U/ml 3 mL Penfill® and administered in accordance with the instructions provided by the pump manufacturer, preferably in the abdomen, by subcutaneous infusion. The insulin dose adjustments were made based on frequent glucose measurements during contacts with the investigator. The following glycaemic targets were recommended: preprandial and bedtime glucose: below 6.0 mmol/L (108 mg/dL) and 2-hr postprandial glucose: below 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL). A 2:1 randomisation following the screening period was selected in order to ensure adequate exposure to faster-acting insulin aspart.</description>

        <title>Number of Microscopically Confirmed Episodes of Infusion Set Occlusions</title>
        <description>The number of microscopically confirmed episodes of infusion set occlusions during 6 weeks of treatment. Episodes of infusion set occlusions were confirmed by microscopic examination of the infusion sets at each routine weekly visit and infusion sets that had been changed prematurely because of leakage, unexplained hyperglycaemia or suspicion of occlusion (observation of a plug).</description>

        <population>FAS: included all randomised subjects. In exceptional cases subjects could be excluded from the full analysis set. In such cases the reason for exclusion was to be justified and documented. Subjects in the full analysis set contribute to the evaluation “as randomised”.</population>

            <description>Subjects received faster-acting insulin aspart for a duration of 6 weeks. Faster-acting insulin aspart was provided in 100U/ml 3 mL Penfill® and administered in accordance with the instructions provided by the pump manufacturer, preferably in the abdomen, by subcutaneous infusion. The insulin dose adjustments were made based on frequent glucose measurements during contacts with the investigator. The following glycaemic targets were recommended: preprandial and bedtime glucose: below 6.0 mmol/L (108 mg/dL) and 2-hr postprandial glucose: below 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL). A 2:1 randomisation following the screening period was selected in order to ensure adequate exposure to faster-acting insulin aspart.</description>
