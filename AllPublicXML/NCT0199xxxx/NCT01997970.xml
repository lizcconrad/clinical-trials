  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect on Non-exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT) when
      implementing active workstation at offices compared to conventional office work. The primary
      hypothesis is that this implementation will lead to a significant increase in time spent
      walking per day.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NEAT consists of the energy expenditure of the physical activities that are non sporting-like
      and that we perform in our everyday life, such as walking, cleaning, shoveling snow etc.
      Which occupation we have play a big role in how much we are able to active our NEAT during
      our days and those who have more active jobs can expend up to 1500kcal more per day than
      those with sedentary jobs.

      This study aims to try and increase NEAT at offices where sedentary time often is high.
      Participants will be randomized to either an intervention group or to a control group.
      Participants in the control group will continue to work at their regular desk, but will
      receive an individual health talk in the beginning of the study where diet and physical
      activity recommendations will be discussed.Participants in the intervention group will
      receive the same individual health talk and a treadmill desk, which they will use for 12
      months at self-selected speed. They will be recommended to walk on the treadmill for at least
      1 hour per day.
