  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For this project we propose to refine the psychosocial intervention developed in phase one,
      based on input from key stakeholders, and to test the feasibility, acceptability and
      preliminary efficacy of the intervention. The proposed project addresses unmet public health
      needs for a historically hard-to-reach group of individuals with epilepsy and comorbid
      serious mental illnesses, and as the intervention is an adjunct to care that individuals with
      serious mental illness are already receiving, and uses staff already likely to be present in
      a care system, it is ideally suited for &quot;real-world&quot; implementation in people with epilepsy
      and serious mental illness (E-SMI).

      The purpose of this study is to try and engage individuals with E-SMI to actively participate
      in illness self-management and treatment adherence that are crucial in minimizing the
      morbidity and mortality associated with both chronic mental disorders and chronic
      neurological conditions.
