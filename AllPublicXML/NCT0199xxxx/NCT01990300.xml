      This is a special drug use surveillance on long-term use of alogliptin/pioglitazone
      combination tablets. This study is designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of
      long-term use of alogliptin/pioglitazone combination tablet in patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus in the routine clinical setting.

      Participants will be patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The planned sample size is 3000.

      The usual adult dosage is 1 tablet (containing alogliptin/pioglitazone at either 25 mg/15 mg
