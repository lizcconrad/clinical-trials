      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of exercise + therapy to therapy alone
      to determine if they can improve the effects of prolonged exposure therapy (PE) in reducing
      symptoms of anxiety associated with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In addition the
      two strategies (i.e., exercise + therapy and therapy alone condition) will be compared in
      terms of levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is a protein that helps to
      support the survival of existing neurons and stimulate the growth of new neurons and
      synapses. BDNF is important to learning and memory in general and therefore may be associated
      with the learning and memory as it relates to PE and corresponding symptoms PTSD improvement.
