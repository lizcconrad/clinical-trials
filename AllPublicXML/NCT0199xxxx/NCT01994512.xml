  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A national randomized multicentre trial (RCT) where decompression is compared with
      decompression with simultaneous fusion in 245 patients with spinal stenosis on one or two
      adjacent lumbar levels with or without degenerative olisthesis. The material is stratified
      for the existence of degenerative olisthesis &gt;3mm. Monitoring is performed with clinical
      results from patient surveys after 2 and five years, and with radiological follow-up (MRI, CT
      and plain X-ray) and an objective function test (6 min walking test) after 2 years. The null
      hypothesis is that there is no difference in results between the two interventions.

    <measure>Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>A disease-specific self-report outcome instrument commonly used in trials to measure treatment outcomes in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. The Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire quantifies severity of symptoms, physical function characteristics, and patient's satisfaction after treatment. It was designed to complement existing generic measures of lumbar spine disability and health status in the evaluation of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.</description>
