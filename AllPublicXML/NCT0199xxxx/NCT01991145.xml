      This randomized controlled study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of allogeneic
      umbilical cord blood therapy combined with erythropoietin for children with cerebral palsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of neurodevelopmental conditions with abnormal movement and
      posture resulted from a non-progressive cerebral disturbance. It is the most common cause of
      motor disability in childhood. Most therapies are palliative rather than restorative.
      Umbilical cord blood (UCB) and erythropoetin (EPO) may be used as restorative approach for
      children with CP.

      Many experimental animal studies have revealed that UCB is beneficial to improve and repair
      neurological injuries. EPO is also known to have neuroprotective effects.

      Based on animal studies and some clinical trials, UCB is suggested as a potential therapy for
      children with CP. EPO is combined to add synergistic effects to UCB therapy.
