  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to assess whether the injection of local anesthetic into the nerve
      (intraneural), as opposed to around it (perineural), requires a shorter time to develop
      surgical anesthesia of the lower leg.

      The investigators will compare the two types of injection using the same drug, so as to
      determine if there is an actual difference onset time. They will also examine the overall
      success rate of either kind of sciatic nerve blocks as the sole anesthetic for non-emergent
      orthopedic surgery.

      The safety of these procedures will be examined by in-hospital and phone-call follow-up
      contacts.

      This will be a randomized, controlled, patient- and observer-blinded trial assessing block
      characteristics after intra- or perineural injection of ropivacaine for subgluteal sciatic
      nerve blocks performed for elective surgery of the lower limb.

    <measure>Onset Time of Sciatic Nerve Block</measure>
    <time_frame>≤30 minutes after block performance</time_frame>
    <description>Time to onset of sciatic nerve anesthesia, defined as both following criteria:
Sensory: does not feel pain or discomfort when pricked with a 25G needle.
Motor: able to slightly curl toes; unable to flex the ankle.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Success Rate of Sciatic Nerve Blocks</measure>
    <time_frame>≤30 min after block performance</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of patients who attain the criteria for block success within 30 minutes of the injection.
Investigators will also report the percentage of patients who successfully complete surgery without significant additional analgesia (see below); this will be defined as &quot;clinical success rate.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence and Prevalence of Neurologic Disturbances</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after anesthesia performance</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be interviewed at ~4 h (block resolution visit), 7 days and (if necessary) at 30 days to assess for residual neurologic disturbances in the sciatic nerve territory.
The incidence/prevalence of these phenomena will be noted.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences in Time to Resolution of Sciatic Nerve Block</measure>
    <time_frame>&lt;12 h</time_frame>
    <description>The time at which sensory and motor function of the sciatic nerve have recovered at least to the following criteria:
Sensory: patients feel discomfort when pricked with a thin needle (25G)
Motor: patients may move both toes and ankle, albeit with reduced strength
This outcome measure will be examined by an investigator every 30-60 min and reported by patients as &quot;time to return of sensation and movement&quot;. The investigator-reported value will be preferred if both are available.</description>

    <description>Patients in this group will receive a perineural injection for subgluteal sciatic nerve block under real-time, short-axis, in-plane ultrasound guidance, in addition to a femoral nerve block and patient-controlled postoperative analgesia. Ropivacaine will be used for the sciatic nerve block, whereas the choice of agent for the femoral nerve block is left to the attending anesthesiologist.</description>

    <description>The injection will start as the needle penetrates the outermost discernible layer of the nerve (epineurium) under ultrasound guidance. The injection will be adjudicated as &quot;intraneural&quot; if nerve cross section expansion and a reduction in echogenicity are observed.
Short-axis real-time ultrasound imaging will be used, with an in-plane needle approach.</description>
