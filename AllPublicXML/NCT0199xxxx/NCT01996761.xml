      This study, E-COMPASS is a phase IV clinical trial designed as a multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. This study will enroll 75 subacute
      stroke patients with unilateral motor dysfunction. Primary objective is to demonstrate the
      efficacy of porcine brain peptide to improve motor recovery measured by the improvement ratio
      of Fugl-Meyer assessment ((score of FMA after 3 weeks - score of FMA at baseline) / score of
      FMA at baseline) in patients with subacute stroke.
