    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvis pain is very common between adult women. Significant progress is made in
      clarifying the multifactorial model of chronic pain pathogenesis, but a more complete
      assessment is important in order to improve the therapeutic approach. The purpose of this
      study is stablish a clinical and symptomatological profile of women with chronic pelvic pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain is defined as non-menstrual or noncyclic pelvic pain with duration of at
      least 6 months. This pain interfere with habitual activities and requires clinical or
      surgical treatment. It is a complex interaction between the gastrointestinal, urinary,
      gynecologic, musculoskeletal, neurologic and endocrine systems influenced by psychological
      factors. Its prevalence range between 3 and 8% among women aged 15-73 years, ranging from 14
      to 24% among women of reproductive age. It is very important a multidimensional approach in
      order to stablish a more specific profile.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pressure pain measure</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Pain pressure threshold at baseline. This is going to be measured in four points (anterior tibialis, between the second and third metacarpophalangeal joint, between the fifth and the sixth vertical vertebrae and an abdominal point). All assessments were made by the same investigator. All the subjects were trained to familiarize the subjects with the pressure algometry procedure before the measures in an anatomical site different from the chosen sites for this study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nervous assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The nervous assessment is measured with neurodynamic tests. This is used to test upper and lower extremities. It moves most of the nerves between the neck and legs, including the spinal nerves and lower limbs nerves.
The patient is placed in supine position. It is measured with a goniometer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spinal assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The spinal assessment is going to be performed using the Spinal Mouse. Spinal Mouse is a device that, combined with a computer program, assesses the curvatures of the vertebral column without applying harmful radiation. Spinal Mouse checks: spine alignment, measuring segmental and global angles in the sagittal and frontal planes; posture and spinal mobility; spine functions and performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Posture assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The posture is going to be assessed using the Mensendieck test. It is a standardized test applied to evaluate posture, movement, gait, sitting posture, and respiration of patients with psychosomatic disorders, based on observation and analysis of motor function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trigger points evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Trigger points are discrete, focal, hyperirritable spots located in a taut band of skeletal muscle. A pressure at a trigger point is performed in order to evoke pain at the point as well as referred pain in myofascial or visceral structures. The trigger points located in the gluteal and adductors muscles are going to be assessed.</description>
