  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood blindness. Vascular
      endothelium growth factor (VEGF) is an important component of this disease. The goal of
      treatment is to reduce the production of VEGF in the immature retina and to eliminate the
      abnormal growth of new vessels. Currently, laser photocoagulation of the peripheral avascular
      retina is the treatment standard. Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF antibody Bevacizumab
      (IVB) has been used clinically off-label as an alternative therapy. However, VEGF is
      important for the development of neurons and vessels in the systemic organs in premature
      infants. Pharmaceutical study showed that IVB was absorbed into the bloodstream. It is
      unclear if the systemic absorption of Bevacizumab is dose related, and the short and longterm
      effects on ocular and systemic systems, especially neurological development. In this study,
      our goals are to establish the pharmacokinetics of Bevacizumab in the premature infant and to
      compare the short and long-term vision and neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants treated
      with IVB compared to laser ROP.

      This study will enroll preterm infants who were scheduled to receive treatment for ROP by
      laser or Bevacizumab. We will observe the patients in the hospital for the cure of ROP until
      54 weeks' postmenstrual age. We will check the changes of chemicals in the blood and observe
      short-term and long-term effects on visual system, brain and other body organs. Descriptive
      statistics from a two sample t-test or Fisher's exact test will be used to compare the short
      and long-term vision and neurological development outcomes. We predefined a statistical
      significance level p=0.05.

Each neurodevelopmental assessment includes a developmental history, direct behavioral observations, and direct developmental testing using the Revised Gesell Developmental Schedules; the Motor Quotient will be used to assess gross motor development; and the Capute Scales will be used used to assess non-verbal, visual-motor problem-solving development and speech and language development.</description>
