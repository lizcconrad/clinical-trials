      Project Summary: One of the challenges facing pediatric researchers is the need to balance
      decreasing funding with the time and human resource costs associated with enrolling children.
      In order to address this, the Emergency Department (ED) research team developed an innovative
      model for subject enrollment and consent using highly trained and supervised undergraduate
      students. From a human resources perspective, utilizing students is more cost effective than
      the traditional research nurse model. However, a concern with this method is the adequacy of
      parental understanding of study information for informed consent. The aim of this project is
      to determine if the use of students is at least as good as the more costly &quot;gold standard&quot; of
      experienced research nurses. The validation of this innovative student model will enable
      child health investigators to better meet parent's needs and increase the efficiency of
      pediatric research.

      The primary objective of this study is to measure parental comprehension of informed consent
      information using an innovative undergraduate research assistant program compared to consent
      using the traditional research nurse model. We hypothesize that parental comprehension of the
      informed consent information process when approached by undergraduate students will be
      comparable (or not worse) than when consent is obtained by a research nurse.

    <measure>Parental understanding of informed consent process using a standardized measurement tool, the Deaconess Informed Consent Comprehension Test (DICCT)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day ED visit</time_frame>
    <description>The DICCT is a validated and reliable tool that was developed to assess comprehension of informed consent information among adult study subjects and adapted to measure parental understanding of consent. Parental understanding of the consent process will be measured using a modified Deaconess Informed Consent Comprehension Test (mDICCT), which has previously been used in a pediatric setting. The score on the DICCT will be presented as a mean or median (depending on distribution) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI's). The appropriate parametric (t-test) or non-parametric test will be used to compare the score on the DICCT between the intervention (student enrollment) and the control group (traditional nurse enrollment).</description>
