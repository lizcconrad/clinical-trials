  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tooth loss can be addressed by different rehabilitative strategies. Implant-supported crowns
      and conventional bridges (fixed dental prostheses [FDPs]) are well established treatment
      alternatives. Implant therapy is sometimes impossible, however, because of patient-related
      risk factors or economic issues. In such cases therapy with an FDP requires extensive removal
      of tooth structure to provide enough space for the restoration and to ensure mechanical
      retention if the abutment teeth are sound. Alternatives for rehabilitation requiring minor or
      no preparation of the anchoring teeth are desirable. Resin-bonded bridges meet this demand
      for minimal invasiveness and have been used clinically successfully. Sometimes, however,
      patients choose a conventional FDP over a resin-bonded one (RBFDP) for esthetic reasons since
      the adhesive wings, which are traditionally made of a cobalt-chromium alloy, might be exposed
      while speaking or smiling or account for a colour change of the abutment teeth. Such patients
      profit from an all-ceramic RBFDP. Today, the clinical performance of metal-based and
      all-ceramic RBFDPs has not yet been evaluated under randomized controlled conditions. The aim
      of this pilot study is to calculate the sample size that allows us to accept the hypothesis
      that metal- and all-ceramic RBFDPs are similar regarding their clinical performance with
      adequate statistical power.
