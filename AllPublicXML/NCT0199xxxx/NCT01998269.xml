  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to develop and test a Measure of Drug Self-Management for use in
      clinical settings among patients with hypertension and diabetes.

      While medication non-adherence is a highly recognized public health and patient safety
      concern, it is rarely assessed in a routine and consistent manner in clinical settings. With
      the aging of the US population and rising rates of chronic disease, an increasing number of
      adults are being prescribed multi-drug regimens that require greater self-management skills.
      Despite the complexity of medication use, adherence has most commonly been measured as a
      limited set of behaviors (i.e., filling a prescription, taking doses). This emphasis has,
      over time, simplified how we think of prescription (Rx) medication use and directed attention
      away from the full range of tasks associated with effective Rx self-management. The field of
      health literacy research has deconstructed these tasks in considerable detail in recent
      years, and can offer insight into a more comprehensive measurement of patients' outpatient Rx
      use.

      There is a clear need for a brief, yet inclusive, measure of adherence that can be used in
      clinical settings to routinely assess patients' use of complex Rx regimens. Such an
      assessment could be used to guide clinicians in addressing specific patient challenges to
      safe and appropriate medication use. In response to this need, our study proposes to develop
      a new assessment of medication self-management. This unique measure will utilize health
      literacy best practices to promote patient comprehension and ease-of-use; it will also be
      tailored to patients' actual regimens via electronic health record (EHR) data. Finally, the
      tool will be available in both English and Spanish to support use among diverse patient
      populations. Our study aims are to:

        1. Develop and refine a Measure of Drug Self-Management (MeDS) prototype.

        2. Inform the content, structure and delivery of the MeDS through targeted discussions with
           patients, providers and information technology specialists.

        3. Test the reliability and validity of the MeDS among patients with diabetes and
           hypertension

      H1: The MeDS will strongly correlate with other self-report adherence measures.

    <description>The MeDS is an assessment of medication self-management skills. The MeDS tool has 14 questions, the minimum score is 0 (poor medication self-management skills) and the maximum score is 14 (adequate self-management skills). The internal consistency of the scale is .72 (cronbach's alpha), which is considered adequate internal consistency. The MeDS was compared to The Morisky Medication Adherence Scale is one of the most commonly used assessments of medication adherence. It includes 8 questions that assess various factors that can affect medication use, such as forgetfulness, busyness and side effects. Scores range from 0 to 8, with lower scores reflecting better adherence.</description>
