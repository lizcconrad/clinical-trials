  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The availability of HIV care and treatment programs is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa.
      However more than half the patients who need HIV medicines are still not receiving this
      antiretroviral therapy (ART), and this can lead to early death from AIDS. One of the problems
      in this region is that patients start ART late, after the HIV disease is very advanced. This
      results in high death rates soon after ART initiation. The way clinic-level factors, such as
      the way services and referrals are organized, how referrals are regarded, counseling messages
      and record-keeping, contribute to late ART initiation is unclear. As the second phase of a
      3-phase NIH-sponsored project, this study will identify clinic-level enablers and barriers to
      timely enrollment into HIV care and ART initiation. A cross-sectional qualitative study will
      be conducted at 4 selected HIV care and treatment clinics and the health facilities in which
      they are located in Ethiopia. Data will be collected using 4 methods:

        1. Data abstraction

        2. Key informant interviews with clinic personnel

        3. Observation of post-test counseling sessions in the VCT clinic

        4. Observation of provider-patient interactions in the care and treatment clinic
           Identifying modiﬁable health facility-level predictors of late ART initiation will
           facilitate implementation of interventions, programs and policies that will increase the
           number of patients who enroll in HIV care and initiate ART early. Additionally, results
           will inform the design of the third phase of the NIH-project referenced above.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Although HIV care and treatment programs are scaling up in sub-Saharan Africa,
      more than 50% of patients who need ART are not receiving it and signiﬁcant mortality from
      AIDS persists. One major challenge in this region is high rates of late ART initiation (i.e.,
      in the advanced stages of HIV disease) which results in high rates of mortality soon after
      ART initiation. The clinic-level factors that contribute to late ART initiation are unclear.

      Objective: As the second of a 3-phase NIH-sponsored project, this study aims to identify
      clinic-level enablers and barriers to timely ART initiation.

      Methods: A cross-sectional qualitative study will be conducted at 4 purposively selected HIV
      care and treatment clinics in Ethiopia. Data will be collected using 4 methods:

        1. Data abstraction

        2. Key informant interviews with clinic personnel

        3. Observation of post-test counseling sessions at the voluntary counseling and testing
           (VCT) clinic

        4. Observation of provider-patient interactions in the care and treatment clinic
           Descriptive statistics will be produced from the data abstraction. Content analysis of
           key informant interviews will be conducted. Descriptive summaries will be produced from
           observations. All analyses will focus on identifying within- and across-clinic themes,
           and include triangulation across data collection methods to identify clinic-level
           enablers and barriers to timely ART initiation.

      Expected use of results: Identifying modiﬁable clinic-level enablers and barriers to timely
      ART initiation will facilitate implementation of interventions, programs and policies to
      reduce late ART initiation. Additionally, results will inform the third phase of the
      NIH-project referenced above.

    <description>We will conduct interviews with 4 clinic personnel (16 across the 4 sites) to learn about practices and provider perspectives in the HIV clinic or ancillary clinics such as VCT. The 4 clinic personnel in each site will include: the physician-in-charge, a nurse, one peer educator, and a nurse or community counselor from the VCT clinic. A semi-structured interview guide will be used to query respondents about: procedures for enrolling new clients, conducting active testing, identifying and initiating patients on ART, CD4 monitoring, tracking clients who have missed appointments, support programs, and peer education. We will also aim to understand how each respondent views her/his role, how s/he counsels patients on pre-ART care, and the challenges faced from each one's perspective.</description>
