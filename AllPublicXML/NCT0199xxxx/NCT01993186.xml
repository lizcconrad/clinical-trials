      UX007 is more effective than placebo for the reduction of seizures in patients with Glut1 DS,
      as measured by the reduction from baseline in frequency of generalized or partial-onset
      seizures, including: Generalized Tonic-Clonic, Generalized Tonic, Generalized Clonic,
      Generalized Atonic, Partial/Focal with Secondary Generalization, Myoclonic, Myoclonic Atonic,
      Myoclonic Tonic, Complex Partial/Focal, Absence and Simple Partial/Focal Motor seizures

      STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:

      UX007G-CL201 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, study to
      assess the safety and efficacy of UX007 in Glut1 DS. The study will enroll pediatric,
      adolescent, and adult subjects who are currently not on, or not compliant with a ketogenic or
      other high fat diet. Enrolled subjects are otherwise able to maintain standard of care
      treatment with 1-3 AEDs throughout the duration of the study.

      Beginning with the screening visit, subjects will record seizure frequency during the 6-week
      Baseline Period. If the subject does not meet the seizure count criteria, the subject will be
      considered a screen failure and will not be randomized. At the end of the Baseline Period,
      eligible subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to either UX007 or placebo. Dosing will
      be initiated using a 2-week titration schedule until the subject has reached 35% of total
      daily calories from study drug (~1-4 g/kg/day depending on age). If a subject has not reached
      the target of 35% of total daily calories by the end of the 2-week titration period, dose
      titration should continue until the maximum tolerated dose is reached.

      Phase 2 study will enroll approximately 40 subjects. After the initial 8-week double-blind
      Treatment Period, the open-label Extension Period will begin, wherein all subjects will be
      treated with UX007 through Week 52 of the study. A population-PK analysis at Week 26 will
      provide data on metabolite levels with all subjects on UX007. Following the Week 26 visit,
      approximately the first 40 subjects will participate in a 10-week Dose Exploration Period to
      assess the impact of UX007 dose level on seizure control, other clinical manifestations such
      as movement disorders and cognitive deficits, and tolerability. At the end of the Dose
      Exploration Period, the subject will continue in the open-label Extension period, maintained
      on the UX007 dose (as determined by the Investigator) that provided the maximum improvement
      in clinical status with acceptable tolerability, and continued on this dose for the duration
      of the study. Long term safety and maintenance of effect of UX007 will be assessed during the
      Extension Period.

          9. Has a concurrent disease or condition, or laboratory abnormality that, in the view of
             the investigator, places the subject at high risk of poor treatment compliance or of
             not completing the study, or would interfere with study participation or introduces
