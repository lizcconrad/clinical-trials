  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigate whether ranolazine, a novel anti-anginal agent with antiarrhythmic properties,
      has a role in the management of symptomatic ventricular premature beats.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to compare the effect of ranolazine versus placebo on premature
      ventricular beats (using 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring) for subjects
      with symptomatic palpitations. Subject population will consist of seventy-two adult subjects
      of both sexes who have greater than 1,000 premature ventricular beats during initial
      monitoring.

    <measure>Measure Temperature Rebound Rate (TRR)</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Measure serial change in endothelial function as measured using the VendysÂ® DTM device as measured by fingertip Temperature Rebound (TR) in degrees Celsius. Temperature rebound is measured as the absolute difference between low fingertip temperature during cuff occlusion and maximal temperature rebound following cuff release. In addition, rate of change (slope) in temperature rebound will be calculated, measured as the TR divided by the time from temperature nadir to temperature peak. This will be termed: temperature rebound rate (TRR).</description>

    <description>Subjects will be consented by the study investigator and then randomly assigned in an allocation-concealed fashion to double blinded treatment with either titrated doses of ranolazine or matched placebo. After the initial 6 days of treatment with ranolazine, 500 mg twice daily or matched placebo, subjects will undergo repeat 24 hour electrocardiographic monitoring. If tolerated, the subjects will then have their study medication increased (Ranolazine 1,000 mg twice daily or matching placebo) with the plan to then undergo a repeat 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in 6 days. When the subject returns the monitor, subjects will enter the washout period (cessation of the study medication) for 6 days and have electrocardiographic monitoring prior to return to the subject's referring provider for care.</description>
