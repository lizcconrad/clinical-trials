  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare the difference in the pain score in radial arterial
      puncture using the insulin needle versus the standard 23G hypodermic needle.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a randomised, crossover design, healthy volunteers were recruited to receive bilateral
      radial arterial punctures. They were assigned to receive either the insulin or the standard
      needle as the first puncture using block randomisation. The primary outcome was the pain
      score measured on a 100mm visual analogue scale (VAS) and the secondary outcomes were
      procedural complications and rate of haemolysis.

    <time_frame>Immediately after each puncture ( average within 5 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately following the radial arterial punctures the outcome assessor asked the volunteer to assess the discomfort that was caused by the puncture. The volunteer was asked to place a slash on a 100 mm VAS sheet. The VAS showed &quot;no pain&quot; at 0 mm and &quot;worst pain&quot; at 100 mm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>blood haemolysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after collection</time_frame>
    <description>The serum collected during the punctures was analysed for the amount of free haemoglobin. We define presence of haemolysis as free haemoglobin concentration of more than 100 mg/dL.</description>
