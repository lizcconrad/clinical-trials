      Introduction: bariatric surgery shows an important morbidity and there are some reports that
      have used preoperative intragastric-balloons (IGB-BIB®) to decrease surgical morbidity.

      Patients Methods: Since 2009 we are performing a randomized and prospective study to assess
      the usefulness of (IGB-BIB®) before bariatric surgery [sleeve resection (SR) or gastric
      bypass (GB)] &quot;group A&quot; vs a control group &quot;B&quot; with the same type of surgical procedures but
      without preoperative IGB-BIB. All patients coming for both groups were followed at 4-week
      intervals by a nurse practitioner and dietitian for 6 months, Nurse practitioner made the
      dietetics adjustments (750-1500 Kcal) , provide advice and assess the evolution of weight
      loss The hypothesis was that preoperative IGB-BIB helps the patients to lose weight ( more
      than 10%) ,and the weight loss will contribute to decrease surgical morbidity by at least
      30%, and also will decrease hospital stay Objective: to check if morbidity, mortality and
      hospital stay decreased in the IGB-BIB ® group, and secondly if the weight before surgery was
      associated with surgical morbidity. secondary objective : Assess the rate of IGB-BIB
      failure.Intragastric balloon failure was considered when the weight loss is less than 10%
      from the initial weight. We defined severe complication whenever the patient had to be
      admitted in the hospital after discharge, new surgeries or transfusions were required or the
      hospital stay was longer than 7-10 days.
