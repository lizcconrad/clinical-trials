    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether the nutritional status of patients
      undergoing Functional Jejunal Interposition is better than those with Roux-en-Y After Total
      Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer. To find a better reconstruction for patients who received
      total gastrectomy.

    <textblock>
      Surgery is the only curative way for gastric cancer to date. Methods of Resection and
      reconstruction are closely related to prognosis and nutritional status. Therefore, it is
      essential to choose. At present, more and more clinical centers tend to choose Roux-en-Y (RY)
      reconstruction after total gastrectomy, which are prone to a variety of complications, and
      seriously affects the quality of life, such as malnutrition. There is argument over whether
      functional jejunal interposition is better than those with Roux-en-Y After total gastrectomy
      for gastric cancer. How to improve the nutritional status of the patients following total
      gastrectomy with gastrointestinal reconstruction arouses people's attention. The purpose of
      this study was to evaluate differences of the nutritional status in patients undergoing
      functional jejunal interposition and Roux-en-Y after total gastrectomy.

    <description>First, an end-to-side esophagojejunostomy was performed at 40 cm anal to Treitz's ligament. Then, an end-to-side duodenojejunostomy was created at the efferent limb 35 cm distal to the esophagojejunostomy, followed by a side-to-side jejunostomy at 5 cm distal to duodenojejunostomy and 20 cm distal to Treitz's ligament. Finally, 2 jejunal proper ligations were made at 5 cm oral to esophagojejunostomy and 2 cm distal to duodenojejunostomy.</description>

    <description>The distal end of the duodenum was closed. The jejunum was separated 15-20cm distal to the Treitz's ligament, and an end-to-side esophagojejunostomy was done at the distal side of the jejunum. Then, the continuity of the jejunum was reconstructed with side-to-end jejunojejunostomy at 40-45cm distal to esophagojejunostomy.</description>
