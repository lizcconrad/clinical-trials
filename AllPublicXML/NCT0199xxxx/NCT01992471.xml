      The purpose of this study is to find out what kinds of information people would like to
      receive from a new kind of genetic testing, and how they respond to this new kind of testing.

    <description>This is a single-arm observational study. Subjects with a history of breast cancer who have undergone BRCA1/2 testing and have received uninformative findings will enroll in this study, and then receive pre-test counseling for multiplex testing.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Pre-test Assessment</intervention_name>
    <description>Subjects who consent to the study will complete a pre-test instrument that elucidates their baseline response to genetic testing (BRCA1/2) as measured by the Multidimensional Impact of Cancer Risk Assessment (MICRA), and their current cancer surveillance and prevention behaviors, as well asintentions to undergo surveillance and prevention in the next 6 months. The instrument will either be completed at the time of the counseling for multiplex testing, or by phone within approximately 7 days of sample donation.</description>

    <intervention_name>Pre test Counseling</intervention_name>
    <description>Subjects will receive appropriate pre-test counseling that will describe the range of outcomes that may results from the multiplex testing. The subject will be asked for permission to audiotape the session for later qualitative review. An outline of the pretest counseling that will be provided. In addition to a description of the genes and syndromes being tested, subjects will receive specific education regarding the following categories and subcategories of possible results a. Definitive (informative) results, b. Variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUCS), c. Uninformative negative test results, d. d. Incidental results. Then Post-counseling selection of desired information After counseling, subjects will complete an instrument indicating which genetic test results they wish to receive. They will complete this instrument in the presence of a genetic counselor, so that the subject may ask questions in order to make the choice most consistent with their preferences.</description>

They will also describe the surveillance and prevention behaviors of the preceding 6 months, and their intentions for the next 6 months. Subjects who express a high degree of distress will be offered referral to the Counseling Service, facilitated by Dr. Hay.</description>
