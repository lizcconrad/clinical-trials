  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, randomized, multi-center, open-label, parallel-group study to evaluate
      the progression-free survival during maintenance therapy.

      Eligible patients will be treated within a 12-week induction therapy. Those patients
      achieving CR/PR or SD at 12 weeks and qualifying for maintenance treatment and re-induction
      treatment with all potential drug components, will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive
      chemotherapy plus panitumumab or chemotherapy alone during maintenance. In case of
      progression, re-induction treatment will be started.
