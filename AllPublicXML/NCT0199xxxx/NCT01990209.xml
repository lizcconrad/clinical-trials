  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in 70-90 percent of primary breast tumors and in 75
      percent of breast metastases. There is evidence to suggest that Androgen Receptor (AR) may be
      a target in patients with advanced breast cancer. Breast cancer patients whose tumors do not
      express the ER, PR or HER2 (triple negative) have very few options for treatment. Orteronel
      is being developed as an endocrine therapy for relevant hormone-sensitive cancers such as
      prostrate cancer and breast cancer. Triple-negative metastatic breast cancer patients with AR
      expression could potentially benefit from anti-androgen therapy like orteronel.

      This open-label multicenter study will be conducted in 2 stages.

        -  Lead-in Phase: The first 6 patients treated will be evaluated to confirm the safety and
           feasibility of this regimen. After all 6 patients complete at least 4 weeks of
           treatment, and if no prohibitive toxicities are identified, continuous study treatment
           will begin.

        -  Continuous Study Treatment: Patients will continue to be enrolled into both cohorts
           based on their tumor specificities with a total of 31 patients in Cohort 1
           (ER-/PR-/HER2-/AR+) and 55 patients in Cohort 2 (ER+ and/or PR+/AR+).

      Patients will be evaluated every eight weeks for response to treatment. All patients who
      respond to treatment (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) or have stable disease
      (SD) will continue to receive orteronel until they develop progressive disease (PD) or
      unacceptable toxicity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care

          2. Patients must have MBC that is measurable or evaluable as defined by Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria. Patients with metastases

          3. Patients with breast tumors that are AR+ (≥10% staining by immunohisto-chemistry).
             Archived tumor tissue from a primary biopsy or metastatic lesion for centralized
             determination of AR expression is mandatory. If tissue is limited, the additional
             correlative testing is optional. If tissue is not available, a patient will not be
             eligible for enrollment into the study. Patients may enroll based on local laboratory
             AR assessment, but will need to submit tissue for confirmation at the central
             laboratory.

          4. In addition to having AR+ tumors, patients must fit into 1 of the 2 following
             categories:

                  at least 1 and up to 3 prior chemotherapy regimens in the advanced setting.)

               -  ER+ and/or PR+ (Note: This group of patients must have received at least 1 and up
                  to 3 prior hormonal therapies and at least one prior chemotherapy treatment in
                  the advanced setting. HER2+ patients in this group must have received a minimum
                  of 2 lines of HER2-directed therapy in the advanced setting.) This group of
                  patients may be pre-menopausal with ovarian suppression or post-menopausal. LHRH
                  agonists maybe used to render ovarian suppression with post-menopausal ranges of

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (in patients with
                  known Gilbert Syndrome, a total bilirubin ≤3.0 x ULN, with direct bilirubin ≤1.5
                  x ULN)

         10. Adequate renal function, defined as:
