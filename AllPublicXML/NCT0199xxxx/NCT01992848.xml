  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of mortality in the UK with an
      estimated 80,000 fatalities in 2010. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is associated with
      atherosclerotic plaque burden and cardiovascular mortality. Mechanisms underlying isolated
      CAC have not been as yet been fully explained. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), known to act as regulators
      of gene expression, have also emerged as powerful biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis
      of cardiovascular disorders and may be used in the detection of CAC. We aim to investigate
      the potential for a &quot;microRNA-signature&quot; in patients with CAC by performing a prospective,
      case-controlled study to identify pathways associated with CAC in humans. Previous research
      has demonstrated an inverse relationship between CAC and bone mineral density (BMD),
      suggesting that these processes may be linked. In a further substudy we plan to define the
      relationship between CAC and BMD as well as a number of markers of bone metabolism.

      Patients will be prospectively enrolled whilst attending for elective coronary CT (computed
      tomography) angiography including a coronary calcium score, at the Royal Surrey County
      Hospital. Data regarding demographic and clinical characteristics of patients will be
      collected. Peripheral venous blood sampling will take place on this occasion. Coronary artery
      calcification scores will be estimated by a Radiologist using default software. Patients
      eligible for the bone metabolism substudy will be required to attend the University of Surrey
      for peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT) of bone mineral composition of the
      radius. In the intervening period we will ask them to complete a 4-day food diary and wear a
      UV dosimeter, the latter to assess typical UV exposure, for one week.
