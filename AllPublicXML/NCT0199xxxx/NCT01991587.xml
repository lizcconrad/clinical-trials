      A phase I/II trial conducted in a single centre, observer-blind, randomized, dose-ranging,
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a single
      intramuscular injection of plant-based Seasonal Quadrivalent VLP Influenza Vaccine
      administered to healthy adults 18-49 years of age.

      A total of one hundred and twenty (120) subjects will be randomized in four (4) groups of 30
      subjects to receive one injection of either a low, a medium, or a high dose level of VLP of
      the quadrivalent VLP influenza vaccine or the placebo preparation (100 millimolar (mM)
      phosphate buffer + 150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) + 0.01% Tween 80).

      The Phase 1 portion of this study will be a dose escalation, cohort staggering (slow
      enrollment) for the 3 dose levels (low, medium or high dose level) with a placebo-controlled
      group:

        -  Cohort 1: A first cohort of thirteen subjects (13) subjects will be randomized, of these
           ten (10) will be dosed with the lowest dose of the quadrivalent VLP vaccine and three
           (3) will receive a placebo. The 7-day safety data after the immunization will be
           collected and reviewed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) consisting of the
           Principal Investigator (PI), the Sponsor's Medical Officer and one external medical
           expert, prior to permitting immunization with the medium dose level.

        -  Cohort 2: A second cohort of thirteen subjects (13) subjects will be randomized; of
           these, ten (10) will be dosed with the medium dose of the quadrivalent VLP vaccine and
           three (3) will receive a placebo. The 7-day safety data after the immunization will be
           collected and reviewed by the DSMB, prior to permitting immunization with the highest
           dose.

        -  Cohort 3: A third cohort of fourteen subjects (14) subjects will be randomized; of these
           ten (10) dosed with the high dose of the quadrivalent VLP vaccine and four (4) will
           receive a placebo. The 7-day safety data after the immunization will be collected and
           reviewed by the DSMB. If the 7-day post-immunization safety data of this cohort is
           satisfactory according to the DSMB review, the Phase 2 portion of the study will
           proceed.

      The Phase 2 portion of this study will be an observer-blind, randomized, dose-ranging study
      of the 3 different vaccine doses or a placebo. Therefore, the remaining 20 subjects per
      vaccine dose will be dosed with the remaining 20 subjects of the placebo group.

      Three (3) and 21 days after immunization, key safety (Day 3) and immunogenicity (Day 21) data
      will be collected and analyzed. All subjects will be followed for safety until Day 201
      (6-month follow up), regardless the phase of the study.

             of the Investigator, competence and willingness to provide written, informed consent
             for participation after reading the informed consent form. The subject must have
             adequate opportunity to discuss the study with an Investigator or qualified designee.

          7. If female, have a negative serum pregnancy test result prior to immunization.

          8. Female of childbearing potential (except subjects in a same sex relationship), must
             use an effective birth control for the 28 days prior to immunization and must agree to
             continue employing adequate birth control measures for at least 60 days
             post-immunization and must have no plan to become pregnant for at least 60 days
             post-immunization. Highly effective birth control includes hormonal contraceptives
             (e.g., injectable, topical [patch], estrogenic vaginal ring, etc.), intra-uterine
             device (IUD), abstinence (confirmed by Investigator), or male condom plus spermicide.
             Abstinent subjects should be asked what method(s) they would use, should their
             circumstances change, and subjects without a well-defined plan should be excluded.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled medical or neuropsychiatric
             illness. &quot;Uncontrolled&quot; is defined as:

               1. Requiring a new medical or surgical treatment within one month prior to study
                  vaccine administration;

               2. Requiring a change in medication dosage in one month prior to study vaccine
                  administration due to uncontrolled symptoms or drug toxicity (elective dosage
                  adjustments in stable subjects are acceptable);

               3. Hospitalization or an event fulfilling the definition of a serious adverse event

          2. Any medical or neuropsychiatric condition or any history of excessive alcohol use or
             drug abuse which, in the Investigator's opinion, would render the subject incompetent
             to provide informed consent or unable to provide valid safety observations and
             reporting.

          3. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive condition or immunodeficiency including
             history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, Hepatitis B or C, or the
             presence of lymphoproliferative disease.

          4. Presence of any febrile illness, oral temperature of &gt;38.0˚C within 24 hours prior to
             immunization. Such subjects may be re-evaluated for enrolment after resolution of

             at Day 201. Immunization on an emergency basis of a tetanus and diphtheria toxoids
             adsorbed for adult use (Td) will be allowed provided the vaccine is not administered
             within two weeks prior to study vaccine administration. Receipt of any other emergency
             immunizations (e.g., rabies) will result in a case-by-case review by the medical
             monitor of continued participation.

          7. Administration of any adjuvanted or investigational influenza vaccine other than a
             'simple' seasonal Trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) or Quadrivalent influenza vaccine
             (QIV) within 1 year prior to study enrolment or planned administration prior to the
             end of this trial (Day 201).

          8. Use of any investigational or non-registered product within 30 days prior to study
             enrolment or planned use during the study period. Subjects may not participate in any

             heparin. Persons receiving prophylactic anti-platelet medications, e.g., low-dose
             aspirin [≤ 325 mg/day (1 regular adult aspirin) or ≤ 81 mg/day (1 baby aspirin)], and
             without a clinically apparent bleeding tendency are eligible.

         12. History of allergy to any of the constituents of the quadrivalent VLP study vaccine,
             or to the Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (used as placebo).
