  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration are useful tools for the diagnosis and
      staging of pancreatic cancer. One potential limitation is contamination when needle traverses
      the gastrointestinal tract under continuous negative pressure. Gastrointestinal tract
      contamination can lead to misinterpretation of FNA specimens. We propose a technique to
      eliminate any remaining negative pressure during EUS-FNA and therefore decrease
      gastrointestinal tract contamination. Our hypothesis is that briefly untwisting the syringe
      from the biopsy channel after a specimen is obtained eliminates any remaining negative
      pressure in the FNA needle and therefore reduces GI tract contamination of EUS-FNA specimens,
      and will lead to improved diagnostic accuracy of this important clinical technique.

      Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has evolved into a minimally invasive diagnostic and staging
      method. The addition of fine needle aspiration (FNA) increases the accuracy of EUS in the
      diagnosis and staging of pancreatic malignancies. An ultrasound probe attached to the end of
      the endoscope allows real-time direct visualization by means of ultrasound transmission.
      During the FNA process a needle is advanced through the biopsy channel of the endoscope and
      into the target lesion. In order to obtain a tissue specimen of a suspicious pancreatic
      lesion, an FNA needle must traverse either the stomach or duodenum to access the pancreatic
      mass. Once the needle has entered the target lesion a syringe is exchanged for the needle
      stylet and negative pressure is applied allowing acquisition of a cytology specimen. Negative
      pressure is released from the syringe and the stop cock is closed to the syringe. However,
      due to the relatively long length of the needle there is is significant remaining negative
      pressure at the needle tip. This leads to aspiration of surrounding material including GI
      mucosal contamination into the needle while removing it from the target lesion.

      Contamination of the FNA specimen from gastric or duodenal epithelium can occur with
      continued negative pressure at the needle tip upon withdrawal of the needle out of the target
      lesion. While EUS-FNA has a high specificity (96%), sensitivity (87%), and accuracy (94%),
      gastrointestinal tract contamination can lead to misinterpretation of FNA specimens. Based on
      clinical experience, we propose a technique to eliminate any remaining negative pressure
      during EUS-FNA and therefore decreasing gastrointestinal tract contamination.
