    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open label study is to determine whether combining pracinostat (study
      drug) with Vidaza (azacitidine) or Dacogen (decitabine) will improve clinical responses in
      Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) patients who have failed an initial single agent
      hypomethylating agent (HMA), and to provide additional safety and efficacy data.
