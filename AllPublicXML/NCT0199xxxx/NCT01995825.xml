    <textblock>
      In this study, brand name lamotrigine (LAMICTAL) and generic lamotrigine will be compared in
      patients with epilepsy. Both the brand name and generic lamotrigine are approved by the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) and are commonly used to treat epilepsy. Some physicians and
      patients with epilepsy have believed that brand and generic lamotrigine have had clinically
      significant differences in efficacy and tolerability. The brand name and generic tablets have
      been shown to be the same when blood levels were measured in healthy volunteers without
      epilepsy, but these drugs have not yet been compared in patients with epilepsy. This study
      will do this comparison, by switching patients between brand and generic in a very structured
      manner, and seeing if the drugs are the same, primarily in terms of blood levels. Other
      comparisons will also be made secondarily, looking for any differences in adverse effects and
      seizure control.

      As is commonly done in a bioequivalence study, the null hypothesis is that the generic (i.e.
      test) is bioINequivalent to the brand name (i.e. reference). Hence, the alternative
      hypothesis is that the generic is bioequivalent to the brand name.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is able to provide informed consent.

          -  Subject is male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive.

          -  Subject has a diagnosis of epilepsy with simple partial seizures and/or complex
             partial seizures, with or without secondary generalization or primary generalized
             seizures.

          -  Subject has had a history of at least one seizure and/or AED related adverse event
             with AED changes; or had at least one seizure and/or AED related adverse event over
             the 12 months prior to Visit 1.

          -  Subject has been maintained on a stable dose regimen of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs),
             including lamotrigine at 200mg, 400mg, or 600mg total daily dosage divided BID for at
             least 28 days prior to Visit 1. Additionally, subject must be taking lamotrigine for 8
             weeks prior to Visit 1.
