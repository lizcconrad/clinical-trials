    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively assess the feasibility of high-resolution
      manometry to identify radiation-induced changes in esophageal motility and contractility or
      &quot;function&quot; in patients undergoing radiation therapy for the treatment of locally advanced
      lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As there is no standard of care to evaluate/visualize the effects of radiation therapy (RT)
      -induced esophageal injury, this is routinely assessed by patient reported accounts, and the
      symptoms are then managed supportively (e.g. with pain medicines, parenteral nutrition,
      feeding tubes etc). Manometry has been frequently used to study the effects of RT on
      gastrointestinal function in the setting of numerous malignancies, including colorectal,
      cervical and prostate cancers. What is often seen after RT is decreased sphincter function in
      the anorectal region leading to problems with continence and fecal urgency, however there has
      not been as rigorous of an evaluation of esophageal function after RT.

      One study performed more than 15 years ago included only 4 patients with lung cancer and
      concluded that mucosal irritation was likely the primary cause of RT-associated esophageal
      injury and no abnormalities in motility were seen. Radiation is known to cause long-term
      esophageal injury including stricture, and there is manometric evidence of impaired motility
      long-term after RT. The recent introduction of high-resolution manometry permits more
      extensive evaluation of the effects of RT on esophageal function.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years or older

          -  Absence of any severe disorders of esophageal motility (patients with reflux and/or a
             hiatal hernia are eligible)

          -  Histologically confirmed lung cancer scheduled to undergo conventionally fractionated
             radiation treatment

          -  Patients that will be treated with a minimum of 45 Gy of radiation therapy

          -  Patients with mediastinal nodal disease, or primary lesions that are near the
             esophagus are eligible provided that they are not having esophageal symptoms believed
             to be due to the tumor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of esophageal motility disorder that pre-dates and is unrelated to the present
             diagnosis of lung cancer

          -  History of any prior radiotherapy to the esophagus

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Inability to understand and follow swallowing instructions for the esophageal
             manometry procedure; this is to ensure patient compliance of performing the breath
             hold technique throughout the radiation therapy treatment
