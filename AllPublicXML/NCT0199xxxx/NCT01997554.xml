  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research project, which is realised with the partnership of the enterprise
      Siamed'Xpress (Marseille), is to validate a new TSH diagnostic test in vitro, to allow an
      earlier screening of hypothyroidism. A serum bank will be conserved in the &quot;Centre de
      Biologie Sud&quot; (&quot;Groupement Hospitalier Lyon Sud&quot;).

      The serum samples will be assayed locally for the usual medical support to patients and after
      they will be sent to Siamed'Xpress (Marseille), where they will be assayed with the new
      diagnostic test. The results obtained from the two techniques will be compared.

      The validation of this new TSH test represents a major advancement, since it could bring in
      the future to a therapeutic index which will allow clinicians to treat earlier asymptomatic
      patients with subclinical hypothyroidism.
