  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy is used to treat early stage lymphomas with excellent
      cure rates. However, a significant proportion of these patients develop cancers and heart
      diseases years later as a result of the radiotherapy. Therefore, there is a move to reduce
      radiation exposure without compromising cure rates. Radiotherapy is planned using a CT scan
      taken following chemotherapy when many of the original sites of the lymphoma are no longer
      visible using a CT scan taken following chemotherapy when many of the original sites of the
      lymphoma are no longer visible.

      In order to safely minimise the volume treated with radiotherapy it is necessary to
      accurately reconstruct the extent of the lymphoma prior to chemotherapy on this 'planning' CT
      scan. A PETCT prior to chemotherapy is the best way of demonstrating the original extent of
      the lymphoma, but is taken in a different position to the radiotherapy treatment position.
      This aim of this study is to explore whether a PETCT scan taken prior to chemotherapy in the
      radiotherapy treatment position, in conjunction with advanced software to combine this scan
      with the subsequent radiotherapy planning CT, can be used to more accurately identify the
      lymphoma target. The study aims to recruit up to 20 patients with early stage Hodgkin
      lymphoma or high grade nonHodgkin lymphoma. A routine staging PETCT will be followed at the
      same session by a PETCT in the radiotherapy treatment position appropriate radiotherapy
      immobilisation devices. Participation in the study will not affect treatment decisions or the
      radiotherapy planning process. The PETCT in the radiotherapy planning position will be made
      available to the treating clinicians. The process of planning radiotherapy will not be
      systematically altered by the study. The study is aimed at determining how to improve the
      radiotherapy planning process in the future, in the hope of a reducing in the long term side
      effects of treatment whilst retaining high cure rates.
