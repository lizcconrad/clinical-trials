  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic venous ulceration of the lower limb poses a significant problem to patients and
      healthcare providers alike. 1% of the population of Western countries have either an open or
      healed chronic venous ulcer.

      However, the pathophysiological abnormalities are not entirely clear in how raised venous
      pressure translates into the changes seen in the skin culminating in an open ulcer. The
      standard treatment of this condition in the United Kingdom is to undertaken compression
      bandaging of the lower limb.

      In order to further their knowledge of venous ulceration, the investigators seek to determine
      the biological profile of venous ulcers over a maximum of twenty-eight weeks and by dividing
      the groups into healing and non-healing wounds, the investigators may be able to demonstrate
      a difference in the biological profile.

      This work may provide insights into predicting who will respond to treatment and targets for
      treatment in the future.

      Forty patients with chronic venous ulceration of the lower limb who meet the inclusion
      criteria will be entered into the study and assessed over a twenty week period with
      assessments at week 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 20. Urine, serum and ulcer fluid will be sampled.

      If the ulcer has not healed, further assessments using an approved biological dressing will
      be undertaken at weeks 20, 21, 22, 23, 25 and 28 with further sampling of ulcer fluid, urine
      and serum.

      Samples will undergo metabolic profiling using established metabonomic techniques developed
      at Imperial College.
