  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the genes responsible for osteoarthritis. Individuals with
      osteoarthritis known or suspected to be caused by a gene mutation (change) may be eligible
      for this study. Family members may also participate.

      Patients will talk with investigators who will explain the study and its possible
      implications for the patient and family and answer questions. The patient's medical records
      will be reviewed, a personal and family history will be taken, and a physical examination
      will be done. Two procedures may be done including blood sampling (which will be used for DNA
      (genetic) studies) and X-rays (to define osteoarthritis grade).

      If no known mutations responsible for osteoarthritis will be detected, participating family
      members will be interviewed by telephone about their personal and family health history and
      will have a blood sample drawn for DNA testing, and X-rays.

      We will investigate the clinical manifestations and molecular genetic defects of human
      osteoarthritis. Families with osteoarthritis of known or suspected genetic basis will be
      enrolled. Individuals will undergo clinical assessment and genetic analyses for the purpose
      of: 1) definition and characterization of phenotype, 2) determination of the natural history
      of the disorder, and 3) genotype/phenotype correlation. Genetic linkage studies may be
      performed for disorders in which the genetic bases is not yet known.
