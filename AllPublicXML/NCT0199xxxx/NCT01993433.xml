  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether DRM02 is safe and effective in the
      treatment of plaque psoriasis when applied twice daily for 6 weeks.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, within-subject control, study enrolling 20 subjects with
      plaque psoriasis and designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of
      DRM02.

      Safety will be assessed during the study, through adverse events, local skin responses,
      urinalysis, serum chemistry and hematology laboratory testing, physical examination and vital
      signs.

      Preliminary efficacy will be assessed through the Physician's Lesion Assessment (PLA) and the
      Severity of Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) from only the two plaques identified at the
      baseline visit.
