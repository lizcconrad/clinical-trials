  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In elderly subjects frailty and malnutrition are very common and can lead to
      serious health hazards, increase mortality, morbidity, dependency, institutionalization and a
      reduced quality of life. In Austria, the prevalence of frailty and malnutrition are
      increasing steadily and are becoming a challenge for our social system. Physical training and
      adequate nutrition can invert it.

      Methods/Design: In this randomized, controlled trial 80 malnourished, frail,
      community-dwelling patients (≥ 65 years) are recruited. Additionally, 80 lay volunteers (≥ 50
      years) named buddies are recruited and subsequently trained regarding health enhancing
      physical activity and nutrition in three standardized training sessions. These buddies visit
      the malnourished, frail subjects at home twice a week for about one hour during an initial
      period of 10-12 weeks. While participants allocated to the intervention group (n=40) conduct
      intervention to improve their fluid intake, their protein and energy intake, perform strength
      training and try to increase their baseline activities, the control group (n=40) only gets
      home visits without any special intervention. After 10-12 weeks, both, the intervention and
      the control group, receive the nutrition intervention and the physical training. Health,
      nutrition and frailty status, physical fitness and body composition and chronic inflammation
      of buddies and frails are recorded before the intervention, after 10-12 weeks, and after 6
      and 12 months.

      Discussion: To the investigators knowledge this trial is the first of its kind to provide
      nutrition and physical activity intervention to malnourished, frail, community-dwelling
      subjects by trained lay buddies, in which the health status of buddies is also expected to
      improve. This study assesses the effectiveness of such an intervention. If successful, the
      intervention offers new perspectives for the management of frailty and malnutrition.

    <description>Muscle strength is assessed by the MASS (Measurement of age and sex related reference values of muscle strength) and the Concept dyno 2. The MASS is a new diagnosis system which was developed by the Technical University of Vienna. It evaluates health related concentric dynamic muscle strength. The measurement is velocity-independent and hence, is appropriate for the target group. Three exercises (bench press, bench pull, and leg press) will be conducted in standardized procedure. For all tested muscle groups the following parameters are recorded: maximum resistance with low velocity and 2-3 fix adjusted sub-maximum loads. Moreover, the Concept 2 dyno is used for assessing the muscle strength. The same exercises as before will be conducted in standardized procedure and the results are analyzed according to the reference values</description>
