      Primary aim: To determine the efficacy of two dosing regimens of TXA initiated in the
      prehospital setting in patients with moderate to severe TBI (GCS score ≤12).

      Primary hypothesis: The null hypothesis is that prehospital administration either of two
      dosing regimens of TXA in patients with moderate to severe TBI will not increase the
      proportion of patients with a favorable long-term neurologic outcome compared to placebo,
      based on the GOS-E at 6 months.

      Secondary aims: To determine differences between TXA and placebo in the following outcomes
      for patients with moderate to severe TBI treated in the prehospital setting with 2 dosing
      regimens of TXA:

        -  Clinical outcomes: ICH progression, DRS at discharge and 6 months, GOS-E at discharge,
           28-day survival, frequency of neurosurgical interventions, and ventilator-free,
           ICU-free, and hospital-free days.

        -  Safety outcomes: Development of seizures, cerebral ischemic events, myocardial
           infarction, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary thromboembolism.

        -  Mechanistic outcomes: Alterations in fibrinolysis based on fibrinolytic pathway
           mediators and degree of clot lysis based on TEG.

      Inclusion: Blunt and penetrating traumatic mechanism consistent with TBI with prehospital GCS
      ≤ 12 prior to administration of sedative and/or paralytic agents, prehospital SBP ≥ 90 mmHg,
      prehospital IV or intraosseous (IO) access, age ≥ 15yrs (or weight ≥ 50kg if age is unknown),
      EMS transport to a participating trauma center.

      Exclusion: GCS=3 with no reactive pupil, estimated time from injury to hospital arrival &gt;2
      hours, unknown time of injury, clinical suspicion by EMS of seizure activity or known history
      of seizures, acute MI or stroke, CPR by EMS prior to randomization, burns &gt; 20% TBSA,
      suspected or known prisoners, suspected or known pregnancy, prehospital TXA given prior to
      randomization, subjects who have activated the &quot;opt-out&quot; process when required by the local
      regulatory board.

      A multi-center double-blind randomized controlled trial with 3 treatment arms:

        -  Bolus/maintenance: 1 gram IV TXA bolus in the prehospital setting followed by a 1 gram
           IV maintenance infusion initiated on hospital arrival and infused over 8 hours.

        -  Bolus only: 2 grams IV TXA bolus in the prehospital setting followed by a placebo
           maintenance infusion initiated on hospital arrival and infused over 8 hours.

        -  Placebo: Placebo IV bolus in the prehospital setting followed by a placebo maintenance
           infusion initiated on hospital arrival and infused over 8 hours.

      1. Overview This multi-center, Phase II trial is designed to determine if Tranexamic Acid
           (TXA) initiated in the prehospital setting improves long-term neurologic outcome
           compared to placebo in patients with moderate to severe TBI who are not in shock. This
           study protocol will be conducted as part of the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC)
           at trauma centers in the United States and Canada. ROC is funded by the National Heart
           Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) in partnership with the US Army Medical Research and
           Materiel Command (USAMRMC), Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Heart &amp; Stroke
           Foundation of Canada, the American Heart Association (AHA), and the Defense Research and
           Development Canada. ROC is a clinical trials network focusing on research primarily in
           the area of prehospital cardiopulmonary arrest and severe traumatic injury. The mission
           of ROC is to provide infrastructure and project support for clinical trials and other
           outcome-oriented research in the areas of cardiopulmonary arrest and severe traumatic
           injury that lead to evidence-based change in clinical practice.

        2. Specific Aims/Hypothesis Statement 2.1 Clinical Hypotheses and Aims

           Specific aim 1: To compare 6-month neurologic outcome between subjects in the
           bolus/maintenance arm, subjects in the bolus only arm, and subjects in the placebo arm
           by evaluating the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score (GOS-E) at 6 months post-injury.

           Primary Hypotheses: We will perform a one-sided test of the following null hypotheses:

             -  Prehospital administration of a 1 gram intravenous (IV) TXA bolus followed by a 1
                gram IV TXA maintenance infusion over 8 hours (bolus/maintenance arm) does not
                increase the proportion of subjects with a favorable neurologic outcome (GOS-E &gt; 4)
                compared to placebo, versus the alternative that this treatment increases the
                proportion of subjects with a favorable outcome.

             -  Prehospital administration of a single 2 gram IV TXA bolus (bolus only arm) does
                not increase the proportion of subjects with a favorable neurologic outcome (GOS-E
                &gt; 4) compared to placebo, versus the alternative that this treatment increases the
                proportion of subjects with a favorable outcome.

           Specific aim 2: To assess differences in morbidity and mortality measured from
           randomization through 28 days or initial hospital discharge between subjects in the
           bolus/maintenance arm, bolus only arm, and placebo arm.

           Secondary Hypotheses: The null hypotheses are that there will be no difference between
           subjects in the bolus/maintenance arm, bolus only arm, and placebo arm in the following:
           both absolute and relative volume of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) progression,
           proportion of subjects with ICH progression, frequency of neurosurgical interventions,
           GOS-E measured at discharge, Disability Rating Scale score (DRS) measured at discharge
           and 6 months, 28-day survival, and ventilator-free, intensive care unit (ICU)-free, and
           hospital-free days.

           Specific aim 3: To assess differences in adverse events measured from randomization to
           initial hospital discharge between subjects in the bolus/maintenance arm, bolus only
           arm, and placebo arm.

           Tertiary Hypotheses: The null hypotheses are that there will be no difference between
           subjects in the bolus/maintenance arm, bolus only arm, and placebo arm in the following:
           proportion of subjects experiencing seizures, cerebral ischemic events, myocardial
           infarction (MI), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), or pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) post
           randomization through 28 days or discharge, whichever occurs first.

           2.2 Laboratory Hypotheses and Aims

           Specific aim 1: To compare coagulation profiles over time using kaolin activated
           thrombelastography (TEG) results between subjects in the bolus/maintenance arm, bolus
           only arm, and placebo arm.

           Primary hypothesis: The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference in the
           degree of fibrinolysis as assessed by percentage of clot lysis determined 30 minutes
           after the maximum amplitude is reached (LY30) between subjects in the bolus/maintenance
           arm, bolus only arm, and placebo arm.

           Specific aim 2: To explore the underlying mechanism of TXA by comparing fibrinolytic
           pathway mediator activity between subjects in the bolus/maintenance arm, bolus only arm,
           and placebo arm.

           Secondary hypothesis: The null hypothesis is that there will be no change in
           fibrinolytic pathway mediator activity as measured by the TEG lysis time 30 minutes
           after maximum amplitude (LY 30) between subjects in the bolus/maintenance arm, bolus
           only arm, and placebo arm.

           Specific aim 3: To estimate the association between the degree of fibrinolysis based on
           kaolin activated TEG results and fibrinolytic pathway mediators on primary and secondary
           clinical outcomes.

           Tertiary hypothesis: The null hypothesis is that no association will exist between the
           degree of fibrinolysis and fibrinolytic pathway mediators and primary and secondary
           clinical outcomes.

        3. Study Enrollment EMS agencies will carry blinded sealed study drug kits. Once the seal
           is broken in the presence of the patient, the patient is randomized. The EMS study drug
           kit will contain a vial of either 1 gram TXA, 2 grams TXA, or placebo. EMS will mix the
           study drug in a 250 mL bag of 0.9% sodium chloride and administer the bolus infusion as
           soon as life-saving interventions are performed. After randomization, EMS will provide
           the study drug kit ID# to the receiving pharmacy. The hospital pharmacist will obtain
           the randomization assignment from the coordinating center and prepare the appropriate
           drug to be administered in the hospital.

        4. Sample Size and Statistical Analysis The total sample size is 1002 (334 per group),
           which will allow for 80% power to detect an 8.1% absolute difference in favorable
           long-term neurological outcome as determined by the GOS-E 6 months after injury for each
           of the true TXA-placebo comparisons, using a one-sided, level 0.1 test.

           Statistical analysis of primary hypothesis: Modified intention-to-treat analysis using
           logistic regression to test for association and estimate the strength of the association
           of treatment group with a favorable 6-month outcome (defined as a GOS-E &gt; 4), after
           adjustment for study site.

        5. Human subjects protection This study qualifies for the exception from informed consent
           (EFIC) required for emergency research outlined in FDA regulation 21CFR50.24. EFIC
           applies because of life-threatening situation, intervention must be administered before
           consent is feasible, no reasonable way to identify prospectively individuals at risk,
           patients have the prospect of benefit from the treatment, and the research could not
           practically be carried out without the waiver of consent.
