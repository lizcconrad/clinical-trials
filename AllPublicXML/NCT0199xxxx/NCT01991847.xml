  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of a one year exercise training
      program in post-surgical patients with colorectal cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apart from a genetic predisposition lifestyle factors (low physical activity, nutrition, and
      obesity) increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Furthermore, in observational studies
      increased physical activity has shown to improve the prognosis in patients after the
      diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, there are currently no prospective randomized
      controlled trials which prove the causal relationship between exercise and prognosis in
      colorectal cancer patients. The long-term aim of this study is to evaluate whether physical
      activity of ≥ 18 MET-h (Metabolic equivalent task-hours) per week significantly improves
      disease free survival in colorectal cancer survivors (stage UICC II/III). In the first
      instance, structure-, process- as well as outcome-characteristics need to be investigated
      within a feasibility study (F-PROTECT). Essential aims are to establish collaborations with
      clinics and training centres, to achieve the required recruitment numbers, and to conduct the
      training intervention.
