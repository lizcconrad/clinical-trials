  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, phase 1b study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of
      DNIB0600A in participants with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (PSOC) or Non-Squamous
      Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). The maximum tolerated dose of intravenously infused
      DNIB0600A in combination with carboplatin will be determined in escalating dose cohorts. The
      combination of DNIB0600A and carboplatin will then be evaluated with and without bevacizumab
      [Avastin] in three dose expansion cohorts.

             fallopian tube cancer that is platinum sensitive.

          -  PSOC (i.e., epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube
             cancer) with documented radiographic progression or relapse within 6 to 18 months of
             most recent platinum-based chemotherapy.

          -  Toxicity (except alopecia and anorexia) from prior therapy or neuropathy of grades &gt;
             1.

          -  Evidence of any significant disease or condition that could affect compliance with the
             protocol or interpretation of results.

          -  Known active infection (except fungal nail infections).

          -  History of liver disease or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  Other malignancy within the last 5 years, except for adequately treated or controlled
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix or skin cancer or primary endometrial cancer of stage
             &lt;/= 1B.

          -  Untreated or active central nervous system (CNS) metastases.

          -  Prior treatment with NaPi2b- targeted therapy.

        Bevacizumab-Specific Exclusion Criteria (for Participants in Second Ovarian

        Expansion Cohort Only):

          -  Inadequately controlled hypertension or history of hypertensive crisis or
             encephalopathy.

          -  History of heart problems or thrombosis within 6 months prior to study start.

          -  History of stroke within 6 months prior to study enrollment.

          -  History of significant vascular disease.

          -  History of expectoration of blood within 1 month prior to study start or blood
             clotting problems.

          -  Core biopsy or other minor surgical procedure within 7 days prior to study start

          -  Serious and non-healing wound, active ulcer, or untreated bone fracture.
