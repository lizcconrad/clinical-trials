        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is suffering from pathologically confirmed T1-T2, N0, M0 prostate
             adenocarcinoma.

          -  Patient is intended to receive radiation therapy (3D-computerized radiotherapy,
             intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and/or brachytherapy) and this will be the first
             prostate or pelvic radiation therapy.

          -  Patient is intended to receive SpaceOAR™ Gel therapy.

          -  The patient is official patient of the clinical investigator in the study centre.

          -  Patient agrees to fully participate in the clinical trial and give informed consent in
             writing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anatomic abnormality, physical or pathological condition precluding the implantation.

          -  Failure in the wall of the perineum room (with the risk that the hydrogel escapes).

          -  History of prostate surgery or local prostate cancer therapy.

          -  Rectal injury before implantation of SpaceOAR™ Gel or history of or active
             inflammatory rectal disease such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

          -  History of or current perirectal or anal disease or surgery such as prolapsed or
             bleeding haemorrhoids or fistula.

          -  Compromised immune system (e.g., HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, auto¬immune
             disease or immunosuppressive therapy).

             laboratory range.

          -  Contraindication for safe MRI and CT scans.

          -  Patient is not able to fully participate in this study including the follow-up (e.g.
             for mental or geographical reasons, or patient is intravenous drug user or has strong
             potential for non-compliance to medical regimes).

          -  Patient is mentally unable to understand the nature, aims, or possible consequences of
