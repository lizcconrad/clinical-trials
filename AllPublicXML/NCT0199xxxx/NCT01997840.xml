    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have a documented diagnosis of multiple myeloma and have relapsed-and-refractory
             disease. Patients must have received at least 2 lines of prior therapies. Patients
             must have relapsed after having achieved at least stable disease (SD) for at least one
             cycle of treatment to at least one prior regimen and then developed progressive
             disease (PD). Patients must also have documented evidence of PD during or within 60
             days (measured from the end of the last cycle) of completing treatment with the last
             anti-myeloma drug regimen used just prior to study entry (refractory disease)

          -  Must have undergone prior treatment with at least 2 cycles of lenalidomide and at
             least 2 cycles of a proteasome inhibitor (either in separate regimens or within the
             same regimen)

          -  Must not be a candidate for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), has declined the
             option of ASCT, or has relapsed after prior ASCT

          -  Must have measurable levels of myeloma paraprotein in serum (≥ 0.5 g/dL) or urine (≥
             0.2 g/24 hours)

          -  Must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0, 1,
             or 2

          -  Females of child bearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 10 - 14 days prior to,
             and again within 24 hours of starting pomalidomide and must either commit to continued
             abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth
             control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME
             TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking pomalidomide. FCBP must also agree to
             ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact
             with a FCBP even if they have had a vasectomy. All patients must be counseled at a
             minimum of every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal exposure.
             Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control
             Methods,and Education and Counseling Guidance must be followed per protocol

          -  Must be able to take acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (81 or 325 mg) daily as prophylactic
             anticoagulation. Patients intolerant to ASA may use low molecular weight heparin.
