    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, multiple dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group, Bayesian adaptive, dose response study in subjects with chronic insomnia.
      Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 6 doses of E2006 (1 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, or 25
      mg) or placebo.

      The study will have 2 phases, Prerandomization and Randomization. The Prerandomization Phase
      will last up to 21 days and will consist of a Screening Period (Days -21 to -2) and a
      Baseline Period (Day -1). Following the Baseline Period, all eligible subjects will be
      randomized, in a double-blind manner, to receive E2006 or placebo for 15 nights during the
      Treatment Period (Days 1 to 15), then all subjects will receive placebo, in a single-blind
      manner, for 2 nights (Days 16 to 17) during the Rebound Insomnia Assessment Period (Days 16
      to 18). Subjects will not receive any treatment during the Follow-up Period (Days 19 to 29).
      All subjects will come to the clinic for screening procedures. During the Screening Period,
      subjects will complete the Sleep Diary each day. Polysomnographic sleep will be measured
      during the Screening Period on 2 consecutive nights between Day -9 and Day -3. These 8-hour
      polysomnograms (PSGs) will start at the median habitual bedtime calculated from responses on
      the Sleep Diary completed 7 days immediately prior to the first PSG night. Subjects may leave
      the clinic between the screening/baseline PSG nights.
