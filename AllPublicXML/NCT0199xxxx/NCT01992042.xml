  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        The study population will consist of patients with localized prostate cancer that have
        elected radical prostatectomy as a primary treatment. Eligible patients will have prostate
        cancer that is Gleason Score ≥ 7.

        Patients who meet all of the following inclusion criteria will be eligible to participate
        in this study:

          1. Men &gt;18 and &lt; 75 years of age

          2. Willing and able to provide informed consent, either alone or with the aid of a
             translator

          3. Histologically confirmed prostate cancer as determined by transrectal ultrasound
             (TRUS) guided prostate biopsy performed within 6 months of study enrolment

          4. Prostate cancer that is Gleason grade ≥ 7 involving at least 30% of one unfragmented
             biopsy core

          5. Candidates for radical prostatectomy considered surgically resectable, either open or
             robotic, by urologic evaluation

          6. Normal organ and marrow function as defined by the following criteria:

             i. absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/uL

             ii. platelets &gt;100,000/uL

             iii. total bilirubin &lt;1.5 X institutional ULN

             iv. AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) &lt;1.5 X institutional ULN

             v. creatinine &lt;1.5 X institutional ULN

          7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1

        Exclusion Criteria

        Any patient meeting one or more of the following exclusion criteria may not be entered into
        the study:

          1. Previous or current use of neo-adjuvant or hormonal management of prostate cancer
             (surgical castration or other hormonal manipulation, including GnRH receptor agonists,
             GnRH receptor antagonists, anti-androgens, estrogens, megestrol acetate and
             ketoconazole)

          2. History of receiving radiation to the pelvic area

          3. Past or current use of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors finasteride and/or dutasteride

          4. History of bilateral orchiectomy, adrenalectomy, or hypophysectomy

          5. Statin use within 2 years of prostate cancer diagnosis

          6. Known hypersensitivity towards any component of the investigational medicinal product.

          7. Previous history or presence of another malignancy, other than prostate cancer or
             treated squamous / basal cell carcinoma of the skin, within the last five years

          8. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (e.g. severe renal or hepatic
             impairment) which in the judgment of the Investigator would affect the patient's
             health or the outcome of the trial

          9. Clinically significant disorder (other than prostate cancer) including, but not
             limited to, renal, haematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, cardiac, neurological,
             or psychiatric disease, and alcohol or drug abuse or any other condition, which may
             affect the patient's health or the outcome of the trial as judged by the Investigator

         10. Use of natural medicines thought to have endocrine effects on prostate cancer (e.g.
             saw palmetto and St. John's Wort) 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

         11. Use of any drug listed in Prohibited Medications List

         12. Mental incapacity or language barrier precluding adequate understanding or co
             operation

         13. Use of an investigational drug within the last 28 days preceding the Screening Visit
             or longer if considered to possibly influence the outcome of the current trial

         14. Patients who are unable or unwilling to undergo MRI testing
