  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, adaptive study will
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of crenezumab versus placebo in individuals who carry the
      PSEN1 E280A autosomal-dominant mutation and do not meet the criteria for mild cognitive
      impairment due to AD or dementia due to AD and are, thus, in a preclinical phase of AD.
      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either crenezumab or placebo
      subcutaneously (every 2 weeks) or intravenously (every 4 weeks) for at least 260 weeks. The
      switch to the intravenous (IV) dose will be optional (as per participant decision). The study
      will also include a cohort of PSEN1 E280A mutation non-carriers who will be dosed with
      placebo only.

             more weeks prior to screening. Short-term, peri-operative use of anti-coagulants may
             not result in discontinuation from the study; however, any such use must be discussed
             with the Medical Monitor

          -  Treatment with any biologic therapy within five half-lives or 3 months prior to
