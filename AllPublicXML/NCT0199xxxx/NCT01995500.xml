    <textblock>
      The NIREUS study aims to demonstrate angiographic non-inferiority for the BioNIR
      Ridaforolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System (hereafter referred to as BioNIR) in comparison
      to the Resolute zotarolimus-eluting stent (hereafter referred to as Resolute).

      The trial hypothesis is that the BioNIR is non-inferior to the Resolute for the primary
      endpoint of angiographic in-stent late loss at 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, single-blind, two-arm, 2:1 randomized clinical trial.

      Randomization will be stratified by the presence of medically treated diabetes vs. no
      medically treated diabetes and by site. Lesions planned to be treated must be declared and
      recorded at time of randomization.

      Angiographic follow-up will be performed at 6 months. Clinical follow-up will be performed at
      30 days, 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years post randomization.

      The Primary Endpoint is in-stent late loss at 6 months as measured by the angiographic core
      laboratory.

      Angiographic Secondary Endpoints to be evaluated at 6 months are:

        -  In-segment late loss

        -  Follow-up percent diameter stenosis (in-stent and in-segment)

        -  Binary restenosis (in-stent and in-segment)

        -  Length and patterns of angiographic restenosis (Mehran classification)

      Clinical Secondary Endpoints to be evaluated at 30 days, 6 months, and 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
      years, except as noted, are:

        -  Device, Lesion, and Procedure Success at time of baseline procedure

        -  Target lesion failure (TLF; the composite of cardiac death, target vessel-related MI, or
           ischemia-driven TLR)

        -  Major adverse cardiac events (MACE; the composite rate of cardiac death, any MI or
           ischemia-driven TLR)

        -  Target vessel failure (TVF; the composite rate of death, target vessel-related MI, or
           ischemia-driven TVR)

        -  Overall Mortality

        -  Cardiac Death

        -  Myocardial Infarction

        -  Target Vessel Related MI

        -  Ischemia-driven TLR

        -  Ischemia-driven TVR

        -  Stent Thrombosis (ARC definite and probable)

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Patient with an indication for PCI including angina (stable or unstable), silent
             ischemia (in absence of symptoms a visually estimated target lesion diameter stenosis
             of ≥70%, a positive non-invasive stress test, or FFR ≤0.80 must be present), NSTEMI,
             or recent STEMI. For STEMI the time of presentation to the first treating hospital,
             whether a transfer facility or the study hospital, must be &gt;24 hours prior to
             randomization and enzyme levels (CK-MB or Troponin) demonstrating that either or both
             enzyme levels have peaked.

          -  Non-target vessel PCI are allowed prior to randomization depending on the time
             interval and conditions as follows:

             a. During Baseline Procedure: i. PCI of non-target vessels performed during the
             baseline procedure itself immediately prior to randomization if successful and

             Grade 3 flow, no dissection ≥ NHLBI type C, no perforation, no persistent ST segment
             changes, no prolonged chest pain, no TIMI major or BARC type 3 bleeding.

             b. Less than 24 hours prior to Baseline Procedure: i. Not allowed (see exclusion

        hours after the non-target vessel PCI. If cardiac biomarkers are initially elevated above
        the local laboratory upper limit of normal, serial measurements must demonstrate that the
        biomarkers are falling.
