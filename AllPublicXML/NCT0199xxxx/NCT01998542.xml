  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of personalized
      anti-cancer vaccine AlloVax(TM) in Subjects with confirmed recurrent or metastatic squamous
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) who cannot be treated with surgery, chemotherapy
      or radiation. AlloVax(TM) is a personalized anti-cancer vaccine combining Chaperone Rich Cell
      Lysate (CRCL) as a source of tumor antigen prepared from patient's tumor and AlloStim(TM) as
      an adjuvant. The combination of CRCL and AlloStim(TM) is designed to provide all the key
      components necessary to develop tumor-specific immunity creating the inflammatory environment
      necessary to overcome the HNC immunosuppressive environment, breaking tumor immune tolerance,
      and provision of specific HNC antigens for generation of a specific adaptive anti-tumor
      response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled study. The subjects and
      investigators will be blinded as to treatment arm. All accrued subjects will undergo tumor
      harvest procedures. The tumor samples will be processed into personalized Chaperone Rich Cell
      Lysate (CRCL) vaccine. Subjects are assigned 3:1 ratio to AlloVax(TM) (CRCL with
      AlloStim(TM)) or to placebo control arms. Both arms will receive best supportive care. Arm 1
      will receive AlloVax(TM) (the intradermal injection of AlloSim(TM) followed immediately by
      the intradermal injection of CRCL) weekly for 3 weeks followed by intravenous infusion of
      AlloStim(TM) in week 4 (cycle 1). Arm 2 will receive AlloVax(TM) placebo weekly for 3 weeks
      followed by an intravenous infusion of AlloStim(TM) placebo in week 4 (cycle 1). This
      experimental treatment schedule will continue for 4 cycles.
