    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is one the main neurodegenerative disease with an incidence of about
      3% in patients older than 65 years. Anesthesia in PD patients has been focused by several
      studies for concerning the interactive reaction between anesthetics and anti-Parkinsonian
      medication or Parkinsonian symptoms. However, our previous experience showed that the
      patients undergoing pulse generator placement were more prone to be involved in delayed
      emergence in the recovery room, which had been not reported yet. We speculated that PD
      patients might be a special population with abnormal pharmacodynamic characters of
      anesthetics, though no related evidence could be found to support this hypothesis. Therefore,
      in this project we investigated whether remifentanl requirement to inhibit patients' response
      to trachea intubation and skin insertion in PD patients undergoing DBS and pulse generator
      placement was different from non-PD patients undergoing intracranial surgery for reasons
      other than PD.
