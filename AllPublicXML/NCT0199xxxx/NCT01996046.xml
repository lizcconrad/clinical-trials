    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate baseline uptake on a FDG PET/CT scan in patients with breast cancer
      that has spread to the bones. A repeat FDG PET/CT scan will be done 4 weeks after the start
      of new breast cancer hormone treatment and again at 12 weeks after treatment start. The
      baseline uptake and change in uptake after the repeat scans will be compared to clinical long
      term outcomes such as time to progression and overall survival. In addition the uptake will
      be compared to the incidence of skeletal related events that are common occurrences in
      patients with cancer that has spread to the bones.

      This is an observational study as all patients will receive the same research diagnostic
      test, an FDG PET/CT study performed at 4 weeks after starting new hormone treatment.

             consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines

        Exclusion Criteria:
