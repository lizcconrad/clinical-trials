      The purpose of Phase 1 of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and assess the
      safety, tolerability and activity of oprozomib in combination with pomalidomide and
      dexamethasone in subjects with primary refractory or relapsed and refractory multiple
      myeloma.

      The purpose of Phase 3 of the study is to compare the key outcome measures for subjects with
      primary refractory or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who are randomized to either
      oprozomib or placebo in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone.
