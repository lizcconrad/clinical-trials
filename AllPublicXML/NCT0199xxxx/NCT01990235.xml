      The objective of this proposal is to test whether a multi-media website
      (www.prepareforyourcare.org) that is focused on preparing older adults for communication and
      medical decision making can help people engage in advance care planning.

    <textblock>
      PREPARE is a website (www.prepareforyourcare.org) that teaches patients how to identify what
      is most important in life, how to communicate their preferences to clinicians and loved ones,
      and how to make informed decisions. It is written at a 5th grade level and includes
      voice-overs of text and closed captioning of videos that model advance care planning
      behaviors. The goal of this proposal is to test the efficacy of PREPARE plus an easy-to-read
      advance directive, versus an advance directive alone, to improve patient engagement in
      multiple advance care planning behaviors including discussions with surrogate decision makers
      and clinicians in addition to advance directive completion. The investigators will also
      determine whether PREPARE can empower and activate patients within clinical encounters with
      their clinicians and help to decrease health disparities in advance care planning.

    <measure>Change in engagement in advance care planning behavior using validated surveys at 12 months from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Engagement in 5 behaviors that is a composite outcome of ACP engagement.
Advance Directive completion - An advance directive form, a living will, a durable power of attorney for health care, Physicians Orders of Life Sustaining Treatment, or other documentation, such as code status.
Advance care planning discussions with surrogates - Asking someone to be a surrogate, talking about goals for medical care, whether to grant leeway, or discussions relating to medical decision making or prognosis.
Advance care planning discussions with clinicians - Discussions concerning a surrogate, goals for medical care, whether to grant surrogates leeway, or discussions relating to medical decision making or prognosis.
Inform others (friends/family member identified as important) - Discussions about advance care planning-related topics
Ask doctors questions - risks, benefits, options.
These behaviors will be measured using validated surveys on a 1 to 5 scale.</description>

    <description>Investigators will measure the following, which will be extracted from one validated survey:
Advance care planning behavior change
Self-efficacy with advance care planning behaviors
Engagement in medical decision making
Satisfaction with medical decision making
Surrogate-reports of patient engagement in advance care planning</description>

    <description>The PREPARE arm will review the PREPARE website plus the easy-to-read advance directive (AD). Participants will review PREPARE on their own for ≥ 20 minutes with staff present to answer questions. During PREPARE, participants answer preference questions and make an action plan (i.e., commitment to engage in advance care planning). To ensure home access to PREPARE content, participants will be given a website login and PREPARE content in digital video disc (DVD), booklet, and pamphlet format as well as the action plan and AD. One to three days before a primary care visit, the PREPARE arm will receive a reminder to come to their appointment and to bring their action plan.</description>

    <description>The Control arm will review an easy-to-read AD. Controls will review the AD for ≥ 15 minutes with study staff present to answer questions and will take the AD home to complete if desired. One to three days before a primary care visit, controls will receive a reminder to come to their appointment.</description>

    <description>At week 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, interviews (telephone or in person based on preference) by blinded staff will assess engagement in advance care planning(ACP), self-efficacy with ACP, and activation in and satisfaction with decision making. Blinded telephone interviews will also assess surrogate reports of patient engagement in ACP.</description>
