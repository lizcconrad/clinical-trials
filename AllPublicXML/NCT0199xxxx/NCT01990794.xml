  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate steady-state cobalt levels following dietary
      supplementation for 90 days with 1 mg cobalt/day (as cobalt chloride in solution) in healthy
      adult volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the counter cobalt (Co) dietary supplements are available for sale in the United States,
      but little is known regarding their clinical effects and biokinetic distribution and body
      burden with long-term use. This study assessed blood kinetics, steady-state levels,
      biochemical responses, and clinical effects in five adult males and five adult females who
      voluntarily ingested approximately 1.0 mg Co/day of a commercially available Co supplement
      over a three month period. Volunteers were instructed to take the Co-dietary supplement in
      the morning according to the manufacturer's label. Blood samples were collected and analyzed
      for a number of biochemical parameters before, during, and after dosing. Hearing, vision,
      cardiac, and neurological functions were also assessed in volunteers before, during, and
      after dosing.

    <description>The fraction of albumin bound cobalt in serum was determined one to two weeks pre-dosing and on the day of the first dose before taking the supplement. Samples were also analyzed during the dosing period as follows: Day 4/5, Day 8/9, Day 14/16, Day 22/23, Day 29/30, Day 43/44, Day 57/58, Day 71/72, Day 88/90 and the fraction of albumin bound cobalt in serum was also determined at one and two weeks post-dosing.</description>

    <measure>Effects on the Immune System</measure>
    <time_frame>0 weeks and three months</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity to metals before and after cobalt supplementation was assessed by an in vitro lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) performed at week 0 and after three months of cobalt supplementation. The average proliferation rate for each metal treatment was normalized to individual proliferation rates of untreated control cells which generated a stimulation index (SI). According to the manufacture, the SI ranges from 0-15, with an SI from 2 to 4 indicated mild reactivity, from 5 to 8 indicated moderate reactivity, and &gt;8 indicated high reactivity to the metal. The data is presented as the averaged normalized lymphocyte transformation response to each metal in men and women combined (n = 10).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, at the study midpoint, and at the study completion</time_frame>
    <description>Audiologic assessments including pure tone threshold determination at frequencies ranging from 250 to 16000 Hz were performed with volunteers serving as their own baseline controls for receptive changes during the study (i.e., week 0, ~day 45, ~day 90). Audiologic assessments including a pure-tone threshold determination at frequencies that ranged from 250 to 16000 Hz were performed with volunteers serving as their own baseline controls for receptive changes during the study. Decreases in hearing were considered clinically significant when one of the following 3 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria were met: 1) a ≥20-dB decrease in the pure-tone threshold at one test frequency, 2) a ≥10-dB decrease at 2 adjacent test frequencies, or 3) the loss of 3 consecutive test frequencies where responses were previously obtained.</description>

        <description>Sensitivity to metals before and after cobalt supplementation was assessed by an in vitro lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) performed at week 0 and after three months of cobalt supplementation. The average proliferation rate for each metal treatment was normalized to individual proliferation rates of untreated control cells which generated a stimulation index (SI). According to the manufacture, the SI ranges from 0-15, with an SI from 2 to 4 indicated mild reactivity, from 5 to 8 indicated moderate reactivity, and &gt;8 indicated high reactivity to the metal. The data is presented as the averaged normalized lymphocyte transformation response to each metal in men and women combined (n = 10).</description>

        <title>Changes in Audiological Function</title>
        <description>Audiologic assessments including pure tone threshold determination at frequencies ranging from 250 to 16000 Hz were performed with volunteers serving as their own baseline controls for receptive changes during the study (i.e., week 0, ~day 45, ~day 90). Audiologic assessments including a pure-tone threshold determination at frequencies that ranged from 250 to 16000 Hz were performed with volunteers serving as their own baseline controls for receptive changes during the study. Decreases in hearing were considered clinically significant when one of the following 3 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria were met: 1) a ≥20-dB decrease in the pure-tone threshold at one test frequency, 2) a ≥10-dB decrease at 2 adjacent test frequencies, or 3) the loss of 3 consecutive test frequencies where responses were previously obtained.</description>

          <title>Changes in Audiological Function</title>
          <description>Audiologic assessments including pure tone threshold determination at frequencies ranging from 250 to 16000 Hz were performed with volunteers serving as their own baseline controls for receptive changes during the study (i.e., week 0, ~day 45, ~day 90). Audiologic assessments including a pure-tone threshold determination at frequencies that ranged from 250 to 16000 Hz were performed with volunteers serving as their own baseline controls for receptive changes during the study. Decreases in hearing were considered clinically significant when one of the following 3 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria were met: 1) a ≥20-dB decrease in the pure-tone threshold at one test frequency, 2) a ≥10-dB decrease at 2 adjacent test frequencies, or 3) the loss of 3 consecutive test frequencies where responses were previously obtained.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The primary limitation of our study was its small sample size. We believe the study was sufficiently robust because we evaluated effects on hematologic and thyroid variables, both of which have been identified as sensitive markers of cobalt exposure.</limitations_and_caveats>
