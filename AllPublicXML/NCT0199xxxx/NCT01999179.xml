  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the pilot study is to determine if a multicenter prospective cohort study of
      cancer patients with blood clots associated with catheters is feasible. Cancer patients with
      catheter-related thrombosis treated with one month of anticoagulation will be evaluated for
      for post-thrombotic syndrome. Laboratory biomarkers will be evaluated as predictors of
      recurrent thrombosis.

      Participants may be referred for screening at Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) in two
      possible mechanisms: participant contact study staff from information on Clinical Trials
      Science Institute (CTSI) FACT website or referral from treating Hematologist or Oncologist.
      At MCW, an EPIC report will be generated to identify people with catheter related thrombosis
      (CRT). The treating provider would then be contacted to determine if referral to the study
      was appropriate. At University of Minnesota (UMN), referral will be through treating
      Hematologist or Oncologist. Subjects at Ohio State University (OSU) will be referred from the
      treating Hematologist or Oncologist. A report generated in Epic will be used to identify
      people with CRT. The treating provider would then be contacted to determine if referral to
      the study was appropriate. Participants will be given printed information about the study or
      verbal explanation using the informational flyer. Verbal consent will be obtained to be
      screened for participation and contacted by study personnel. Screening will be completed by
      BloodCenter of Wisconsin (BCW) nurse coordinator. We aim to consent and enroll patients after
      diagnosis of catheter-related thrombosis and prior to catheter removal. Consent and
      enrollment (Visit 1) must occur prior to discontinuation of anticoagulation. Enrollment will
      be limited to patients undergoing anticoagulation with enoxaparin due to decreased recurrent
      thrombosis rates in cancer patients treated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) compared
      to warfarin. Additionally, enoxaparin is the only FDA approved LMWH for the treatment of
      venous thrombosis. The study will follow patients treated with anticoagulation for one month
      after catheter removal. Prior to discontinuation of anticoagulation, patients will be
      contacted via telephone to review study protocol, assess for bleeding, and arrange for Visit
      2 in the following 1-2 weeks. Visits 3 and 4 will occur 3 and 6 months after catheter
      removal, respectively. At visits 3 &amp; 4, Medical history, cancer history, and medications will
      be updated. At each visit, participants will be assessed for post-thrombotic syndrome using
      the modified Villalta scale and functional limitation using the DASH questionnaire. At MCW,
      surveys will be administered by the Translational Research Unit (TRU) staff and physical
      examination will be completed by BCW nurse coordinator. At UMN, surveys will be administered
      by CTSI staff and physical examinations will be completed by UMN nurse coordinator. At OSU,
      surveys will be administered by research coordinators and physical examination will be
      administered by research nurse coordinator. Laboratory samples will be obtained for MCW
      participants only.
