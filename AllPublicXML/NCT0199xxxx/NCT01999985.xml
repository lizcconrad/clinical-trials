    <time_frame>Up to 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Estimate the objective response rate (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]), and clinical benefit rate, in participants with acquired EGFR resistance. Response Criteria for Phase 1B will follow RECIST v.1.1: Complete Response (CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD.</description>
