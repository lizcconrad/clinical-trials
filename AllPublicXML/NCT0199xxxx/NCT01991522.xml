  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is a commonly used medical procedure. Medical and surgical residents learning
      colonoscopy typically learn the procedure experientially but simulation based teaching is
      increasingly being integrated into training programs. The optimal manner to teach colonoscopy
      on virtual-reality simulators is uncertain. We aim to test a curriculum in simulation-based
      colonoscopy with self-directed learning on simulators.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Transfer of skills to clinical colonoscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>less than 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is the transfer of learned skills to real-patient colonoscopies after completion of the training intervention, as assessed by blinded expert endoscopists using the Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS), a validated task-specific performance measure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention of clinical skills</measure>
    <time_frame>4-6 weeks after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome is performance during an integrated scenario, a test of transfer wherein the participant performs a colonoscopy while interacting with a standardized patient. This will occur 4-6 weeks after the interventions and will be assessed by expert endoscopists using validated task-specific scoring schemata for technical skills, communication skills and global scales.</description>

    <description>The curriculum group will undergo a comprehensive curriculum in colonoscopy utilizing a virtual reality (VR) colonoscopic simulator. This curriculum involves 6 hours of interactive, small-group didactic teaching on colonoscopy interlaced with 8 hours of supervised one-on-one endoscopy VR simulation training with experienced endoscopists.</description>
