  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Differences in human oral sensitivity for caproic, lauric, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic
      acids will be explored. Prior work indicates that there may be a learning effect in measuring
      detection thresholds for free fatty acids. This study is designed to determine the number of
      visits necessary to attenuate this learning effect and also to test whether this effect
      continues across different types of fatty acids or is specific to each fatty acid. This will
      aid in understanding how many visits are required to obtain reliable data and if less
      expensive fatty acids can be used to attenuate learning before testing thresholds for more
      expensive fatty acids.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oral sensitivity to oleic, lauric, linoleic, linolenic and caproic acids measured by the ascending 3 alternative forced choice test as described in American Society and Testing and Methods E679</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at weekly intervals over 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Thresholds for taste of each fatty acid will be determined using the 3 alternative forced choice test. Participants will taste 3 samples, one of which contains a fatty acid, and select which sample they believe is different. The concentration of fatty acid used will range from very dilute to a maximum of 5%. The test is repeated over the range of concentrations until a participant is able to correctly identify the fatty acid or until the maximum concentration is reached.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>DNA sequence of potential fatty acid receptors (e.g., CD36, GPR120, GPR48)</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be collected at the final visit of the study, approximate 2-3 months from participant enrollment depending on how frequently the participant is able to come to the lab</time_frame>
    <description>Saliva will be collected to analyze any correlations between fatty acid receptor genes and sensitivity.</description>

    <description>A survey will be administered to determine each participant's habitual dietary fat intake</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of hunger</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be measured at every study visit (21 visits plus 1 screening visit) over the 2-3 months of the study</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will rate how hungry they are on a line scale because commencing each study threshold test</description>
