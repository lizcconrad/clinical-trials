  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the preliminary efficacy and
      safety of venetoclax (ABT-199) administered orally in participants with acute myelogenous
      leukemia (AML).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of venetoclax administered
      orally in participants with relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)
      or frontline therapy in patients with AML who were unfit for intensive therapy. The secondary
      objective was to evaluate the preliminary safety of venetoclax administered orally in
      patients with AML. The first portion of the study was to consist of 19 participants with the
      objective of evaluating anti-tumor effects and confirming the safety of the regimen. The
      second portion (expansion) was to consist of 35 additional subjects to evaluate anti-tumor
      effects and safety and was to commence if an adequate efficacy signal (i.e., ≥ 5/19 achieved
      complete remission [CR], CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery [CRi] or partial remission
      [PR]) had been observed in the first portion of the study. The criterion for success would
      have been met if ≥ 16 of 54 participants achieved remission. The efficacy signal from first
      portion of the study was deemed insufficient for enrollment into the second portion of the
      study, as 4 of the 19 subjects achieved CR/CRi. During the trial, a number of participants
      were in screening at the point of the interim analysis. Given the early signs of clinical
      activity of venetoclax, disease severity, and prognosis of these participants without
      available options for therapy, they were allowed to initiate treatment ahead of completion of
      the interim analysis. Therefore, 32 participants were enrolled. No additional participants
      were screened or treated after the interim analysis was completed.

    <time_frame>When 19 participants had completed at least 12 weeks of treatment or after all enrolled participants had discontinued venetoclax, whichever was earlier</time_frame>
    <description>The objective remission rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi), or partial remission (PR) per the International Working Group criteria for AML. Complete remission (CR) was defined as peripheral neutrophils at least 10˄3/μL, platelets ≥ 10˄5/μL and normocellular bone marrow with ≤ 5% blasts. Complete remission with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi) was defined as bone marrow with less than 5% blasts, with peripheral neutrophils of at least 10˄3/μL or platelets ≥ 10˄5/μL. Partial remission (PR) was defined as normalization in peripheral blood neutrophil and platelet counts with at least a 50% decrease in blasts persisting in bone marrow versus baseline.</description>

        <title>Objective Remission Rate</title>
        <description>The objective remission rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi), or partial remission (PR) per the International Working Group criteria for AML. Complete remission (CR) was defined as peripheral neutrophils at least 10˄3/μL, platelets ≥ 10˄5/μL and normocellular bone marrow with ≤ 5% blasts. Complete remission with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi) was defined as bone marrow with less than 5% blasts, with peripheral neutrophils of at least 10˄3/μL or platelets ≥ 10˄5/μL. Partial remission (PR) was defined as normalization in peripheral blood neutrophil and platelet counts with at least a 50% decrease in blasts persisting in bone marrow versus baseline.</description>
