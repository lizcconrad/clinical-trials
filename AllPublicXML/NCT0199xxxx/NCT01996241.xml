  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cluster Randomised Control Trial is evaluating an intervention to support adolescent
      girls from marginalised communities in northern Karnataka State, South India to complete
      secondary school, thereby reducing their vulnerability to HIV infection from early marriage
      and entry into sex work at young ages. The intervention will test innovations to address both
      supply and demand side barriers to girls' completion of secondary school, and will have
      long-term educational and livelihood benefits, in addition to reducing vulnerability to HIV.

      School-based constraints will be addressed by improving academic outcomes through teacher
      training and academic support to students; addressing gender-related and skill-based gaps
      among teachers; training of local female teachers; and increasing the content knowledge of
      secondary school teachers. Demand side barriers will be addressed by reducing economic
      pressures that households face to withdraw girls' from school; building appreciation and
      value of girls' education; building family and community accountability for school
      attendance; creating safe spaces for girls and strengthening their agency; and engaging boys
      in promoting and supporting girls' education.

      Primary stakeholders will include teachers and students, especially adolescent girls in the
      school (7th to 10 the standard) from marginalized communities. Secondary stakeholders will
      include school development and management committees (SDMCs), families, boys and the
      communities that are served by the schools. 80 village clusters (40 intervention; 40 control)
      were randomly selected from 125 village clusters in Bagalkot and Bijapur districts. The
      intervention will be implemented with village communities and high schools in 40 village
      clusters in Bagalkot and Bijapur districts. The intervention will be implemented in
      collaboration with the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT),
      Karnataka; the Adolescent Education Cell, Government College of Teachers' Education (CTE),
      Jamkhandi; and the Institute for Advanced Studies in Education (IASE), Gulbarga.

    <description>Outcomes will be measured through a cluster RCT conducted in 80 village clusters (40 intervention; 40 control) in Bijapur and Bagalkot districts in north Karnataka. All lower caste (scheduled caste/tribe) adolescent girls living in the selected village clusters and attending 7th standard (final year of primary school) will be recruited into the study in two consecutive waves, one academic year apart. Girls (n=2100) will be interviewed at baseline (year 8) and at end-line two years later (end of year 10). The interview will comprise a interviewer administered face-to-face questionnaire plus a short self-completed questionnaire (containing sensitive questions). Interviews will be conducted in private in the study participant's home. Observers assessing the outcomes will be blinded to group assignment. The primary outcomes will be an adjusted, cluster-level intention to treat analysis, comparing outcomes in intervention and control villages.</description>

    <description>Due to delays at the start of the cluster-RCT, the intervention had not started when cohort one girls were interviewed. This outcome will be assessed using data from cohort two girls only, using the face-to-face questionnaire. To reduce recall bias, we will use data collected at the first interview (baseline) to measure this outcome.</description>
