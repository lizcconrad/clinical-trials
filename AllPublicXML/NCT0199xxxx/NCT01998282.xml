  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DelAgua Health and Development, Manna Energy and the Rwanda Ministry of Health are
      collaborating on a project financed by carbon credits that will distribute household-based
      water filters and high-efficiency cook stoves to approximately 600,000 households in Rwanda.
      Prior to the full roll out of the campaign, the implementers are conducting research in
      connection with a distribution among 2000 households in western Rwanda. The objective of this
      matched cohort study (Phase 1B)are to investigate whether the filters and stoves delivered in
      October 2012 are still performing and in use, to determine whether they are associated with
      reductions in exposure to pathogens from drinking water and stoves, and to assembly
      information on health and other conditions necessary for the design of a large scale health
      impact evaluation.

        Lower income (ubudehe groups 1 and 2) householders from 18 villages (9 intervention and
        matched controls) in 11 designated Districts in Rwanda: Rutsiro, Karongi, Ngororero,
        Nyamasheke, Nyabihu Districts of Western Province (excluding part of the district to the
        north of the Ruhengeri road); Rubuvu District (excluding part of the district to the north
        of the Ruhengeri road); Nyaruguru, Nyamagabe, Muhanga, and Ruhango Districts in Southern
        Province; Gakenke District in Northern Province.

        Households will be eligible to participate in the study if they reside in selected villages
        and are willing to participate after receiving complete details regarding the study.
        Intervention households must have a functioning stove and water filter in order to
        participate, though they do not need to be in regular use. We will enroll all households
        with a child under 5 years of age if they are in Ubudehe groups 1 or 2.
