      Patients will undergo at baseline and regular intervals:

        -  clinically indicated bloodwork/urine and echocardiogram testing

        -  biomarker studies

      Upon enrolment in the study patients will be divided into 4 groups normal, mildly deficient
      and severely deficient. Normal and mild vitamin D levels will receive no treatment while
      severe Vitamin D deficiency will be randomized (50/50) to receive no treatment or vitamin D
      treatment. They will be seen in the heart failure clinic every 6 months. The patients will be
      followed for 26 months.

        -  &gt;18 years of age

        -  hypercalcemia

        -  known hypersensitivity to Vitamin D

        -  patient unwilling to comply with study requirements

           over a period of 6 months
