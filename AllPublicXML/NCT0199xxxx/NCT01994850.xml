             discussion with the Regulatory-Sponsor/Principal Investigator and medical monitor, and
             if the performance status is believed to be secondary to lymphoma related symptoms and
             performance status is expected to improve once chemotherapy commences.

          -  Capable of understanding the investigational nature, potential risks and benefits of
             the study, and able to provide valid informed consent. In patients who are not able to

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine beta human
             chorionic gonadotropin (b-hcG) pregnancy test result within 7 days prior to the first
             dose of brentuximab vedotin and must agree to use an effective contraception method
             during the study and for 30 days following the last dose of study drug; females of
             non-childbearing potential are those who are post-menopausal for more than 1 year or
             who have had bilateral tubal ligation or hysterectomy.

          -  Males who have partners of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective
             contraceptive method during the study and for 6 months following the last dose of
             study drug.

          -  Must be able to comply with the study and follow-up requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous use of investigational agents, chemotherapyor immunotherapy for lymphoma any
             time prior to enrollment (i.e. must have untreated disease). Prior allogeneic or
             autologous transplants are also not allowed.

          -  Current concomitant chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy other than as
             specified in the protocol. Consolidative radiation therapy (RT) after completion of
             planned course and/or concurrent intrathecal chemotherapy for CNS disease prophylaxis
             is permissible.

          -  Treatment with systemic steroids for &gt; 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 of study
             therapy. Prior radiation therapy, with the exception of an abbreviated course (not
             more than 3 days) if used for SVC syndrome.

          -  History of serious organ dysfunction or disease involving the heart (left ventricular
             ejection fraction &lt; 50%; unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction within 6 months
             prior to randomization, congestive heart failure NYHA III-IV, and arrhythmia unless
             controlled by therapy, with the exception of extra systoles or minor conduction
             abnormalities.), the kidney (creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min), the liver (chronic
             hepatitis B as defined below or elevated AST, ALT or alkaline phosphase &gt; 3 ULN; serum
             bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN; bilirubin up to 3 x ULN is permitted in individuals with
             documented liver involvement by lymphoma or if due to known Gilbert syndrome) ot other
             organ system that may place the patient at undue risk to undergo treatment.

             treatment.

          -  Significant concurrent disease, illness or psychiatric disorder that would compromise

             or interpretation of study results.

          -  Subjects who have current active hepatic or biliary disease (with exception of
             patients with Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver involved with

             with active symptoms or sequelae.

          -  Other malignancy, unless the patient has been disease-free for at least 3 years
             following the completion of curative intent therapy, with the following exceptions:
             Treated non-melanoma skin cancer, any in situ carcinoma, or cervical intraepithelial
             neoplasia, regardless of the disease -free duration, are eligible for this study if
             definitive treatment for the condition has been completed.Organ-confined prostate
             cancer with no evidence of recurrent or progressive disease based on prostate-specific
             antigen (PSA) values are also eligible for this study if hormonal therapy has been
             initiated, or radical prostatectomy or definitive prostate irradiation has been
             performed.

          -  Positive test for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) unless undetectable viral
             load within 3 months of enrollment (HIV RNA less than 48 copies/mL) and on HAART
             therapy.

          -  Positive serology for hepatitis B (HB) defined as a positive test for hepatitis B
             surface antigen or hepatitis B core antibody.

          -  Active involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) by lymphoma. Work-up for CNS
             involvement at diagnosis will be directed as per the treating physician and will
             depend on specific clinical circumstances (no brain imaging or lumbar puncture is
             required by this protocol).
