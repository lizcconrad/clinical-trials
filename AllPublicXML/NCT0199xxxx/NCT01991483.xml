    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of LY2928057 and how LY2928057 affects hemoglobin in
      hemodialysis participants. This study will involve multiple doses of LY2928057 given during a
      6 week period either after a participant discontinues or reduces treatment to stimulate red
      blood cells. This study will last up to 26 weeks for each participant.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants having end-stage renal disease (ESRD), have received an erythropoiesis
             stimulating agent (ESA) at least weekly for 2 weeks prior to screening, and have been
             receiving adequate maintenance hemodialysis (3 times weekly) for at least 12 weeks
             prior to screening (that is, an approximate Kt/V greater than 1.1 (K equals dialyzer
             clearance of urea, t equals dialysis duration time, V equals volume of distribution of
             urea, which is approximately equal to the participant's total body water) based on the
             clinical judgment of participant's nephrologist and investigator and who are willing
             to stop (Parts A and B) or reduce (Part C) their stable ESA dose from the week of
             randomization until completion of the 6-week treatment period (unless rescue therapy
             is needed)

          -  Have a hemoglobin value (taken prior to dialysis if taken on a dialysis day) greater
             than or equal to 9.5 grams per deciLiter (g/dL) and less than or equal to 12.5 g/dL at
             screening

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 45 kilograms per square meter (kg/m^2)
             inclusive at screening

          -  Have a transferrin saturation (TSat) greater than or equality to 15 percent and
             ferritin greater than 40 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any cause of anemia other than renal disease

          -  A history of hyporesponsiveness to ESA
