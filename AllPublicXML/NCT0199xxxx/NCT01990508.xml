  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 15% of the US population is enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
      Program (SNAP), and 50% are children. Although the goal is to improve nutritional health,
      preliminary data suggest that enrollment in SNAP is associated with obesity and metabolic
      risks and that SNAP reimburses $4 billion annually for sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). This
      pilot project tests an innovative strategy to reduce purchase of non-nutritive, SSBs by
      low-income families with children by combining targeted point-of-purchase education with a
      randomized trial of financial incentives to discourage purchase of unhealthy beverages. The
      study will take place at a mid-size grocery store that is located in a low-income, Latino
      community and where 30% of purchases are made with SNAP. Targeted beverage education will be
      provided to all study subjects with a traffic-light system to identify healthy and unhealthy
      beverages at the point-of-purchase. Individual beverage purchases will be tracked by
      electronically stored cash register sales. Supplementary validation of beverage consumption
      will be assessed by 24 hour dietary recall. Aim 1 is to conduct a randomized controlled trial
      to compare purchase and consumption of SSBs by families assigned to a financial incentive to
      reduce purchase of SSBs with families assigned to control (no incentives). Aim 2 is to
      compare the purchase of SSBs by families in both arms during the study period when they are
      exposed to the traffic-light system to a baseline period prior to traffic-light education.
      Results of this project will provide pilot data for larger scale interventions to promote
      healthy choices among low-income families.
