        <title>Geometric Mean Titre (GMT) in Subjects After Receiving One or Two Doses of Either QIVc, TIV1c or TIV2c</title>
        <description>Immunogenicity of QIVc to comparator TIV1c (For A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B1 strain, the comparison was between QIVc and TIV1c and for B2 i.e. alternate B strain, the comparison was between QIVc and TIV2c) was assessed in terms of GMT in subjects (Previously vaccinated and Not previously vaccinated) measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, three weeks after last vaccination with one or two doses of either QIVc, TIV1c or TIV2c.
Non-inferiority was established if the upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of GMTs (GMT TIV1c or TIV2c /GMT QIVc) for HI antibody does not exceed the non-inferiority margin of 1.5.</description>

        <population>Analysis was done on Per Protocol (PP) Population i.e. all subjects in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) efficacy/immunogenicity population correctly received the vaccine, had no major protocol deviations leading to exclusion as defined prior to unblinding/analysis and are not excluded due to other reasons defined prior to unblinding or analysis</population>

          <description>Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of number (%) of subjects (Previously vaccinated and Not previously vaccinated) showing seroconversion or significant increase in HI antibody titers, three weeks after last vaccination with one or two doses of either QIVc, TIV1c or TIV2c For A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B1 strain, the comparison was between QIVc and TIV1c and for B2 i.e. alternate B strain, the comparison was between QIVc and TIV2c Seroconversion was defined in subjects seronegative at baseline (i.e., HI titer &lt;1:10 at Day 1) as postvaccination HI titer ≥1:40, and defined in subjects seropositive at baseline (i.e., HI titer ≥1:10 at Day 1) as a minimum of a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination HI titer.
The Center for Biologics Evaluation, Research, and Review (CBER) criterion for an adult population is that the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion for HI antibody should meet or exceed 40%</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects Reporting Unsolicited AEs After One or Two Doses of Either QIVc, TIV1c or TIV2c by Overall Age Group</title>
        <description>Safety was assessed in terms of number of subjects (Previously vaccinated and Not previously vaccinated) reporting unsolicited AEs (day 1 to 22 for Previously vaccinated and day 1 to day 50 for Not previously vaccinated subjects), serious adverse events (SAEs), medically attended AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal from the study, new onset of chronic diseases (NOCDs), and concomitant medications (day 1 to day 181 for Previously vaccinated and day 1 to day 210 for Not previously vaccinated subjects) after receiving one or two doses of either QIVc, TIV1c or TIV2c. For A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B1 strain, the comparison is between QIVc and TIV1c and for B2 i.e. alternate B strain, the comparison was between QIVc and TIV2c.</description>
