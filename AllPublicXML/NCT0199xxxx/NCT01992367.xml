  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind study to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of single ascending doses (SAD) and multiple ascending doses (MAD) of
      ASLAN003 in healthy subjects

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind study involving SAD and
      MAD of ASLAN003 in healthy subjects.

      The study is divided into two parts:

        -  Part A: SAD cohorts and 1 cohort to assess food effect of ASLAN003 PK.

        -  Part B: MAD cohorts with one cohort being of healthy elderly subjects.

      There will be a sentinel pair of subjects for each of SAD Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 who will be
      dosed first and then the same dose will be given to the rest of the subjects in the
      respective cohorts.

      In addition, 8 subjects will receive ASLAN003 under both fed and fasted conditions

             requirements of the study;

          -  male subjects aged between 21 and 50 years, inclusive (Part A and Cohorts 5, 6 and 7
             of Part B only); male subjects and female subjects of non childbearing potential aged
             â‰¥55 years (Cohort 8 of Part B only);

          -  body mass index (BMI) in the range of 18 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive;

          -  healthy, as determined by pre study medical history, physical examinations, vital sign
             measurements, electrocardiogram (ECG; 12 lead reporting RR, PR, QRS, corrected QT
             [QTc] and QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formulas [QTcF])
             recordings with no evidence of clinically relevant medical disorders based on the
             opinion of the Investigator;

          -  whose out-of-normal range clinical laboratory test results are not clinically relevant
             and are acceptable to the Investigator;

          -  male subjects must be willing to use barrier contraception during sexual intercourse,
             i.e. condoms, even if their partners are post-menopausal, surgically sterile or are

             3 months after the last dose administration;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The exclusion criteria for all subjects are as follows:

             evaluation, procedures or completion;

          -  existence of any surgical or medical condition which, in the judgement of the
             Investigator, may interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion
             of the IP;

          -  clinically significant history or evidence of any active or suspected bacterial,
             viral, fungal or parasitic infection within the 30 days prior to randomisation (e.g.

          -  known history or evidence of active or latent tuberculosis infection (e.g. positive
             tuberculin skin test showing induration &gt;5 mm or positive tuberculin blood test) in
             absence of previous Bacillus Calmette Guerin vaccination, or recent exposure (within 6
             months prior to randomisation in this study) to an individual with active tuberculosis
             or with intention to travel to a country with a high risk of tuberculosis during the
             study period (including the follow up period);

          -  history of autoimmune disease including but not limited to lupus, rheumatoid
             arthritis, autoimmune thyroid disease and immune thrombocytopenia;

          -  with QT or QTcF values higher than 450 ms at screening;

          -  history of regular alcohol consumption (within 6 months prior to randomisation in this
             study), defined as: an average weekly intake of greater than 21 units or any average
             daily intake of greater than 3 units. One unit is equivalent to a half pint (220 mL)
