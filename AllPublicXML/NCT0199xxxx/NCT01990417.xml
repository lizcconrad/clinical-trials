      The present study aimed to analyze the influence of passive stretching before and after
      strength training on flexibility of the hamstrings in people who work out

      Question: Does passive stretching before and after strength training effect the flexibility
      of the hamstrings in people who work out?

      Design: Intervention study in humans

      Participants: 40 healthy student volunteers, ranging in age from 18 to 35 years old, who work
      out.

      Intervention: The Wells bench was used to assess the flexibility of the hamstring muscle. In
      this test, a person sits on a mat, with the soles of both feet maintaining contact with a
      box. The top of the box has an indicator marked in centimeters that is used to measure
      flexibility by how far the person can push the indicator without bending the legs. The knees
      of the seated person are extended while the hips are flexed. The subject is then asked to
      take a deep breath, and during exhalation, flex the trunk forward with the upper limbs
      extended.

      The upper limbs are supported by a bench of 23 cm long aligned with a tape measure over the
      bench. During flexion of the trunk, the right hand is placed over the left and the tips of
      the fingers touch the indicator on top, and move it forward as far as possible.

    <description>After evaluation, the participants were randomly divided into four groups: A, B, C and D. Group A. stretched before and after workout ; group B stretched only before workout; group C stretched only after workout; and group D did not stretch at all.
Passive stretching of the hamstrings was performed only once, lasting 30 seconds, and initiated on the right leg. Participants were in supine position with head, trunk and arms aligned along the body. The researcher remained ipsilateral to the subject´s leg being stretched and applied external force to the limit tolerated by the participant. The researcher performed a hip flexion, knee extension, and dorsiflexion of the ankle while the opposite leg remained extended on the ground.</description>
