      The purpose of this study is studying icotinib following chemotherapy to see how well it
      works compared to chemotherapy in treating patients with resected stage IIA-IIIA NSCLC
      harboring EGFR mutation.

      Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for routine use in patients with fully resected stage
      IIA-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) show great efficacy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutation. Icotinib is a novel EGFR-TKI developed by a group of
      Chinese scientists. In the phase III ICOGEN trial, icotinib had non-inferiority efficacy to
      gefitinib with better safety. In phase II trial, chemotherapy followed by 6-month gefitinib
      as adjuvant therapy can confer longer disease-free survival compared with chemotherapy alone
      in patients with resected stage IIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR mutations.
      This study is to studying 6-month or 12-month icotinib following chemotherapy to see how well
      it works compared to chemotherapy in treating patients with resected stage IIA-IIIA NSCLC
      harboring EGFR mutation.
