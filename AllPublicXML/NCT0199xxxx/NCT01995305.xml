  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fanconi anemia is a rare autosomal or sex linked recessive genetic disease. The disease is
      characterized by bone marrow hematopoiesis failure, multiple congenital abnormalities, and
      susceptibility to neoplastic diseases. The cells of FA patients are extremely sensitive to
      MMC and DEB. The symptoms and ages of FA patients are different, so by comparing the exome of
      FA patients and their parents, the mutations that were accumulated in FA patients could be
      found, and these genes might be sensitive to repairment and be important for hematopoiesis
      maintainance.

      Heterogeneity of FA. In the research of animal model, the phenotypes of FANCA, FANCC and
      FANCG knockout mice are similar. They grow up and develop normally, without any severe blood
      disease or tumor. However, they show chromosome instablity and highly sensitivity to MMC. And
      they have gonadal dysfunction and fertility defects. From this we conclude that the severe
      physical deformity of FA patients might be induced by other mutations. By comparing among the
      FA patients and between FA patiens and normal people, we look forward to find the mutated
      genes and verify their relationship with the physical deformity.

      Even in 90% of FA patients the bone marrow failure will eventually occur, but the starting
      age ranges from 8-84. And Immuno-inhibition therapy has no effects on FA. Other DNA repair
      dysfunction diseases have higher rate of tumor, but not so high rate of bone marrow failure
      as FA does, which implies that the FA protein has the key role in hematopoietic stem cell
      maintainance. In FancC-/- mice, young mice is insensitive to DNA crosslinks with comet assay,
      but not adult mice, indicating that the accumulation of DNA damage during time leads to DNA
      repairment defects. by comparing the exome of FA patients and their parents, the mutations
      that were accumulated in FA patients could be found, and these genes might be sensitive to
      repairment and be important for hematopoiesis maintainance.

    <description>he exome is the part of the genome formed by exons, coding portions of genes in the genome that are used in the synthesis of proteins, therefore, it is most likely to contribute to the phenotype of an organism. The exome of the human genome, is estimated to comprise 1.5% of the total genome (The human exome is about 30 MB).</description>
