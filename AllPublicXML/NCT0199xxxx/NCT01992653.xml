  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study will evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with
      rituximab or obinutuzumab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (CHP chemotherapy)
      in participants with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Participants will receive escalating doses
      of polatuzumab vedotin intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks in combination with standard doses of
      rituximab plus CHP chemotherapy (R-CHP) or obinutuzumab plus CHP chemotherapy (G-CHP).
      Participants will be treated for a total of six or eight cycles in accordance with local
      institutional practice. Two parallel treatment arms will explore doses of polatuzumab vedotin
      in combination with R-CHP or G-CHP. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2
      dose (RP2D) of polatuzumab vedotin in combination with R-CHP will be identified before it is
      combined with G-CHP. Once the MTD or RP2D is determined, polatuzumab vedotin will be dosed at
      MTD or RP2D -1 in combination with G-CHP to start the dose escalation of this combination.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2

          -  Adequate hematologic function (unless inadequate function is due to underlying
             disease, as established by extensive bone marrow involvement or is due to
             hypersplenism secondary to the involvement of the spleen by lymphoma per the
             investigator)

          -  Agreement to use highly effective contraception measures. Women of childbearing
             potential must agree to remain abstinent or use contraceptive measures that result in

             12 months for R-CHP arm or for at least 18 months for G-CHP arm after the last dose of
             study drug. Men must agree to remain abstinent or to use a condom plus an additional
             contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of &lt;1% per year during the
