  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cataract surgery is among the world's most frequently performed operations. It involves
      removal of an opaque lens from the human eye and implantation of an artificial lens. The
      operation is performed under local anaesthesia using ultrasound technology, by which the lens
      is emulsified and removed by suction.

      Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery is a new innovative surgical procedure that can
      improve the quality of cataract surgery and provide a new best possible standard of quality.
      In contrast to the conventional method the capsulotomy and the fragemntation are fully
      automatically performed with a femtosecond laser. In addition, the lens is fragmented by the
      laser, which substantially facilitates its removal and reduces the operation time.

      Study to investigate whether the femtosecond laser cataract surgery causes any significant
      differences in clinical outcomes as compared to the conventional, manual continuous
      curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC).

      Effective phako time (EPT) is defined as duration of phakoemulsifikation of the crystalline
      lens.
