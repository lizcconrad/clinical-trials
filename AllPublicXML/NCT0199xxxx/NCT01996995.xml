  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a sham controlled double-blind trial we aim to establish the efficacy and safety of local
      application of laser therapy in patients with diabetes with onychomycosis and risk factors
      for diabetes related foot complications. Onychomycosis leads to thickened and distorted
      nails, which in turn leads to increased local pressure. The combination of onychomycosis and
      neuropathy or peripheral arterial disease (PAD) increases the risk of developing diabetes
      related foot complications. Usual care for high-risk patients with diabetes and onychomycosis
      is completely symptomatic with frequent skiving and clipping of the nails. No effective
      curative local therapies exist and systemic agents are often withheld due to concerns for
      side effects and interactions.

      Aim: The primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of 4 sessions N-YAG 1064nM laser application
      on the one-year clinical and microbiological cure rate in a randomised, double-blinded
      sham-controlled design with blinded outcome assessment.

      Study population: Patients with diabetes mellitus, with an increased risk for diabetic foot
      ulcers.

      Intervention: local laser treatment from a podiatrist and the other group receives treatment
      according to a control procedure. The laser procedure will be performed as a sham procedure
      by a second podiatrist.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The effect of 4 sessions of laser therapy on cure rate
      (clinical and microbiological) after one year.

      Setting of the study: Hospital, outpatient departments (Foot clinic, Isala, Zwolle)

      Inclusion criteria: Patients with clinical suspicion and microbiologic confirmation of
      onychomycosis , diagnosis of T1DM or T2DM, 18 years or older, at risk for diabetic foot
      ulcers defined by a modified Simm's classification score 1 or 2 with either neuropathy or
      PAD, nail involvement of at least 25% of the target nail.

      Exclusion criteria: no microbiologic confirmation, Simms' classification score 3, the
      presence or history of diabetic foot ulcers, ischemic pain, ankle brachial index &lt; 0.9,
      patients receiving dialysis, severe renal insufficiently (eGFR below 30 ml/min), a documented
      toe pressure below 50 mmHg, use of systemic or topical antifungal agents 3 months prior to
      inclusion, use of immunosuppressive drugs, presence of psoriasis, lichen planus, or other
      abnormalities that could result in clinically abnormal toenails, a history of epilepsy and
      insufficient knowledge of the Dutch language. Patients with a dark skin color (Fitzpatrick 4
      and 5) are excluded since dark skin color is associated with dark nails, which theoretically
      leads to increased temperatures during laser application

    <description>Nd:YAG laser pulse therapy Patients are treated with laser session in week 0, 2, 4, and 12. The settings are; 1064 nm, spot size 3 mm, 20 J /cm2, 5 Hz, power 10 W, pulse duration 132 millisecond. A maximum of two sequential sessions (one session on the horizontal and one the vertical passing) will be applied to eliminate potential safety issues in those patients with a lack protective sensibility.</description>

    <description>Sham treatment Patients are treated with a sham session in week 0, 2, 4, and 12. The study settings are similar to the laser except the laser beam. Because the patient is also blinded, they can't see the procedure. The sound and the beeps are audible similar to the laser treatment.</description>
