        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adult male or female subjects at least 18 years of age.

          -  Within 25% of their ideal weights.

          -  Medically healthy subjects with clinically insignificant screening results (laboratory
             profiles, medical histories, ECGs, physical exam) as determined by the Investigator.

          -  Non-tobacco/nicotine using subjects (minimum of 3 months non-tobacco/nicotine use
             prior to first dose).

          -  Subjects with two normal (non-diseased) eyes, defined as nonclinically significant in
             the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Intraocular pressure between 14 and 20 mm Hg (inclusive) in each eye at
             Screening/Qualification.

          -  Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in each eye of 20/40 or better.

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to any study related
             procedures and to comply with all study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic or acute ophthalmic disease including glaucoma, macular degeneration,
             clinically significant cataract (primary or secondary). Previous cataract surgery.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation (benzalkonium chloride,
             etc.), or to topical anesthetics.

          -  Previous glaucoma intraocular surgery or glaucoma laser procedures.

          -  Refractive surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy, PRK, LASIK, etc.).

          -  Ocular trauma within the past six months, or ocular surgery or laser treatment within
             the past three months (e.g., laser treatment for glaucoma or retina).

          -  Evidence of ocular infection, inflammation, cystoid macular edema, clinically
             significant blepharitis or conjunctivitis at (Screening/ Qualification), or a history
             of herpes simplex keratitis.

          -  Ocular medication of any kind within 30 days of Screening/ Qualification

          -  Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry of either eye.

          -  Central corneal thickness greater than 600 µm.

          -  Cannot demonstrate proper delivery of the eye drop.

          -  Blood donations or blood loss, within the past 3 months, that would put the patient at
             risk with the multiple blood samples required in the present study.

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory tests at screening.

          -  Clinically significant systemic disease (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes, myasthenia
             gravis, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular or endocrine disorders) which might interfere
             with the study.

          -  Participation in any investigational study within the past 30 days prior to screening.

          -  Changes of systemic medication that could have a substantial effect on IOP within 30
             days prior to screening, or anticipated during the study.

          -  Due to status of preclinical safety program, women of childbearing potential who are
             pregnant, nursing, planning a pregnancy, or not using a physician-supervised form of
             birth control for at least the last two months. An adult woman is considered to be of
             childbearing potential unless she is one year post-menopausal or three months
             post-surgical sterilization. All females of childbearing potential must have a
             negative urine or serum pregnancy test result at the screening examination and must
             not intend to become pregnant during the study.
