  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to lack of studies on mechanical ventilation strategies in patients with severe Acute
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) supported with Veno-Venous Extra-Corporeal Membrane
      Oxygenation (VV ECMO), ventilator settings in this patient population are set arbitrarily.

      In this two-phases prospective, interventional, pilot study we hope to gain physiologically
      relevant data on two aspects of mechanical ventilation in patients with severe ARDS supported
      with VV ECMO: (1) the use of tidal ventilation and (2) the level of Positive End-Expiratory
      Pressure (PEEP).

        1. PHASE 1: impact of tidal ventilation on VILI (10 patients) We hypothesized that a CPAP
           strategy that minimizes end-tidal pulmonary stress and strain mitigates VILI compared to
           the current mechanical ventilation practice that employs tidal ventilation in patients
           with severe ARDS on ECMO.

           In this first phase we will test whether administering a distending inspiratory pressure
           to produce tidal ventilation is superior to a strategy where only continuous positive
           airway pressure (CPAP) is applied for ventilation induced lung injury (VILI) mitigation,
           as assessed by its impact on biotrauma (serum cytokines) and physiologic measurements.

        2. PHASE 2: impact of PEEP on VILI (10 patients) We also hypothesized that adjusting PEEP
           to maximize respiratory system compliance reduces VILI in patients with severe ARDS on
           ECMO.

      In the second phase we will therefore gain more insight as to whether a strategy that
      utilizes a PEEP level that correspond to best compliance is beneficial over Zero
      End-Expiratory Pressure (ZEEP). We will test the impact of both strategies on biotrauma
      (serum cytokines), physiologic parameters, and right ventricular function (transesophageal
      echocardiographic assessment).

      Because ARDS patients supported with VV ECMO can be hemodynamically unstable, the use of
      imaging techniques that require transport, such as computed tomography, is limited.
      Therefore, bedside imaging techniques, such as pleural and lung ultrasound (PLUS) and focused
      bedside cardiac ultrasonography, are important tools for clinicians who care for these
      patients. This study will allow us to learn whether these techniques are feasible and valid
      in this patient population.

      Furthermore, the knowledge gained from this study will allow us to assess the rationale and
      feasibility of performing a similar larger, randomized study in the future.
