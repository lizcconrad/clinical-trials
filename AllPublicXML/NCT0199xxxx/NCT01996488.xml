      Objective:

      Primary objective of the present study was to compare the single dose bioavailability of
      Torrent's Olanzapine Orally Disintegrating 5 mg Tablets versus Zyprexa® Zydis® 5 mg Tablets
      (Reference formulation; Eli Lilly and Company, USA). Dosing periods were separated by a
      washout period during fasted study.

      Study Design:

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>bioequivalence based on Composite of Pharmacokinetics</measure>
    <time_frame>plasma samples were obtained from blood drawn at Pre-dose and 0.5, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 3.50, 4.00, 4.50, 5.00, 5.50, 6.00, 6.50, 7.00, 8.00, 10.00, 12.00, 14.00, 18.00 and 24.00 hours after dose administration</time_frame>
    <description>bioequivalence; 90% geometric confidence interval of the ratio of least-squares means of the test to reference product should be within 80.00% - 125.00% for AUC-unf, AUCo-t and Cmax.</description>
