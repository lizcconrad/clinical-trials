    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Vilazodone (Viibryd), an SSRI and 5HT1a
      receptor agonist, is effective in treating Adult Separation Anxiety Disorder over a 12-week
      treatment course.

      In this randomized clinical trial, 40 adults with a principal diagnosis of Adult Separation
      Anxiety Disorder (ASAD) and no major depression or substance abuse disorders will be
      randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with vilazodone (flexibly dosed) or matched pill placebo.
      Outcome will be assessed in respect to symptomatic improvement, quality of life, adverse
      events and safety.

    <measure>Change From Baseline on Structured Clinical Interview for Separation Anxiety Disorder</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Structured Clinical Interview for Separation Anxiety Disorder was modified for DSM-5. The eight separation anxiety disorder criteria are rated for both childhood (rated at baseline only) and past week time frames, scored as 0 (not at all), 1 (sometimes), 2 (often) or ? (don't recall). In keeping with the DSM-5 guidelines, endorsement of three or more of the eight criterion symptoms (symptoms rated as '2' or 'often') is used as a threshold to determine categorical (yes/no) diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder. Scores on each of the eight items are also summed to produce a continuous measure of separation anxiety symptoms experienced during childhood and adulthood (range for each scale=0-16).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on Structured Clinical Interview for Separation Anxiety Disorder</title>
        <description>The Structured Clinical Interview for Separation Anxiety Disorder was modified for DSM-5. The eight separation anxiety disorder criteria are rated for both childhood (rated at baseline only) and past week time frames, scored as 0 (not at all), 1 (sometimes), 2 (often) or ? (don’t recall). In keeping with the DSM-5 guidelines, endorsement of three or more of the eight criterion symptoms (symptoms rated as ‘2’ or ‘often’) is used as a threshold to determine categorical (yes/no) diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder. Scores on each of the eight items are also summed to produce a continuous measure of separation anxiety symptoms experienced during childhood and adulthood (range for each scale=0–16).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline on Structured Clinical Interview for Separation Anxiety Disorder</title>
          <description>The Structured Clinical Interview for Separation Anxiety Disorder was modified for DSM-5. The eight separation anxiety disorder criteria are rated for both childhood (rated at baseline only) and past week time frames, scored as 0 (not at all), 1 (sometimes), 2 (often) or ? (don’t recall). In keeping with the DSM-5 guidelines, endorsement of three or more of the eight criterion symptoms (symptoms rated as ‘2’ or ‘often’) is used as a threshold to determine categorical (yes/no) diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder. Scores on each of the eight items are also summed to produce a continuous measure of separation anxiety symptoms experienced during childhood and adulthood (range for each scale=0–16).</description>
