    <measure>Number of Participants With Complete Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, or Progressive Disease as the Best Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to 90 days post last dose, up to February 2015 (approximately 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response (OR) was determined using modified World Health Organization (mWHO) criteria. Complete response (CR): complete disappearance of all index and non-index lesions, and no new lesions. Partial response (PR): decrease in index lesions of 50% or greater in a sum of the products of diameters (SPD) relative to baseline, and no new lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Does not meet criteria for CR or PR, in the absence of PD in index lesions and no change or any change with persistence of one or more non-index lesions, and no new lesions. Progressive Disease (PD): At least 25% increase in SPD relative to nadir in index lesions and unequivocal progression of non-index lesions, along with new lesions or no new lesions; or PD: new lesions with any response with index or non-index lesions. Not Evaluable: Response cannot be determined.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 to 90 days post last dose, up to February 2015 (approximately 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) was defined as the total number of participants whose Best Overall Response (BOR) is Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) divided by the total number of treated participants (%). A two-sided, exact 95% Confidence Interval (Clopper and Pearson) for the BORR was calculated. Overall response (OR) was determined using modified World Health Organization (mWHO) criteria: Complete Response = complete disappearance of all index and non-index lesions, and no new lesions. Partial Response = decrease in index lesions of 50% or greater in a SPD relative to baseline, and no new lesions. BOR=an overall response of CR or PR at Week 12 or after Week 12.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Study initiated 12 December 2013 and completed February 2015. Previously treated or untreated patients with Stage III (unresectable) or Stage IV melanoma were recruited. Previously untreated defined as: patients without treatment for metastatic disease but who may have received treatment in the adjuvant setting.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>26 participants were enrolled and 20 were treated with study drug. Of the 6 participants not treated: 5 no longer met study criteria, 1 withdrew consent.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Ipilimumab</title>
          <description>During treatment, participants received Ipilimumab intravenous (IV) injection 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, up to 4 doses (12 weeks). Study was divided into 4 Phases: Screening Phase, Induction Phase, Toxicity/Progressive Disease(PD) Follow Up Phase, and Overall Survival Phase. The Induction Phase consisted of treatment and a 12 week post dosing follow up. It started at first dose and ended at Week 24, or earlier if participant discontinued treatment and moved to Follow-Up Phase.</description>

Immune-related AEs (irAEs) characterized by potential association with inflammation and considered by investigator as drug related.

Study was divided into 4 Phases: Screening Phase, Induction Phase, Toxicity/Progressive Disease(PD) Follow Up Phase, and Overall Survival Phase. The Induction Phase consisted of treatment and a 12 week post dosing follow up. It started at first dose and ended at Week 24, or earlier if participant discontinued treatment and moved to Follow-Up Phase.</description>

        <description>AEs graded using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0. AE=any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment. SAE=a medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization. Grade (Gr) 1=Mild, Gr 2=Moderate, Gr 3=Severe, Gr 4= Potentially Life-threatening or disabling, Gr 5=Death. Related=relationship to study drug reported as certain, probable, possible, or missing. Immune-related AEs (irAEs) characterized by potential association with inflammation and considered by investigator as drug related.</description>

            <description>During treatment, participants received Ipilimumab intravenous (IV) injection 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, up to 4 doses (12 weeks). Study was divided into 4 Phases: Screening Phase, Induction Phase, Toxicity/Progressive Disease(PD) Follow Up Phase, and Overall Survival Phase. The Induction Phase consisted of treatment and a 12 week post dosing follow up. It started at first dose and ended at Week 24, or earlier if participant discontinued treatment and moved to Follow-Up Phase.</description>

Hematology parameters included: White Blood Cell Count (WBC), Absolute Neutrophil Count, Platelet Count, Hemoglobin, and Lymphocyte Count (absolute). The most recent assessment on or before Day 1 of study medication was taken as baseline (in addition, baseline laboratory must have been collected no earlier than Day -28).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Liver Function Laboratory Abnormalities</title>
        <description>Abnormal laboratory results were reported after the induction period start and within 90 days after induction period end date. Induction Period was 1 dose every 3 weeks for 4 doses (12 weeks). Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) version 3.0 was used in this study; Grade (Gr) 1=Mild, Gr 2=Moderate, Gr 3=Severe, Gr 4= Potentially Life-threatening or disabling, Gr 5=Death. Liver Function parameters included: alanine aminotransaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Total Bilirubin, and Alkaline Phosphatase (Alk Phos). The most recent assessment on or before Day 1 of study medication was taken as baseline (in addition, baseline laboratory must have been collected no earlier than Day -28).</description>

        <description>Overall response (OR) was determined using modified World Health Organization (mWHO) criteria. Complete response (CR): complete disappearance of all index and non-index lesions, and no new lesions. Partial response (PR): decrease in index lesions of 50% or greater in a sum of the products of diameters (SPD) relative to baseline, and no new lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Does not meet criteria for CR or PR, in the absence of PD in index lesions and no change or any change with persistence of one or more non-index lesions, and no new lesions. Progressive Disease (PD): At least 25% increase in SPD relative to nadir in index lesions and unequivocal progression of non-index lesions, along with new lesions or no new lesions; or PD: new lesions with any response with index or non-index lesions. Not Evaluable: Response cannot be determined.</description>

A two-sided, exact 95% Confidence Interval (Clopper and Pearson) for the BORR was calculated. Overall response (OR) was determined using modified World Health Organization (mWHO) criteria: Complete Response = complete disappearance of all index and non-index lesions, and no new lesions. Partial Response = decrease in index lesions of 50% or greater in a SPD relative to baseline, and no new lesions. BOR=an overall response of CR or PR at Week 12 or after Week 12.</description>

A two-sided, exact 95% Confidence Interval (Clopper and Pearson) for the BORR was calculated. Overall response (OR) was determined using modified World Health Organization (mWHO) criteria: Complete Response = complete disappearance of all index and non-index lesions, and no new lesions. Partial Response = decrease in index lesions of 50% or greater in a SPD relative to baseline, and no new lesions. BOR=an overall response of CR or PR at Week 12 or after Week 12.</description>

          <description>During treatment, participants received Ipilimumab IV injection 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, up to 4 doses (12 weeks). Study was divided into 4 Phases: Screening Phase, Induction Phase, Toxicity/Progressive Disease (PD) Follow Up Phase, and Overall Survival Phase. The Induction Phase consisted of treatment and a 12 week post dosing follow up. It started at first dose and ended at Week 24, or earlier if participant discontinued treatment and moved to Follow-Up Phase.</description>
