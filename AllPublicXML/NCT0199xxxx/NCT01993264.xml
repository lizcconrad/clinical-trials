  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac disease in children may start early in life and evidence of cardiac disease can be
      seen during prenatal life. A variety of diseases diagnosed during fetal life can put children
      at risk for cardiac disease. The accurate assessment of cardiac function is important in
      these patients. A type of imaging scan called &quot;fetal echocardiogram&quot; is used to measure the
      contractility or squeeze of the heart. The fetal echocardiogram is a painless test and
      completely non-invasive.

      This study aims to recruit women and fetuses to determine if this imaging scan can be used
      throughout the pregnancy to measure heart squeeze and develop normal values to help doctors
      better diagnose fetuses who may have cardiac disease before they are born.

      The subject will have to complete 6 fetal echocardiograms. A fetal echocardiogram is picture
      of the unborn baby's heart in motion made by bouncing sound waves off the heart and recording
      the echo. The procedure will be very similar to the ultrasounds that the subject is already
      receiving as part of her prenatal care.

      The scans will start at week 20 of the subject's pregnancy and repeat every 3 weeks until
      week 38 of birth (whichever occurs first). The appointments will last approximately 30
      minutes each and will be performed by one of two sonographers trained specifically in fetal
      echocardiography. One additional echocardiogram will be performed on the infant after birth,
      within the first two months of life. In addition to the scans, study staff will access the
      subject's medical record to collect information such as: age, ethnicity, race, medical
      history and health insurance status.
