      This phase 4, single-arm, open-label, multicenter study is designed to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of brentuximab vedotin as a single agent in adult participants with histologically
      confirmed CD30+ relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin Lymphoma who have not received a
      prior stem cell transplantation (SCT) and are considered to be not suitable for SCT or
      multiagent chemotherapy at the time of study entry.

      The drug being tested in this study is called brentuximab vedotin. Brentuximab vedotin is
      being tested to treat people who have relapsed or refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma. This study
      will look at the overall response of people who took brentuximab vedotin.

      The study enrolled 60 patients. Participants received:

      • Brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg

      This multicenter trial is being conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 6 to 7 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic,
      and will be contacted by telephone every 3 months for 18 months after the end of treatment
      (EOT) for follow-up assessment of overall survival and then every 6 months until death, study
      closure, or 5 years after enrollment of the last participant.

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. AE severity was graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03. AEs Grade 3 and higher are severe.</description>
