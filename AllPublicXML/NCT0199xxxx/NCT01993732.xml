  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to retrieve and cryopreserve ovarian tissue from females
      undergoing a treatment that may lead to irreversible loss of ovarian function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this preliminary study is to retrieve and properly cryopreserve ovarian tissue for
      autotransplantation in any premenopausal female whose ovarian function is threatened in a
      physiological, pathological or iatrogenic manner in an effort to observe the return of
      ovarian endocrine function and development of egg(s) appropriate for use in in vitro
      fertilization.
