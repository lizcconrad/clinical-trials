    <textblock>
      Mood journaling is a cornerstone of self-management in major depressive disorder (MDD).
      Research over the last decade has shown that electronic mood journals are superior to paper
      ones. One potential advantage of mental health telemetry (MHT), which use cell phones to
      collect mood journal data, is that electronic journal data can easily be converted into
      graphical records, allowing people living with MDD to readily spot trends, correlations, or
      patterns in ways that would be quite challenging using paper diaries. This information should
      make it easier to recognize and evaluate changes in mental health status -- the first two
      steps in the process of self-management. The investigators will develop and deploy a
      visualization module for patients with which to explore their own MHT data sets on the same
      cell phones which they record their journals, and test the investigators hypotheses that
      their enhanced MHT system will (i) improve patients' ability to self-manage MDD and (ii)
      enhance their quality-of-life.

      The study is a non-randomized, un-blinded, A-B-A' (modified single-subject withdrawal design,
      with user choice of treatment or withdrawal in the A' stage) study, to explore the utility of
      MHT as a tool for enhancing self-management and QoL for persons living with MDD. The aims of
      this study are to explore the impact of MHT on subjects' self-management and QoL, and to
      gauge participants' perceptions of MHT's utility.

    <description>Self-management ratings using the three sub-scale scores (maintenance, management, and confidence) of the Sunnybrook Self-Management Scale - Depression (3S-D) instrument at the end of the Treatment-as-Usual phase (two months) as compared to the end of the active treatment phase (four months)</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality-of-life (QoL) ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>two months and four months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ) scores at the end of the treatment-as-usual (two months) and active treatment (four months) phases. We will control for severity of mood symptoms (using mental health telemetry (MHT) composite depression scores) as a covariate of the magnitude of change in QoL outcomes because we expect that some, but not all, of the variance in QoL outcomes will be accounted for in particular by the severity of depression.</description>

    <description>Patients will be given software for Mental Health Telemetry (MHT), which allows them to record symptom intensity, hospital / ER visits, life events, etc., and to visualize their MHT data. Patients will be encouraged to make MHT entries once daily at a pre-determined time while in this arm, and will be prompted via text message by the MHT software to do so.</description>

    <description>Patients exiting the MHT arm will be given the choice to continue with MHT for a further two months or whether to resume TAU (i.e., no further use of MHT) for the remaining two months.</description>

    <intervention_name>MHT</intervention_name>
    <description>MHT and visualizer contains mood information about the patient themselves, which allows for self management of the mood disorder. Self-management interventions promote early recognition of mood episodes, medication adherence and self-management skills which have shown to improve outcomes in depression. MHT encourages patients to take an active role by engaging in mood journaling, while making this information available in explorable form to the patient and his / her team of clinicians.</description>
