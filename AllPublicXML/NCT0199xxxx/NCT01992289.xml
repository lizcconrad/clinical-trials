      The goal of the ECP-002e extension study is to continue the evaluation of all EDI200-treated
      ECP-002 subjects up to age 10 yrs. No additional study drug administration is planned. The
      efficacy evaluations will incorporate growth and development parameters, frequency of
      infections and hospitalizations, and age-appropriate assessments of ectoderm-derived organ
      function. The safety evaluations will include physical examinations, adverse events and
      concomitant medication documentation, and laboratory testing. Funding Source - FDA OOPD

    <textblock>
      X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED) is a disorder of ectoderm development in
      which sweat and other secretory gland hypoplasias predispose affected infants to serious and
      potentially life-threatening hyperthermia and pneumonia. Those XLHED patients who survive
      infancy face a host of ectoderm-related clinical conditions including failure to thrive,
      oligodontia and misshapen teeth, mid-face hypoplasia, eczema, chronic dry eyes, asthma,
      respiratory infections, sinusitis and chronic nosebleeds. XLHED is caused by inherited
      defects in the ectodysplasin gene (EDA, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim) resulting in a deficiency
      of the ectoderm signaling protein EDA-A1. As is the general case with X-linked disorders,
      hemizygous XLHED males are more consistently and severely affected, while heterozygous XLHED
      females have a more variable phenotype.

      In normal development, EDA-A1 acts as an ectoderm signaling molecule that binds specifically
      to the EDA-A1 receptor (EDAR) triggering initiation and maturation of ectodermal appendages
      into sweat and other secretory glands, tooth buds and hair follicles. In the case of XLHED,
      EDA-A1 deficiency results in the absence or functional hypoplasia of the ectoderm appendages.
      There are no therapies currently available for XLHED that prevent or correct the underlying
      ectodermal abnormalities.

      EDI200 is a fully humanized EDA-A1 replacement molecule under development as a novel
      therapeutic for XLHED. EDI200 comprises the human IgG1 Fc domain linked to the human EDA-A1
      receptor-binding domain. On-target EDI200 activation of the EDA-A1/EDAR signaling pathway in
      vivo is evidenced by the remarkable phenotypic response in preclinical models. In
      XLHED-affected animals, EDA-A1 deficiency is corrected by a single course of EDI200 therapy,
      administered either prenatally (mice) or postnatally (newborn mice and dogs), resulting in a
      significant and sustained improvement in the health of the treated animals. Postnatal studies
      in both mice and dogs demonstrated a consistent and restricted window of efficacy. These
      results support the clinical development of EDI200 as a therapeutic to be administered to
      XLHED-affected patients in the neonatal period or earlier.

      ECP-002, a Phase 2, international, first-in-neonate EDI200 study is enrolling
      treatment-naïve, XLHED-affected male newborns in the first two weeks of life. All subjects
      will meet entry criteria including documentation of an EDA mutation associated with XLHED.
      Following Baseline evaluations, EDI200 dosing is initiated between day-of-life 2 and 14, with
      each study subject receiving a single course of study drug administered at 2 doses/week for a
      total of 5 doses. The treatment study protocol incorporates comprehensive safety,
      pharmacokinetic (PK), immunogenetic, and pharmacodynamic (PD)/efficacy evaluations continuing
      through age 6 months.

      The goal of the ECP-002e extension study is to continue the evaluation of all EDI200-treated
      ECP-002 subjects up to age 10 yrs. No additional study drug administration is planned. The
      efficacy evaluations will incorporate growth and development parameters, frequency of
      infections and hospitalizations, and age-appropriate assessments of ectoderm-derived organ
      function. The safety evaluations will include physical examinations, adverse events and
      concomitant medication documentation, and laboratory testing.

    <description>Sweat duct density (number/cm2) from at least two different sites on the soles of the feet or the palms of the hands will be determined through analysis of images collected annually if positive findings were observed at the end of protocol ECP-002 and will continue until negative results are observed on two consecutive evaluations. This will be accomplished by direct visualization with an FDA 510(k) device, the Lucid VivaScope 1500 (www.lucid-tech.com). This technology has been tested in controls and XLHED-affected males from the newborn period to adulthood without complication. An adhesive ring will be placed on the subject's palm to which the VivaScope will be attached via a magnetic lock. A series of photographs will be taken of an area approximately 6mm X 6mm. An individual trained in the use of this device will be involved in the acquisition of all images.</description>

Following completion of the pilocarpine iontophoresis the Webster Sweat Inducer electrodes and discs are removed from the subject, the application site is wiped once with alcohol, and a Macroduct Sweat Collector is placed over the site of one electrode. The Macroduct Sweat Collector is held in place for approximately 30 minutes using a Velcro Macroduct Strap. Sweat volume is determined from microliter markings on a collection coil diagram. Sweat rate will be determined annually if positive findings were observed at the end of protocol ECP-002 and will continue until negative results are observed on two consecutive evaluations.</description>

    <description>At the year 5 and 10 visits the total and anagen hair counts and follicular unit counts in the scalp will be determined from color macrophotographs of clipped hair in a 1 cm2 circular target area centered by a cosmetic ink dot. Hair in the target area will first be clipped to approximately a 1 mm length for determination of total hair count and hairs per follicular unit, and then clipped further to about 0.35 mm to monitor hair growth over the 2-3 day period between phototrichograms. The sponsor will provide all of the equipment necessary for photography and to cut the hair to the exact lengths specified. A second photogram will be taken approximately 2-3 days later for the determination of anagen and telogen hair counts, based on the number of hairs that have lengthened over the intervening time period, as well as hair properties including growth rate and hair width.</description>

    <description>A craniofacial recognition software algorithm is under development that will identify characteristics of XLHED-affected males as neonates, children and adults.

    <measure>Exercise thermoregulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline exercise thermoregulation at 7, 8, 9 or 10 years (done once)</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise thermoregulation during bicycle ergometry will be assessed once at a single visit when the study subject has reached an age of at least 7 yrs and a weight of at least 80 lbs. The main outcome measure is body core temperature during and after exercise. Body core temperature is measured immediately prior to and 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60 and 90 minutes after initiation of exercise using an ingestible thermometer pill. External recording of body core temperature is started approximately 30 minutes after ingestion of a calibrated pill. Basal values are noted when no changes of body temperature is observed anymore, and the subject is then told to start cycling. Heart rate is monitored continuously. Physical strain is 0.5 W/kg body weight at the beginning and increased every 4 minutes by 0.5 W/kg body weight. Stopping criteria are a body core temperature of more than 40°C, an increase in heart rate above an age-adjusted threshold, or subjective exhaustion.</description>
