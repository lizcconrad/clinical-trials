  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a randomized, control, phase II/III study of early stage (FIGO Ia2-IIb)
      cervical cancer after radical hysterectomy in Northwest China treated with radiotherapy or
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy based on the surgical-pathological risk factors. All the
      patients received whole pelvis radiation and were divided into three groups according to
      adjuvant chemotherapy: concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin weekly (40mg/m2) , concurrent
      chemotherapy with docetaxel plus cisplatin tri-weekly (75mg/m2), or concurrent and adjuvant
      chemotherapy with docetaxel plus cisplatin tri-weekly (75mg/m2). The effectiveness, and side
      effects will be evaluated according to Standard WHO response criteria, and NCI common
      toxicity criteria for adverse events(NCI-CTC-AE) V3.0.

      To the cervical cancer patient who accepted radical hysterectomy, whether the adjuvant
      therapy should be received or the method of adjuvant therapy are determined by the
      postoperative pathology. In the traditional opinion, the postoperative risk factors were
      divided into two groups: intermediate risk factors, including large tumor size, deep stromal
      invasion and lymphovascular space invasion, and high risk factors, including non-squamous
      cell carcinoma, marginal positive, parametric invasion and pelvic lymph node(LN) metastasis.
      Patients with intermediate risk factors should accepted adjuvant radiotherapy only and who
      with high risk factors should received adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Cisplatin
      weekly(40mg/m2) was the standard regimen of concurrent chemotherapy. However, we
      retrospectively analyzed 801 cervical cancer patients with postoperative radiotherapy and
      found that distant metastasis was the main cause of current treatment failure(84.5%), which
      suggested the current regimen of chemotherapy was insufficient and might be strengthened in
      future.
