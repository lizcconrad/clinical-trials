  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the success of anti-angiogenic therapy in multiple treatment settings, a fraction of
      patients are refractory to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor treatment,
      while the majority of patients will eventually develop evasive resistance. It is proposed
      that mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET) and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor
      (HGF or scatter factor) contribute to VEGF inhibitor resistance, such that combining a c-MET
      inhibitor with a VEGF inhibitor will provide additional clinical activity compared to VEGF
      inhibitor alone. This hypothesis will be tested using the cMET/ALK inhibitor, crizotinib, in
      combination with the VEGF inhibitor, axitinib.Since this will be the first study of axitinib
      given in combination with crizotinib, the study will primarily assess the safety and
      tolerability of the combination regimen.

    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed.

    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug.

    <description>Percentage of participants with OR based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST (v1.1). Confirmed response were those that persisted on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. CR was defined as disappearance of all lesions (target and/or non target).

Duration of tumor response was calculated as (the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause minus the date of the first CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed plus 1) divided by 30.44.

Tumor progression determined from oncologic assessment data (where it meets criteria for progressive disease [PD]), or from adverse event (AE) data (where outcome was &quot;Death&quot;). Progression using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) is &gt;= 20 percent (%) increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; measurable increase in non-target lesion; appearance of new lesions.</description>
