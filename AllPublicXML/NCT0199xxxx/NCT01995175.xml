  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence and associated healthcare utilization of
      RSV-associated, suspected LRTI in a general population of infants from birth up to 2 years of
      age, and also to assess the accuracy of a newly developed LRTI case definition and severity
      scale compared to two existing definitions. The study will also assess the population
      attributable risk percent of RSV LRTI on the development of wheeze and asthma from 0 to 6
      years of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New born infants from various countries over the world will be followed up for up to two
      years for the occurrence of Lower Respiratory Tract Infections. Through active and passive
      surveillance, any suspected case will be identified, assessed during an examination visit and
      followed up until completion through a diary card. Full symptomology will be assessed during
      the examination visit. The disease course and all healthcare utilization will be subsequently
      collected through a two-week diary card and contact with ay healthcare providers involved in
      management of the disease. RSV detection will occur through quantitative PCR of collected
      nasal swabs. A baseline cord blood serum sample of all subjects and a follow-up blood serum
      sample from a sub-cohort will also be collected to assess antibody levels at various points
      in time and in relation to risk of RSV LRTI.

      For extension period, pertaining to wheeze and asthma (Epoch 002): Subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s)
      will be asked to re-consent and subjects will be followed up through quarterly contacts up to
      the age of 6 years. Data collection will also occur from medical charts retrospectively for
      those who have a gap period between the end of the primary study and providing re-consent for
      the extension. The extension involves enrolment visit (at 2nd birthday [on completion of
      primary study or as soon as possible thereafter]) and quarterly surveillance contacts.
