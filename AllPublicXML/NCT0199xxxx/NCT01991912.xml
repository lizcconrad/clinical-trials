  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The classic laminectomy for surgical treatment of spinal stenosis has considerable morbidity
      .This is further magnified by the disease being more common in elderly with associated
      medical comorbidities and being usually global involving multiple levels.The purpose of this
      study is to present and to evaluate a new endoscopic technique named Irrigation Endoscopic
      Decompressive Laminotomy (IEDL) for lumbar spinal canal decompression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the IEDL group,2 portals 0.5cm were used one for the endoscope and the other for
      instruments. For every additional level one portal is added. The endoscope and instruments
      are directly placed over the surface of lamina without any dissection and saline under pump
      pressure is used to open a potential working space. Unilateral laminotomy and bilateral
      decompression under endoscopic vision is performed. In the microsurgical group, bilateral
      fenestration is performed in the usual manner

    <description>endoscopic decompression is performed for cases of lumbar spinal stenosis.Portals 0.5cm in size are used for the introduction of the instruments and the endoscope. Saline under pump pressure is used to open a potential working space. This is followed by performing an ipsilateral hemilaminotomy and contralateral decompression under the midline structure</description>
