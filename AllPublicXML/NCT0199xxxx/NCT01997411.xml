      The purpose of this study was to assess how glucagon administered as a puff into the nose
      (AMG504-1) works in children and adolescents compared with commercially-available glucagon
      given by injection. In addition, the safety and tolerability of glucagon given as a puff into
      the nose was evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glucagon, the treatment of choice for severe hypoglycemia outside of the hospital setting, is
      currently available only as a powder that must be mixed with a diluent immediately prior to
      administration by injection. Although this is a very simple procedure for insulin-using
      individuals, subjects experiencing severe hypoglycemia cannot inject themselves with glucagon
      because of the disabling effects of severe neuroglycopenia. For any non-medical person who is
      confronted with an emergency situation in which a patient with diabetes is in a hypoglycemic
      coma or suffering hypoglycemia-related convulsions, reconstitution and injection of the
      current injectable glucagon is a complex and daunting procedure.

      When used at the recommended dose of 1 mg by injection, glucagon often causes a substantial,
      although transient, hyperglycemia that is often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The data
      generated to date with AMG504-1 suggest the resulting glucagon pharmacokinetics (PK),
      although less than that observed with injected glucagon, results in a therapeutic blood
      glucose increment with a very low incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects.

      Caregivers of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes are called upon to treat episodes
      of severe hypoglycemia and may want to use AMG504-1. This study was conducted to permit
      determination of appropriate dose level(s) for pediatric use based on the safety observations
      and results of glucagon and glucose assays.

      Each participant 12.0 to less than 17.0 years of age underwent two visits in random order and
      received AMG504-1 during one visit and commercially available glucagon (GlucaGen, Novo
      Nordisk) by IM injection during the other visit. Participants 4.0 to less than 12.0 years
      were randomly assigned to have either 1 visit with commercially available glucagon (GlucaGen,
      Novo Nordisk) by IM injection OR to have 2 visits with a 2.0 mg dose of AMG504-1 administered
      during one visit and a 3.0 mg dose of AMG504-1 administered during the other visit. For those
      randomized to complete two research dosing visits, the dose of intranasal glucagon given
      during each visit was masked to the participant and study personnel.

      Each dosing visit consisted of reducing the plasma glucose level to about 80 mg/dL by
      increasing the basal insulin infusion rate on the insulin pump or by an intravenous (IV)
      infusion of regular insulin diluted in normal saline. The insulin infusion was stopped once
      the plasma glucose was &lt;80 mg/dL. Five minutes after stopping the insulin infusion,
      participants were treated with either glucagon given intranasally (either 2.0 mg or 3.0 mg
      for participants 4.0 to less than 12.0 years of age or 3.0 mg for those 12.0 to less than
      17.0 years of age) or by intramuscular (IM) injection (1 mg constituted in 1 mL of diluting
      solution for those 55 lbs or more and 0.5 mg constituted in 1 mL of diluting solution for
      those who weigh less than 55 lbs) in the quadriceps muscle of the leg.

      Blood glucose levels and adverse events were carefully monitored for 90 minutes post-dosing.
      After a wash-out period of 7 days or more, participants 12.0 to less than 17.0 years of age
      returned to the clinic and the procedure repeated with each participant crossed over to the
      other treatment. Participants 4.0 to less than 12.0 years assigned to have 2 dosing visits
      returned to clinic and repeated the procedure with a different dose of intranasal glucagon
      given. Participants 4.0 to less than 12.0 years assigned to a single dosing visit did not
      return for a second dosing visit.

This is done via the &quot;Nasal Non-nasal Score Questionnaire&quot;. Each of the 9 symptoms is assigned an integer value from 0 to 3; higher values indicate more severe symptoms (a score of 0 indicates no symptoms).

        <title>Nasal and Non-nasal Effects/Symptoms</title>
        <description>Symptoms of runny nose, nasal congestion and/or itching, sneezing, watery and/or itchy eyes, redness of eyes, and itching of ears and/or throat were assessed prior to administering glucagon and at 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes following administration of glucagon. This is done via the &quot;Nasal Non-nasal Score Questionnaire&quot;. Each of the 9 symptoms is assigned an integer value from 0 to 3; higher values indicate more severe symptoms (a score of 0 indicates no symptoms). The reported results indicate the cohort median out of a possible maximum value of 27 (summing all 9 questions for each subject and reporting the median/IQR across participants).</description>
