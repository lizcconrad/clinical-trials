  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether DRM02 is safe and effective in the
      treatment of atopic dermatitis when applied twice daily for 6 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, within-subject control, study enrolling 20 subjects with
      atopic dermatitis and designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy
      of DRM02.

      Safety will be assessed during the study, through adverse events, local skin responses,
      urinalysis, serum chemistry and hematology laboratory testing, physical examination and vital
      signs.

      Preliminary efficacy will be assessed through the Physician's Lesion Assessment (PLA) and the
      Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) from only the two lesions identified at the baseline
      visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female 18 to 70 years of age.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of stable atopic dermatitis (AD) and with two lesions of similar
             size and have an identical score of at least 5 but no more than 9 on the sum of the
             individual components of the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) at the Target
             Lesion scale.

          -  Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating females.

          -  Signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have unstable atopic dermatitis (AD).

          -  Significant infection at the target lesion site.

          -  Prior or concomitant use of systemic therapies for AD within the past 4 weeks. - Prior
             or concomitant use of topical treatments for AD, to within 10 cm of the target lesion
             within the past 4 weeks.

          -  Prior or concomitant use of oral retinoids for AD within the last 6 months.

          -  Use of biologics for AD within the past 3 months, or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer).

          -  Subjects who have poor skin condition within 5 cm of the target lesion.

          -  Subjects who are current drug or alcohol abusers; have a history of immunodeficiency
             disease; or are a poor medical risk because of other systemic diseases or active
             uncontrolled infections.

          -  Subjects with an unstable medical condition or a medical condition not adequately
             controlled with standard medical therapy.

          -  Subjects who are actively participating in an experimental therapy study or who have
             received experimental therapy within 30 days.

          -  Subjects who have a clinically significant laboratory value at screening.
