        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  â€¢ Subjects with low transfusional iron overload secondary to thalassemia major showing
             downward-trend in SF over last 6 months ( 2 readings are needed).

               -  Thalassemia major patients with SF equal or less than 500 after reduction of
                  chelation dose. Patients on different types of chelation monotherapy will be
                  included

               -  The subjects must also have a level of understanding and willingness to cooperate
                  with the confinement and procedures described in the consent form and scheduled
                  by the study site. In addition, he/she must be able to provide voluntary written

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  subjects with HIV positive or have active HCV.

          -  A history of serious immunologic hypersensitivity to any medication such as
             anaphylaxis or angioedema.

          -  Participation in a previous investigational drug study within the 30 days preceding
             screening.

          -  A woman of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening. She must use a medically acceptable form of birth control during the study
             and for a month afterwards who are pregnant or breast-feeding.
