      The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a yoga treatment for veterans with
      mild post-traumatic and chronic tension-type headaches.

      Study Aims:

        -  Does this yoga treatment, targeted toward specific symptoms veterans with mild
           post-traumatic and chronic tension-type headaches experience, assist in decreasing
           headaches and associated symptoms?

        -  Does this yoga treatment, targeted toward specific symptoms veterans with mild
           post-traumatic and chronic tensions-type headaches experience, assist in improving
           quality of life?

        -  Does this yoga treatment, targeted toward specific symptoms veterans with mild
           post-traumatic and chronic tension-type headaches experience, improve mood?

        -  Do the effects of yoga on symptoms, mood, and quality of life maintain 2 months post
           completion of treatment?

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a yoga treatment for veterans with
      mild post-traumatic and chronic tension-type headaches. The yoga will be provided in the form
      of 6 weekly yoga sessions aimed at providing direct instruction and immediate feedback on
      postures, breathing, and relaxation techniques in a small group format. The sessions will be
      led by an experienced yoga instructor who is a part of the study team and have worked with
      medical patients. A post-yoga 2-month follow-up assessment of self-reported symptoms, mood,
      and quality of life will also be assessed.

      This is a feasibility study to determine if a yoga treatment is received favorably and can be
      successfully delivered to veterans seeking treatments for post-traumatic and chronic
      tension-type headaches. This study does not include a comparison group; therefore, we can
      only make conclusions based on pre to post differences in subjects who participate in the
      yoga. Our aim for this study is to collect data on the potential benefits of a targeted yoga
      treatment for symptoms experienced by these subjects, and to then utilize these data to
      implement a larger study with a comparison group.
