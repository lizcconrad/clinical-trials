  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed research study, we are investigating the feasibility of integrating automated
      planning tools to MR images acquired using a novel MR-guided linac, for on-line adaptive
      radiation treatment. However, these on-line automation tools require further technical
      refinement and clinical validation. The goal of this research proposal is to develop an
      on-line MR-guided radiation therapy process for adapting breast IMRT treatment. Such an
      approach will provide early stage breast cancer patients timely access to high-quality
      adaptive treatments without exposure to additional ionizing radiation.
