  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GEN-004 is a combination of 3 conserved proteins from Streptococcus pneumoniae. This is a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study. Eligible subjects (male
      and non-pregnant female) will be assigned sequentially to 1 of 3 dose cohorts and randomized
      in a 3:1:1 ratio to receive GEN-004 with adjuvant, GEN-004 without adjuvant, or placebo,
      respectively. Each subject will receive up to 3 doses at 4 week intervals.

      Subjects will be followed for safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity for 12 months after
      their last dose.

             reaction to an immunization.

         17. History of invasive pneumococcal disease (i.e., sepsis, meningitis or pneumonia with
             bacteremia).

         18. History of drug or alcohol abuse that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             interfere with the subject's ability to comply with the study requirements.
