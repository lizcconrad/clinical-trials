  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PF-06678552 is a new compound proposed for the treatment of hypercholesteremia. The primary
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of single oral doses of PF-06678552 in healthy subjects.

    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>
