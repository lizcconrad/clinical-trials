  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Addition of systemic herbal immunomodulators with scaling &amp; root planing (SRP) may enhance
      the therapeutic result of Chronic Periodontitis owing to host modulation &amp; anti-inflammatory
      properties. If proven, herbal immunomodulators can be used as an adjunct to SRP.
