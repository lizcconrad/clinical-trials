  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soft tissue injury leads to significant deformity in size, shape and body contour. Adipose
      tissue, continues to be the tissue of choice in repairing soft tissue defects due to
      traumatic or other defects. Current autologous fat transfer techniques, however, have a
      number of limitations including significant donor site morbidity, unpredictable resorption,
      and the potential for requiring revision. Thus, an &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; material that retains the
      mechanical and biological properties of adipose tissue would be ideal for the reconstruction.

      Extracellular matrix (ECM)-based biomaterials have the potential to be a non-immunogenic
      biological scaffold for adipose tissue engineering for repair of soft tissue defects. Our
      collaborators have recently generated a novel tissue-derived material to improve soft tissue
      reconstruction. The final, processed adipose tissue does not contain cellular components, yet
      retains the native architecture and bioactivity of the original adipose tissue. The tissue is
      then further processed into particles to create an injectable implant. In preclinical models,
      we have demonstrated that human adipose tissue can be decellularized by mechanical processing
      with preservation of matrix ultrastructure. Histologic analysis two-weeks after implantation
      into rats showed minimal inflammatory reaction and good tissue integration of the
      decellularized, dilipidized, adipose derived-ECM.

      The goal of the study is to 1) evaluate the safety and compatibility of the soft tissue
      implant, and 2) determine the efficacy of this ECM replacement in soft tissue injuries after
      6 weeks. Specifically, the volume of the soft tissue defect will be determined before
      implantation and at multiple time points over the following 6 weeks. We hypothesize that the
      decellularized adipose ECM will retain at least 50% volume and surface area after 6 weeks. If
      our results are promising, decellularized adipose derived-ECM may be a viable alternative to
      autologous tissue transplantation for correction of soft tissue deformity.

    <description>Each syringe of adipose-derived ECM will hold 2mL and will be for single use only. Up to 3 syringes (6mL total) may be used for each patient. Injections will be made under local anesthesia and sterile conditions using a 23-gauge needle. All injections will be performed in an outpatient clinic setting at study site by the principal investigator who will determine the method, depth, and volume of each implant. Decellularized adipose tissue-derived matrix will be infiltrated into the defect and the underlying musculature as well as the subcutaneous tissue surrounding the defect, with the goal of creating a smooth transition from surrounding structures to the filled defect. This will be performed using a series of multiple punctures or a single puncture with a fanning or threading technique. After the injection is completed, the treatment area will be massaged to conform to the contour of the surrounding tissue and ice will be applied as needed for swelling.</description>
