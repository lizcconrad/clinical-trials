      The goal of this research is to understand the functioning of 'regulatory circuits' in the
      brain. These are brain circuits which allow a person to regulate their attention, regulate
      their behavioral responses, and regulate their decision-making. We are also interested in how
      the stimulant medications methylphenidate and naltrexone affect these regulatory circuits.
      Methylphenidate is a widely-used, FDA approved medication used to treat Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and is also known as Ritalin. Naltrexone is an FDA approved
      medication used to help treat alcohol and substance abuse.

      This research study will use a scanning technique known as functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI)which takes a special kind of picture of the brain that enables us to &quot;see the
      brain at work&quot;. Adult participants will be given a one-time dose of either methylphenidate,
      naltrexone,or placebo before each fMRI scan session. There are three total fMRI scan
      sessions. Therefore, each participant will receive each possible medication/placebo only
      once.

      Thus, using the fMRI technique, our main purpose for this research is to better understand
      the functioning of regulatory circuits in conditions such as ADHD and alcohol dependence.
      This research may one day help us develop better treatments for these disorders.

      To ensure the safety of every subject before administration of any drug compound, all
      subjects must first undergo a urine drug test and if female, a urine pregnancy test before
      ingestion of the drug compound. Concurrently, subjects with alcohol dependence must undergo a
      breathalyzer as well as the urine drug and pregnancy test (if female) before ingestion of the
      drug compounds and fMRI scanning sessions.

      Once subjects have been administered the drug compound at the Rachel Upjohn Building at the
      University of Michigan, the study coordinator or any other trained study personnel will ride
      with the subject in a taxi cab ride over to the scanner facility. For more detailed
      information regarding drug administration please see section.

      Once at the scanner facility, subjects will fill out an MRI Safety form before every scan to
      ensure that they are able to enter the magnet safely. After this form has been completed and
      signed, then the subject will undergo a practice session of the fMRI tasks in the private
      practice room designated for such activity at the scanner facility. Once tasks have been
      practiced the MRI technician will prep the subject making sure there is no metal on their
      person before entering the scanner.

      All subjects will be in the scanner for approximately 65 minutes performing the tasks which
      are listed in more detail in section.

      Post scan, the study coordinator or other trained study personnel will escort the subject
      back to the Rachel Upjohn Building at the University of Michigan via taxi for a study
      debriefing.

[1]40 Healthy adults [2]40 adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) [3]40 adults with a history of Alcohol Dependence [4]40 adults with combined ADHD and history of Alcohol Dependence. Every participant in all four groups will be administered a one-time, randomized dose of 40mgs of Methylphenidate, 40mgs of Naltrexone, and a placebo one hour before the fMRI scanning session and task performance. No participants will be administered any of the three drug compounds more than once during the study. The order for which medication type is given at which scanning session for every participant is determined by randomization code.</description>
