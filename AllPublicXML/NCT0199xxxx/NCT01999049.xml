    <textblock>
      The Argus II Retinal Implant is a revolutionary new device, which offers vision to patients
      who are blind from retinal degeneration - retinitis pigmentosa. These patients have no
      alternatives. Patients typically can achieve ambulatory vision.

      This study is an investigator-sponsored, observational, controlled, prospective,
      single-center study. The purpose of this current study is how it affects people's visual
      function and activities of daily living and to collect additional data on Argus II users in
      order to monitor the System's safety. In addition, data about the long-term reliability of
      the System will be gathered.

      The Argus II retinal implant will be surgical implanted into patients who are blind but the
      surgical procedure is not a part of this observational study. Our hypothesis is that the
      visual results in our hands will be comparable to those reported in the FDA study. We will
      use the results of this study to plan future enhancements to the service and to explore the
      use of the device for other blinding conditions.

    <measure>Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will be observed for 1 year post-implant.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint in the study is safety. Safety will be assessed by calculating the proportion of subjects who experience individual procedure- and device-related adverse events. In addition, the proportion of subjects who experience a significant ocular event will also be reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual function</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Visual function: Visual function means how the eye works (e.g. visual acuity). Visual function will be measured using the following tests: Square Localization; Direction of Motion; Grating Visual Acuity (GVA).
Functional vision: Functional vision means how subjects perform in vision-related activities of daily living. Function vision will be assessed using the Functional Low-Vision Observer Rated Assessment (FLORA). A utilization questionnaire will also be administered to track how subjects are using the Argus II System.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        •Adults, age 25 years or older with severe to profound outer retinal degeneration.

        but some residual light perception. If no residual light perception remains, the retina
        must be able to respond to electrical stimulation and previous history of useful form
        vision.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ocular diseases or conditions that could prevent the Argus II System from working
             (e.g. optic nerve disease, central retinal artery or vein occlusion, history of
             retinal detachment, trauma, severe strabismus).

          -  Ocular structures or conditions that could prevent the successful implantation of the
             Argus II Implant or adequate healing from surgery (e.g. extremely thin conjunctiva,
             axial length &lt;20.5 mm or &gt; 26 mm, corneal ulcers, choroidal neovascularisation in the
             area of the intended tack location, etc.).

          -  Ocular diseases or conditions (other than cataracts) that prevent adequate
             visualisation of the inner structures of the eye (e.g. corneal opacity, etc.).

          -  Inability to tolerate general anaesthesia or the recommended antibiotic and steroid
             regimen associated with the implantation surgery.

          -  Predisposition to eye rubbing.
