    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until disease progression, last tumor assessment without disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first (up to the data cutoff date [07 Oct 2016])</time_frame>
    <description>PFS = time from randomization to first documentation of radiographic progression (RP),unequivocal clinical progression or death due to any cause (death within 112 days of treatment discontinuation without objective evidence of RP),whichever occurred first as per investigator. Unequivocal disease progression was pain requiring chronic administration of analgesics, decline of prostate cancer of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score to 3 or higher or initiation of new anticancer therapy/radiation therapy or surgical intervention due to tumor progression. ECOG score range= 0(no severity) to 5(maximum severity).RP for bone disease was evaluated by appearance of 2 or more new bone lesions as per Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) or for soft tissue disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor version 1.1. Participants with no PFS event at analysis date were censored at last tumor assessment date prior to data cutoff date.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until disease progression, last tumor assessment without disease progression, whichever occurred first (up to the data cutoff date [07 Oct 2016])</time_frame>
    <description>Time from date of randomization to the date of first confirmed PSA progression as per Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2). For participant's whose PSA decreased at Week 13 after randomization, progression was defined as 25 percent (%) PSA increase relative to nadir or absolute increase of &gt;=2 nanogram/milliliter (ng/mL) above nadir. Progression was confirmed if another assessment measured at least 3 weeks later met the criterion as well. For participant's whose PSA did not decrease at Week 13 after randomization, progression was defined as 25% PSA increase relative to baseline assessed 12 weeks after baseline. Participants who were not known to have had a PFS event at the analysis date were censored at last PSA assessment date prior to data cutoff date.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until disease progression, last tumor assessment without disease progression, whichever occurred first (up to the data cutoff date [07 Oct 2016])</time_frame>
    <description>PSA response rate was defined as percentage of participants with &gt;=30% and &gt;=50% decrease in PSA from baseline at randomization to the maximal PSA response with a threshold of 30% and 50% respectively. PSA response was confirmed if another assessment measured at least 3 weeks later met the criterion as well.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until CR or PR, whichever occurred first (up to the data cutoff date [07 Oct 2016])</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate as assessed by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) was defined as 1) Percentage of participants with confirmed best overall complete response (CR) and partial response (PR); 2) Percentage of participants with CR, PR and stable disease (SD) for target lesions or non-progressive disease for non-target lesions. CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target and non-target lesions, including target and non-target lymph nodes reduction to &lt;10 millimeter (mm) in short axis. No new lesions and disappearance of all non-target lesions. PR: &gt;= 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, compared to the sum at baseline. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Pain Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Rate of pain progression was defined as percentage of participants with an increase of &gt;=30% from baseline in the mean Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) pain intensity item scores of 4 items assessing average, worst, least, and intermediate pain severity. BPI-SF is an 11-item self-report questionnaire that is designed to assess the severity and impact of pain on daily functions of a participant. BPI-sf includes 4 questions that assess pain intensity (worst, least, average, right now) and 7 questions that assess impact of pain on daily functions (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, enjoyment of life). BPI-sf score range for each item was from 0=no pain to 10=worst possible pain. Total score was reported as average of individual questions ranges from 0 to 10, where lower scores indicated less pain or less pain interference.</description>

    <measure>Time to First Use of New Antineoplastic Therapy for Prostate Cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until date of first use of any antineoplastic therapy (after last dose date of Period 2, up to the data cutoff date [07 Oct 2016])</time_frame>
    <description>It was defined as time from randomization to the date of first use of subsequent antineoplastic therapy for prostate cancer. For participants who had not started subsequent antineoplastic therapy as of data analysis cutoff date, the time to first use of subsequent antineoplastic therapy was censored at the date of last assessment.</description>

        <description>Objective response rate as assessed by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) was defined as 1) Percentage of participants with confirmed best overall complete response (CR) and partial response (PR); 2) Percentage of participants with CR, PR and stable disease (SD) for target lesions or non-progressive disease for non-target lesions. CR: Disappearance of all non-nodal target and non-target lesions, including target and non-target lymph nodes reduction to &lt;10 millimeter (mm) in short axis. No new lesions and disappearance of all non-target lesions. PR: &gt;= 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, compared to the sum at baseline.

        <description>Rate of pain progression was defined as percentage of participants with an increase of &gt;=30% from baseline in the mean Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) pain intensity item scores of 4 items assessing average, worst, least, and intermediate pain severity. BPI-SF is an 11-item self-report questionnaire that is designed to assess the severity and impact of pain on daily functions of a participant. BPI-sf includes 4 questions that assess pain intensity (worst, least, average, right now) and 7 questions that assess impact of pain on daily functions (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, enjoyment of life). BPI-sf score range for each item was from 0=no pain to 10=worst possible pain. Total score was reported as average of individual questions ranges from 0 to 10, where lower scores indicated less pain or less pain interference.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life as Assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) Global Score</title>
        <description>The FACT-P is a multidimensional, self-reported quality of life instrument consisting of 27 core items that assess participant function in 4 domains: physical, social/family, emotional, functional well-being, and supplemented by 12 site-specific items to assess for prostate-related symptoms. Each item is rated on a 0 to 4 Likert-type scale, and then combined to produce subscale scores for each domain, as well as a global quality of life score which is the sum of all 5 domain scores and ranges from 0 to 156 where higher scores represent better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life as Assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) Social/Family Well-Being Domain Scores</title>
        <description>The FACT-P is a multidimensional, self-reported quality of life instrument consisting of 27 core items that assess participant function in 4 domains: physical, social/family, emotional, functional well-being, and supplemented by 12 site-specific items to assess for prostate-related symptoms. Each item is rated on a 0 to 4 Likert-type scale, and then combined to produce subscale scores for each domain. Total subscale score range for social/family well-being domain is from 0 (worst response) to 32 (best response), where higher score indicate better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life as Assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) Emotional Well-Being Domain Scores</title>
        <description>The FACT-P is a multidimensional, self-reported quality of life instrument consisting of 27 core items that assess participant function in 4 domains: physical, social/family, emotional, functional well-being, and supplemented by 12 site-specific items to assess for prostate-related symptoms. Each item is rated on a 0 to 4 Likert-type scale, and then combined to produce subscale scores for each domain. Total subscale score range for emotional well-being domain is from 0 (worst response) to 24 (best response), where higher score indicate better quality of life.</description>

        <description>The FACT-P is a multidimensional, self-reported quality of life instrument consisting of 27 core items that assess participant function in 4 domains: physical, social/family, emotional, functional well-being, and supplemented by 12 site-specific items to assess for prostate-related symptoms. Each item is rated on a 0 to 4 Likert-type scale, and then combined to produce subscale scores for each domain. Total subscale score range for functional well-being domain is from 0 (worst response) to 28 (best response), where higher score indicate better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life as Assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) Prostate Cancer Domain Scores</title>
        <description>The FACT-P is a multidimensional, self-reported quality of life instrument consisting of 27 core items that assess participant function in 4 domains: physical, social/family, emotional, functional well-being, and supplemented by 12 site-specific items to assess for prostate-related symptoms. Each item is rated on a 0 to 4 Likert-type scale, and then combined to produce subscale scores for each domain. Total subscale score range for prostate cancer domain is from 0 (worst response) to 48 (best response), where higher score indicated better quality of life with fewer symptoms.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69, 73, 77, 81, 85, 89</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population included all participants randomly assigned to study treatment. Here, n signifies those participants who were evaluable at specified time points.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life as Assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) Physical Well-Being Domain Scores</title>
        <description>The FACT-P is a multidimensional, self-reported quality of life instrument consisting of 27 core items that assess participant function in 4 domains: physical, social/family, emotional, functional well-being, and supplemented by 12 site-specific items to assess for prostate-related symptoms. Each item is rated on a 0 to 4 Likert-type scale, and then combined to produce subscale scores for each domain. Total subscale score range for physical well-being domain is from 0 (worst response) to 28 (best response), where higher score indicate better quality of life.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69, 73, 77, 81, 85, 89</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population included all participants randomly assigned to study treatment. Here, n signifies those participants who were evaluable at specified time points.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Quality of Life as Assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) Physical Well-Being Domain Scores</title>
          <description>The FACT-P is a multidimensional, self-reported quality of life instrument consisting of 27 core items that assess participant function in 4 domains: physical, social/family, emotional, functional well-being, and supplemented by 12 site-specific items to assess for prostate-related symptoms. Each item is rated on a 0 to 4 Likert-type scale, and then combined to produce subscale scores for each domain. Total subscale score range for physical well-being domain is from 0 (worst response) to 28 (best response), where higher score indicate better quality of life.</description>
          <population>ITT population included all participants randomly assigned to study treatment. Here, n signifies those participants who were evaluable at specified time points.</population>

        <title>Time to Degradation of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) Global Score</title>
        <description>Time to degradation of FACT-P was defined as the time from randomization to first assessment with at least a 10-point decrease from baseline in the global FACT-P score for each participant. The FACT-P is a multidimensional, self-reported quality of life instrument consisting of 27 core items that assess participant function in 4 domains: physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being, and supplemented by 12 site-specific items to assess for prostate-related symptoms. Each item is rated on a 0 to 4 Likert-type scale, and then combined to produce subscale scores for each domain, as well as a global quality of life score which is the sum of all 5 domain scores and ranges from 0 to 156 with higher scores representing better quality of life. Participants with no score degradation at the time of analysis data cutoff were censored at the date of last assessment showing no degradation.</description>
