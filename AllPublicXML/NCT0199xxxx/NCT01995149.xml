      Background: Lipid lowering response to weight loss in subjects with genetic hyperlipidemias
      and overweight or obesity and its effect on cholesterol metabolism has not been studied.

      Objective: To explore the effects of weight loss on lipid values and cholesterol metabolism,
      by measuring circulating non-cholesterol sterols, in overweight or obese subjects with
      genetic hypercholesterolemias.

      Design: The investigators conducted a 6-months weight loss intervention in subjects with the
      diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL),
      body mass index &gt;25 kg/m2, steady weight (±3 kg in the last 3 months) and absence of lipid
      lowering drugs in the previous 5 weeks. They were advised to follow a hypocaloric diet with a
      deficit of 600 kcal (30% fat, 15% protein, and 55% carbohydrates) per day as calculated from
      the person's resting energy expenditure and activity level. Anthropometric data, biochemical
      analysis including lipids, apolipoproteins and non-cholesterol sterols were evaluated at
      baseline, 3 months and 6 months.

Non-cholesterol sterols: Phytosterols (campesterol, stigmasterol and sitosterols) and cholestanol (which are stated as subrogate markers of intestinal cholesterol absorption) and desmosterol, lathosterol and lanosterol (cholesterol synthesis markers).</description>

    <description>The weight loss intervention had a total duration of 6 months. Each participant's caloric prescription represented a deficit of 600 kcal per day as calculated from the person's resting energy expenditure and activity level using the Harris-Benedict equation. In general, prescribed energy intake was between 1200 kcal and 1600 kcal/day. Dietary composition consisted on 50-55% of carbohydrates, 15-20% of protein and 30% of fat and included a wide variety of foods typical of a Mediterranean diet. Patients were also provided with recipes and shopping counselling to improve intervention compliance and to achieve the weight loss goal. Individual consultations with a nutritionist were performed twice a month to motivate the weight loss and reinforce the intervention.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  Diagnosis of Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia* and Familial Hypercholesterolemia**.

          -  Body mass index &gt; 25 kg/m2.

          -  Steady weight (±3 kg in the last 3 months).

          -  Absence of lipid lowering drugs including sterols supplements in the previous 5 weeks.

               -  Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia diagnosis was based on the presence of primary
                  combined hyperlipidaemia in untreated patients whose serum cholesterol and
                  triglyceride concentrations were above the sex- and age-specific 90th percentiles
                  for the Spanish population, serum total apolipoprotein B concentration ≥ 120
                  mg/dL and there was at least one first-degree relative with hyperlipidemia (total
                  cholesterol and/or triglycerides &gt;90th percentile) (Gómez-Gerique JA et al;
                  1999).

                    -  Familial Hypercholesterolemia was diagnosed in subjects with off-treatment

                       percentile of a Spanish reference population, triglyceride below 200 mg/dL
                       and familial vertical transmission with at least one first-degree relative
                       with LDL cholesterol above age- and sex-specific 95th percentiles
                       (Gómez-Gerique JA et al; 1999).

        Exclusion Criteria:
