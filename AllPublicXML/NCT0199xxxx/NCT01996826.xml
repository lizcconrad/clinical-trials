  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to investigate whether using bevacizumab (Avastin®) is both safe
      and effective at decreasing the likelihood of a high-risk corneal graft rejection. Patients
      who are &quot;high-risk&quot; for rejection have blood vessels growing from the white of the eye into
      the cornea (clear, front region of the eye). The medication is used at the time of surgery
      and in the weeks following surgery. Participants have a 50/50 chance at receiving the active
      study medication or a placebo medication.

      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a drug, bevacizumab (Avastin), in
      preventing blood vessels that often occur after a corneal transplantation which are
      considered at &quot;high-risk&quot; for rejection. In many cases these blood vessels lead to the graft
      rejection and eventual failure of the corneal transplant. It is hoped that this treatment
      will increase the chances of corneal graft survival.

      The medication used in this study is called bevacizumab or Avastin (Genentech, Inc). It works
      by inhibiting the action of a molecule called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF
      is a substance molecule that binds to certain cells to stimulate new blood vessel formation.
      When VEGF is bound to the drug, it cannot stimulate the formation and growth of new blood
      vessels. Growth of blood vessels into the cornea is a complication which can worsen the
      prognosis of your corneal transplant and put the transplant at a higher risk for rejection.
