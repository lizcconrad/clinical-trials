  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and the second leading cause of cancer death
      in men. The purpose of this research study is to compare prostate cancers treated with
      hormone therapy versus prostate cancers treated with hormone therapy plus drugs that directly
      target cancer cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most prostate cancers respond to hormone therapy, also known as chemical castration.
      Unfortunately, castration resistance may occur in certain prostate cancers. Castration
      resistance or hormone refractory prostate cancer means that the cancer continues to progress
      as seen by progressively rising PSA and/or or an increase in tumor mass on bone scan, X-ray,
      CT scan or MRI despite previous hormonal therapy. The researchers are interested in
      understanding mechanisms of castration resistance in prostate cancer by analyzing prostate
      tissue before radical prostatectomy (from prostate biopsy tissue) and after radical
      prostatectomy (whole prostate specimen). They will look at the &quot;molecular signature&quot; of
      prostate cancer cells after hormone therapy to identify the key steps that the cancer cells
      undergo to become resistant to hormone therapy. In addition, the researchers will use other
      medications in addition to hormone therapy in order to block some of the key biochemical
      steps that are thought to mediate treatment resistance. This research will provide crucial
      information for the development of therapies that can improve the clinical outcome of
      patients with advanced prostate cancer.
