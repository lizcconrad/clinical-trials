  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertensive patients often show an exaggerated rise in blood pressure during exercise
      through overactivity of the exercise pressor reflex. An increasing body of evidence suggests
      a role for aldosterone in augmenting the exercise pressor reflex in hypertensive humans. We
      hypothesize that this effect of aldosterone is mediated by its direct action on the central
      nervous system and that administration of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists constitute
      an effective treatment for EPR overactivity in hypertension, independent of reductions in
      resting BP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertensive patients are known to display exaggerated rise in blood pressure (BP) during
      exercise but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.

      Traditionally, muscle afferents were dichotomized as metaboreceptors, which are activated
      slowly and only during intense or ischemic muscle contraction, or mechanoreceptors, which
      respond quickly to even mild deformation of their receptive fields. The increase in
      sympathetic nerve activity and BP caused by activation of these receptors, known as exercise
      pressor reflex, is normally buffered by activation arterial baroreceptors, which are reset to
      operate at higher BP range but at the same level of sensitivity. Mechanisms responsible for
      overactive exercise pressor reflex in hypertension remain unknown, but an increasing body of
      evidence suggested a role for aldosterone in regulating resting central sympathetic outflow
      in both hypertensive rats and humans.

      Experiments will be performed on 3 groups of subjects 1) stage I (140-159/90-99 mmHg)
      subjects with essential hypertension, 2) stage I hypertensive subjects with Primary
      Aldosteronism (PA), and 3) normotensive controls. All participants will attend a baseline
      study visit, which will include a physical examination, a medical history review, vital sign
      measurements, and blood and urine collection. Small electrodes will be used to measure muscle
      nerve activity while the subjects perform a series of exercises that include passive arm
      cycling, active arm cycling, rhythmic hand grip, sustained hand grip and cold pressor test.
      Muscle blood flow will be measured before and after hand grip exercises.

      A subgroup of subjects with essential hypertension and PA will be assigned to receive
      Eplerenone or Amlodipine on a randomized, double-blinded design. Participants will attend two
      weeks visits over a period of 16 weeks. Study visits include measurement of vital signs and
      blood samples collection. After completing 8 weeks on each medication, muscle nerve activity
      will be measured while performing the same exercises described in the baseline study visit.

    <description>Investigators will measure sympathetic nerve activity from the peroneal nerve by inserting a tiny needle directly into the nerve in the leg. Investigators will localize the nerve by electrical stimulation over the skin using a blunt probe. With this stimulation, subject will notice either involuntary twitching or a tingling sensation, which may be annoying but not painful. Investigators will then introduce a tiny, sterile wire needle (an electrode) through the skin at the same location. When the tip of the needle enters the nerve, subjects may again notice involuntary muscle twitches or tingling in the leg. Investigators will then turn the electrical stimulator off and make minor adjustments in the position of the needle until investigators begin to record the nerve signals. The recording needle will remain in position throughout the study.</description>
