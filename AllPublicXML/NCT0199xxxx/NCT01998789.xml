    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an everolimus conversion (EVR)
      protocol as compared to the standard tacrolimus (TAC) based protocol in liver transplant
      recipients, as determined by renal function, rejection rates, and progression to fibrosis (in
      HCV positive subjects). Additionally, safety profile and tolerability of these regimens will
      be assessed.

    <textblock>
      The mainstay of maintenance immunosuppression post-transplantation includes a calcineurin
      inhibitor, either cyclosporine or tacrolimus. The introduction of calcineurin inhibitors led
      to a significant improvement in graft and patient outcomes post solid organ transplantation.
      However, one of the severe limitations of this class of drugs, is its associated
      nephrotoxicity. Data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients reveal that the
      incidence of stage 4 chronic kidney disease or stage 5 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) after
      Orthotopic Liver Transplantation (OLT) at 1, 3, and 5 years is 8%, 14%, and 18%,
      respectively, increasing to approximately 25% by 10 years after transplantation.Furthermore,
      renal dysfunction is associated with a four-fold increase in patient mortality post solid
      organ transplantation.

      Several calcineurin inhibitor sparing and minimizing regimens have been studied. Most
      recently, in the phase III, randomized study in de novo liver transplant
      recipients,demonstrated significantly improved renal function in the tacrolimus minimization
      arm (everolimus plus tacrolimus one year post transplant.In fact superior renal function was
      achieved with the tacrolimus minimization arm one month after randomization and was
      maintained to Month 12. With this pilot study, we aim to compare the efficacy of the standard
      immunosupression post liver transplant with Tacrolimus and Mycophenolic acid (Myfortic)with
      calcineurin sparing regimen using the combination of everolimus and enteric coated
      mycophenolic acid, as determined by the estimated Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at one
      year post transplant, with acceptable rates of biopsy proven rejection.

    <description>Everolimus will be initiated within 24 hours of baseline at a dose of 1 mg po BID (2 mg/day). Therapeutic Drug Monitoring will be performed throughout the study. Tacrolimus should be eliminated when the everolimus target range has been reached. Complete tacrolimus elimination will not occur earlier than 90 days post transplant and no later than 120 days post transplant. Enteric coated mycopenolic acid will be maintained for the duration of the study. Oral corticosteroids may not be eliminated sooner than 180 days post transplantation.
