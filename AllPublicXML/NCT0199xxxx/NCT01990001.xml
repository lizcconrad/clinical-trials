  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The broad objective of this research is to determine whether a quick, simple intervention
      will increase utilization of contraceptive reminders and adherence to short‐term
      contraceptive regimens. Such an intervention could be implemented easily with no additional
      resources into a busy clinical practice.

      The specific aims of the study are to:

        1. Measure the difference in reminder utilization over three months between patients who
           are assisted with initiating the reminder system during their office visit versus those
           who are encouraged to self‐initiate after the visit.

        2. Assess whether provider‐assisted enrollment in the online reminder system improves
           adherence to a short‐term contraceptive regimen compared to self‐ initiated enrollment
           after the visit.
