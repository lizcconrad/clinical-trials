      A randomized clinical trial to assess whether elective induction of labor at 39 weeks of
      gestation compared with expectant management will improve outcomes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the reported increased risks of adverse events in pregnancies extending beyond 39 weeks
      it has been hypothesized that a policy of planned elective induction at 39 weeks could
      improve outcomes for the infant and the mother. For multiparous patients, especially those
      with a favorable cervix, it is perhaps easy to justify an elective induction at 39 weeks
      given the low risk of cesarean section. However, for nulliparous patients the current
      evidence, derived mainly from retrospective observational studies, does not allow a clear
      recommendation. Nevertheless, a trend towards an increased rate of elective labor induction
      in pregnancies at 39 weeks has been reported, indicating that practitioners are more commonly
      using elective induction at this gestational age,even as others caution against routine
      elective induction prior to 41 weeks given the reported increased risk of cesarean delivery.
      Ultimately, a randomized controlled trial is necessary to satisfactorily understand whether
      elective induction of labor of nulliparas at 39 weeks improves neonatal and maternal
      outcomes.
