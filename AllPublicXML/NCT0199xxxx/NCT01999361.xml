  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, open label study in islet transplant recipients after
      complete islet graft rejection/loss, defined as stimulated c-peptide ≤0.3 ng/mL.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After complete islet graft loss is determined, patient's maintenance immunosuppression (i.e.
      sirolimus and tacrolimus) will be discontinued and they will be placed on Myfortic®
      monotherapy for 2 years thereafter. After completion of two years of Myfortic® maintenance
      monotherapy, it will be weaned and subjects will be monitored over the subsequent twelve
      months, for the appearance of sensitization using panel reactive antibody (PRA) levels.

             transplantation.

          5. History of at least one islet transplant.

          6. Stimulated C-peptide &lt;0.3 ng/ml.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known history of untreated severe hyperlipidemia, obesity, or refractory hypertension

          2. For female participants: Positive pregnancy test or presently breast-feeding.

          3. History of active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, or TB.
