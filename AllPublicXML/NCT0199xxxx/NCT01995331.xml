  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe aplastic anemia (SAA)is characterized by the depletion of hematopoietic precursors
      associated with life-threatening complications. High-dose cyclophosphamide has been found to
      yield a complete response (CR) in adults and children with SAA.However, the optimal dosage of
      cyclophosphamide for patients in childhood remains unclear. So we explore the ideal dosage of
      cyclophosphamide for the treatment of children with SAA.

      Tisdale et al. (2000,2002) attempted to compare immunosuppression using ATG/CSA with
      high-dose cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/d for 4 consecutive days) plus CSA in a randomized trial
      of newly diagnosed adults with SAA. Both groups received CSA as part of the treatment
      regimen. However, the trial was terminated prematurely due to excessive morbidity among the
      patients treated in the cyclophosphamide arm. They documented that invasive fungal infections
      were severe among the cyclophosphamide group. Between January 2008 through May 2009, in our
      department, nine pediatric patients with a diagnosis of SAA were enrolled a study with lower
      dose of cyclophosphamide with 30mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive days and combination with CSA,
      this study shows promise for children with severe aplastic anemia.Now we want explore the
      dosage of cyclophosphamide.

    <description>Complete response (CR) was defined as achieving normal levels of hemoglobin adjusted for age, platelet count &gt;100×109/L, and ANC&gt;1.5×109/L. Partial response (PR) was defined as transfusion independence, reticulocyte count &gt;30×109/L, platelet count &gt;30×109/L, and ANC &gt;0.5×109/L above the baseline. Persistence of transfusion requirement or death was evidence of no response (NR).</description>

The dose of CSA was adjusted to maintain trough drug concentration above 150 μg/L and peak drug concentration above 300 μg/L.
Drug, human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF), 5 μg/kg/day subcutaneously starting 24 hrs after the fourth dose of cyclophosphamide, and it was withdrawed when ANC was &gt;1×109/L.</description>
