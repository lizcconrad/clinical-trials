    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of High dose of Methotrexate
      combined with gemcitabine, pegaspargase and dexamethasone (GAD-M regimen) as first-line
      treatment in patients with de novo extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma.

    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that effects of P glycoprotein mediated chemotherapy resistance reduce the
      therapeutic efficacy of anthracycline-based chemotherapy of NK/T cell lymphoma, and agents
      like pegaspargase and large doses of Methotrexate is not affected by the P glycoprotein. A
      number of reports suggest that gemcitabine combined with other chemotherapy drugs has good
      application prospect in the treatment of lymphomas. Dexamethasone is used in combination with
      other agents for the treatment of lymphomas which may be implicated in the development or
      growth of some cancers. So we explored to evaluate the efficacy and safety of High dose of
      methotrexate combined with gemcitabine, pegaspargase and dexamethasone (GAD-M regimen) as
      first-line treatment in patients with untreated extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma.
