    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to observe whether a brushless cleaning device can be equally as
      effective in removing plaque from the teeth as a soft toothbrush. The goal is to give people
      an alternative to bristle brush cleaning if they find they are brushing too hard. The
      hypothesis is that it is possible to maintain healthy teeth and gingiva by using brushless
      methods in conjunction with flossing.
