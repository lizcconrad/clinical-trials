  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exposure to second-hand smoke during pregnancy and early infancy leads to low birth weight
      and childhood illnesses. 50% of all newborns in the UK are exposed to tobacco smoke due to
      maternal smoking or contact with second-hand smoke.

      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of delivering and evaluating the
      effectiveness of a Smoke Free Homes (SFH) health education intervention with pregnant women
      and mothers with newborns to reduce unborn and newborn babies exposure to second-hand smoke.
      The intervention will be delivered through routine antenatal and postnatal healthcare
      settings provided by midwifery and health visiting services.

      The intervention consists of educational materials to be given to the woman and a
      conversation held between the woman and midwife/health visitor about protecting the baby from
      second-hand smoke. The development of the intervention has been informed by the views of
      health professionals and service users, incorporates behaviour change theory and has drawn on
      other SFH materials developed for other settings. Different parts of the intervention will be
      delivered at different points along the antenatal and postnatal care pathway. 200 pregnant
      women and their newborns will be recruited.

      We will measure salivary cotinine levels to assess the level of exposure to SHS in women and
      urinary cotinine levels in newborns. We plan to conduct a before-and-after study of the
      delivery of the intervention to test the feasibility of delivering, and methods to evaluate
      the effectiveness of the intervention.

      Feasibility study outputs:

        -  A standardised, acceptable, feasible and appropriate health education intervention to
           protect unborn and newborn babies exposure to second-hand smoke at home, capable of
           being integrated into routine midwifery and health visiting practice

        -  A trial protocol to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on unborn and newborn
           babies' exposure to secondhand smoke.

    <description>We will assess the level of smoking restrictions at home through a Household Survey (questionnaire) completed by the women. The survey is divided into two parts. Part One asks for demographic information and this information will only be collected once, at the start of the study. Part Two asks about smoking behaviour and is based on two questions; (a) Do people in the house smoke in front of pregnant mothers and children? (b) Where do people smoke? Participants will be asked to complete Part B at different points throughout their involvement in the study so that the impact of the delivery of different stages of the intervention can be assessed.
Responses to question (a) will be assessed as a binary outcome. However, responses to question (b) will be grouped into one of three categories. Smoking takes place; (i) in any part of the house; (ii) in one room only; (iii) only outside the house. We will add an additional question to assess smoking restrictions on the visitors.</description>
