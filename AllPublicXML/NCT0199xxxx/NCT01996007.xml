  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumococcus is a bacteria that causes disease of the respiratory tract (pneumonia and middle
      ear infections), blood poisoning, and meningitis. It is frequently carried by people in back
      of the throat without symptoms. Pneumococcal carriage in the Thames Valley region has been
      studied over the last 12 years with carriage rates having been shown to be reflective of
      disease potential and hence vaccine effect. During this time pneumococcal vaccines have been
      introduced into the routine immunisation schedules of this community. The PCV7 (A vaccine
      against 7 types of pneumococcus) vaccine has subsequently been noted to have had a
      significant impact in reducing vaccine serotype carriage and disease. Herd protection
      (indirect protection of unvaccinated individuals) has also been implicated with vaccine
      serotypes not being carried in parents of vaccinated children. The most common serotype
      carried since the introduction of PCV7 is 19A, which is included in the PCV13 vaccine (A
      vaccine against 13 types of pneumococcus). PCV13 has superseded PCV7 in the routine
      immunisation schedule, however its impact on carriage and disease in this community is yet to
      be evaluated.

        One thousand healthy children aged 13-48 months, of which at least 600 will be aged 21-48
        months, who have received 3 doses of PCV13 will be recruited along with a subset (200) of
        their parents/legal guardians

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Children

          -  Parent/guardian of participant is willing and able to give informed consent for
             participation in the study.

          -  In good health as determined by a brief medical history and/or clinical judgement of
             the investigator

          -  Have received three doses of PCV13 as per infant immunisation schedule (as confirmed
             by red book or through vaccination history and age). Vaccination history will be
             confirmed by the child's GP or CHCD. The visit and sampling may still proceed if the
             vaccination history has not been confirmed beforehand and the participant subsequently
             excluded if they are found to not have received all three doses of PCV13.Aged 13-48
             months and at least 28 days since their third PCV13 vaccination.

          -  Able (in the Investigators opinion) and willing to comply with all study requirements.

        Parents/ Legal guardians
