  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of intrapleural AdV-tk therapy in patients with malignant pleural
      effusion (MPE). The primary objective is to test the safety of intrapleural AdV-tk therapy.
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate clinical efficacy and biologic activity

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this open-label, dose escalation clinical trial is to investigate if the
      administration of AdV-tk to patients with MPE followed by valacyclovir and chemotherapy is
      safe, can be effectively delivered without disturbing standard therapy, and will have
      anti-tumor activity in patients with solid tumors.

      The first and second dose levels have been completed, and the study is currently expanded to
      enroll more patients to dose level 2 with Celecoxib.

      Patients will receive one injection of AdV-tk through a pleural catheter on day 0. The
      prodrug, valacyclovir, will be administered orally at a fixed dose for 14 days after each
      AdV-tk injection. Celecoxib will be administered starting 3 days before AdV-tk and continuing
      for 2 days after AdV-tk administration.

      Chemotherapy may begin at any time after completion of valacyclovir. Choice of chemotherapy
      depends on the treating oncologist.

    <description>The primary study endpoint for the phase I portion is safety based on standard laboratory and clinical adverse event monitoring. Safety profile will be characterized by collection of adverse event information and laboratory values during the treatment phase. Acute toxicity data will be collected at each follow up visit every 2-3 weeks until week 8. The long term effects will be evaluated at follow up visits very 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months for the second year. After 2 years, clinical assessment of late toxicity and disease status will be conducted yearly through year 5 after which long-term follow up of general health status will continue yearly through at least 10 years.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have MPE (defined as positive pleural fluid cytology). Eligible patients
             include NSCLC, small cell lung cancer, malignant mesothelioma (MM), breast cancer and
             ovarian cancer. Diagnosis must be made prior to AdV-tk injection. For patients with
             MM, histologic proof is needed, but positive pleural fluid cytology is not required.

          -  Patients must have an indication for placement of pleural catheter

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older

          -  Performance status must be ECOG 0-1

          -  Acute toxic effects from any prior radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or prior surgical
             procedures must have resolved to NCI CTCAE v 4.0 grade ≤ 1

          -  Baseline pulmonary function tests must be FEV1 ≥1 liter or 40% of predicted value (may
             be post-drainage and/or bronchodilator)
