  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To improve the clinical care of women with pelvic pain and abnormal uterine bleeding due to
      benign uterine conditions including leiomyomas (uterine fibroids) and adenomyosis by
      evaluating the accuracy of radiology diagnostic exams (MRI(magnetic resonance imaging),
      ultrasound and ultrasound with elastography).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently benign conditions of the uterus are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. This
      project will help determine which diagnostic radiology exams are most helpful to the
      clinician in providing accurate diagnosis. In addition, this study will evaluate which exam
      (MRI vs. Ultrasound) patients prefer over another exam.

    <description>Pelvic ultrasound with transabdominal and transvaginal imaging. The transvaginal ultrasound will include elastography (TVUS-E). Also, a pelvic MRI will be performed if not done in the last 6 months. The MRI is performed with IV gadolinium-based contrast (MultiHance Â®).
A patient survey will be included.</description>

    <description>Subjects may take part in this arm because they have recently had a MRI performed and scheduled for, or have recently undergone a pelvic ultrasound.
Subjects will also be asked to complete a survey that will state their preference with regards to examination/imaging. This will be done over the phone and will take no longer than 30 minutes to complete.</description>
