      The purpose of this clinical study is to allow the investigation of the Neural Bridging
      System for participants with tetraplegia to assess if the investigational device can
      reanimate a paralyzed limb under voluntary control by the participant's thoughts.

      This study plans to enroll participants who have been diagnosed with C4- C6 ASIA A spinal
      cord injuries (motor and sensory complete neurologic injuries), who are more than 1 year post
      injury, and who are neurologically stable.
