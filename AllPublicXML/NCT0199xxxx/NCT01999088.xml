  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Volunteers were randomly assigned by gender to follow of two 12 weeks experimental periods:
      intervention (I) and control (C) in different order (I/C or C/I). Both periods were separated
      by a 4 weeks wash-out interval during which subjects returned to their usual diet:

      During the I period, volunteers weekly consumed three 150g/serving Functional Meat (FM)
      products (cooked Ham and Turkey breast). It was firmly recommended that all other meats and
      meat derivatives had to be excluded from the diet.

      During the C period, volunteers consumed identical amounts of meat products that did not
      include functional ingredients (Control Meat (CM)).

      Functional meat (FM) products (Functional cooked Ham (FH) and Functional cooked Turkey breast
      (FT)), were manufactured mixing the meats with the patented formula® (P200402755.2004). The
      amount of supercritical rosemary extract, deodorized salmon oil and vitamin E used was
      respectively, 0.02% w/w, 0.6% w/w, and 0.001% w/w.

      Control meat (CM) products (Control cooked Ham (CH) and Control cooked Turkey (CT), were
      prepared without addition of the functional ingredients.
