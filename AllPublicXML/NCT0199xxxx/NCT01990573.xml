  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Three arm randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a single dose of
      intraoperative methadone in reducing post-operative pain and opioid consumption in
      adolescents undergoing posterior spinal fusion. Our secondary goal is to determine the
      pharmacokinetics of IV methadone in children (0.4 and 0.5 mg/kg).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, controlled, modified dose-escalation design. Patients receive standard monitoring
      for anesthesia and postoperative care. Surgical and anesthesia (except for opioid use) care
      are not altered for study purposes. All patients are induced by propofol and muscle
      relaxants. In the first cohort (n=30 evaluable), subjects are randomized 1:2 to either
      control (standard intraop opioid at anesthesiologists' discretion) or methadone HCl (0.4
      mg/kg ideal body weight, IBW). In the second cohort (n=30 evaluable), subjects are randomized
      1:2 to either control (standard intraop opioid) or methadone HCl (0.5 mg/kg ideal body
      weight, IBW). Subjects in the study groups will receive methadone (IV bolus, after induction
      of anesthesia) as their primary intraoperative opioid, rather than leaving the choice of
      intraoperative opioid to the anesthesiologist. Intraoperative breakthrough pain will be
      treated at the discretion of the anesthesiologist with fentanyl. In the control groups,
      intraoperative opioid administration will be left at the discretion of the anesthesia
      providers. Patient controlled analgesia as prescribed by the clinical team, using
      hydromorphone or morphine, will be used to treat postoperative pain relief.

    <description>Assessments are made in the postoperative period by a trained member of the research team blinded to intraoperative use of methadone. These will be conducted on each post-operative day until discharge or post op day 6, whichever comes first. Pain intensity is assessed using the Wong-Baker FACES scale employed by the inpatient nursing staff and previously validated (9). Pain relief is also assessed using a Colored-Visual Analog Scale. Sedation is assessed using a five-point scale (patient fully alert - not arousable). Itching and nausea are assessed using a five-point verbal scale (none, mild, moderate, severe or excruciating).</description>
