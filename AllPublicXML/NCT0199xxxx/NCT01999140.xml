      The ICD Registry™ is a nationwide quality program that helps participating hospitals measure
      and improve care for patients receiving implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and
      cardiac resynchronization therapy devices with defibrillator (CRT-Ds). The ICD Registry
      captures the characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of patients receiving (ICDs).
      Patient-level data is submitted by participating hospitals on a quarterly basis to the
      American College of Cardiology Foundation's (ACCF) National Cardiovascular Data Registry
      (NCDR) which then produces an Outcomes Report of the hospital's data, with comparison to both
      a volume peer group (number of ICD patients submitted annually) and the entire ICD registry
      data set.

      In January 2005 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded the covered
      indications for primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) to
      incorporate the findings from the Sudden Cardiac Death Heart Failure Trial (SCDHeFT) and the
      Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial II (MADIT II). As part of this
      expansion, CMS mandated that a national registry be formed to compile data on Medicare
      patients implanted with primary prevention ICDs to confirm the appropriateness of ICD
      utilization in this patient population.

      Responding to this mandate, a collaborative effort of the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS)and the
      American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), utilizing the expertise of the National
      Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR®), developed the ICD Registry™. Enrollment opened on June
      1, 2005. CMS selected the NCDR ICD Registry as the mandated national registry in October
      2005.
