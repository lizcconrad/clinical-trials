    <textblock>
      The purpose of the INSPIRE-ELR study is to characterize arrhythmias in post MI low EF (≤35%)
      patients in the acute phase (at discharge from hospital after index MI) and chronic phase (at
      8-10 weeks after index MI) and to correlate with patients at high risk of all-cause mortality
      or sudden cardiac death (SCD) at 1 year.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients must meet all of the below criteria to be eligible for the study:

          -  Patients must provide written informed consent/data release consent to

          -  participate in the study.

          -  Acute Myocardial Infarction (STEMI or non-STEMI) documented within 10 days of onset,
             matching one of the following criteria:

          -  Acute ST segment elevation greater than or equal to 0.1 mv on ECG in 2 or more leads
             or new LBBB, with symptoms of ischemia

          -  In all other situations, including non ST segment elevation MI, at least one cardiac
             biomarker value [preferably cardiac troponin (cTn)] above the 99th percentile of a
             normal reference population (upper reference limit (URL)) AND with at least one of the
             following (1) new or presumed new ST-T changes (2) Symptoms or signs of Ischemia (3)
             Development of pathological Q waves in the ECG (4) Identification of an intracoronary
             thrombus by angiography

          -  LVEF less than or equal to 35 percent as measured by echocardiography Simpsons method,
             biplane one day before or on the day of hospital discharge

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients who cannot be discharged from the hospital within14 days after index
             Myocardial Infarction event

          -  Patients contraindicated for NUVANT system

          -  Comorbidities likely to limit survival to less than the minimal study duration (12
             months)

          -  Participation in an investigational study with known or suspected cardiac effect
             expected to confound the results of this study (e.g. stem cell trials, stent trials,
             cardiac intervention trials, drug trials)

          -  Patients with an existing pacemaker or ICD implanted.

          -  Patients that are dialysis dependent at discharge
