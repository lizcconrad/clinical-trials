  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine how cognitive deficits (e.g.,verbal fluency deficit) in patients
      with Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) relate to specific aspects of brain and function.
      The study team will assess whether the &quot;brain signatures&quot; associated with specific cognitive
      deficits differ in older adults with and without AMD.

    <description>All Participants will receive neurocognitive testing, health and lifestyle surveys, audiometry and eye exams. Brain MRIs will be obtained on half the cohort, as this will provide sufficient power to accomplish the Aims that involve neuroimaging data. These MRIs will be obtained while participants are in the &quot;resting state&quot; meaning they are awake but not instructed to perform specific scanner. Two years after baseline exams, participants will return for repeat data collection. Participants who received an MRI at baseline will receive repeat resting-state, brain MRI at 2-year follow-up, unless they have developed contradictions to MRI scans in the interim.</description>

        This study will include 300 participants: 150 subjects with AMD plus 150 age, gender, and
        education-matched adults without AMD. All participants will receive baseline and 2 year
        neurocognitive tests and a subset will provide structural and &quot;resting stage&quot;functional
        magnetic resonance images (MRIs) at each time point.
