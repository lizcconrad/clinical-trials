      Primary Objective: To determine the rate of downstaging to resectability in patients with
      borderline resectable pancreatic cancer receiving FOLFIRINOX and SBRT as preoperative
      therapy.

      Secondary Objective(s):

        1. To assess the disease-free-survival, overall survival, time to recurrence and site of
           recurrence in patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer receiving
           preoperative FOLFIRINOX followed by SBRT

        2. To investigate the safety and tolerability of FOLFIRINOX and SBRT in patients with
           resectable pancreatic cancer

        3. To determine the radiologic and pathological response associated with preoperative SBRT
           and FOLFIRINOX therapy

        4. To assess quality of life through and after treatment using the FACT-Hep questionnaire

      The study investigators hypothesize that neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX can be safely and
      efficaciously delivered using a sequential regimen with SBRT as an alternative to standard
      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Standard of care neoadjuvant treatment typically requires
      about six weeks of treatment with sub-systemic dosing of chemotherapy. The feasibility of the
      sequential delivery of the FOLFIRINOX followed by SBRT will be evaluated by capturing the
      prevalence of grade 3 toxicity and the treatment delay rate.

      In our study, SBRT is planned sequentially to follow cycle 4 of chemotherapy treatment,
      provided toxicity has resolved to grade 2 or less. Thus, allowing for resolution of
      chemotherapy toxicity prior to initiation of radiation therapy. This interval and the fact
      that there is no concurrent delivery of chemo-RT, based on previously discussed experiences,
      including approaches where SBRT safely follows other intense chemotherapy regimens (see
      Polistina et al and Chuong [35,36]) makes this study feasible without establishing toxicity
      profile.

      The proposed regimen of 4 cycles of FOLFIRINOX followed by 30 Gy/5 fractions using SBRT will
      be safely tolerated and will improve resectability rates in borderline resectable PDAC
      patients. In addition, this regimen will not compromise the ability to achieve a successful
      Whipple resection.

      This regimen will improve the local control rate and overall disease free survival in this
      patient population. The investigators further hypothesize that early administration of
      FOLFIRNOX will provide optimal systemic therapy to control clinically occult micrometastases.
