    <measure>Change From Baseline in Peak Inspiratory Capacity (IC) Comparison Between QVA149 and Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, day 22, baseline day 36, day 57</time_frame>
    <description>Inspiratory capacity (IC) will be measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. The mean of 3 acceptable measurements will be calculated and reported in liters. In this cross-over trial, we had two baselines collected at day 1 and collected at day 36. From the IC measurements collected on either Day 22 or 57, respectively, the appropriate baseline measurements were subtracted - so either Day 22-Day1 or Day 57-Day36</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Comparison of QVA149 Versus Placebo With Respect to Average Physical Activity Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, day 22, baseline day 36, day 57</time_frame>
    <description>Average physical activity level is defined by average daily activity-related energy consumption [Kcal/day], measured via Actinography device. In this cross-over trial, we had two baselines collected at day 1 and collected at day 36. From the activity measurements collected on either Day 22 or 57, respectively, the appropriate baseline measurements were subtracted - so either Day 22-Day1 or Day 57-Day36</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, day 22, baseline day 36, day 57</time_frame>
    <description>The average number of steps per day will be measured via Actinography device. In this cross-over trial, we had two baselines collected at day 1 and collected at day 36. From the activity measurements collected on either Day 22 or 57, respectively, the appropriate baseline measurements were subtracted - so either Day 22-Day 1 or Day 57-Day36</description>

    <measure>Change in the Duration of at Least Moderate Activity Per Day Comparison of QVA149 Versus Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, day 22, baseline day 36, day 57</time_frame>
    <description>Least moderate activity (defined as 3,5-7kcal/min) will be measured via Actinography device. In this cross-over trial, we had two baselines collected at day 1 and collected at day 36. From the activity measurements collected on either Day 22 or 57, respectively, the appropriate baseline measurements were subtracted - so either Day 22-Day1 or Day 57-Day36</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 or day 36</time_frame>
    <description>Inspiratory capacity (IC) will be measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. The mean of 3 acceptable measurements will be calculated and reported in liters. In this cross-over trial, we had two baselines collected at day 1 and collected at day 36. The IC measurements collected prior to dosing on either Day 1 or 36, respectively, were subtracted from the appropriate peak measures on the same respective days</description>

    <measure>Peak Forced Expiratory Volume 1 (FEV1) Comparison Between QVA149 and Placebo at Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 or day 36</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced exhalation, measured through spirometry testing. The mean of 3 acceptable measurements will be calculated and reported in liters. In this cross-over trial, we had two baselines collected at day 1 and collected at day 36. The FEV1 measurements collected prior to dosing on either Day 1 or 36, respectively, were subtracted from the appropriate peak measures on the same respective days</description>

        may be considered for inclusion. In such patients, atrial fibrillation must be present at
        baseline and screening visits, with a resting ventricular rate &lt; 100/min.

        impairment or urinary retention.

        Patients with a history of malignancy of any organ system, treated or untreated, within the
        past 5 years whether or not there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases, with the
        exception of localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin. Patients with non-melanoma skin
        carcinoma may be considered for the study.

        Patients with a body mass index (BMI) of more than 40 kg/m2. Women who are pregnant or
        breast feeding Patients requiring long term oxygen therapy on a daily basis for chronic
        hypoxemia.

        Patients who have had a COPD exacerbation that required treatment with antibiotics and/or
        oral corticosteroids and/or hospitalization in the 6 weeks prior to screening.

        Patients who have had a respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks prior to screening.

        Patients with any history of asthma. Patients with concomitant pulmonary disease Patients
        with clinically significant bronchiectasis. Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion
        criteria may apply
