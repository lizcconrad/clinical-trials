  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the rate of radial artery occlusion post
      transradial cardiac catheterization through different modalities.

      The study hypothesis is that specialized imaging can provide specific information to help
      identify hand complications after cardiac catheterization through the wrist.

      The purpose of this study is to establish the rate of radial artery occlusion post
      diagnostic/interventional cardiac catheterization through different modalities, and to
      compare current assessment methods (such as Allen's test, Modified Barbeau test and duplex
      ultrasonography) to specialized imaging techniques for sensitivity and specificity of radial
      artery occlusion detection post transradial catheterization.

      The study hypothesis is that specialized imaging can provide a specific focused analysis of
      hand characteristics to identify physiologic abnormalities as a result of radial artery
      occlusion post transradial catheterization.

    <study_pop>

        The subjects consist of patients who present to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for
        an angiogram or percutaneous intervention for the first time.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult subjects over the age of 18 who present to the Jesse Brown VA cath lab for a
             diagnostic radial artery angiogram or percutaneous intervention will be considered for
             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any subject who is unable to give informed consent or declines to participate will be
             excluded.

          -  Patients who have previously had a cardiac catheterization through the radial artery
             will be excluded because it will not be known if the changes to the circulation of the
             hand is secondary to the current or previous transradial catheterization.
