      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the acute safety of deploying and
      implanting the Altura Endograft in the treatment of AAA in subjects who are candidates for
      endovascular repair.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the acute and longer-term safety and performance of the
      Altura Endograft through 5 years.

      The primary safety endpoint of the study is freedom from Major Adverse Events (MAE), a
      composite endpoint consisting of death, stroke, paraplegia, myocardial infarction,
      respiratory failure, renal failure, bowel ischemia and blood loss ≥ 1000 mL.
