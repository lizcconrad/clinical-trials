      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the accuracy of the newly released Masimo SpHb
      Butterfly Sensor with RevK version and compare the results to a blood hemoglobin level
      analyzed in the UCSF Clinical Laboratories. A secondary purpose is to assess the blood
      hemoglobin using the Masimo Pronto-7 hand-held device immediately prior to surgery.

      -  Masimo SpHb™ continuous hemoglobin monitoring The Masimo SpHb™ monitor with the
           Butterfly Sensor with RevK version will be used to continuously monitor hemoglobin
           electronically. The Butterfly Sensor will be connected to the 3rd or 4th finger on
           either the right or left hand.

        -  Masimo Pronto-7™ intermittent hemoglobin monitoring The Masimo Pronto-7™ is a hand-held,
           noninvasive device used for intermittent measuring of blood hemoglobin. The device is
           connected to a re-usable sensor which is clipped onto a finger for quick spot-check
           readings. A reading from the Pronto-7 will be taken immediately before surgery.

        -  Blood sampling for hemoglobin determination For the study, about a ½ tsp of blood will
           be collected from the arterial line placed for the purpose of surgery approximately
           every hour during the surgery to obtain a hemoglobin measurement to be analyzed in the
           UCSF Clinical Lab.
