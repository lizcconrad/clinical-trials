  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conduct this study to access the effect of corneal edema (the investigators
      are particularly interested in those who have the clinical central corneal edema) on the
      variation of intraocular pressure values measured by 3 commercial-available tonometers
      compare to the current gold standard tonometer; Goldmann applanation tonometer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous published articles reported on the effect of corneal edema on the accuracy of
      tonometry were performed in enucleated cadaver eyes, or contact lens-induced corneal edema
      eyes. Thus, it remains unclear as to how the clinical corneal edema that is found in routine
      clinical practice will affect the variation of intraocular pressure measurement using the
      standard Goldmann applanation tonometer and other more modern tonometers such as the dynamic
      contour tonometer, the iCare, and the Tonopen.
