  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether metformin is effective in lowering plasma
      IL-6 level and improving the treatment response in patients with non-small cell lung cancer

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Several
      clinical studies show metformin could decrease IL-6 level in addition to the glucose-lowering
      effect. Preclinical data also reveal metformin could decrease the IL-6 production in lung
      cancer cells and enhance cytotoxicity of chemotherapy in animal model. Based on these
      findings, the purpose of this study is to determine whether metformin is effective in
      lowering plasma IL-6 level and improving the treatment response in patients with non-small
      cell lung cancer clinically. Patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma will be enrolled in
      this study and receive standard treatments for lung cancer, either chemotherapy combining
      cisplatin and pemetrexed or targeted therapy (Gefitinib). For patients with plasma IL-6 more
      than 2.0 pg/ml after 2 cycles of standard treatment, metformin will be given and titrated to
      1500mg/day gradually. Plasma IL-6 level will be checked after use of metformin for 12 weeks.
      Tumor response to the standard treatment plus metformin will be evaluated and side effects of
      metformin will also be monitored.

    <description>Participants enrolled in this study will be treated with either chemotherapy (Cisplatin 75mg/m2 plus Pemetrexed 500mg/m2 on D1) for 4 cycles or targeted therapy (Gefitinib 250mg/d) till disease progression according to physicians' decision. For participants with plasma IL-6 &gt; 2.0 pg/mL after 2 cycles of chemotherapy or targeted therapy, Metformin 500mg orally qd will be given on Day 1 of cycle 3. If patient could tolerate it well, metformin will be titrated to 500mg bid in the following week (Cycle 3 D8) and 500mg tid in the 3rd week (Cycle 3 D15). For patients receiving chemotherapy, metformin will be used for total 12 weeks and plasma IL-6 level will be checked at the end of metformin treatment. For patients receiving targeted therapy, metformin will be used till disease progression and plasma IL-6 level will be measured after use of metformin for 12 weeks.</description>
