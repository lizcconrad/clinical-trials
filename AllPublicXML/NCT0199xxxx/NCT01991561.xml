      A phase 2, Randomized, Observer-blind, Multicenter, Dose-Ranging Study to Evaluate the
      Immunogenicity, Safety, and Tolerability of the plant-made H5 VLP Influenza vaccine
      adjuvanted with Alhydrogel or Glucopyranosyl-lipid adjuvant in squalene emulsion (GLA-SE), in
      healthy adults 18-60 years of age.

      This study will consist of a dose-ranging in 390 subjects who will be randomized to receive
      one injection at Days 0 and 21 of either a low, medium or a high dose of H5 VLP Influenza
      vaccine combined with Alhydrogel®, or a low or high dose of H5 VLP Influenza vaccine combined
      with GLA-SE, or the placebo preparation (100 millimolar (mM) phosphate buffer + 150 mM Sodium
      Chloride (NaCl) + 0.01% Tween 80). Seven-day (7) safety data after the first immunization of
      the first 25% study subjects enrolled (98 subjects) will be tabulated and reviewed by the
      Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), prior to permitting the first immunization of the
      remaining study subjects and the second immunisations. Also, based on medical expert opinion
      and on safety criteria defined in the protocol, a DSMB review might be necessary on the
      seven-day safety data of the same 25% study subjects following administration of their second
      dose, before proceeding to the second immunizations of the remaining study subjects.
      Twenty-one (21) days after each immunization, key safety and immunogenicity data will be
      collected and analysed. All subjects will be followed for safety until Day 407.

             for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled medical or neuropsychiatric

             sampling at Day 228. Immunization on an emergency basis of a tetanus and diphtheria
             toxoids adsorbed for adult use (Td) will be allowed provided the vaccine is not
             administered within two weeks prior to test article administration. Receipt of any
             other emergency immunizations (e.g. rabies) will result in a case-by-case review of
             continued participation;

          7. Use of any investigational or non-registered product within 30 days prior to study
             enrolment or planned use during the study period. Subjects may not participate in any
             other drug study while participating in this study;

          8. Treatment with systemic glucocorticoids at a dose exceeding ≥ 10 mg of prednisone per
             day, or equivalent for more than 7 consecutive days or for 10 or more days in total,

             aspirin, and without a clinically apparent bleeding tendency are eligible;

         10. History of previous H5N1 vaccination or a history of exposure to H5N1 virus. Any
             subject that was enrolled on our previous H5 studies (except the ones that received
             placebo) would not be eligible;

         11. Are at high risk of contracting H5N1 influenza infection (e.g. poultry workers);

         12. History of allergy to any of the constituents of H5 VLP (H5N1) study vaccine,
             Alhydrogel® (aluminum hydroxide), GLA-SE, or the phosphate buffer;

         19. If female, and of childbearing potential, has not been consistently using effective
             birth control for the 28 days prior to study entry. An example of highly effective
             birth control is oral contraceptives, hormone implants, abstinence (self-reported), or
             male condom plus spermicide. All female subjects, regardless of birth control history
             must provide a serum sample for pregnancy screening. Effective birth control must be
             used for the duration of the study for female of child bearing potential. The subject
             must have no plan to become pregnant during the study period;

             are eligible.
