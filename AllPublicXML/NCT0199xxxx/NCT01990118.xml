      The purpose of this study is to establish the therapeutic equivalence of Gengraf® with the
      standard treatment Neoral® for a treatment period of 6 months in stable renal allograft
      transplant recipients with respect to drug levels, dosage, and acute graft rejection and
      other adverse events.

    <textblock>
      The introduction of cyclosporine (CsA) into clinical practice resulted in improvements in
      acute renal allograft rejection rate and graft survival in renal transplant patients. Gengraf
      a microemulsion formulation of CsA though granted an AB-rated equivalent to Neoral, because
      of concerns over the use of generic drugs in transplantation, we undertook this study to
      evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Gengraf.

      We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open labeled study to establish the equivalence
      between Gengraf and Neoral in stable renal transplant recipients for a treatment period of 6
      months. 6 months post transplant patients with stable graft function and receiving a stable
      dose of neoral were recruited into the study. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to
      remain on Neoral or convert to an equal milligram-for-milligram dose of Gengraf. The primary
      end-point was serum creatinine at 26 weeks.

             within 30 days preceding the screening phase of this study.

          4. Those persons directly involved in the conduct of the study.

          5. Active infection at the time of screening for enrollment into trial.
