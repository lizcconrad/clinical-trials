  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Succinylcholine is commonly used for neuromuscular relaxation for short procedures such as
      rigid bronchoscopy. A more modern alternative is the application aof rocuronium, reversed by
      sugammadex. The investigators compare the intubating conditions, incidence of postoperative
      myalgia (POM) as well as patient satisfaction for these two muscle relaxants.

    <description>The intubating conditions will be measured using the scoring system proposed for Good Clinical Research Practice using the following variables: conditions of inserting the rigid bronchoscope, vocal cord position and coughing</description>

    <description>The severity of POM is measured by using a four-point-scale:
0. no myalgia
minor pain limited to one area of the body
muscle pain or stiffness noticed spontaneously by the patient, which may have required analgesic therapy
generalized, severe or incapacitating discomfort</description>

    <description>Anaesthesia is induced and maintained with propofol (1-2 mg/kg) and remifentanil (0,5 µg/kg). The study arm is immobilized and after cleaning the skin a dual electrode for peripheral nerve stimulation is placed over the ulnar nerve near the wrist. Neuromuscular monitoring is performed with accelerometry. After induction of anaesthesia the patient receives muscle relaxant according to the study group.</description>
