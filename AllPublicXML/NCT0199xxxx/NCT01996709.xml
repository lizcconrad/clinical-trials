    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Investigator Rated Lid Papillae Maximum Score at Day 90</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Lid papillae (bumps on the inner eyelid) were assessed by the investigator using slit-lamp biomicroscopy and classified independently for the four palpebral zones (upper lid=1-3; lower lid=4) on a 5-point forced choice scale, where 0 = None; 1 = Slight (diffuse papillae); 2 = Mild (diffuse &amp; tufts papillae); 3 = Moderate (moderate &amp; tufts papillae); 4 = Severe (giant papillae). The maximum of the four zones was selected for the analysis. Both eyes were included in the model for analysis. A higher change value indicates a larger reduction in the severity of the lid papillae.</description>

    <description>As interpreted and reported by the subject on a questionnaire. A 5-point Likert scale was used, where 1=strongly disagree; 2=disagree; 3=undecided; 4=agree; 5=strongly agree. The Top-2-box response (agree, strongly agree) was calculated and reported as a percentage of all responses.</description>

    <description>As interpreted and reported by the subject on a questionnaire. The subject was asked, &quot;During a typical day in the past 2 weeks, how often did your eyes feel gritty and/or scratchy while wearing your contact lenses?&quot; and responded on a 5-point scale (1 = Never; 2 = Rarely; 3 = Sometimes; 4 = Frequently; 5 = Constantly).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current biweekly or monthly silicone hydrogel contact lens wearer (excluding Air
             Optix® brand) and have worn these lenses bilaterally for at least three (3) months
             prior to Visit 1 (daily wear use only).

          -  Symptoms of contact lens discomfort as defined by the protocol.

          -  Habitual use of a biguanide-preserved multi-purpose solution for at least 30 days
             prior to Visit 1.

          -  Mild to severe (grade 2-4) Investigator rated palpebral roughness in one or more zones
             of either eye.

          -  Other protocol-specified inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Extended (over-night) contact lens wearer.

          -  Any systemic or ocular disease or disorder (refractive disorder allowed and mild dry
             eye with successful contact lens wear is permitted), complicating factors or
             structural abnormality that would negatively affect the conduct or outcome of the
             study.

          -  Topical ocular over the counter (OTC) or prescribed medications, with the exception of
             contact lens rewetting drops, within 7 days of enrollment.

          -  Other protocol-specified exclusion criteria may apply.
