  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether short term treatment with a antihypertensive
      medication prazosin, can influence the levels of a dopamine in the brain. We will examine the
      levels of dopamine in the the brain using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI). We hypothesize that there will be no significant changes in dopamine
      levels in healthy individuals taking prazosin.

      The purpose of this study is to find out whether short term treatment with a antihypertensive
      medication prazosin, can influence the levels of dopamine in the brain. We will examine the
      levels of dopamine in the the brain using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI). The study will involve three PET scans and one MRI. One PET scan
      will be performed before the participants take prazosin for approximately three weeks, and
      the last two PET scans will be performed after the prazosin medication phase. We hypothesize
      that there will be no significant changes in dopamine levels in healthy individuals taking
      prazosin.

          -  Current use or use during the previous month of medication that may affect the CNS at

          -  Any significant abnormalities in baseline blood results (e.g. CBC, renal and hepatic
             indicators) or ECG readings that would preclude the use of prazosin

          -  Pregnancy, trying to become pregnant or breastfeeding
