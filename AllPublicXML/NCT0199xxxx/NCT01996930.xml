  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney failure is a devastating illness requiring treatment with dialysis or transplantation
      to preserve life. Individuals unable to have transplants are managed by peritoneal dialysis
      (PD)or haemodialysis (HD). PD involves the placement of a soft, flexible plastic tube
      (catheter) into the abdomen, allowing dialysis fluid to be drained in and out of the
      peritoneal cavity. This catheter exits from a hole in the abdomen and occasionally patients
      can have complications at this exit site. One possible complication is over-granulation.
      Over-granulation occurs as the wound attempts to heal and the skin around the exit site
      becomes red,'wet','bumpy' and stands 'proud' of the surrounding skin. An over-granulating
      exit site can lead to discomfort, pain, bleeding and harbour infection. More serious
      complications include dialysis failure, sepsis and death. There are several ways to treat
      over-granulation but there is limited research evidence to demonstrate which treatment is
      best. The study aims to compare current standard treatment which involves the application of
      silver nitrate by qualified nursing staff to chemically burn the tissue away, with an
      alternative treatment which involves the application of steroid impregnated tape to the area
      of over-granulating tissue by the patient themselves.

      This study will be a United Kingdom wide multi-centre trial. A minimum of 40 patients in each
      arm will be recruited. Subjects will be identified using a standardised exit site assessment
      tool by PD nurses in participating units during the routine care of their PD population. Any
      subject with an over-granulating exit site deemed to meet the agreed standard for treatment
      will be invited to participate.

      Therapy will be administered for two weeks followed by an additional two weeks if clinically
      indicated. Treatment must be according to randomisation for the first 28 days. If after 14
      days the over-granulation is worse than at day 0, then a medical decision to continue
      treatment may be taken. A further two weeks of the designated treatment may then be
      administered although this can be discontinued at any point if a satisfactory clinical
      response is observed.

    <description>The primary research objective of this study is to assess the total response at 14 days to treatment with either steroid tape or silver nitrate therapy on the over-granulated tissue surrounding the PD exit site.
Assessment is by two blinded independent investigators (patient and therapy administrators will not be blinded to the therapy received). At each of the study visits, a series of photographs will be taken according to a study specific standard operating procedure and the two assessors will score the exit sites from the photographic series. There is no standardised scoring system for over-granulating exit sites so a scale has been devised:
Score 1: Complete response:complete disappearance of over-granulation Score 2: Partial response: reduction in size or an obvious reduction in intensity of over-granulation Score 3: No change, appearance identical to that of pre-treatment Score 4: Worse, increase in size or increased intensity of over-granulation</description>
