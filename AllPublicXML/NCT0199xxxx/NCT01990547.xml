  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine whether functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI), can distinguish between service members with and without traumatic brain injury
      (TBI), as well as those with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who receive either virtual
      reality exposure therapy (VRET) or PTSD treatment other than exposure therapy. The
      investigators and other investigators have previously identified changes in function in
      multiple regions of the brain in combat veterans with PTSD, and the investigators have also
      seen that structural changes in the white matter associated with combat TBI are also linked
      with changes in function, and in turn with PTSD symptoms. However, the investigators need to
      confirm these findings in larger numbers, and also need to discern whether fMRI can
      distinguish if there is something significantly different about those who have PTSD after TBI
      vs. those in whom it does not follow a TBI. Finally, the investigators have previously
      demonstrated that exposure therapy ameliorates the functional changes in the brain induced by
      PTSD, but the investigators do not know if similar changes occur with other forms of therapy,
      so the investigators seek to compare the two directly. It is our expectation that the
      findings will better inform the choice of therapy for service members with combat-related
      PTSD, with or without TBI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have previously demonstrated that military service members (SMs) with PTSD
      related to deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan have fMRI brain activation patterns similar to
      those reported in other populations with PTSD. The investigators have also demonstrated
      significant improvements, or normalization, in the activation of each of these brain areas
      following exposure therapy. In this study the investigators will assess recovery in SMs
      receiving virtual reality exposure therapy, comparing them to healthy veterans, those with
      history of blast exposure and those with PTSD receiving usual care. The investigators hope to
      (1) demonstrate that fMRI can distinguish between military service members with PTSD, with
      mild TBI, and those who have neither; (2) demonstrate that significant differences are not
      seen in brain activation patterns merely by repeating fMRI scans at 3 month intervals but
      when significant changes are present they in fact represent the effect of the exposure
      therapy intervention; (3) discern whether those with PTSD after TBI have different activation
      patterns than those with PTSD in the absence of TBI; and (4) identify fMRI characteristics of
      resilience in service members who have been deployed but did not develop PTSD.

    <description>Functional MRI: Requires the exposure of subjects to various sensory stimuli while in the scanner, in order to assess the function of specific regions of the brain, by measuring the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal. The Affective Stroop is a validated series of stimuli for distinguishing between those with PTSD and controls, that entails showing participants a variety of pictures (some neutral and some emotionally charged), and also asks them to distinguish between various number patterns.</description>

          2. Able to give written informed consent prior to participation in this study.

          3. Good overall health. Subjects with stable medical problems (e.g., hypertension,

             included.

          4. Specific criteria according to arm:

               1. Healthy OIF/OEF veterans who deployed for at least 3 months in support of OIF/OEF
                  who do not have blast exposure (i.e., within 100 feet of a blast, in which the
                  pressure wave knocked them to the ground or caused other physical symptoms, or
                  the vehicle in which they were riding hit an improvised explosive device, jarring
                  them from their seat) or PTSD: PCL-M&lt;50, negative history of concussion or loss
                  of consciousness.

               2. OIF/OEF veterans with a history of blast exposure (as defined above) who do not
                  meet criteria for PTSD (PCL-M &lt;50)

               3. OIF/OEF veterans with PTSD only who receive usual care: any form of individual or
                  group psychotherapy so long as it does not include exposure therapy, and/or may
                  be on any combination of prescription psychotropic medications; participants in
                  this group may or may not have a history of blast exposure, provided they did not
                  have loss of consciousness of 60 minutes or more or otherwise meet any criteria
                  for moderate or severe TBI.

               4. OIF/OEF veterans with PTSD that will receive VRET through the WRNMMC IRB approved
                  protocol entitled &quot;Enhancing Exposure Therapy for PTSD: Virtual Reality and
                  Imaginal Exposure with Cognitive Enhancer&quot;: must meet entry criteria for that
                  study; most notably, they must have combat-related PTSD; participants in this
                  group may or may not have a history of blast exposure, provided they did not have
                  loss of consciousness of 60 minutes or more or otherwise meet any criteria for
                  moderate or severe TBI.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Dementia or an inability to read or understand written and oral questions for any
             other reason.

          2. The presence of a clinically significant or unstable medical disorder (e.g., unstable
             angina, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic liver
             or kidney disease).

          3. Meet DSM-IV criteria for alcohol abuse within 1 month prior to screening.

          4. Meet DSM-IV criteria for alcohol and/or substance dependence within 1 month prior to
             screening.

          5. Currently at imminent or high risk for homicide or suicide.

          6. A current or past history of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar
             disorder. However, those with a comorbid history of other Axis 1 disorders such as
             major depression, dysthymia, or panic disorder will be included, if there are neither
             psychotic features nor significant suicidal or homicidal ideation.

          7. Active pregnancy, actively seeking to become pregnant or being unwilling to use birth
             control measures if of child-bearing age and sexually active.

          8. Residual shrapnel fragments retained within the body as a result of blast injury, or
             any prosthetic ferro-magnetic metal devices within the body that would pose health
             risks with the use of MRI. Those with MRI-safe surgical devices such as titanium will
             be permitted.

          9. History of claustrophobia or inability to tolerate an MRI in the past without use of
             sedating medicine, as the use of sedating medicine could interfere with interpretation
             of the fMRI.
