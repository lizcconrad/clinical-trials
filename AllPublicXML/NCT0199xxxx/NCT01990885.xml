  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of different amounts of BL-7010 in single
      oral administration and in repeated oral administration to well-controlled celiac patients.
      Another purpose is to evaluate if BL-7010 is absorbed by the body or not.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females aged 18-75 years who have signed an informed consent form

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18.5-29.9, inclusive

          -  Documented history of biopsy-proven celiac disease.

          -  Adherence to a gluten-free diet for the last 6 months prior to randomization

          -  TG2 and EMA antibody (IgA) negative

          -  Women of childbearing potential and all men must agree to use an approved form of
             contraception

          -  Ability and willingness to understand and comply with study procedures and to give
             written informed consent prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  IgA deficiency.

          -  History of IgE-mediated reactions to gluten.

          -  Other food sensitivities or allergies.

          -  Use of oral steroids, biologics, immunosuppressants or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
             drugs 6 months prior to entry (screening).

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Clinically significant, concomitant gastrointestinal disease.

          -  Have clinically significant current or historical medical problems such as diabetes
             mellitus, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias, arteriosclerotic heart disease,
             renal insufficiency or failure, autoimmune disease, history of malignant melanoma or
             history of cancer (excluding basal cell carcinoma) within the past 5 years prior to
             screening.

          -  Subjects receiving drugs or oral devices that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             possible ineffective treatment with these drugs/oral devices for a duration of two
             weeks will put the subject at a medical risk

          -  Uncontrolled complications of celiac disease.

          -  Any other condition that in the opinion of the Investigator will place the subject at
             risk or prevent protocol compliance.
