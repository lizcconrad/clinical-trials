  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a registry study, where sites will enter patients with LGS who require a modification
      in anti-epileptic therapy (either the addition of another anti-epileptic drug, or the change
      of one drug to another). This will include patients who are started on rufinamide. Patients
      will be reviewed according to local practice, but it is envisaged that review will occur at
      approximately one month, three months and six months, and then every six months. Upon entry
      to the registry baseline details concerning disease severity, diagnosis, prior therapy, and
      developmental assessment will be recorded. On each subsequent visit the patient (usually
      through their caregiver) will be asked about current medication, general seizure profile, any
      seizures deemed to be of medical significance, tolerability, AEs (including suicidal-related
      events), and healthcare resource utilisation.

        Participation in this study will be offered to any patient of four years or older, who has
        a known diagnosis of LGS, who requires a change in anti-epileptic therapy. This will
        include patients who are started on rufinamide, as an adjuvant therapy.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Patients will be four years and older

          -  Patients will have an established diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and:

          -  Documented history or current presence of multiple seizure types associated with LGS
             (including tonic or atonic seizures (drop attacks) and atypical absences)

          -  Documented history or current presence of typical EEG abnormalities (e.g., bursts of
             slow spike and wave activity)

          -  Presence of intellectual / learning disability (a variable degree is permitted)

          -  Patients entered on the registry will be those requiring a modification in their
             current anti-epileptic medication. This includes but is not limited to patients who
             are commenced on rufinamide as adjuvant therapy

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Female patients who are pregnant, lactating, or whom are planning to become pregnant

          -  Female patients, of child bearing potential, who are not willing to use appropriate
             contraception (This is at the discretion of the investigator)

          -  Those starting rufinamide and for whom the investigator considers it necessary to
             administer in contradiction to the indications, and warnings within the current
             Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC).
