  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1A/B, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation oncology study to
      evaluate the administration of EC1456 in advanced solid tumors. In part A, EC1456 will be
      dose escalated on 4 concurrently enrolling schedules. FR-positive expression on a
      99mTc-etarfolatide scan is not required for inclusion in Part A.

      Part B of the study will confirm the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2
      (RP2) dose of EC1456, and evaluate the efficacy of EC1456 in NSCLC all subtype patient
      populations with FR-positive cancer in up to three schedules (i.e., twice weekly, once
      weekly, and four times weekly). FR-positive expression on a 99mTc-etarfolatide scan is
      required for inclusion in Part B.

      Minimum length of patient participation is anticipated to be 10 weeks (two 3-week cycles
      followed by a 30 day follow-up period).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In part A, EC1456 will be dose escalated on 4 concurrently enrolling schedules.

      Treatment 1 is EC1456 BIW on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 3-week schedule (BIW); Treatment 2 is
      EC1456 QW on Days 1 and 8 of a 3-week schedule (QW); Treatment 3 is EC1456 QW on Days 1, 8,
      and 15 of a 3-week schedule (CWD) and Treatment 4 is EC1456 QIW on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10,
      and 11 of a 3-week schedule (QIW).

      In part B, EC1456 will be dosed on 3 concurrently enrolling schedules:

      Treatment 5 is EC1456 BIW. Once a dose is determined in Part A, Part B will begin with 3-6
      subjects who will receive consecutive day dosing on Days 1, 2, 8, and 9 of a 3-week schedule.
      If this is not tolerated, the BIW cohort will continue with dosing on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of
      a 3-week schedule; Treatment 6 is EC1456 QW on Days 1 and 8 of a 3-week schedule or CWD on
      Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 3-week schedule; Treatment 7 is EC1456 QIW on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9,
      10, and 11 of a 3-week schedule for at least two cycles. If the patient is eligible to
      continue treatment (based upon treatment response and tolerability), he/she may opt to
      continue on the QIW schedule or change to the Treatment 6 regimen schedule (once its MTD and
      schedule have been determined).

    <description>EC1456 is small molecule drug conjugate of folic acid and tubulysin B hydrazide (TubBH) that specifically binds to the membrane-bound FR and gains entry into the cell via endocytosis.
EC20 is Etarfolatide, a conjugate of folic acid and a tripeptide moiety that can efficiently chelate the radioisotope 99mTechnetium (99mTc). When etarfolatide is labeled with 99mTc, the product (99mTc-etarfolatide) is able to quantify FR expressing tissues with SPECT imaging.</description>
