      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness and usability of multiple
      computer-based treatments for mood and anxiety relevant risk factors. The target of the
      treatment is related to cognitive stress, which has been shown to be associated with a
      variety of negative mental health outcomes such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, suicidal
      ideation, and substance use disorders.

      CATS is a newly developed computerized treatment targeting specific risk factors associated
      with anxiety symptoms and suicidal thoughts. Individuals will be asked to complete four
      appointments, where they will complete various self-report questionnaires as well as a newly
      developed computerized treatment targeting risk factors associated with anxiety.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 4 follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The ASI-3 is an 18-item self-report measure of anxiety sensitivity (AS). This scale was developed to provide a more stable measure of the three most widely recognized AS subfactors (cognitive, social and physical concerns) than the original ASI provides. Each subfactor is represented by six items. The measure has shown good psychometric properties.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Suicide Scale (BSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 4 follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The BSS is a 21-item widely used self-report measure assessing a broad spectrum of behaviors and attitudes related to suicide risk, including suicidal ideation and past suicide attempts. It has demonstrated strong reliability and validity.</description>

    <description>The anxiety risk reduction condition will be a combination of psychoeducation plus Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM-I) for anxiety sensitivity (AS). The psychoeducational component will focus on the nature of stress and its effect on the body. Interoceptive exposure (IE) exercises, designed to correct the conditioned fear to these bodily sensations, will be explained and practiced.</description>
