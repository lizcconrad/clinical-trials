  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the study is that laryngeal US can accurately and reliably diagnose
      laryngomalacia in infants with congenital stridor.

      Stridor is a respiratory noise caused by partial obstruction of the large airways at the
      level of the pharynx, larynx and/or trachea. The most prevalent congenital cause of stridor
      is laryngomalacia. Flexible laryngobronchoscopy (FLB) under sedation is regarded as the gold
      standard. However, FLB under sedation has some drawbacks as it requires venous access, use of
      sedative agents, may cause discomfort for the patient and is costly.

      Ultrasound (US) is a noninvasive, painless, radiation free, well tolerated imaging technique.
      It allows for dynamic assessment of moving structures in an awake patient and the results can
      be easily displayed and recorded.
