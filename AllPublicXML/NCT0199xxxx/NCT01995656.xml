  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study drug
      known as LY3108743 in healthy participants and in participants with type 2 diabetes.

      The study will also investigate how LY3108743 affects the levels of blood sugar and other
      naturally occurring substances (e.g. hormones that control the way sugar is used) in the
      body, how much of the study drug gets into the blood stream, and how long it takes the body
      to get rid of it.

      Information about any side effects that may occur will be collected. The study is expected to
      last approximately 7 to 8 weeks for each participant.

      The study will have up to 3 parts. Participants may enroll in only one part.
