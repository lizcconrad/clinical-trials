      This is a special drug use surveillance on long-term use of Voglibose (Basen) designed to
      determine the safety and efficacy of long-term use of Voglibose (Basen) to prevent
      progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with impaired glucose tolerance in the
      routine clinical setting.

      Subjects will be patients with impaired glucose tolerance. The planned sample size is 1,000.

      The usual adult dosage is 0.2 mg of voglibose administered orally three times daily
      immediately before each meal.

    <description>Estimate over time of the cumulative rate of progression to T2DM. Diagnostic criteria for T2DM are: (1) &quot;Blood glucose ≥200 mg/dL at any time, morning fasting blood glucose ≥126 mg/dL, or 2-hour post 75-g (Oral Glucose Tolerance Test) blood glucose ≥200 mg/dL. (2) Two or more glucose measurements obtained on different days that meet the above-mentioned criteria, or (3) A single glucose measurement meeting the above-mentioned criteria if the patient meets any of the following conditions: (i) Has typical symptoms of diabetes mellitus (e.g., dry mouth, polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss) (ii) HbA1C ≥6.5% (JDS value) (iii) Obvious diabetic retinopathy</description>
