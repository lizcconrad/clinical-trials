  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lung expansion techniques are widely used to prevent postoperative pulmonary
      complications. However, the effect of each technique on thoracoabdominal mechanics after
      abdominal surgery and if it influences the rate of postoperative pulmonary complications
      remains unknown. The investigators hypothesis is that the lung expansion technique that more
      increases lung volume after abdominal surgery, will be the most efficient in preventing
      postoperative pulmonary complication after abdominal surgery. The investigators objectives
      will be to compare the effect of different lung expansion techniques on lung volumes and
      activation of inspiratory muscle, and prevention of pulmonary complications in patients
      undergoing upper abdominal surgery. This study will involve 171 patients undergoing elective
      abdominal surgery. Patients will be randomly divided into 5 groups: no therapy group (n=35),
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP, n=34); volumetric incentive spirometry (VIS,
      n=34); flow oriented incentive spirometry (FIS, n=33) and deep breathing (DB, n=35). The
      thoracoabdominal mechanics will be assessed before and 3 days after surgery. Complications
      will be evaluated by a researcher who did not know to which group each patient belongs.

      The assessments performed were thoracoabdominal kinematics (by optoelectronic
      pletysmography)and respiratory muscles activity (by surface electromyography). The follow
      pulmonary complications were considered: pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, atelectasis and acute
      respiratory failed

    <description>The intervention groups (CPAP, VIS, FIS and DB) used the specific device (or not) according to the group allocation.
The intervention was performed 3 times per day, from 1 to 5 postoperative day. Patients performed 5 sets of 10 repetitions of the specific breathing exercise, with 30 seconds rest between each set.
The sessions were held in the morning, early afternoon and early evening, always supervised by a physiotherapist.
Before starting each session, the patient reported the sensation of pain, and if he quantify pain intensity more than 3 in the visual numeric scale (0 to 10) was asked the doctor to administer analgesics aiming that him to perform properly the breathing exercise.</description>
