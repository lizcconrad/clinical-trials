      Implementation of a home based exercise program to reduce functional decline, cancer related
      fatigue (CRF) and improve quality of life in the elderly gynecologic oncology patient

      Problem:

      Can prevention of CRF and loss of function improve QOL in the elderly gynecologic oncology
      patient undergoing chemotherapy?

      Support:

      Fatigue and its impact on QOL is a major concern with the elderly patient receiving
      chemotherapy. When compared to younger adults QOL is more important than gain in survival for
      elderly patients. (Eyigor, et al., 2010).

      The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends exercise as the most effective
      intervention for cancer related fatigue.

      Methods:

      This is a single institution randomized controlled study to evaluate a home based exercise
      program in elderly gynecologic oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy. Subjects will be
      randomized to the intervention group or to the control group receiving usual care.

      Intervention group will receive a home exercise program 3 days weekly consisting of 30mins of
      strength and aerobic activity, utilizing a follow along exercise DVD and patient log to
      assist with compliance.

      The two groups will be compared by 1) objective PT assessment with the Berg Balance and 6
      minute walk test (before or after) Cycle 1 and 6, 2) subjective nursing assessment with the
      NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) and FACIT- F (Functional Assessment
      of Chronic Illness Therapy: Fatigue) prior to Cycle 1 (baseline),4 (midpoint), and following
      cycle 6 (completion).

      Conclusion:

      PT directed home exercise program may improve CRF, functional decline, and QOL in elderly
      gynecologic oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy.
