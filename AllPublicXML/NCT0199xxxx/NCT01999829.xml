  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation remains a major cause of morbidity following cardiac surgery with
      cardiopulmonary bypass. Many mechanisms have been implicated. Among then, adenosine, a strong
      endogenous vasodilating agent has been involved in cardiac surgery-induced atrial
      fibrillation, via A2A receptors modulation.

      The effects of caffeine on the inducibility of atrial fibrillation are actually well-known,
      leading then to a significant reduction of atrial fibrillation. Moreover, a recent clinical
      study has demonstrated that coffee drinking was inversely associated with total and
      cause-specific mortality.

      The investigators therefore examined the preventive effects of oral caffeine on valvular
      surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass-induced atrial fibrillation. The investigators also
      evaluated prospectively the influence of caffeine on adenosine plasma levels and A2A
      adenosine receptors modulation.
