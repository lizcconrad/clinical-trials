    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JNJ-268229 (Ultiva
      /Remifentanil Hydrochloride) in pediatric participants between 1 and 15 years of age during
      maintenance of general anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is multicenter, open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) one-arm study
      in pediatric participants receiving general anesthesia. The participants are children aged
      1-15 years old, planned to undergo head and neck, thoracic (except heart), urological,
      orthopedic or plastic surgery. Approximately 80 participants will be enrolled in this study.
      These participants are divided into two groups by age (1-6 and 7-15 years old).
      Pharmacokinetic (what the body does to the drug,) blood samples will be collected from at
      least 3 participants between the ages of 1 and 6 years and at least 3 participants between
      the ages of 7 and 15 years from 15 minutes after the start of infusion to the end of infusion
      of the study drug . The study consists of 4 phases: screening phase, treatment phase,
      recovery phase and follow-up phase. Screening for eligible participants will be performed
      within 14 days before administration of the study drug. The safety and tolerability of study
      drug will be evaluated by physical examinations, electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory
      tests, vital signs, and adverse events (AEs) according to the Time and Events Schedule.
      Participants safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>After intubation, continuous intravenous infusion of remifentanil (0.25 µg/kg/min) is started, while anesthesia is maintained with inhaled or intravenous anesthetics. In cases where sedation by general anesthetics and analgesia by lidocaine does not seem to provide a sufficient means of analgesia at the time of intubation, remifentanil may be used, beginning before intubation. The rate of infusion may be adjusted while monitoring the subject's general condition in 25% to 100% increments or in 25% to 50% decrements every 2 to 5 minutes, but should not exceed 1.3 µg/kg/min.</description>
