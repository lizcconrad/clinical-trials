  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to validate functions for estimating energy expenditure in
      free-living conditions. This method was based on accelerometry data acquired from a
      smartphone worn in a trouser pocket. The developed functions have been compared to the
      estimations provided by two research devices named Armband and Actiheart.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing interest in evaluating physical activity and energy expenditure (EE) to
      provide feedback to the user. The use of mass-market sensors such as accelerometers offers a
      promising solution for the general public due to the growing smartphone market over the last
      decade.

      Thus, the proposed EE estimation function has been created using accelerometry data collected
      from 10 volunteers equipped with a smartphone and two research sensors (Armband and
      Actiheart) used to estimate EE during several controlled activities. The research sensors'
      data serves as reference during the creation and evaluation of the proposed function.

      It has been evaluated with data of 6 other volunteers in free-living conditions in the
      previous eMouve project.

      eMouve2 consists in acquiring more data from 24 new volunteers in order to validate the
      function in free-living conditions.

      This EE estimation function using the smartphone technology is dedicated to light- and
      moderate-intensity activities, and we believe it can be a new way to help people controlling
      their daily physical activity level.
