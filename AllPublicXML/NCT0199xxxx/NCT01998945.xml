      We will compare two programs that are designed to help older adults who have had fall
      injuries manage anxiety and improve their level of functioning. We expect that both programs
      will provide some benefit, but that one will promote better management.

    <textblock>
      Fall accidents can be frightening experiences that cause life-changing injuries. Each year,
      millions of older Americans who fall may develop disabling anxiety and related distress,
      functional limitations, and poor health.

      Our previous study adapted a well-researched anxiety treatment, Exposure-based Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy (ET), for older adults diagnosed with full posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD), subsyndromal PTSD, or fear of falling after fall injury. The approach was
      well-accepted by subjects and they reported both reductions in anxiety and having more fully
      returned to normal living immediately after the treatment and then three months later.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to compare ET to another active treatment, Relaxation
      Training (RT). Both study treatments will consist of eight home-based sessions. ET consists
      of education about anxiety, relaxation training, managing distressing thoughts, healthy
      routine, and confronting avoided memories and situations. RT consists of techniques to ease
      bodily tension.

      Twenty-four subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups. The study
      will compare how subjects in each group improve on outcomes such as diagnosis, anxiety
      severity, and quality of life over the course of treatment, and at three- and six-month
      follow-up.

      The findings will provide the basis for larger future studies.
