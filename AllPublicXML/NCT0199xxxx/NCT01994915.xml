  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a chronic condition involving an impairment in
      functionality and in the execution of activities of daily life. The hypothesis of this study
      is that an occupational therapy intervention added to a physiotherapy program and a medical
      treatment increase the functionality and the quality of life of patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The evolution of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can be aggravated in some periods by
      an increase of the symptoms (above all, the cough, the dyspnea and the quantity of sputum
      purulence). This is known as exacerbation, and it is the most frequent reason for hospital
      stay, urgences services and death in this condition. A physiotherapy program and an
      occupational therapy intervention are carrying out in patients attending to the Hospital
      because of an exacerbation.. Participants will be assessed at baseline and again at the end
      of the study.

    <description>Change from baseline to postintervention on functionality. This is assessed using two measures: the Functional Independence Measure and the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. A follow-up is going to be performed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the occupational therapy intervention.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline to postintervention in quality of life. It is assessed using two questionnaires, the EuroQoL-5D questionnaire and the Health Questionnaire St. George. A follow-up is going to be performed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety and depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline to postintervention on anxiety and depression measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Patients are going to complete this questionnaire composed of statements relevant to either generalised anxiety or depression. A follow-up is going to be performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the intervention.</description>

    <description>The accelerometer Armband is going to be used for activity monitoring. It measures the intensity of the activity during 12 hours. A follow-up at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months is going to be performed after treatment.</description>
