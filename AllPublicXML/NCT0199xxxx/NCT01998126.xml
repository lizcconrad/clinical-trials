      The goals of the overall study are to evaluate a recommended phase 2 dose and the short and
      long term toxicities of the combinations. This is a modified phase I trial of immune
      checkpoint inhibitors in combination with mutation - specific targeted therapy (crizotinib or
      erlotinib) at conventional doses stratified for presence of ALK (Anaplastic lymphoma kinase)
      or EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mutation.

      The goals of the overall study are to evaluate a recommended phase 2 dose and the short and
      long term toxicities of the combinations.

    <description>The immune-related response criteria (irRC) incorporate several elements reflecting the complex tumor dynamics of ipilimumab/nivolumab treatment. Under these criteria, a measure of tumor volume is used that incorporates the contribution of new measurable lesions. Each net percentage change in tumor burden per assessment using irRC accounts for the size and growth kinetics of both old and new lesions as they appear. New lesions alone do not qualify as immune-related progressive disease.</description>

In this study, immune-related response criteria (irRC) will be used to assess subject response to study treatment per investigator assessment. The secondary endpoint irPFS will be determined based on investigator assessment. In order to adequately address this secondary objective, investigators will follow the clinical practice guidelines to obtain additional tumor assessments beyond mWHO PD and follow the instructions in this section for the determination of immune-related response.</description>

             metastases are not allowed.

          -  Serious/active infection or infection requiring parenteral antibiotics.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females.
