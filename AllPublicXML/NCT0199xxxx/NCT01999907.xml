  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Viral infections are the main cause of asthma attacks in preschoolers, an age group with the
      highest rate of emergency visits due to asthma. While high doses of inhaled or oral
      corticosteroids provide benefits, these have been associated with adverse outcomes. Most
      asthmatic children have lower blood levels of vitamin D compared to non-asthmatic children.
      Low vitamin D level has been linked to more frequent and more severe asthma attacks as well
      as with higher dose requirement of inhaled corticosteroid. Recent studies show that vitamin D
      supplements can reduce the number of asthma attacks triggered by viral infections in
      children. Unfortunately, most people forget to take vitamin D every day during the fall and
      winter season as recommended in Canada. A solution is to give a vitamin D bolus by mouth.
      This has been shown to safely and effectively increase vitamin D levels in children. The
      investigators hypothesise that a vitamin D bolus given in clinic will sufficiently increase
      the blood level of vitamin D to prevent the expected winter decline in vitamin D, compared
      with placebo in preschool-aged children with asthma. This six-month pilot randomized
      controlled trial aims to: (1) show that a vitamin D bolus is superior to placebo in raising
      vitamin D levels; (2) record the number of asthma attacks and viral infections in enrolled
      participants; and (3) identify problems that may call for protocol changes.
