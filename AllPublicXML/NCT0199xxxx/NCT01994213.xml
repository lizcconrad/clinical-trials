  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Famitinib is a tyrosin-inhibitor agent targeting at c-Kit, VEGFR2, PDGFR, VEGFR3, Flt1 and
      Flt3. Phase I study has shown that the toxicity is manageable.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of Famitinib in
      patients with advanced or metastatic Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor.
