    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to evaluate the quality of life and functional disability
      in the long term (2 years after craniectomy) in subject's victims of malignant Sylvien stroke
      who received a decompressive craniotomy in the acute phase. Patients who have given their
      consent to be evaluated at least two years after their stroke and their operation in a single
      visit by clinical examination and procurement of standardized scales. Will be measured the
      quality of life through scale SIS3.0, residual disability by the Rankin scale. The quality of
      life of the carer will be assessed through scales and Zarit carer version of SIS3.0. The
      existence of predictive parameters of long-term evolution will be searched in determining the
      existence of a correlation between demographic data and baseline characteristics of the
      stroke on and the evolution of the quality of life.
