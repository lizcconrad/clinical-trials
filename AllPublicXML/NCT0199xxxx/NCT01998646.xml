  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      single ascending oral doses of ASP4058 in non-elderly, healthy male and female subjects. This
      study will also explore the effect of food on the PK of ASP4058.The food-effect crossover
      group was open-label treatment with no placebo control.

      Subjects will remain in the clinic for 9 days. Subjects will return to the clinic for
      follow-up on days 12 and 30 to collect additional safety information.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The female subject must be at least two years postmenopausal (defined as at least 2
             years at Screening without menses and a confirmatory follicle stimulating hormone
             (FSH) level of ≥ 40 U/L at Screening) or surgically sterile (with documentation
             provided by a healthcare professional) and not pregnant or lactating.

          -  The male subject agrees to sexual abstinence, is surgically sterile (with
             documentation provided by a healthcare professional), or is using a medically
             acceptable method (e.g., spermicide and diaphragm, or spermicide and condom) to
             prevent pregnancy and agrees to continue using this method until end of study or 29
             days post-dose, whichever is longer.

          -  The subject must have normal (≥ 80% of normal range) respiratory function as defined
             by spirometry, measuring forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and forced vital capacity
             (FVC) relative to established normal ranges adjusted for age and sex.

          -  The subject at Screening and Day -2, must have color vision testing, acuity testing
             (corrected), and a fundoscopic exam that are within normal limits in the opinion of
             the examining/reviewing ophthalmologist.

          -  The subject's total lymphocyte count at Screening must be &gt;1.0 x 103/uL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is a current smoker or has a history of routinely smoking (&gt;10
             cigarettes/day) within the last seven years..

          -  The subject has a history of clinically significant bradyarrhythmia or sinus
             bradycardia.

          -  The subject has any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g., gastrectomy).

          -  The subject has history of consuming more than 14 units of alcoholic beverages per

             administration.

          -  The subject has been vaccinated within the last 60 days.

          -  The subject has had any significant blood loss, donated one unit (450 mL) of blood or
             more, or received a transfusion of any blood or blood products within 60 days or has
             donated plasma within 7 days prior to clinic admission on Day -2.
