      The specific objective of this study is:

        -  Evaluate and quantify colorimetric changes in young permanent anterior teeth;

        -  Compare the efficiency and efficacy of three gels used for self-administered home
           whitening and an over the counter whitening strip;

        -  Analyze the increase in dental sensitivity in adolescent patients submitted to home
           whitening with 6% and 7.5% hydrogen peroxide with and without the addition of calcium
           (whitening strips);

        -  Assess sensitivity, comfort and acceptance of whitening strips by patients;

        -  Assess patient satisfaction with the method and material used for home whitening.

      The aim of the proposed controlled clinical trial will be to assess colorimetric changes and
      increased dental sensitivity in adolescent patients submitted to tooth whitening with 6% and
      7.5% hydrogen peroxide using home kits with whitening strips. Adolescents aged 12 to 20 years
      will be allocated to different groups based on treatment (n = 16 per group): 1) placebo; 2)
      6.0% hydrogen peroxide (White Class with calcium - FGM); 3) 7.5% hydrogen peroxide (White
      Class with calcium - FGM); and 4) 7.5% hydrogen peroxide (Oral B 3D White - Oral-B). After
      the whitening procedures, the participants will be evaluated using a visual analogue scale
      for tooth sensitivity and digital spectrophotometry for the measurement of changes in color.

    <description>Color readings of the vestibular region of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth will be performed by a previously trained examiner blinded to the allocation of the volunteers to the different groups. A digital spectrophotometer will be used for the colorimetric evaluation.
It will be carried out in all groups at the following times: pre-treatment period, immediately following the first treatment period, after seven days, after 30 days, after six months, after 12 months, after 24 months, and after 48 months.</description>

    <description>The volunteers will inform the degree of sensitivity at all evaluation times using a visual analog scale ranging from 0 (absence of sensitivity) to 10 (maximum sensitivity).
Evaluations of dental sensitivity will be carried out in all groups at the following times: pre-treatment period, immediately following the first treatment period, after seven days, after 30 days, after six months, after 12 months, after 24 months and after 48 months.</description>

Individual plastic molds (vacuum form, flexible acetate 1 mm in thickness) will be made for each arch using the plaster models. After fitting the molds in the oral cavity, the volunteers will receive oral and written instructions on how to use the whitening gel and will be instructed to perform proper oral hygiene with dental floss and a tooth brush prior to the application of the whitening agent. The volunteers will be instructed to use the molds with the gel one hour a day for seven days. Thirty days after the beginning of treatment, the volunteers in this group will receive the whitening treatment with 6.0% hydrogen peroxide - White Class with calcium.</description>
