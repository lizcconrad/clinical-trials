  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure leads to heart attacks and strokes which can be prevented by blood
      pressure-lowering medication. However, the current office-based prescription of one pill and
      one dose at a time is ineffective. the investigators want to pilot-test a more effective
      patient-centered treatment approach, where patients will receive a prescription with gradual
      but automatic weekly increases of dose and number of pills. Patients will measure their blood
      pressure with an iPhone compatible cuff, which transmits readings to the doctor or
      pharmacist, who will stop escalation when the desired blood pressure level is reached. The
      investigators hypothesize that the intervention will decrease the time to control blood
      pressure and increase the overall rate of blood pressure control. Therefore, this new
      treatment model could prevent heart attacks and strokes, and reduce healthcare costs.

      This is a pilot 2A trial of an innovative behavioral economics theory-based antidote for
      physician inertia in the medical treatment of hypertension (HTN). In the current reactive
      physician-centered model, blood pressure (BP) is measured and medical decisions are made in
      the physician office; when deciding whether or not to prescribe new medication for a high
      office BP reading, the physician's default behavior is inaction. The investigators propose
      default medication intensification as a new patient-centered/pharmacist-assisted proactive
      treatment model to eliminate physician inertia. For enrolled patients with office BP&gt;155/95,
      the physician will prescribe a one-month protocol that automatically escalates drug dose and
      drug number each week. The pharmacist will fill the prescription in a blister pack to
      simplify adherence. The patient will measure daily home BP with an iPhone cuff that transmits
      the data electronically to the pharmacist, who will halt the protocol if goal home BP&lt;135/85
      is achieved ahead of schedule. the investigators will pilot test the feasibility and safety
      of self-monitoring plus the new automatic intensification protocol packaged in blisters.
      Default medication intensification could revolutionize HTN treatment and reduce healthcare
      costs.

    <description>The investigators will determine which blood pressure medications to use. No specific drug will be tested but rather the automatic intensification of medications is the intervention. Examples of drugs used in this study are calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine 2.5 mg to 10 mg) or ACE-inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril 5 mg to 40 mg) or diuretics (HCTZ 25 mg).</description>
