      The study is to evaluate the feasibility of the NLA tool, a combined assessment of
      nutritional and physical functional status, to provide personalized advice for the
      independence and mobility of elderly.

      -  Determining the proportion of elderly subjects who, according to the NLA result, would
           qualify for a personalized program to improve their nutritional and physical status;

        -  Determining the segmentation (defined by cut-off criteria) of these elderly subjects
           stratified into 3 NLA subgroups according to strength and endurance performance (33% +/-
           10% of target group)
