      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of decline in quantitative viral load
      measured in hospitalized patients with Influenza A infection

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase IIa proof-of-concept study,
      designed to evaluate the effect of CR8020, CR6261, or placebo in hospitalized patients with
      influenza A infection that are receiving standard of care. Up to 262 participants will be
      randomized to receive 30 mg/kg of CR8020, 30 mg/kg of CR6261, or placebo. The study duration
      will be approximately 117 days for each participant. Prior to enrollment, participants will
      be screened to assess their eligibility. Eligible participants will be randomized to CR8020,
      CR6261, or placebo and study drug will be administered on Day 1. Participants will be
      followed up for 115 days in 9 visits on Days 2 to 8, Day 29, and Day 116 (end of study).
      After hospital discharge, the remaining follow-up visits will be performed as outpatient
      visits.
