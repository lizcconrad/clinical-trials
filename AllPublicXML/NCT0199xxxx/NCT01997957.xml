    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most commonly malignant tumors around the world
      and causes death of about 600000~1000000 people each year. Since 1990s, hepatic carcinoma has
      become the second carcinoma killer in China. Surgical resection or liver transplantation is
      the only method possibly able to cure hepatic carcinoma. However, due to multiple tumors or
      poor hepatic function reserve in cirrhosis, surgical treatment is suitable for only a small
      portion of patients (11.9%-30.1%). Therefore, in clinical practice, transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) or transarterial embolization (TAE) is a preferential and standard
      treatment of unresectable advanced hepatic carcinoma and has notable advantages in
      controlling local tumors of the liver. Hepatic arterial infusion of oxaliplatin after TACE
      can significantly increase the local doses of chemotherapeutic agents in the liver, kill
      micrometastases and residual foci after embolization and demonstrate outstanding efficacy for
      treating concomitant portal and hepatic vein tumor thrombi. S-1 is a chemotherapeutic agent
      with convenient use and definite efficacy and, when used concomitantly with TACE,
      theoretically can not only effectively control intrahepatic foci but also prevent and control
      extrahepatic metastatic foci. However, this hasn't been verified in clinical application.
      This study is intended to investigate efficacy and safety of the combination treatment so as
      to provide a more effective and safety way for treating patients with advanced hepatic
      carcinoma (Barcelona stage-C patients with concomitant portal vein tumor thrombi or
      extrahepatic metastasis).
