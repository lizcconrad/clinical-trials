  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a diet that is low in glycemic load
      and abundant in fiber, fruits, vegetables, legumes and omega-3 fatty acids
      (&quot;anti-inflammatory diet&quot;) on pulmonary function in pediatric patients with asthma. The
      primary endpoint will be change in forced expiratory volume in one second in response to the
      diet intervention. Secondary outcomes will include additional spirometry measures, fraction
      of exhaled nitric oxide, and assessment of symptomatic asthma control. In addition, we will
      identify potential physiological mechanisms relating diet with lung function, including
      changes in systemic inflammation, insulin sensitivity, and intestinal microbiome composition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma, an inflammatory disease of the airway mucosa, is highly correlated with obesity and
      nutritional intake in multiple cross-sectional studies. Limited interventional data in adults
      with asthma, relying on behavioral modification, have reported that asthma control
      significantly improves with caloric restriction and diets enriched with antioxidants, and may
      improve with increasing omega-3 fatty acid content. A comprehensive diet harnessing
      anti-inflammatory properties of multiple foods may have synergistic effects on bronchial
      inflammation and pulmonary function, yet this possibility remains largely untested,
      especially in children.

      We propose a randomized, controlled cross-over trial, with 6-week treatment arms, in
      pediatric patients with moderate to severe asthma. The experimental diet will focus on
      reducing glycemic load, and increasing fiber, fruits, vegetables, legumes and food-based
      omega-3 fatty acid content. The comparison diet will be each participant's habitual diet.
      Both diets will be isocaloric and weight maintaining, to isolate the effects of the dietary
      composition from the known beneficial effects of weight loss. In addition, the home delivery
      of prepared meals will alleviate the variable and incomplete adherence commonly observed in
      behavioral studies.
