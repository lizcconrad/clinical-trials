    <textblock>
      Regorafenib is a valuable treatment option for metastatic colorectal cancer patients who have
      progressed after prior standard treatments. Prior progression-free survival data suggest that
      there could be a distinct subgroup of patients that may benefit from regorafenib. The aim of
      this study is to identify predictive biomarker of regorafenib in terms of its efficacy.

    <textblock>
      Regorafenib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor which has been shown to increase survival in
      metastatic colorectal cancer patients who have progressed after prior standard treatments.
      Progression-free survival data suggest that there could be a distinct subgroup of patients
      that may benefit from regorafenib. Therefore, it would be important to identify predictive
      biomarker of efficacy of regorafenib. Considering that regorafenib is a multi-tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor, comprehensive approach is required to discover predictive biomarker.

      NGS-based sequencing allows generating large amount of data regarding multiple genes and
      multiple genetic alterations within a single experiment. Also, it requires less amount of DNA
      or tissue and cost compared to currently used individual gene testing techniques such as
      direct sequencing or FISH. Moreover, superior sensitivity over Sanger sequencing can be
      obtained by increasing coverage depth, especially in cases with low tumor purity. Wide range
      of genes targeted by regorafenib and genes in the major oncogenic pathway of colorectal
      cancer influenced by regorafenib can be efficiently assessed using NGS-based sequencing.

      The aim of this study is to identify predictive biomarker of efficacy of regorafeinib in
      metastatic, refractory colorectal cancer patients using NGS technology.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent obtained before any study-specific procedures.

          2. Age ≥ 20

          3. Pathologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of colon or rectum

          4. Failure of standard therapies, which must include fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and
             irinotecan. Failure is defined as progression during or within 3 months following the
             last administration of therapy. Patients who have withdrawn from standard treatment
             due to unacceptable toxicity warranting discontinuation of treatment and precluding
             retreatment with the same agent before progression of disease will also be allowed
             into the study. Patients treated with oxaliplatin in an adjuvant setting who have
             progressed during or within 6 months of completion of adjuvant therapy are regarded as
             failure of oxaliplatin. Patients may or may not have received bevacizumab or
             cetuximab.
