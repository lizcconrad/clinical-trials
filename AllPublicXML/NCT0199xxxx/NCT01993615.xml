  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes for patients that receive two different
      treatments used for FAI (Femoroacetabular Impingement). The programs are 1) a 6-week
      supervised physical therapy program and 2) arthroscopic surgery. Enrollment is limited to
      patients that have already been determined surgical candidates. The study is following
      patients for a 2-year period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to enroll a total of 60 Tricare beneficiaries primarily from the Madigan
      Healthcare System with a diagnosis of FAI that are surgical candidates and have already
      failed at least six weeks of conservative treatment.

      This is a randomized controlled study comparing outcomes for the standard treatment for FAI
      and/or acetabular labral pathology (arthroscopy with or without labral repair) versus
      physical therapy. For subjects in the arthroscopy group, the surgery will be performed by the
      Orthopedic Surgical Service at Madigan Army Medical Center.

      Subjects randomized to the physical therapy group will follow a treatment plan implemented by
      a physical therapist within the Madigan Army Healthcare System.

      After consent, subjects will be randomized into one of two arms (Group I = hip arthroscopy,
      Group II = physical therapy). Group I will undergo hip arthroscopy with or without labral
      repair. Group II will follow a FAI-based physical therapy program x 12 sessions (6 weeks).

      The arthroscopy group will complete outcome measures at time of consent and following surgery
      at 6 months, 1 year and 2 year time periods. Subjects in this group will follow a
      standardized post-operative rehabilitation protocol.

      The physical therapy group will complete outcomes measures at time of consent and at 6 month,
      1 year and 2 year time periods following the initial physical therapy evaluation. Subjects in
      this group will complete 6 weeks of an impairment-based physical therapy program.

      In addition to the outcome measures taken, healthcare utilization and associated costs for
      hip-related care during this 2-year period will also calculated for comparison between the 2
      groups.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Hip Outcome Score at 24 months</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Hip Outcome Score is designed to assess higher level activities (i.e. those required in athletics) and has demonstrated validity in a study of patients at a mean of three years following hip arthroscopy. Additionally, a 2011 study states that the HOS has the greatest amount of clinimetric evidence (rigor of rating scales and indexes for the description of clinical phenomena). Only three published patient-reported outcome instruments utilized to assess FAI and labral pathology use clinimetric evidence and the HOS was identified as the most proven instrument.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in International Hip Outcome Score (IHOT33) to 24 months</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The iHOT33 is a quality-of-life patient-reported outcome measure that uses a visual analog scale response format for young, active patients with hip pathology. This 33-item questionnaire includes four sections: symptoms and functional limitations, sports and recreational activities, job related concerns and social, emotional and lifestyle concerns. This outcome measure has shown to be reliable; shows face, content and contrast validity and is highly responsive to clinical change.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Rating of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The GROC will be administered to patients at the 6 months, one year and two year time points. The GROC questionnaire is a common, feasible, and useful method for assessing short term outcomes and overall changes in quality of life and is a valid measurement of change in patient status in a variety of pain populations. The GROC has a 15-point scale with a change of positive three points or higher demonstrating clinically significant improvement in a patient's perception of quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Self-Motivation Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Motivation Inventory is an outcome measure that was developed to determine level of motivation. The Self-Motivation Inventory is a 40-item tool that has been found to measure an individual's tendency to persevere independent of situational reinforcement. It has also been used to predict successful weight loss and may correlate with number of sessions attended in weight loss program [29]. This tool underwent refinement in 1980 with the original 60-item tool being tested in undergraduate male and females. Items correlating less than 0.30 were deleted. The final 40-item scale yielded an exceptionally high internal reliability (Î± = 0.91) suggesting that a unitary common concept is evident for the obtained factor structure. The tool is widely used and has been tested in weight loss and therapeutic exercise studies</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from Baseline Pain Catastrophizing Scale at 24 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PCS is a 13-item patient-report scale developed to measure the extent to which people catastrophize in response to pain. Each item is scored from 0 ('not at all') to 4 ('all the time'). The PCS is reported as a total score, with higher scores indicating greater catastrophizing, and is composed of three sub-scales: Rumination (four items; e.g. 'When I am in pain, I keep thinking about how badly I want the pain to stop'), Magnification (three items; e.g. 'When I am in pain, I become afraid that the pain will get worse'), and Helplessness (six items; e.g. 'When I am in pain, I feel I can't go on'). The PCS has been shown to have high levels of internal consistency and construct validity.</description>
