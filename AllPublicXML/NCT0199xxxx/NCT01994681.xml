  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) in human breath are captured and analyzed by the
      Spectrosense EVA system, which is combination of a gas chromatography (GC) and software
      algorithm. The objective is to obtain a set or sets of VOC bio-markers that will provide the
      best discrimination between Pancreatic Cancer sick population and healthy population. The
      gold standard for identifying sick/healthy population is biopsy proven Pancreatic cancer.
