    <textblock>
      This is a phase 4 study being conducted at the Ohio State University Department of Neurology
      Multiple Sclerosis Research Program. The purposes of the study is to administer a single shot
      of intrathecal (injection into the space surrounding the spinal cord via a lumbar puncture or
      spinal tap) ziconotide as a test dose to patients who have chronic painful myelopathy (pain
      from spinal cord damage) or painful peripheral neuropathy (pain from nerve damage) that has
      not responded to other pain medicines. Study Hypothesis: We intend to determine if a single
      shot trial (SST) of intrathecal (IT) ziconotide will temporarily reduce pain in these
      patients. In the proposed study, patients will receive two injections, one of which is the
      ziconotide and one which is a placebo. They will be blinded and not know which order they
      receive the treatment versus placebo. The results of this clinical trial will provide a
      focused examination of ziconotide efficacy and safety in patients with painful neuropathies
      or myelopathies that have not been effectively treated with other pain medications. Moreover,
      the use of a single shot trial (SST) IT injection in the outpatient setting will provide
      evidence for application of this technique in outpatient neurological clinical practice,
      thereby improving access to this specific patient population. Ziconotide is currently FDA
      approved for this indication and route of administration. Therefore, a study design that
      improves the feasibility of ziconotide trialing specifically in the neurology clinic (that
      is, single shot administration) is being used in order to ensure its broader use by
      neurologists who routinely care for neuropathy and myelopathy patients. Information from this
      study will also inform future studies of predictors for long term efficacy after pump
      placement.

    <description>The primary outcome measure of this study is to determine the efficacy of single shot IT ziconotide in treatment of refractory neuropathic pain as a result of painful peripheral neuropathy or myelopathy and to determine the maximal decrease from baseline in VASPI (Visual analog Scale of Pain Intensity). A responder analysis will also be performed for the VASPI</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men or women 18 years or older.

             care for treatment of neuropathic pain; treatment failure can be either due to lack of
             efficacy or to intolerable side effects.
