  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of paediatric obesity has increased over the last two decades and with it, an
      increased diagnosis of lifestyle-related diseases in children and adolescents. High intensity
      interval training has recently been explored as an alternate to traditional aerobic exercise
      in adults with chronic disease and has potential to induce rapid reversal of subclinical
      disease markers in obese children and adolescents.

      High intensity interval training has recently been explored as an alternate to traditional
      aerobic exercise in adults with chronic disease and has potential to induce rapid reversal of
      subclinical disease markers in obese children and adolescents.

      Goal: The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of
      a high intensity interval training intervention on myocardial function, vascular function and
      visceral adipose tissue in obese children and adolescents at baseline, three and twelve
      months.

      Method: Multi-centre randomised controlled trial of 100 obese children and adolescents in the
      cities of Trondheim (Norway) and Brisbane (Australia). Participants will be randomised to (1)
      high intensity interval training, (2) moderate intensity continuous training or (3) nutrition
      advise. Participants will partake in supervised exercise training and/or nutrition
      consultations for 3 months. Measurements for all study endpoints will occur at baseline, 3
      months (post intervention) and 12 months (follow up).

      Scientific Significance : This randomised controlled trial will general substantial
      information regarding the effects of exercise intensity on paediatric obesity, specifically
      the cardio-metabolic health of this at-risk population. It is expected that communication of
      results will allow for more robust and realistic guidelines regarding exercise prescription
      in this population to be formed while outlining the benefits of high intensity interval
      training on subclinical markers of disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, childhood overweight and obesity rates are approximately 10%, this high incidence
      attributed to a physically inactive lifestyle and inappropriate nutrition. Early cohort
      studies illustrated that fifty per cent of obese children became obese adults and
      consequently had an higher risk for metabolic syndrome than obese adults who were not obese
      as children. Both female and male overweight children and adolescents had a 30% increase in
      all cause mortality. The increases in risk of death were independent of adult body mass
      index.

      Systematic reviews suggest that lifestyle and exercise interventions in obese children and
      adolescents can lead to improvements in anthropometric and cardio-metabolic outcomes, but
      these are not inclusive of several important outcomes such as myocardial and vascular
      function or visceral adipose tissue.
