  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the current proposal is to evaluate the importance of blood vessel
      dysfunction and heart dysfunction to overall exercise impairments in type 2 diabetes and
      their contribution to the gender differences observed in exercise capacity. Importantly,
      treatments that improve blood vessel function in persons with type 2 diabetes can be used to
      directly assess whether impairment in blood vessel function and ultimately exercise
      performance, can be improved and whether the degree of improvement differs between the sexes.

      Hypothesis 1. Uncomplicated type 2 diabetes more adversely affects exercise capacity in women
      than men.

      Hypothesis 2. Blood vessel function and cardiac function are more significantly impaired in
      women with type 2 diabetes than men and contribute to the gender differences in exercise
      capacity.

      Hypothesis 3. Restoration of blood vessel function will improve exercise capacity more in
      women than men with type 2 diabetes.

      Subjects will come in for a total of seven research visits. Four initial study visits before
      exercise training for three months and then subjects will repeat the testing.

        1. Initial exam. A history and physical exam will be performed. Blood will be drawn for
           measurements of overall health. Resting electrocardiogram will be obtained. The Low
           Level Physical Activity Recall (LOPAR) questionnaire will be administered.

        2. Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) will be carried out during visit two. A
           familiarization bicycle ergometer test will also be performed on this day.

        3. During visit three, a euglycemic clamp will be performed.

        4. During visit four, echocardiographic measurements will be made and a diet interview will
           be performed.

        5. On visit five, measures of blood vessel-dependent vasodilation will be performed.
           Repeated brachial artery diameter and forearm blood flow responses to cuff occlusion
           will be measured separately on this occasion.

        6. On visit six, arterial stiffness will be measured. Subjects will also perform a graded
           bicycle exercise test.

        7. On visit seven, subjects will perform constant level bicycle tests.
