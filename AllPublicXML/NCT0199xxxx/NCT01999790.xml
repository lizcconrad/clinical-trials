  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Grave's ophthalmopathy is the most common cause of orbital disease in adults. The clinical
      presentation may vary between sub clinic symptoms to severe ones. The eyelid retraction is
      one of the most important signs of Grave's ophthalmopathy and can lead to cosmetic and
      functional problems.

      The eyelid retraction can be found in the inflammatory stage and in the chronic disease, when
      it is stable. It can be described when the upper lid is contouring the superior limbus or
      positioned above that. This condition can lead to dry eye symptoms, exposure keratitis and
      cosmetic issues. The treatment can may be surgical or medical.

      The medical treatment are usually based on controlling thyroid function and in the use of
      steroids, both are not specific for the lid retraction, but for the inflammation that is
      common in the disease.

      In the longstanding disease, surgery is the most efficient treatment. There are several
      described techniques, they are based on the concept of weakening the muscles that act on lid
      elevation (levator and Muller Muscle).

      Basically the techniques can be divided in two groups: the first with an anterior approach
      (with skin scar in the lid sulcus) and the second using a posterior approach (through the
      conjunctiva).

      In the literature there is no consensus in deciding the best technique, regarding cosmetic
      results, incidence of complications, hypo or hypercorrection.

      In this trial we propose to compare two distinct techniques that are already in clinical use.
      The blepharotomy uses a cutaneous approach and the other a conjunctival approach.

      The patients will be divided in two randomized groups and surgical expected outcomes,
      cosmetics outcomes and complications occurrence will be compared.

      After a complete ophthalmic evaluation the recruited patients with inactive graves
      orbitopathy and upper eyelid retraction eligible for the study will be randomly separated in
      two groups.

      The evaluation also includes a face photography in primary position of gaze, a OSDI
      questionnaire, a quality of life questionnaire, schirmmer test, lissamine green evaluation
      and eyelid position measurements.

      In the first group the patients will be submitted to blepharotomy for surgical correction of
      their upper eyelid retraction.

      In the second group the patients will be submitted to a posterior mullerectomy and gradual
      recession of the elevator muscle aponeurosis for surgical correction of their upper eyelid
      retraction.

      The outcomes will be compared between the two groups after a 6 month followup.
