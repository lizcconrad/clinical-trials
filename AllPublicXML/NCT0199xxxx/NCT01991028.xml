  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OligoG is a new potential treatment which is being developed by AlgiPharma AS (a
      Norwegian-based company) with an aim to help people with cystic fibrosis in the future.

      OligoG, derived from marine algae, is expected to act locally in the lungs once inhaled to
      reduce mucus thickness and improve mucus clearance. It could also have the benefit of
      reducing the incidence of infections.

      Nebulised doses of up to 540 mg/day have been administered to healthy volunteers for three
      consecutive days and to cystic fibrosis patients for 28 consecutive days. Both groups
      tolerated the medication well, with no treatment related issues reported. The dose
      administered in this study is lower; patients who complete the study will receive, in total,
      186 mg of OligoG in two divided doses.

      A new dry powder formulation of OligoG has been developed so that patients can use an
      inhaler, rather than a nebuliser. Administration from an inhaler compared to a nebuliser is
      much quicker and more practical for the patient.

      In this study, we will use gamma scintigraphy to see where in the lungs the dry powder and
      nebulised solution go after being inhaled by cystic fibrosis patients. Gamma scintigraphy is
      a well-established medical imaging technique. A small amount of radioactive material will be
      added to both the dry powder and nebulised solution. The radiation emitted will then be
      detected by taking images using a device known as a gamma camera. The procedure is relatively
      easy and non-invasive.

      The purpose of this study is to help answer the following research questions:

        -  How do the OligoG dry powder and nebulised solution distribute in the lungs of patients
           with cystic fibrosis?

        -  How much of the formulation gets to the deep lung?

        -  How much of the formulation remains in the devices used for administration?

      The primary efficacy (deposition) variable will be the % dose deposited in the lungs.

      The following secondary efficacy (deposition) variables will be determined (where
      appropriate): Percentage dose deposited in the oropharyngeal, oesophageal and gastric regions
      Percentage dose remaining in the Miat Monodose inhaler Percentage dose remaining in the
      nebuliser mouthpiece Percentage dose remaining in the nebuliser reservoir Percentage dose
      deposited on the exhalation filter (if appropriate) Percentage dose contained in mouth
      washing(s) Penetration index based on the ratio of counts in the central:peripheral lung
      regions (C/P index)
