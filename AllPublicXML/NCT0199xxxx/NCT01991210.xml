  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      DNIB0600A (RO5541081) in comparison with PLD in participants with PROC, primary peritoneal
      cancer or fallopian tube cancer. Participants will be randomized to receive either DNIB0600A
      2.4 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks or PLD 40 milligrams per
      meter-squared (mg/m^2) IV every 4 weeks.
