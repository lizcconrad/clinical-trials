      Abstract

      Background:

      It is documented that some patient education interventions, preferably with a behavioral
      component included, may improve pain, disability and moods Purpose of the study: the purpose
      of this study was to improve the quality of life and reduce pain in rheumatoid arthritis
      patients.

      Methods:

      Patients were allocated to a patient training intervention group and patient without training
      intervention group. Both groups received routine treatments while the patient training
      intervention group, in addition to the routine treatments received training booklets and
      participated in the training workshop. All the extracted data from the written questionnaire
      were collected and analyzed using SPSS software.

      Results:

      The improvement in the signs of recovery for physical and mood symptoms in the patient
      training intervention group were seen (p &lt; 0.05). The score of quality of life had
      significantly improved in the two groups (Mean difference was 9.31Â±3.03 and P&lt;0.003). This
      improvement was significantly higher in the patient training intervention group (P=0.008).
      After adjustment for education level, the score of quality of life in patient training
      intervention group had a higher improvement, but the difference between the two groups was
      not significant (P = 0.1).

      Conclusions:

      This study showed the important role of training and the patients' educational level on
      better treatments. The appropriate training in the patient could create a change in the
      treatment process and has a better effect on quality of life.

    <description>The intervention consisted of training leaflet and oral training. All of the patients were new cases and were divided into 2 groups. All patients were treated with routine medication, no addition medication for two groups were done, the case group attended the workshops and were trained In addition to medical therapy, continuing education and training workshop.
