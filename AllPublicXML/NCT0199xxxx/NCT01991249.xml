      Acute leukemias are a heterogeneous group of hematologic malignancies. They result from
      clonal expansion of immature cells whose number is greater than 20% in bone marrow. Childhood
      acute leukemias are the most common pediatric malignancies. In Europe and the United states,
      they represent about 35% of childhood cancers. 80% of them are acute lymphoblastic leukemia
      (ALL) and 15-20% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Current treatments allow a cure in about
      80% of ALL, while this level is only 50% in AML.Acute leukemia diagnosis is based on the
      multidisciplinary exploration of leukemia cells by different techniques:

        -  Cellular: cytology, immunophenotyping and cytochemistry

        -  Cytogenetic: conventional (karyotype) and molecular (FISH) cytogenetic

        -  Molecular: RT-PCR and RQ-PCR

      Cytogenetic studies are performed at time of acute leukemia diagnosis. Indeed, the WHO 2008
      classification of acute leukemia is based largely on the presence of recurrent cytogenetic
      and molecular abnormalities. The most frequent chromosomal aberrations have been associated
      with specific clinical and biological characteristics and are now used as diagnosis and
      prognostic markers. These chromosomal abnormalities affect genes involving in the
      leukemogenesis process. These rearrangements are of several types:

        -  Fusion genes causing :

             -  Repression of transcriptional activity of genes involved in differentiation of
                hematopoietic cells (AML1-ETO, PML-RARA…)

             -  Deregulation of signal transduction pathway (eg BCR-ABL chimeric protein with
                constitutive tyrosine kinase activity)

             -  Changing in the state of chromatin condensation resulting changes of transcription
                (MLL gene rearrangements in 11q23, MOZ en 8p11…)

        -  Deregulation of genes expression: chromosomal rearrangements can sometimes induce
           deregulation of adjacent genes to the breakpoint. For example, inv(3)(q21q26) or
           t(3;3)(q21;q26) induce over expression of transcriptional factor EVI-1.

        -  Loss of function due to deletion of variable size in genomic regions containing genes
           with a role in the differentiation, apoptosis, or cell proliferation (eg IKZF1, PAX5…)

      In addition to the karyotype, which allows to have a global view of the genome; FISH, a
      targeted technique, is used to highlight invisible abnormalities on karyotype (cryptic
      abnormalities) or the time of karyotype failure. However, conventional and molecular
      cytogenetic techniques do not highlight any abnormalities (eg different partners involved in
      the formation of fusion genes in particular for MLL gene rearrangement, mutations) hence our
      interest in next generation sequencing.Indeed, the high throughput targeted sequencing
      messenger RNAs (RNA-seq) has the avantage of allow identification of different types of
      mutations in a single test, with exception of epigenetic mutations. The importance of RNAs
      sequencing rather than DNA genomic is the one hand, a very significant decrease in the volume
      of sequences to analyze because transcribed mRNA genes represent about 5% of the genome size
      and secondly, a better identification of chimeric genes. The RNA-seq has used as a research
      tool in hematologic malignancies. The purpose of this project is to use innovative technology
      to develop a new diagnostic and prognostic new tool in hematological malignancies. 50 acute
      leukemias will be tested and results will be analyzed according to three criteria:

        -  Quantity, quality and relevance of information provided for the diagnosis, monitoring
           and therapeutic management compared to a conventional strategy

        -  Period required to obtain results and methods to decrease the analysis time so that
           results can be integrated into therapeutic decisions.

        -  Economic evaluation, which will calculate the cost of this diagnosis option and assess
           the cost/benefit ratio In future, other innovative approaches will be implemented (study
           of imbalances genomic abnormalities by array-CGH, transcriptome analysis with
           micro-array, and study of methylome) to identify the &quot;molecular signature&quot; of each
           leukemia and set of informative abnormalities for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of
           disease and monitoring of residual disease.
