    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the brain circuits involved with effortful
      control in healthy adult participants. Study participants will be given either
      methylphenidate (also known as 'Ritalin')which is an FDA approved, most widely-used
      medication given to those diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)or a
      placebo, which is a sugar pill. Each participant will also perform some computer tasks that
      have been shown in previous studies to require effortful control while undergoing an fMRI
      (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) which takes a special kind of picture of the brain.
      Our goal is to learn more about the brain mechanisms by which methylphenidate improves
      effortful control.

      This study involves two total visits. All visits are scheduled at the Rachel Upjohn Building
      on East Medical Campus of the University of Michigan. Participation in this study will end
      once the participant has completed both study visits which are a total of 4 hours. The first
      visit will require one to complete various questionnaires regarding behavior and general
      health and takes about 1 hour to complete. The second visit will be scheduled approximately 2
      to 7 days after the first study visit and includes the fMRI scanning session. The second
      visit will last about 3 hours.

    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>We will quantify functional connectivity which is the correlation between the BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent signal, the signal that is measured by fMRI) time series between anatomical regions of interest that have been identified from previous cognitive regulation studies. These include dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula dorsal anterior cingulate regions.</description>
