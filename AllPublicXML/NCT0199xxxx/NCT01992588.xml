  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to compare the pharmacokinetic
      (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) and pharmacodynamic (the effect of the
      investigated drug on the body) properties of FIAsp (faster-acting insulin aspart) and insulin
      aspart (NovoRapid®) given as a bolus on top of a basal continuous subcutaneous insulin
      infusion (CSII).
