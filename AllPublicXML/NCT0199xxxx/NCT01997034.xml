  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Denmark and the western world, there is an increasing prevalence of obesity probably due
      to a combination of inadequate daily physical activity and a high energy intake. One approach
      to achieve weight loss and change life style is to participate in an intensive supervised
      prolonged life style modification course. The immediate effect is often positive, but over
      time the overall effect is limited as the majority will not maintain weight loss and a
      changed life style.

      The purpose of this study is therefore to characterize the physiological factors that
      determine/influence the capacity to maintain weight loss and a healthy lifestyle after a
      prolonged lifestyle intervention.

      The investigators have the following research questions:

        1. Are there physiological traits and characteristics that mediate better adherence to
           lifestyle changes and weight loss?

        2. Does the adaptation in muscle oxidative capacity after lifestyle intervention predict
           success in maintaining weight loss and lifestyle changes?

        3. How does gender and age influence the capacity to maintain the lifestyle induced
           adaptation in muscle and adipose tissue and maintaining weight loss?

      The study design is cross-sectional and will be based on a lifestyle intervention, as it is
      practiced in a real life setting at Ubberup folk high school. The investigators will recruit
      former participants of this lifestyle style intervention. 50 % who maintained a weight loss
      and a healthy life style and 50 % who did not.

        Former participants of Ubberup Folk High School will be included in this study. Ubberup
        Folk High School is a privately hold externate that teaches lifestyle intervention courses
        with focus on weight loss. A stay at Ubberup has a duration of 10-14 weeks and is primarily
        self-financed. The study population will consist of men and women of two different age
        Groups (18-35 and 35-65yr). We will recruit participants who succeeded in maintaining the
        weight loss and participants who regained in weight.
