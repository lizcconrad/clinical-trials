      To study the safety and efficacy of ARTRA (glucosamine chondroitin sulfate) in the treatment
      of non-specific low-back pain of lumbosacral localization in ambulatory care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We enrolled patients between 40 and 65 years of age who had low back pain for at least 12
      weeks with a pain intensity &gt;3 on a 0-10 point visual analogue scale (VAS). Major exclusion
      criteria were presence of fibromyalgia, degenerative spondylolisthesis, and alcohol and/or
      drug abuse. All patients were treated with ARTRA (combination of glucosamine hydrochloride
      500 mg and chondroitin sulfate 500 mg in tab; Unipharm Inc.) at a dose of 1 tab bid for the
      first month and then 1 tab daily for the next two months. The primary endpoint was pain
      intensity (at rest and movement) as measured on a 0-10 point VAS. Secondary endpoints
      included Oswestry Disability Index, patient global assessment of efficacy (0-5 scale) and
      NSAID consumption.
