  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Men with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation are at increased risk for early onset, aggressive prostate
      cancer compared to men in the general population.

      Standard of care screening for men with a BRCA mutation includes PSA testing and digital
      rectal examination (DRE), the same as with men in the general population.

      This study is being done to assess whether there is value in using MRI as a screening tool to
      detect prostate cancer at an earlier stage than may otherwise be detected using standard of
      care screening (PSA, DRE). It is unclear whether MRI has utility as a screening tool in this
      specific population at high risk for aggressive disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the value of using Multispectral 3T MRI (MS3TMRI) for prostate cancer screening
      in men with a high risk of developing early onset aggressive prostate cancer given known
      BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carrier status, with no prior prostate cancer diagnosis, independent
      of baseline PSA levels.

        -  Determine the prevalence of prostate cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers
           independent of baseline PSA levels.

        -  To evaluate the accuracy of tumor targeting based on MRI and ultrasound (US) tumor
           co-localization. To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of an
           automated computer aided diagnosis method (CAD) applied to MS3TMRI in the prediction of
           zonal biopsy results for the presence or absence of a significant cancer.

    <description>Patients would undergo MS3TMRI and then have a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy performed within one month after the MRI. The initial cores would be obtained using TRUS without MRI information (TRUSBx). During the same biopsy session, the MS3TMRI information would be given to the physician performing the biopsy and additional cores specifically targeted to suspicious areas would be performed (MS3TMRI-TRUSBx).</description>

    <description>Multispectral 3T MRI (MS3TMRI) is a device that uses a 3T MRI system without an endorectal receiver coil and with a surface phased array coil. 3T MRI in addition to established computer aided diagnosis (CAD) has been used to perform guided biopsies in an active surveillance population and demonstrated a positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 83% and 81%.
A recently completed a study looking at repeat prostate biopsies in men followed on an active surveillance population at Sunnybrook has shown that the PPV of MS3TMRI guided biopsy to be 85%, while the negative predictive value was 100% (Haider, Vesprini and Milot, unpublished).</description>
