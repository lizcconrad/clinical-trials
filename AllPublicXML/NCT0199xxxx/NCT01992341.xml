  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel when given alone
      and in combination with AMG 386 to determine whether AMG 386 alters the pharmacokinetics of
      paclitaxel

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects enrolled in the study will begin receiving paclitaxel on a three weeks on /
      one week off schedule at study day 1 and weekly AMG 386 beginning at study day 8. The
      pharmacokinetic portion of the study occurs during the first two study cycles with intensive
      PK collections on study weeks 1, 6 and 8. Once the pharmacokinetic assessment period is
      completed, continued combination therapy with AMG 386 and paclitaxel or single-agent AMG 386
      will be administered at the investigator's discretion until progression, unacceptable
      toxicity develops, or study withdrawal.
