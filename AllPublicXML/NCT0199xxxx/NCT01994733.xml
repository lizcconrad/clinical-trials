  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who have elevated serum phosphate (P) levels
      have significantly higher mortality rates compared to those with normal P. In patients
      receiving conventional dialysis regimens, serum P may be lowered through dietary intervention
      and use of P binders, though these have potentially important side effects and may adversely
      impact quality of life. Whether lowering P, and / or targeting specific P levels improve
      survival and clinical outcomes is unknown. Despite this uncertainty, over 90% of patients
      with ESRD receive P lowering therapy and guidelines for the care of patients with ESRD are
      increasingly calling for more aggressive phosphate lowering. This intensive P lowering
      results in extra medications (and their associated side-effects), and higher health care
      costs. We are uncertain whether the intensification of P control results in measurable
      benefits to patients with ESRD. The overall goal of this pilot trial is to evaluate the
      feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial of intensive vs liberalized phosphate
      control among hemodialysis recipients.
