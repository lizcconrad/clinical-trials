             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 26 weeks after the
             last dose of investigational product, in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is
             minimized

             WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone
             successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or
             bilateral oophorectomy) or is not post-menopausal. Post-menopause is defined as:

               -  Amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive months without another cause, or

               -  For women with irregular menstrual periods and taking hormone replacement therapy
                  (HRT), a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level ≥ 35 mIU/mL.

             Women who are using oral contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives (vaginal
             products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products
             such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to
             prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their partner is sterile (eg,
             vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing potential.

             WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L
             or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours before the start of ipilimumab.

             Men of fathering potential must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid
             conception throughout the study [and for up to 26 weeks after the last dose of
             investigational product] in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized.

         14. Patients must agree to blood sampling to participate in study.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Ocular melanoma

          2. Presence of brain metastases

          3. Prior radiation therapy for melanoma

          4. Any other malignancy form which the patient has been disease-free for less than 3
             years, with the exception of adequately treated and cured basal or squamous cell skin
             cancer, superficial bladder cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or DCIS. Patients
             with prior malignancies that are not considered to be an active problem may be
             enrolled at the discretion of the investigator, regardless of time frame.

          5. Autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, including
             ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease, are excluded from this study, as are patients
             with a history of symptomatic disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive
             sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [eg,
             Wegener's Granulomatosis]); motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g.
             Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Myasthenia Gravis).

          6. Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the
             investigator will make the administration of ipilimumab hazardous or obscure the
             interpretation of AEs, such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea.

          7. Any non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases (for up to
             1 month before or after any dose of ipilimumab).

             inhibitor or agonist.

          9. Concomitant therapy with any of the following: IL 2, interferon, or other non-study
             immunotherapy regimens; cytotoxic chemotherapy; immunosuppressive agents; other
             investigation therapies; or chronic use of systemic corticosteroids in the previous 4
             weeks (defined as prednisone 10mg daily or equivalent.)

         10. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), defined above in Section 4.1, who:

               1. are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of contraception to avoid
                  pregnancy for their entire study period and for at least 26 weeks after cessation
                  of study drug, or

               2. have a positive pregnancy test at baseline, or

               3. are pregnant or breastfeeding.

         11. Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for
             treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious) illness.

         12. Persons of reproductive potential must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception throughout treatment and for at least 26 weeks after ipilimumab is
             stopped. Sexually active WOCBP must use an effective method of birth control during
             the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Before
             study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during
             study participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. All
             WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test before first receiving ipilimumab. If the
             pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive ipilimumab and must not be
             enrolled in the study.
