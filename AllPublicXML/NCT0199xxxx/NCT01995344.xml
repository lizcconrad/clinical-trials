  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two arm, open-labelled phase II randomised trial of Tumour Infiltrating Lymphocytes
      (TIL) in metastatic melanoma patients given with preconditioning chemotherapy and
      Interleukin-2 (IL2). Eligible patients will undergo surgical tumour excision from which TIL
      will be derived, cultured and expanded. Patients will receive preconditioning chemotherapy
      with cyclophosphamide (60mg/kg) day -7 and day -6, followed by fludarabine (25mg/m2) day -5
      to day -1. The autologous TILs will be re-infused on day 0 and the patients will receive up
      to 12 doses of intravenous High Dose Interleukin-2 (HD-IL2) or Low Dose Interleukin-2
      (LD-IL2) depending on the randomised arm.

      The primary objectives are response rate assessed and compared by CT scans carried out at
      week 6, week 12 and at 12 weekly intervals thereafter and the evaluation of feasibility and
      tolerability of TIL therapy with HD-IL2 versus LD-IL2.
