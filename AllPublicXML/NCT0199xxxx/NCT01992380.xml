    <description>Evaluate test-retest reproducibility of 18F-AV-1451 for brain imaging of tau in healthy volunteers and subjects with cognitive impairment. Standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) for each scan, normalized to the cerebellum, will be evaluated using intraclass correlation.</description>
