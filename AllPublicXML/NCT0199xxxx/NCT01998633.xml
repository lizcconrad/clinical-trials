  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HLH, HLH-related disorders, Chronic Granulomatous (CGD), HIGM1, Immune dysregulation,
      polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, and X-linked inheritance (IPEX) and severe LAD-I represent
      primary immune disorders that are typically fatal without Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
      (HCT). However, transplant is often complicated by inflammation, infection and other
      co-morbidities. In addition, these disorders have been shown to be cured with partial
      chimerism, making them an ideal target for the use of reduced intensity approaches, where a
      portion of patients may not achieve full donor chimerism, but instead achieve stable mixed
      chimerism. Reduced-intensity conditioning strategies have demonstrated improved survival with
      decreased Treatment Related Mortality (TRM) in institutional series for patients with HLH
      (Cooper et al., 2006; Marsh et al., 2010; Marsh et al., 2011). However, graft loss and
      unstable chimerism remain challenges. An institutional case series from Cincinnati Children's
      Hospital demonstrated full or high-level chimerism and improved durable engraftment using
      intermediate (Day -14) timing alemtuzumab (Marsh et al., 2013b). This study aims to test the
      efficacy of the Intermediate RIC strategy in a prospective multi-center study including HLH
      as well as other primary immunodeficiencies where allogeneic transplant with RIC has been
      shown to be feasible and stable chimerism is curative.

      The primary goal of this Phase II clinical trial is to determine the one-year overall
      survival of patients treated for immune deficiencies including HLH, HLH-like disorders, CGD,
      HIGM1, IPEX syndrome, and severe LAD-I with Matched Related Donor (MRD)/ Matched Unrelated
      Donor (MUD) bone marrow transplant using a reduced-intensity conditioning strategy including
      intermediate-timing of alemtuzumab. The donor choice is an unaffected related bone marrow
      donor who is a 6/6 match at HLA-A, -B (intermediate or higher resolution) and -DRB1 (at high
      resolution using DNA-based typing) OR a 7/8 or 8/8 match for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A,
      -B, -C and -DRB1 (at high resolution using DNA-based typing), OR an unrelated bone marrow
      donor who is a 7/8 or 8/8 match at HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 (at high resolution using
      DNA-based typing). The transplant conditioning regimen will include fludarabine, melphalan,
      and alemtuzumab starting at Day -14 (Flu/Mel/Alem). Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD)
      prophylaxis will consist of cyclosporine and corticosteroids through engraftment.
      Post-transplant supportive care will include infection surveillance and prophylaxis, and
      disease-specific supportive care.

    <description>Systemic HLH Reactivation: Post-transplant HLH reactivation is defined by clinical and lab evidence of pathologic inflammation (persistent fever, progressive cytopenias, rising ferritin and soluble IL2Rα, decreasing fibrinogen, hepatosplenomegaly, end-organ damage) not attributable to other causes.
Central nervous system (CNS) HLH Reactivation: Reactivation of CNS inflammation in patients with HLH may present with or without altered mental status and is defined by pleocytosis in Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or an MRI consistent with CNS inflammation not attributable to other causes.
To assess the incidence of reactivation, cumulative incidence curves will be computed along with a 95% confidence interval. Death prior to reactivation will be considered as a competing risk.</description>
