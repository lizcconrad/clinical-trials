  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if electrical stimulation (small levels of
      electricity) can safely and effectively reduce post-amputation pain. This study involves a
      device called the SPRINT System. The SPRINT System delivers mild electrical stimulation to
      nerves in the residual limb. The SPRINT System includes a small wire (called a &quot;lead&quot;) that
      is placed through the skin in the upper leg. It also includes a device worn on the body that
      delivers stimulation (called the SPRINT Stimulator).
