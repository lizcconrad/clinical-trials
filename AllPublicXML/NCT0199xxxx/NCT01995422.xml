    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of a 12 weeks adapted physical
      activity program (active walking) on depression by analyzing the dynamics of emotional and
      cognitive functioning. The secondary objectives are to test the effects of a physical
      activity on functional performance and to highlight psychological mechanisms.

      Primary outcomes:

      Self evaluations concerning global self-esteem, a perception of competence and satisfaction
      in the physical self and four sub-domains that are perceived physical endurance, perceived
      competence in sports, perceived physical force and perceived physical appearance, are
      performed.

      Assessment of depressive symptomatology is also realised including momentary levels of
      depression, anxiety, rumination, efficacy of coping strategies and quality of life.

      Secondary outcomes:

      Assessment of postural control
