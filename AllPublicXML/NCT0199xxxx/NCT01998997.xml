    <textblock>
      To address the feasibility of implementing a randomized, educational intervention to prevent
      delirium, directed at family members of hospitalized older (70 years of age or older) medical
      in-patients. Specifically rates of recruitment and acceptance rates of such an intervention
      to family members will be assessed. An estimate of the effect size of this intervention will
      also be calculated. This is a pilot study. The investigators hypothesize that this
      intervention will be feasible and agreeable to family members to perform, with acceptance
      rates exceeding 80%.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a recent study in Chile, investigators randomized family members of admitted patients to
      an educational intervention to prevent delirium. Family members actively participated in a
      non-pharmacological intervention to prevent delirium. This has not been done in a North
      American environment, with different cultural and climactic factors.

      This study will be a randomized controlled trial (pilot study) involving family members.
      Family members will be randomized to a control group or an educational intervention. The
      control group will receive a general brochure, outlining general health information published
      by the Ministry of Health. The intervention group will receive a specific brochure on details
      around delirium (what it is and how to prevent it), and then a brief educational session
      comprising a didactic session and to address any questions. This pilot study will examine the
      feasibility of doing this kind of intervention in a North American environment. The
      family-based intervention is similar to what was done in the Chilean study. It involves six
      elements including the educational session. The five other elements include: 1) family being
      present for extended periods (at least 5 hours if possible); 2) engaging in conversation with
      study patients for re-orientation to current time and current events; 3) avoiding sensory
      deprivation (ensuring hearing or visual aids and dentures are available as needed; 4)
      providing familiar objects to patients; 5) provision of a clock and calendar to the patient.
      The intervention brochure is similar to what was provided to family members as part of the
      original Chilean study (kindly provided to the principal investigator, M. Dasgupta, by the
      lead author of the Chilean study, Dr. F.T. Martinez).
