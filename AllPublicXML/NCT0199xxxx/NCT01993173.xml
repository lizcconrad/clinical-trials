  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the immunogenicity and safety profile of ADACEL compared to
      local adsorbed diphtheria and tetanus combined vaccine (local DT or local Td vaccine in
      participants in China.

      Primary objective:

        -  To describe diphtheria and tetanus seroprotection rates and pertussis booster response
           rates induced by each of the study vaccines: ADACEL vaccine (in all study age groups),
           local DT vaccine (in children), and local Td vaccine (in adolescents and adults).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To further describe in each group the immunogenicity of the study vaccines at baseline
           and 1 month after vaccination.

        -  To describe the safety of the study vaccines
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants will receive a single booster dose of ADACEL (Tdap vaccine) or a single
      booster dose of local DT or local Td vaccine, depending on the age subgroup.

      Immunogenicity will be assessed before and 28 days post-vaccination; safety profile will be
      assessed in all subjects up to Day 35 post vaccination.
