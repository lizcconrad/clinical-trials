  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second cause of cancer mortality in women.
      There are approximately 200,000 new cases of breast cancer a year. Classically, breast
      cancers are divided into two groups, invasive and non-invasive. A mainstay of the treatment
      of both of these types is surgical resection not only for therapeutic purposes but also for
      diagnostic purposes. Breast conserving therapy includes surgical lumpectomy and
      post-operative radiation. However, despite best surgical practices, when patients undergo BCT
      anywhere from 20 - 40% of these patients have margins positive for cancer. This leads to
      increased rates of reoperation which are quoted to be as high as 30% and increased local
      recurrences.

      There is an over expression of folate receptors located on the surface of many human
      carcinoma nodules.Specifically for breast cancer up to 33% of all breast cancers over express
      the folate receptor.

      Folate-fluorescein isothiocyanate, or folate-FITC, also identified as EC-17, targets folate
      receptors over expressed in certain cancers such as breast cancer, and could help in better
      identifying the margins of the cancer thereby achieving negative margins.
