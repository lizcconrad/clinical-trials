  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical resection is the most effective treatment of primary and secondary liver tumors.
      Technical innovations have mainly focused on minimizing bleeding during transection of the
      hepatic parenchyma because excessive hemorrhage and the need for blood transfusion are
      associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality.
      Recently,radiofrequency-assisted（RFA）hepatectomy has developed rapidly and gained widespread
      acceptance for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinomas（HCC），but its influence on the
      prognosis of HCC patients，especially for those with cirrhosis，is still controversial.
      Therefore, we design this prospective clinical trial to explore the effect of RFA hepatectomy
      versus the conventional hepatectomy on the outcomes of perioperative period and prognosis of
      HCC patients with cirrhosis.

    <description>The degree of postoperative hepatic injury is assessed by daily measurements of postoperative aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, serum bilirubin levels, and prothrombin times. Each patient is followed up within postoperative 90 days.</description>

    <description>Blood parameter change after operation is measured by postoperative blood routine test till the hospitalization. The estimated average postoperative hospitalization ranges from 10 ot 15 days (generally 2 weeks). If the incidence of postoperative hepatic insufficiency occurred beyond hospitalization,blood routine test is also necessarily counted in.</description>
