  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy and safety of adding Herceptin to a paclitaxel-containing
      regimen followed by cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy in women
      with locally advanced breast cancer and HER2/c-erbB-2 gene amplification. In a parallel
      observational study patients with HER2-negative disease will receive the same chemotherapy
      without Herceptin.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Breast Pathological Complete Response (bpCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>BL, Day 1 of Cycles 1-10 (pre-surgery)</time_frame>

    <time_frame>BL, Presurgery: Day 1 of Cycles 1-10</time_frame>
    <description>Assessments were made based on objective tumor measurements of the lesions as recorded in the case report form. In inflammatory cancer, progressive disease (PD) was defined as progression of any of the 2 signs of breast edema and erythema. In non-inflammatory cancer, PD was concluded if either the investigator judged the participant as having progressed at any time prior to surgery, or there was at least a 20% increase in the sum of target lesions (TLs), any new lesion, or clear progression of any nontarget lesion (NTLs). Clear progression of any NTL was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of NTLs compared to BL. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease from BL in the sum of the longest diameter of TLs. CR was defined as no PD as assessed by the investigator and complete disappearance of all lesions.</description>

          <description>Participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 proto-oncogene positive (HER2+) breast cancer received treatment as follows:
Cycles 1-3 (3-week cycles): trastuzumab 8 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg), intravenously (IV) on Day 1 (Cycle 1 only; 6 mg/kg in Cycles 2 and 3), doxorubicin 60 mg/square meter (mg/m^2), IV, and paclitaxel 150 mg/m^2, IV, on Day 1 followed by 2 weeks off.
Cycles 4-7 (3-week cycles): trastuzumab 6 mg/kg, IV, paclitaxel 175 mg/m^2, IV, on Day 1, followed by 2 weeks off.
Cycles 8-10 (3-week cycles): trastuzumab 6 mg/kg, IV, on Day 1 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m^2, IV, methotrexate 40 mg/m^2, IV, and 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m^2, IV, (collectively CMF) on Days 1 and 8, followed by 2 weeks off.
Cycles 11-17 (3-week cycles): postoperatively, participants received trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV on Day 1, followed by 2 weeks off for maximum of 17 overall cycles with trastuzumab. Adjuvant tamoxifen, 20 mg/day was administered for up to 5 years.</description>

        <description>Assessments were made based on objective tumor measurements of the lesions as recorded in the case report form. In inflammatory cancer, progressive disease (PD) was defined as progression of any of the 2 signs of breast edema and erythema. In non-inflammatory cancer, PD was concluded if either the investigator judged the participant as having progressed at any time prior to surgery, or there was at least a 20% increase in the sum of target lesions (TLs), any new lesion, or clear progression of any nontarget lesion (NTLs). Clear progression of any NTL was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of NTLs compared to BL. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease from BL in the sum of the longest diameter of TLs. CR was defined as no PD as assessed by the investigator and complete disappearance of all lesions.</description>
