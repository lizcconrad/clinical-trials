      The purpose of this study is to evaluate medical cost-effectiveness, reduce the psychological
      risk factors( including hostility, anxiety, depression, and perceived stress) in coronary
      artery disease (CAD) patients and enhance the regulation of the autonomic nervous system
      (including respiration rate, heart rate, distal blood vessel pulse, and finger temperament)
      through web-based cognitive -behavioral group therapy.

      Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in reducing the level of anger, hostility and
      depression present in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients.In Taiwan, Weng et al. also
      confirmed the eight-week group CBT program not only diminished the emotion disturbances
      including anger, hostility and depression of CAD, but also significantly prolonged the
      coagulation time, thus reducing the rate of thrombosis formation. Even though the therapeutic
      effect of the CBT program was valid, this program is still not accessible for some patients
      in need because they are not aware of it, or they are restricted by time and transportation.
      Internet-based therapeutic intervention can overcome the obstacles to access this program at
      any time and in any place. Presently, structured CBT intervention is provided through the
      Internet and used widely by patients with physical or psychological problems such as smoking,
      obesity, or headaches, but not by CAD patients. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to
      evaluate the effects to reduce the psychological risk factors of a web-based group CBT
      program in CAD patients. Follow-up assessments will be performed after 3 and 6-month
      durations. The investigators expect that, after an eight-week group intervention, there will
      be significant decrease of the psychological risk factors. Moreover, the therapeutic effects
      can be maintained during the three- and six-month follow-up.evaluate In addition, web-based
      cognitive -behavioral group therapy will significantly reduce indirect medical costs (travel
      time and money).
