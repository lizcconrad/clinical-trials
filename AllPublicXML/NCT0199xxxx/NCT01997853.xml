  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Omega 3 fatty acids is one such dietary supplement, known to modulate the host response in
      chronic conditions like cardiovascular diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, ischemic
      cerebrovascular diseases, osteoporosis by producing Resolvins and protectins without showing
      any inadvertent effects.Addition of systemic Omega 3 Fatty Acids with SRP may enhance the
      therapeutic result of Chronic Periodontitis owing to host modulation &amp; anti-inflammatory
      properties. If proven, this can be used as a routine treatment modality.
