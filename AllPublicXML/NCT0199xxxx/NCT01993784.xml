    <textblock>
      Nimotuzumab is an IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody that recognized an epitope located in
      the extra cellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Clinical
      efficacy has been shown in adult with head and neck cancer. The study assessed the safety and
      efficacy of different dosage of Nimotuzumab in second or late- line treatment of patients
      with locally advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.
