  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether mifepristone is an effective treatment for
      hyperglycemia due to mild hypercortisolism.

        -  To test the hypothesis that GR blockade with mifepristone will decrease the severity of
           metabolic syndrome features as measured by waist circumference, lipid profile, body mass
           index, blood pressure and insulin resistance, measured by HOMA-IR score.

        -  To test the hypothesis that GR blockade with mifepristone will improve QoL, depression
           and anxiety scores, measured by validated assessments, in patients with mild
           hypercortisolism.

    <description>Change in Quality of Life as assessed by the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) which is a patient reported questionnaire to measure a patient's view of their own health status. There are 6 sections (Energy level, Pain, Emotional Reaction, Sleep, Social Isolation, and Physical Abilities. All questions have only yes/no answer options and each section score is weighted so that the possible score range for any section is 0-100. The higher the score, the greater the number and severity of problems.</description>

Scoring is from a 0 (not at all) to 3 (severe) with a total score range of 0-63. Higher total scores indicate more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>
