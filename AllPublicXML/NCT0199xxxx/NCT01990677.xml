The adjustment will be based on serum potassium and creatine levels from blood draws done at Day 12 and Day 33. From the 25 mg starting dosage, the dosage will either be increased to 50 mg a day or reduced to placebo, one time, each day.
25mg Eplerenone: Patients will be given 25mg Eplerenone (or 50mg Eplerenone) or placebo throughout the study and the dosage will be based on the serum potassium/creatine levels. Patients will be randomized 2:1 such that 36 patients in each group will receive eplerenone and 16 patients in each group will receive placebo
Placebo: Patients will be given placebo throughout the study from day one, other patients may be tapered down to placebo based on the serum potassium/creatine levels. 16 patients in each group will receive placebo.</description>
