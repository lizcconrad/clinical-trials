      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of real-time continuous glucose monitoring
      system on glucose control and outcomes of critically ill patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Real-time continuous glucose monitoring system has shown great accuracy and feasibility in
      critically ill patients. However, its impact on glucose control and outcomes has nearly
      unknown. Thus, Investigators designed this study to evaluate the effect of real-time
      continuous glucose monitoring system on glucose control and outcomes of critically ill
      patients.

    <description>Continuous Glucose Monitoring Group:
Different methods of blood glucose monitoring between groups, and this group will use real-time continuous glucose monitoring system with alarm limits（high and low limit is 10 mmol/L and 8 mmil/L , respectively ) up to five days for glucose control, the target mean glucose level is between 8 and 10 mmol/L.</description>

    <description>Conventional Group：
Different methods of blood glucose monitoring between groups, and this group will use finger prick blood glucose measurements for glucose control with the same target mean glucose level of 8 -10 mmol/L. Patients also wear real-time continuous glucose monitoring system to collect glucose measurements. The values of real-time continuous glucose monitoring system are blinded to investigator and patients.</description>
