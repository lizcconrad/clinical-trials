  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will quantify one of the lipid compounds (5,6 epoxy eicosatrienoic acid (5,6 EET), 5,6-
      EpoxyEicosaTrienoic acid) in colonic biopsies of Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients. We will
      evaluate its possible use as a pathological activity biomarker and its potential as a
      therapeutic target.

      We hypothesized that 5,6-EET is present in human colonic tissues in varying quantities
      depending on the pathological state of the IBD patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project is an exploratory physiopathological/translational pilot study, aiming at
      understanding the relative importance of the lipid compounds, especially 5,6-EET, in
      Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.

      Using mass spectrometry, 5,6-EET and other 33 lipid metabolites will be quantified in situ in
      colonic biopsies from IBD patients and from control patients. We will compare quantities of
      5,6-EET in inflammatory and non-inflammatory zones of biopsies from IBD patient to biopsies
      from control patient. We will establish a cluster of lipid compounds associated with
      pathological activity. We will determine the exposed profile of receptor lipid mediators
      expressing to the 5,6-EET lipid compound and one of its signalization.

      All data will be submit to statistical analysis to confirm relevance.

      We expect this pilot study to help us define 5,6-EET and other components of the same
      metabolic family as markers for IBD activity. It could point lipid mediators and their
      receptors as potential new therapeutic targets.

      It will increase our knowledge on current treatment efficiency by evidencing lipid markers
      for the inflammatory condition.

    <description>Colonoscopy or coloscopy can provide a visual diagnosis and grants the opportunity for biopsy or removal of suspected colorectal cancer lesions.
The endoscope is then passed through the anus up the rectum, the colon, and ultimately the terminal ileum. The endoscope has a movable tip and multiple channels for instrumentation, air, suction and light. Biopsies are frequently taken for histology, needed for cancer or IBD diagnosis.
Extra-biopsies for research purpose will only be performed if the clinician decides that they are necessary for the clinical diagnosis or for the disease follow-up.
For this protocol, collecting these extra biopsies should last under 5 minutes and should not extend the procedure by more than this time.</description>
