      1.0 Title: &quot;The Efficiency and Effectiveness of Video-Based Education for Dermatology
      Patients Qualifying for Chronic Treatment with Systemic Corticosteroids&quot;

      2.0 Background: Past studies have shown that the use of educational videos has been effective
      in increasing patient education and satisfaction. These studies suggest that such video tools
      may enable an office to be significantly more efficient.

      3.0 Objective: The Emory University Department of Dermatology has created an educational
      video as part of clinical care. The objective for Phase I of the study is to collect
      information about dermatology patients' baseline knowledge about corticosteroid and/or
      corticosteroid sparing medication treatment using an online (or written copy) questionnaire.
      The objective for Phase II of the study is to determine the effect of a video on dermatology
      patient knowledge. The objective for Phase III of the study is to determine the office
      efficiency of the video in patients requiring long-term oral corticosteroid and/or
      corticosteroid sparing medications. Secondary objectives of the study are to determine
      patient and physician satisfaction with the video as an educational tool.

      4.0 Patient Selection: Phase I and Phase II: Patients who arrive to clinic during a
      participating physician's clinic day at the Emory Dermatology Department. Phase III: Patients
      who require treatment with long term oral corticosteroids at the Emory University Department
      of Dermatology Clinic as determined by their treatment physician.

      5.0 Recruitment: All patients arriving to clinic on a study day will be given an
      informational opt-out sheet. All patients will be eligible to complete Phase I and Phase II:
      (steroid questionnaire only and steroid video or verbal education plus questionnaires). Only
      patients who require long term oral corticosteroid treatment will proceed to Phase III: of
      the study. Physicians will be recruited from the Emory Dermatology Department.

      6.0 Assessment: Patients in Phase I will complete to the pre-education questionnaire online
      (or a written copy). Their results will be compared with baseline results from patients in
      Phase III: who undergo treatment with steroids. Patients in Phase II or III will be
      randomized to two groups. Control patients will receive verbal discussion of corticosteroid
      treatment. Phase II control patient education will be using a script developed by study
      physicians and delivered by study personnel. Phase III patients who qualify for long term
      systemic steroid will have verbal education by their doctor as usual. Video patients will
      receive an educational video instead, and will write down any remaining questions after
      viewing for their doctor to address as soon as possible. After verbal or video education,
      both groups will take a post-education questionnaire and patient satisfaction surveys online.
      Phase II is then complete. In Phase III, both groups will follow-up at least 1, 3, and 6
      months after beginning treatment. At follow-up, their doctor will ask about current
      corticosteroid dose and frequency, willingness to transition to a steroid-sparing method, and
      compliance with preventative measures during treatment. Patients will complete the same
      post-education questionnaire online again at these visits. Physicians will also complete
      satisfaction surveys online at 1, 3, and 6 months from study start, and then every 6 months.

      6.1 Sample size: The sample size for Phase I is unlimited until the last Phase II patient
      completes enrollment. Emory plans to recruit a total of 80 patients to participate in Phase
      II of this study (40 per group).

      6.2 Participant time burden: Phase I only: 5-10 minutes Phase II and III: 30-35 minutes
      Physicians: 20 minutes
