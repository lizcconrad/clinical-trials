  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this observational study is to evaluate the in hospital and 6 month outcomes of
      the use of Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor eptifibatide as adjunctive therapy in patients
      undergoing primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for ST-elevation myocardial infarction
      in a large tertiary referral center.

      It is hypothesized that Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor use during primary Percutaneous
      Coronary Intervention for ST-elevation myocardial infarction/ acute myocardial infarction is
      superior to unfractionated heparin alone or bivalirudin alone. Additionally, after propensity
      matching this superiority remains.

      This is a retrospective, observational, data analysis of approximately 800 patients who
      underwent primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention at our institution since September 2000.
      Patients will have either received eptifibatide pre-or during Percutaneous Coronary
      Intervention or have received no eptifibatide. Patients who received a thrombolytic prior to
      Percutaneous Coronary Intervention will be excluded.

      This analysis is estimated to take 1-2 months.
