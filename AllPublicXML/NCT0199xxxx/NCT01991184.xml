  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, Phase I study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics
      of increasing doses of GDC-0853 in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In a dose-expansion part, GDC-0853 will be assessed
      in subsets of patients.
