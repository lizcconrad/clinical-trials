      Hypothesis/Specific Aims:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of training with the Stride Management
      Assist (SMA) device vs. Impairment based physical therapy (IPT) on descending corticospinal
      drive to the lower limb muscles in patients post stroke. The investigators hypothesize that
      long-term SMA use would strengthen the connections between the motor areas of the brain and
      the lower limbs. Specifically, individuals in the SMA group will show higher corticospinal
      excitability of the lower limb muscles compared to those in the IPT group.

      This is a randomized control trial comparing task specific training with the Stride
      Management Assist (SMA) device verses an impairment based physical therapy (IPT) approach on
      functional walking ability in outpatient stroke rehabilitation. Participants between the ages
      of 18-80 and who are 30 days or greater post stroke will be included.

      This SMA robotic device assists hip flexion and extension, for each side independently. It is
      controlled through software run on a tablet. The device weighs 2.8 kgs, and has 2 brushless
      direct current motors running on a rechargeable lithium ion battery. It comes in 3 sizes
      (small, medium and large). It is worn around like a belt with the motors near the hips and
      straps on the thighs. The SMA device allows users to increase their stride length by
      providing assist with the motors in flexion and extension. This device is 1) simple to use in
      the clinical setting; 2) easily adjustable to alter according to the requirements of each
      subject; and, 3) can quantify the amount of assistance required to facilitate walking
      patterns.

      Participants post stroke 30 days or greater will be recruited from inpatient, day
      rehabilitation and outpatient clinics. Participants will be scheduled for 18 Sessions of
      outpatient physical therapy plus 3 sessions of testing. The amount of sessions provided will
      be dependent upon compatibility with the device and ability to tolerate the device. A
      participant will continue with each session of the study as deemed appropriate by research
      staff.

        -  A. Phase I. (session 0): After consenting, subjects will undergo a physical evaluation
           and screening exam by a licensed physical therapist. If they meet study criteria, they
           will be randomly placed into either the SMA group or the IPT group using a random number
           generator and they will be entered into the study. Once they are enrolled, baseline
           outcome measures will be assessed by a blinded research physical therapist.

        -  B. Phase II. (sessions 1-9):

             -  Stride Management Assist Group: Treatment consists of 30 minutes high intensity
                gait training with device, 15 minutes functional mobility with device.

             -  Impairment Based Physical Therapy Group: Treatment will be divided into: 15 min
                balance training, 15 minutes functional mobility (transfers, strength or
                flexibility training) and 15 min high intensity gait training

        -  C. Phase III. (session 10): Mid treatment assessment. Outcome measures will be assessed
           by a blinded research physical therapist.

        -  D. Phase II. (sessions 11-19):

             -  Stride Management Assist Group: Treatment consists of 30 minutes high intensity
                gait training with device, 15 minutes functional mobility with device.

             -  Impairment Based Physical Therapy Group: Treatment will be divided into: 15 min
                balance training, 15 minutes functional mobility (transfers, strength or
                flexibility training) and 15 min high intensity gait training

        -  E. Phase IV. (session 20): Post Testing. Outcome measures will be assessed by a blinded
           research physical therapist.

      All testing and training sessions will be under the supervision of a licensed physical
      therapist. All subjects will be permitted to stop physical activity or rest at any time
      during the study. Adverse events will be recorded.

      The investigators anticipate this study will help determine if the Stride Management Assist
      is a practical option to better strengthen the connections between the brain and the lower
      limbs. The investigators do not foresee any potential pitfalls.

The impairment based group will match the SMA group in intensity but will be focused on balance and other functional goals rather than explicitly on walking. The rationale of this study is to assess task specific training with SMA vs. impairment based training. To this end, we will use the Stride Management Assist device by Honda Corporation and compare it to impairment based physical therapy in outpatient sessions.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Session 0 (initial visit);Session 20 (between 6-8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the effect of training on the connections between the brain and leg muscles (descending corticomotor drive) using a non-invasive brain stimulation called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is a safe, non-invasive, painless method of brain stimulation that has been widely used to study the physiology of the representations of muscles in the motor cortex in healthy and neurologically disordered individuals13. Very short duration (&lt; 1 ms) magnetic pulses are applied via an insulated wire coil placed on the intact scalp overlaying the motor cortical area projecting to a target muscle. Each pulse induces a motor evoked potential (MEP) in a target muscle that can be readily monitored by recording Electromyogram (EMG) from that muscle. A figure-of-eight or double cone coil is typically used to deliver focal magnetic pulses to a number of scalp sites over the cortical area representing a muscle of interest.</description>

    <description>The 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) is a test of endurance, by measuring the distance a subject can walk indoors on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes, using assistive devices, as necessary.The distance is measured with a measuring wheel. The instructions are &quot;Walk covering as much ground as you can in 6 min. You can stop to sit or stand if needed, but time will keep running.&quot; The change in the distance walked in the 6-minute walk can be used to evaluate the efficacy of an exercise-training program or to trace the natural history of change in exercise capacity over time. The 6MWT is measured in meters.</description>

    <measure>Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Assessment (Visit 1), Mid Training Assessment (Visit 10), Post Training Assessment (Visit 18), 3 Month Post Training Assessment (3 Month Follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The BBS is a 14-item objective measure designed to assess static balance and fall risk in adult populations and is a well-accepted measure in the stroke literature. The functional activities that are assessed include sitting and standing balance during transfers, altered base of support, reaching, turning, eyes open and closed. Each item is scored from 0 to 4 points. The maximum score is 56 points. A score from 0 to 20 represents balance impairment, 21 to 40 represents acceptable balance, and 41-56 represents good balance. The minimal detectable change score for individuals with acute stroke is 6.9 points16 and 4.66 points in chronic stroke17.</description>

Each individual domain consists of 3 to 10 items that are averaged to generate an overall score, each item is rated on a 5- point Likert scale, with a minimum value of 1 (meaning the worst outcome) and a maximum value of 5 (meaning the best outcome). Domains scores (non-weighted average of item scores) and a summary score (non-weighted average of all 12 domain scores) are computed. Summary scores range from 49-245, with higher scores indicating better functioning.</description>

        <description>PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-report questionnaire designed to diagnose both the presence of depressive symptoms as well as to characterize the severity of depression. A single question rates how difficult problems have made it to do work, take care of things at home or get along with other people using a 4 level scale (not difficult at all to extremely difficult). Each item is scored from 0-3; total scores may be 0-27, with higher scores representing increased severity of depression.</description>

        <title>Participants Receiving Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)</title>
        <description>To compare the effect of training on the connections between the brain and leg muscles (descending corticomotor drive) using a non-invasive brain stimulation called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is a safe, non-invasive, painless method of brain stimulation that has been widely used to study the physiology of the representations of muscles in the motor cortex in healthy and neurologically disordered individuals13. Very short duration (&lt; 1 ms) magnetic pulses are applied via an insulated wire coil placed on the intact scalp overlaying the motor cortical area projecting to a target muscle. Each pulse induces a motor evoked potential (MEP) in a target muscle that can be readily monitored by recording Electromyogram (EMG) from that muscle. A figure-of-eight or double cone coil is typically used to deliver focal magnetic pulses to a number of scalp sites over the cortical area representing a muscle of interest.</description>

        <description>The 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) is a test of endurance, by measuring the distance a subject can walk indoors on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes, using assistive devices, as necessary.The distance is measured with a measuring wheel. The instructions are &quot;Walk covering as much ground as you can in 6 min. You can stop to sit or stand if needed, but time will keep running.&quot; The change in the distance walked in the 6-minute walk can be used to evaluate the efficacy of an exercise-training program or to trace the natural history of change in exercise capacity over time. The 6MWT is measured in meters.</description>

        <description>The BBS is a 14-item objective measure designed to assess static balance and fall risk in adult populations and is a well-accepted measure in the stroke literature. The functional activities that are assessed include sitting and standing balance during transfers, altered base of support, reaching, turning, eyes open and closed. Each item is scored from 0 to 4 points. The maximum score is 56 points. A score from 0 to 20 represents balance impairment, 21 to 40 represents acceptable balance, and 41-56 represents good balance. The minimal detectable change score for individuals with acute stroke is 6.9 points16 and 4.66 points in chronic stroke17.</description>
