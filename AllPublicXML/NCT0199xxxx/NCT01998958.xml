  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and dose response of intranasal
      esketamine (Panel A: 28 mg, 56 mg, and 84 mg and Panel B: 14 mg and 56 mg) compared with
      placebo in improving depressive symptoms in participants with treatment-resistant depression
      (TRD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a 2-panel, randomized ( participants are assigned different treatments based on
      chance), double-blind (neither investigator nor participant knows which treatment the
      participant receives), placebo-controlled (placebo is an inactive substance that is compared
      with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial), multicenter
      study. Approximately 100 male and female adult participants diagnosed with TRD will
      participate in this study. For participants in both panels (Panel A and Panel B), there will
      be 4 study phases: a 4-week screening phase, a double-blind treatment phase (Day 1 to Day
      15), an optional open-label treatment phase (Panel A: Day 15 to 74; Panel B: Day 15 to 25),
      and an 8-week post-treatment (follow-up) phase. Depending on the treatment Panel, patients
      will be assigned to intranasal placebo or intranasal esketamine 14 mg, 28 mg, 56 mg, or 84
      mg. Safety assessments will be performed throughout the study. The maximum study duration for
      a participant will be 23 weeks for Panel A and 16 weeks for Panel B.

    <measure>Change from baseline to the 1-week endpoint in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>(Day 1 predose, Day 8 predose) to (Day 8 predose, Day 15)</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity and to detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. The scale consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total possible score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in patient-reported depressive symptoms using the 16-item quick inventory of depressive symptoms - self report (QIDS-SR16) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 to 15, and in the optional open-label treatment period, if applicable on Days 18 to 74 (Panel A), Days 18 to 25 (Panel B) and up to 2 weeks after the last dose</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS-SR16 is a patient reported measure designed to assess the severity of depressive symptoms. The QIDS-SR16 assesses all the criterion symptom domains designated by the DSM-IV to diagnose a major depressive episode. This assessment can be used to screen for depression, although it has been used predominantly as a measure of symptom severity</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in severity of illness using the Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 15, and in the optional open-label treatment period, if applicable on Days 18 to 74 (Panel A), Days 18 to 25 (Panel B) and up to 8 weeks after the last dose</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7-point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in severity of illness using the patient global impression - severity (PGI-S) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 to 15 and in the optional open-label treatment period, if applicable on Days 18 to 74 (Panel A), Days 18 to 25 (Panel B) and up to 2 weeks after the last dose</time_frame>
    <description>The PGI-S is a 4-point scale that requires the participant to rate the severity of their illness at the time of assessment, relative to the participant's past experience. Considering their total experience, the patient assesses the severity of their depression illness at the time of rating as none, mild, moderate, or severe. Paper and pen format will be used for this study.</description>

    <description>The GAD-7 is a 7-item self-report assessment of severity of anxiety. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale (0-3), with a total score range of 0-30. The standard recall period used is 2 weeks, but in the current study we plan to use a 7-day recall.</description>
