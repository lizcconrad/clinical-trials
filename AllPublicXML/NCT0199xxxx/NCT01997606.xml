      Product information:

      Purotex is a textile treatment that uses five 100% natural bacteria or probiotics, selected
      for their ability to clean up house dust mite allergen along with other allergen types.

      Study design:

        -  Placebo-controlled: the effect of the Purotex impregnated mattress and pillow covers
           will be compared to untreated, classical bedding covers (placebo).

        -  Cross-over design: There will be 2 'treatment' arms. One arm (Arm 1) in which the
           subjects will first use the Purotex impregnated covers (Set A=Purotex) during 2 months
           (=period A) and, after a wash out period of 1 month, the untreated covers (set
           B=placebo) during 2 months (=period B). In the second arm (Arm 2), the subjects will
           first use the untreated set (set A=placebo) and, after a wash out period the Purotex
           impregnated covers (set B=Purotex).

        -  Randomized: The subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 treatment arms.

        -  Double blind: both the subjects and the investigators will not know to which treatment
           arm the subjects are assigned.

      Study hypothesis:

      We want to investigate:

        -  if there is a reduced concentration of HDM allergen in Purotex covers compared to
           untreated covers in real life

        -  if patients with allergic rhinitis to house dust mite use the Purotex covers, they
           experience an improvement of their quality of life and sleep, and an improvement of
           their allergic symptoms and global discomfort

    <description>Purotex is a textile treatment that uses five 100% natural bacteria or probiotics, selected for their ability to clean up house dust mite allergen along with other allergen types. The active probiotics are placed inside of millions of capsules and are introduced during the textile production. These human friendly bacteria remain non-active until friction force is created between the mattress/pillow and the sleeper's body. Under the friction force a small part of the capsules is opened and probiotics become active. They saturate the bacterial capacity of the textile and by doing so, reduce the risk of dust mite allergen development and growth of molds and harmful bacteria. The patients will apply the covers around their mattress and around their pillow. On top of these covers the patients will apply their own fitted sheet and pillowcase (which they will change every 4 weeks).</description>
