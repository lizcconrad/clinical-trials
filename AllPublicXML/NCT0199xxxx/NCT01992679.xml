  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence that exercise-based rehabilitation results in improvements in
      mobility and participation in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the vast
      majority of the scientific evidence in support of this view is based on persons with MS who
      have minimal mobility impairment. This is partially due to the lack of accessible exercise
      equipment and facilities available to persons with severe mobility limitations.

      One option available to persons with severe mobility limitations is body weight supported
      treadmill training. Indeed, this rehabilitation approach has been utilized with some success
      in various clinical populations, such as stroke and spinal cord injury, and is believed to
      target neuroplasticity. Specific to persons with MS, body weight supported treadmill training
      has shown great promise in improving quality of life, symptoms and functional mobility in two
      small (n=4 and n=6) pilot investigations. However, previous research has been hampered by
      methodological limitations including small sample size, lack of a control group and limited
      training sessions. Consequently, no firm conclusion regarding the benefit of body weighted
      supported treadmill training in persons with MS can be drawn. The proposed project seeks to
      determine if twenty-weeks of body weight supported treadmill training leads to improvements
      in physiological function, mobility and quality of life in persons with MS with severe
      mobility limitations. The outcomes of this project have the potential to lead to new
      rehabilitation approaches capable of improving function and quality of life in persons with
      advanced MS.

    <description>The BWSTT program will consist of biweekly training sessions for 20 weeks. Per neurorecovery network guidelines, each training session will include a minimum of 20 minutes of locomotor training and 20 minutes of balance training. Training will take place on a Therastride which consists of a treadmill with an air pressure powered pulley system connected to a harness system. The locomotor training strategy focuses on proper gait mechanics, including weight bearing, shifting and maintaining body positioning. Manipulating the participant's legs is done in such a way as to provide appropriate sensory-motor cues that facilitate the development and refinement of walking pattern.</description>

             neurologist using a standard form letter.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The criteria for exclusion are having a relapse in the last 30 days, inability to
             contract the quadriceps, and unwilling to complete the 20 week intervention.
