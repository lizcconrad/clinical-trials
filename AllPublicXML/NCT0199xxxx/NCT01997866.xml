  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) on non-Intensive Care Unit medical services
      and/or visiting our outpatient Congestive Heart Failure Clinic will be screened using the
      STOP-BANG Scoring Model. (STOP-BANG stands for Snoring, Tiredness, Observed Apnea, Blood
      Pressure, Body Mass Index, Age, Neck Circumference, Gender.) Patients with high risk of
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) will be referred for evaluation and treatment of Sleep Apnea.
      They will be followed to determine if treatment of Sleep Apnea improves their quality of life
      and decreases their utilization of the Hospital and Emergency Department (ED).

      Patients with Congestive Heart Failure on non-Intensive Care Unit Medical Services and/or
      visiting our outpatient Congestive Heart Failure clinic will be screened using the STOP-BANG
      Scoring Model. Patients with high risk of Obstructive Sleep Apnea will be referred to the
      Sleep Center physicians for evaluation and treatment. Patients will be followed for one year
      to determine if the treatment for Sleep Apnea improves their Quality of Life and decreases
      Hospital and Emergency Department utilization.
