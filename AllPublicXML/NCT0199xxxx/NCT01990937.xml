  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference of Anxiety score</measure>
    <time_frame>Asked the patient 5 minutes before EGD and then after fully recovery from sedation.</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety score is 10-cm scaled visual analog scale.
Anxiety score which asked the patient 5 minutes before EGD, called &quot;Pre EGD anxiety score&quot;
Anxiety score which asked the patient after fully recovery, called &quot;During EGD anxiety score&quot;.
Difference of anxiety score means &quot;Pre EGD minus During anxiety score&quot;.
Fully recovery means fully gain of consiouness (time, place, person).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>Asked the patient after fully recovery from sedation.</time_frame>
    <description>Fully recovery means fully gain of consiouness (time, place, person).
Overall tolerance was grading into 4 levels;
Poor : Very uncomfortable during the entire procedure
Fair : Uncomfortable during most of the procedure
Good : Believes the procedure was generally comfortable, there were portions of procedure during which sedation could have been given
Excellent : Believes the procedure was comfortable, no additional sedation was needed</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Amnesia score</measure>
    <time_frame>Asked the patient after fully recovery from sedation.</time_frame>
    <description>Fully recovery means fully gain of consiouness (time, place, person).
Amnesia score was grading into 4 levels;
= Patient unable to recall any portion of procedure
= Able to recall and describe some portion of procedure
= Able to recall and describe most of procedure
= Able to recall and describe entire procedure</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Overall satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Asked the patient after fully recovery from sedation.</time_frame>
    <description>Fully recovery means fully gain of consiouness (time, place, person). Overall satifaction was 10-cm scaled visual analog scale.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Willing to repeat EGD</measure>
    <time_frame>Asked the patient after fully recovery from sedation.</time_frame>
    <description>Fully recovery means fully gain of consiouness (time, place, person). Willing to repeat EGD was defined to &quot;Yes or No&quot;.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Vital signs</measure>
    <time_frame>Vital signs were measured at 5 minutes before EGD then measured every 5 minutes during EGD until the patient was fully recovery after the EGD was finished.</time_frame>
    <description>Vital signs were blood pressure(mmHg), heart rates(beats per minute), respiratory rates(per minute) and oxygen saturation(percents).</description>
