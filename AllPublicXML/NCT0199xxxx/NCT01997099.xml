  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the home healthcare organization ambulatory infusion
      pump programming workflow and the process that was followed to introduce the new CADD®-Solis
      VIP System to each home healthcare organization or facility. In addition, this study will
      characterize the overall clinician (Phase 1) and patient (Phase 2) ease of use and
      satisfaction with the CADD®-Solis VIP System.

      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, post-market study conducted within the
      United States. There will be two independent components (Phases) to this study. Phase 1 will
      involve data collection to describe the home infusion pump programming workflow and the
      process that was used to introduce the new CADD®-Solis VIP System to each home healthcare
      organization. This phase is further broken down into data collection consisting of four
      parts: drug protocol library creation and development within the CADD™ Solis Medication
      Safety Software Administrator, pump programming, home care implementation, and overall
      workflow and new smart pump implementation. Phase 2 will involve data collection from
      patients that receive a prescription requiring use of the CADD®-Solis VIP pump.
