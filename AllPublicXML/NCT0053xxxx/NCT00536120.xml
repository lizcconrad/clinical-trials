    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study were: to evaluate the effect of Tysabri® (natalizumab)
      on antibody responses after immunization with a neoantigen (keyhole limpet hemocyanin [KLH])
      and a recall antigen (tetanus toxoid [Td]), and to evaluate the effect of Tysabri on
      circulating lymphocyte subsets (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, and CD56+) over time in participants
      with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The secondary objective was to assess
      alpha4-integrin saturation and alpha4-integrin expression levels over time.

    <measure>Mean Alpha4-Integrin Saturation at Baseline, Month 3, and Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 0 (Baseline), Month 3, and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of the degree of natalizumab saturation of the alpha4 integrin on peripheral blood mononuclear cells was accomplished by staining cells with phycoerythrin conjugated anti human IgG4 antibody (hIgG4-PE) to label the cell-bound natalizumab, followed by flow cytometric detection and quantification.</description>

    <measure>Mean Alpha4-Integrin Expression at Baseline, Month 3, and Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 0 (Baseline), Month 3, and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Alpha4-integrin expression is the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI), a measure of fluorescence intensity often used to monitor changes in surface antigen modulation in flow cytometry. There is no reference range for this test, which was developed at Biogen Idec.</description>
