      This study investigates whether OROS-methylphenidate improves performance on different
      aspects of attention and memory in children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
      (ADHD).

    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effect of Osmotic-Release Oral System (OROS)-methylphenidate, a
      long-acting stimulant, on multiple dimensions of attention and on working memory.
      Specifically, we will investigate the following two hypotheses: (1) OROS-methylphenidate will
      result in improved performance on measures assessing multiple domains of attention, including
      sustained attention, attentional control, selective attention, and divided attention, and (2)
      OROS-methylphenidate will result in improved performance on measures of working memory. In
      addition we will use the study to collect pilot data on whether the magnitude of the effect
      of OROS-methylphenidate varies across the different components of attention and working
      memory and whether improvement across any of these measures is helpful in predicting parent
      or teacher ratings of improvement.

    <measure>Test of Everyday Attention for Children: Walk, Don't Walk</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The TEA-Ch is a battery of nine subtests designed to assess multiple attentional capacities in children 6-16y.o. The Walk-Don't Walk subtest is a measure of sustained attention and response inhibition. Scores on this subtest can range from 0 to 20 with higher scores representing better performance.</description>

    <measure>Gordon Diagnostic System Continuous Performance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of sustained attention &amp; response inhibition for children 6 yrs and older. During this task a series of numbers flash, one at a time, on a screen. The subject is told to press a button every time a &quot;1&quot; is followed by a &quot;9&quot;. There are 45 possible correct responses over the 9-minute task. Omission errors are a measure of sustained attention and can range from 0 to 45. Commission errors are a measure of sustained attention and response inhibition can range from zero to hundreds (each time the button is pushed at the incorrect time). Lower scores indicate better performance.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited from an outpatient ADHD evaluation and treatment program at a pediatric academic medical center. Eligible children wer: 1) Age 6-12 years and at least in 1st grade; 2) DSM-IVTR diagnosis of ADHD, Combined Type;3) Parent and teacher ratings on the ADHD Rating Scale-IV &gt; 85th percentile; 5) IQ greater than 75</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Parents of 41 patients inquired about participating in the study. Four did not meet eligibility requirements leaving 37 eligible children. Three families elected not to participate leaving 34 children. Three children did not complete the dose finding stage leaving 31 children who entered the double blind placebo controlled crossover study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Test of Everyday Attention for Children: Walk, Don't Walk</title>
        <description>The TEA-Ch is a battery of nine subtests designed to assess multiple attentional capacities in children 6-16y.o. The Walk-Don’t Walk subtest is a measure of sustained attention and response inhibition. Scores on this subtest can range from 0 to 20 with higher scores representing better performance.</description>

        <title>Gordon Diagnostic System Continuous Performance Test</title>
        <description>This is a measure of sustained attention &amp; response inhibition for children 6 yrs and older. During this task a series of numbers flash, one at a time, on a screen. The subject is told to press a button every time a “1” is followed by a “9”. There are 45 possible correct responses over the 9-minute task. Omission errors are a measure of sustained attention and can range from 0 to 45. Commission errors are a measure of sustained attention and response inhibition can range from zero to hundreds (each time the button is pushed at the incorrect time). Lower scores indicate better performance.</description>
