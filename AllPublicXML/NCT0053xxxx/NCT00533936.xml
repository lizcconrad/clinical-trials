      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry
      tumor-killing substances to them. Giving combination chemotherapy together with trastuzumab
      before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs
      to be removed. Giving trastuzumab after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after
      surgery. Sometimes, after surgery, the tumor may not need more treatment until it progresses.
      In this case, observation may be sufficient. It is not yet known whether trastuzumab is more
      effective than observation when given after combination chemotherapy and trastuzumab in
      treating patients with breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying trastuzumab to see how well it works
      compared with observation when given after combination chemotherapy and trastuzumab in
      treating patients undergoing surgery for stage II or stage III breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the percentage of pathological responses in patients with stage II or III
           breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant therapy comprising fluorouracil, doxorubicin
           hydrochloride, and cyclophosphamide followed by trastuzumab (Herceptin®) and paclitaxel.

        -  To compare the disease-free survival of patients treated with adjuvant therapy
           comprising trastuzumab versus observation.

      Secondary

        -  To measure the overall survival at 3 years in these patients.

        -  To measure the cardiac safety profile of these regimens in these patients.

        -  To measure the percentage of patients that become negative on the fluorescence in situ
           hybridization (FISH) test at the end of neoadjuvant therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I :

             -  Neoadjuvant therapy: Patients receive fluorouracil IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride
                IV, and cyclophosphamide IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses
                in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then
                receive trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over 30-90 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 1
                hour once a week for 12 weeks.

      After completion of neoadjuvant therapy, patients proceed to surgery.

        -  Surgery: Patients undergo definitive surgery. Some patients may also undergo
           radiotherapy*.

      NOTE: *Patients with initial tumor &gt; 5 cm, inflammatory breast cancer, or with a skin
      condition or final pathological evaluation of metastasis to &gt; 4 nodes or 1-3 nodes with
      capsular ruptures or extension to fatty tissues receive adjuvant radiotherapy.

        -  Adjuvant therapy: Beginning 4 weeks after surgery, patients receive trastuzumab IV over
           30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 13 courses.

             -  Arm II:

        -  Neoadjuvant therapy: Patients receive neoadjuvant therapy as in arm I.

        -  Surgery: Patients undergo definitive surgery. Some patients may also undergo
           radiotherapy if clinically indicated.

        -  Observation: Beginning 4 weeks after surgery, patients undergo observation. In both
           arms, patients with estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive disease
           also receive anastrozole daily for 5 years. Premenopausal patients with remaining
           ovarian function (as confirmed by follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] and estradiol)
           after completion of anastrozole undergo chemical or surgical ovarian ablation.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then once a year thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 160 patients (80 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
