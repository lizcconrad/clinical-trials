  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a non-contact, non invasive method to examine the
      retina by providing cross-sectional scans through the retina. Measurements of the retinal
      thickness based on automatically set border lines created by threshold algorithm provide
      information concerning the amount of intraretinal fluid and activity of the lesion. In this
      study the reproducibility of retinal thickness measurements in patients suffering from
      age-related macular degeneration performed by two independent examiners of two examinations
      of the same day but performed in a time interval of at least two hours should be evaluated.
      Using the macular thickness program of stratus OCT, 6 radial lines through the center of the
      foveal avascular zone are performed, Differences between the first and second measurement
      will be investigated by a 95% confidence interval, a Bland-Altman plot (with corresponding
      regression analysis) and a random effect model with time, examiner and diagnosis as fixed
      factors. Although threshold algorithm failures and fixation problems are common in
      age-related macular degeneration evidence of reproducibility and repeatability of maximum
      retinal thickness is expected.
