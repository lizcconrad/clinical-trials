      Background: In this proposed study, we aim to investigate safety and efficacy of two
      synthetic retinoids - bexarotene (Targretin; LGD1069;
      4-[1-{5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-2-naphthalenyl} ethenyl] benzoic acid) and
      fenretinide (Dihydroceramide N-(4-Hydroxyphenyl retinamide) on severity of psychopathology
      and cognitive impairment in schizophrenia patients in an double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study. The rationale behind add-on these medications to ongoing antipsychotic treatment in
      schizophrenia patients is based on both the retinoid dysregulation hypothesis: the growth
      factors deficiency and synaptic destabilization hypothesis of schizophrenia. Furthermore, in
      our preliminary open clinical trial, we found that a low dose of bexarotene (Targretin, 75
      mg/day) was safe and led to significant improvement on total PANSS scores, general
      psychopathology, on the positive and the dysphoric mood factor scores. The aim of the present
      study was to provide further insight into the safety and efficacy of bexarotene in comparison
      to fenretinide (a medication with smaller potential of adverse effects) and placebo in
      patients suffered from schizophrenia.

      In this clinical trial, a minimal dose of bexarotene (Targretin, 75 mg/day) or fenretinide 5
      mg/day or placebo will be added for 8 weeks to the stable ongoing antipsychotic treatment of
      90 schizophrenia patients. Participants will be assessed at baseline and after 2, 4 and 8
      weeks of treatment. A battery of research instruments will be used for assessment of efficacy
      and safety (psychopathology, and side effects). In addition, cholesterol and triglyceride
      levels, liver and thyroid function tests and a blood cell count will be monitored at baseline
      and during therapy.
