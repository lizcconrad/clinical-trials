  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uttarbasti is per urethral administration of medicated oil which has been recommended by
      Sushrut for urinary track disorders.

      As far as conventional surgery is concerned urethral stricture still remains a challenge due
      to post procedural high recurrences and complications

      Uttarbasti being almost non invasive, with minimum recurrences and most economical, easy to
      practice OPD procedure, can be the treatment of choice in the management of urethral
      stricture.
