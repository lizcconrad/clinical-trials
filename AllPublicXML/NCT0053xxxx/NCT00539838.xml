  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter,
      parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab compared to placebo
      when combined with a single stable background immunosuppressive medication and a
      corticosteroid regimen in patients with moderately to severely active systemic lupus
      erythematosus, who do not have moderate to severe glomerulonephritis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated prematurely when the decision was made that ocrelizumab was not likely
    to benefit this patient population.
