  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liquid medication administration errors are common, and place children at risk for adverse
      events. Caregivers with low socioeconomic status (SES), low education and poor health
      literacy skills are at increased risk for errors. In this study, we seek to assess whether
      at-risk parents who received a plain language, pictogram-based intervention would have
      reduced medication dosing errors and improved medication adherence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence suggests that errors by parents and caregivers in administering medications to their
      children are frequent. These errors, which include inaccurate dosing as well as nonadherence
      to medication regimens, place children at risk for morbidity and mortality. Misdosing is
      prevalent, with 50% or more of pediatric caregivers either measuring an incorrect dose or
      reporting a dose of liquid medication given outside the recommended range. Of further concern
      are reports of an overall poor adherence rate of 50% for pediatric medications, with
      implications for treatment failure and drug resistance.

      Few studies have examined strategies for decreasing medication administration errors in
      pediatric patients. Pictograms represent a promising approach in which simple diagrams are
      used to improve understanding of concepts. Pictorial-enhanced written materials have been
      shown to improve comprehension and adherence with medical directions, particularly for
      patients with low literacy.

      We developed a pictogram-based intervention to decrease dosing errors and improve adherence.
      In this study, we sought to assess whether this intervention would reduce medication dosing
      errors and improve adherence in a pediatric emergency room serving at-risk families.

    <intervention_name>Pictogram</intervention_name>
    <description>The plain language, pictogram-based medication instruction sheets (available in English and Spanish) utilize pictograms to convey information about the medication name, indication, dose, dose frequency, and length of treatment, along with information about preparation and storage. The sheets also include a medication log for parents to keep track of when they administer the medication.
Research staff reference the sheets as they demonstrate dosing with a standardized dosing instrument; teachback is performed to reinforce concepts. For medications in which a standardized dosing instrument was not included at dispensing, a standardized oral dosing syringe is provided for the caregiver to use at home. After counseling, the caregiver is given the instruction sheet to take home.</description>
