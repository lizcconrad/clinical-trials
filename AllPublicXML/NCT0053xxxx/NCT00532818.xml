  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard for recurrent, persistent or metastatic cervical cancer is palliative
      chemotherapy with cisplatin topotecan, however, the results need to be improved. Epigenetic
      aberrations play an important role in cancer progression by silencing growth regulatory genes
      and there is now evidence that inhibitors of DNA methylation and HDAC inhibition synergize
      the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy.

      Objective. To determine the superiority of epigenetic therapy with hydralazine and valproate
      plus standard cisplatin topotecan against placebo plus cisplatin topotecan upon
      progression-free survival.

      Hypothesis. Hydralazine and magnesium valproate associated to cisplatin topotecan will
      increase progression-free survival from 4.6 to 7.6 months as compared with the same regimen
      of chemotherapy plus placebo.

      Randomized, double-blind phase III trial. A total of 143 patients (alpha 0.5, power 0.8)with
      metastatic, persistent or recurrent cervical cancer without previous systemic treatment will
      be randomized to cisplatin topotecan + placebo or cisplatin topotecan hydralazine valproate
      for 6 courses every 3 weeks. Patients will receive an oral dose of hydralazine of 182mg
      (rapid) or 83mg (slow) according to the acetylator phenotype in a single daily dose and
      magnesium valproate at an oral dose of 40mg/Kg t.i.d. Both drugs in a slow-release
      formulation. Experimental drugs or placebo will start from seven days before day 1 of
      chemotherapy until the end of the sixth course.

             than 2cm in the longest diameter or has no clearly defined borders.

          -  Patients should have no previous systemic treatment (could have received chemotherapy
             as radiosensitization to the pelvis and or para-aortic field.

          -  Aged &gt;18 years, performance status 0-2 according to ECOG classification, and adequate
             liver, hematological and renal function, as defined by: hemoglobin &gt;10 g/L, leukocytes
             &gt;4000/mm3, platelets &gt;100 000mm3; normal creatinine value and creatinine clearance &gt;60
             mL/min; total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 upper normal limit value.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of allergy to hydralazine or valproate; past or present condition of rheumatic
             disease, central nervous system disease, heart failure from aortic stenosis and
             postural hypotension as diagnosed by a physician; newly diagnosed hypertension
             patients with or without pharmacological treatment are allowed as long as their
             treatment do not include hydralazine.

          -  Previous use of the experimental drugs (hydralazine and magnesium valproate) as well
             as if patients were pregnant or breast-feeding. Other exclusion criteria are
