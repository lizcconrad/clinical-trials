  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the way and rate that the study medication, JSM6427
      a potent, highly specific integrin α5β1-antagonist is absorbed, broken-down and eliminated
      from the body when it is given as a single dosage strength by injection into the eye.
      Repeated dosages will also be given to determine the highest safe dose.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In non-clinical models, JSM6427 can lead to the inhibition and regression of choroidal
      neovascularization, making α5β1 an attractive target for therapeutic strategies directed at
      pathological angiogenesis. JSM6427 may also interfere with other key processes in the
      pathogenesis of AMD, namely inflammation and fibrosis. Further, non-clinical data show that
      JSM6427 inhibits scarring and inflammation. Thus, JSM6427 may target multiple important
      pathways in the pathogenesis of neovascular AMD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Best corrected visual acuity in the study eye between 5 and 7 letters inclusive using
             and ETDRS chart (Snellen equivalent of appx. 20/800 to 20/40.

             previous 12 weeks.

          -  Clear ocular media and adequate pupillary dilatation to permit good stereo fundus
             photography for screening.
