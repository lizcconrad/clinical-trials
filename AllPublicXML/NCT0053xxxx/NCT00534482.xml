    <textblock>
      This research project brings together the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)
      National Research Network (AAFP-NRN) and the AAFP's public health initiative, Americans In
      Motion (AIM). This project will develop and evaluate a practice improvement program to
      improve family physicians' delivery of effective patient-centered behavior change
      interventions for &quot;fitness&quot; (physical activity, nutrition and emotional well-being). The
      investigators seek to develop a unique program that positions fitness in a central role as
      &quot;the treatment of choice&quot; when dealing with issues of prevention and treatment of chronic
      conditions. In addition, this newly developed program is intended to help shift the paradigm
      of family physicians' use of common advice-giving methods to more effective patient-centered
      lifestyle counseling. Ultimately, this program will seek to improve care for all patients
      through fitness-related physician interventions.

      Outcomes: This study design will allow the investigators to evaluate whether (and how)
      dissemination of educational materials impacts patient intervention by first engaging
      clinicians and staff in their personal use of these materials. This project will also
      evaluate the effects of the behavioral change tools, as well as, the added impact of new
      physiologic feedback measures (HOMA-IR and NMR Lipoprotein profiles) on physical activity and
      diet in study participants.

      Conclusion: Primary care offices can become more effective settings to help patients improve
      physical activity, diet and emotional well-being. Demonstrating the value and impact of
      creating &quot;healthy offices&quot; that endorse and support clinicians, office staff and patients in
      the use of effective educational materials fits well with the new model of care as part of
      the AAFP's &quot;Future of Family Medicine&quot; initiatives, which emphasize the importance of
      lifestyle decisions and supporting successful changes in behaviors within primary care. This
      project will help define how to accomplish this.

      Study Design: This trial will consist of a two-level randomized controlled trial. The first
      level of randomization will be performed at the practice level in order to study the impact
      of involving both clinicians and office staff in making their own personal changes (i.e.,
      creating the &quot;healthy&quot; office)- a central component of AIM - on the translation of the
      project's educational tools to patients. The second level of randomization will occur at the
      patient level comparing two practice level interventions designed to improve nutrition,
      increase physical activity and improve emotional well-being. Furthermore, the effectiveness
      of the educational tools will be evaluated on self-reported diet, physical activity and
      emotional well-being and established physiologic measures on behavioral change. Both arms of
      the study will receive brief office-based counseling using established tools that have been
      compiled for this project. Practices will be asked to work on incorporating brief nutrition,
      physical activity and emotional well-being messages into routine care - either motivational
      in nature for people not willing to work on lifestyle changes, or goal-oriented for those
      working on changes. Patients in the intervention arm will also receive feedback concerning
      changes in two novel physiologic measures that correlate with improved nutrition and
      increased physical activity.

    <description>Patient receives feedback on two novel indicators of their individual cardiovascular risk that: 1)appear to relate to obesity and lack of physical activity, and 2) may show relatively rapid change with improvements in these areas. These are the Homeostatic Assay - Insulin Resistance or HOMA-IR and Nuclear Molecular Resonance (NMR) lipoprotein profiles (NMRLP). These patients and their physicians also will receive periodic feedback on other outcome measures, including BMI, blood pressure, a 3-minute step test, eating assessment, physical activity assessment, and emotional well-being assessment.</description>
