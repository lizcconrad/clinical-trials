      The objective of the trial was to explore the dose-response relation of Org 25969 given as a
      reversal agent at 3 and 15 minutes following administration of 1.0 and 1.2 mg/kg of Esmeron®
      (rocuronium) in subjects of ASA 1 to 3, and to evaluate the safety of single doses of Org
      25969 administered to subjects of ASA 1 to 3.

      In the US the highest dose recommended in the package insert of Zemuron® (i.e. the trade name
      for Esmeron® in the US) is 1.2 mg/kg whereas in Europe it is 1.0 mg/kg. For both doses, dose
      recommendations for reversal with Org 25969 were to be found. Hence, the present trial was
      set up to explore the dose-response relation of Org 25969 given as a reversal agent at 3 and
      15 minutes following administration of 1.0 and 1.2 mg/kg of Esmeron® in subjects of ASA 1 to
      3. The sub-investigator who performed any subjective safety assessments after anesthesia was
      to be remained blinded.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects of ASA class 1 - 3, above or equal to the age of 18 years;

          -  Subjects scheduled for surgical procedures with an anticipated duration of anesthesia
             of at least 120 minutes, without further need for muscle relaxation other than for
             intubation;

          -  Subjects scheduled for surgical procedures in supine position;

          -  Subjects who had given written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects in whom a difficult intubation because of anatomical malformations was
             expected;

          -  Subjects known or suspected to have neuromuscular disorders impairing neuromuscular
             blocking and/or significant renal dysfunction;

          -  Subjects known or suspected to have a (family) history of malignant hyperthermia;

          -  Subjects known or suspected to have an allergy to narcotics, muscle relaxants or other
             medication used during general anesthesia;

          -  Subjects receiving medication known to interfere with neuromuscular blocking agents,
             such as anticonvulsants and Mg2+;

          -  Subjects who had already participated in CT 19.4.206;

          -  Subjects who had participated in another clinical trial, not pre-approved by NV
             Organon, within 30 days of entering into CT 19.4.206;

          -  Female subjects who were pregnant: in females pregnancy was to be excluded both from
             medical history and by an hCG test within 24 hours before surgery except in females
             who were not of childbearing potential, i.e. at least 2 years menopausal or who had
             undergone tubal ligation or an hysterectomy;

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential not using any of the following methods of
             birth control (for one month): condom or diaphragm with spermicide, vasectomized
             partner (&gt;6 months), IUD, abstinence;

          -  Female subjects who were breast-feeding.
