  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial provides a unique opportunity in that it combines genomic, proteomic and
      pharmacogenomic assessments in patients receiving chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer. To
      date no other trials have analyzed gene and protein expression at the same time points in the
      same patient, combined with clinical outcome. Similar to previous attempts to predict
      response based on expression of a single gene or protein, we expect that neither genomic or
      proteomic profiling alone will be sufficient to optimize therapy. Rather, we expect an
      iterative process that combines information gleaned from both platforms, modified to avoid
      toxicity based on pharmacogenomics.
