  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients treated for methamphetamine dependence have high rates of relapse, and no
      pharmacotherapy has yet been demonstrated to be efficacious. Modafinil (d,
      l-2-[(diphenylmethyl) sulfinyl] acetamide) is a novel wake- and vigilance- promoting agent
      that is chemically and pharmacologically dissimilar to CNS stimulants such as the
      amphetamines, methylphenidate, and pemoline. It is well tolerated and has low abuse liability
      compared to CNS stimulants. Modafinil is FDA approved for a variety of sleep disorders, may
      relieve methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms, improves cognitive function, has been shown to
      reduce cocaine use in dependent users, and is safe when co-administered with intravenous
      methamphetamine. We will conduct a pilot, open-label clinical trial of modafinil to establish
      its safety and efficacy as a pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine dependence.

      Specific Aims:

        1. Determine the safety of modafinil in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence.

        2. Determine the efficacy of modafinil in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence.

        3. Assess the effect of modafinil on cognitive function in methamphetamine users.

        4. Assess the effect of modafinil on methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms.

        5. Compare the validity of a cellular telephone-based reporting system for assessing
           medication regimen adherence to conventional electronic medication monitoring.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Modafinil will be as safe and well tolerated as placebo in a comparison group from
           another study.

        2. Subjects given modafinil will use less methamphetamine than subjects given placebo.

        3. Subjects given modafinil with demonstrate improvements in cognitive function when
           compared to subjects given placebo.

        4. Subjects given modafinil will have reduced withdrawal symptoms when compared to subjects
           given placebo.

        5. Adherence will be recorded more accurately by cellular telephone than by conventional
           electronic medication monitoring.
