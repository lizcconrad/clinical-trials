  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In spite of the use of radiation combined with conventional chemotherapy, the long-term
      survival prognosis for most patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer is
      disappointing. Much effort is currently focussed on exploring new molecular targeted agents
      that may improve upon survival. The addition of an agent that targets blood vessel formation
      in tumors, bevacizumab or Avastin, to conventional chemotherapy has been shown to improve
      survival in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Data from animal studies have shown that
      bevacizumab and related agents also increase tumor cure rates when administered both during
      and after radiotherapy. This suggests that combined bevacizumab and chemo-radiation may
      improve survival in local-advanced disease as well. Before such clinical studies can
      commence, the safety and normal tissue toxicity profile of bevacizumab with thoracic
      radiotherapy must first be established. In this study, escalating doses of bevacizumab will
      be administered during radiotherapy, followed by maintenance bevacizumab.
