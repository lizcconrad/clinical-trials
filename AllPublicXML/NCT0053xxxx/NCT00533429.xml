      The purpose of this study is to determine if Pemetrexed plus Carboplatin plus Bevacizumab
      plus Enzastaurin, followed by maintenance Bevacizumab plus Enzastaurin can extend survival
      time without disease progression in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced stage
      non-small cell lung cancer.
