      Rationale:

      Approximately 25% of breast cancers detected are non palpable. Accordingly, a localization
      technique is required to help the surgeon to find and remove the cancer. The current
      technique (wire guided localization [WGL]) is difficult to perform and has a high rate of
      tumour positive margins in the resected specimen, requiring a second operation. A new
      approach in the localization and resection of non-palpable malignant breast lesions is 'radio
      guided occult lesion localization' (ROLL). ROLL was introduced as a possible replacement for
      WGL at the `European Institute of Oncology' in Milan in 1996. This technique utilizes the
      intratumourally injected radiotracer, that is generally used for the lymphatic mapping and
      SNB, to localize the primary tumour guided by the gamma probe. Five studies so far have
      proven the applicability of this method.

      Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of Radio Occult Lesion Localisation (ROLL) versus Wire guided
      Localisation (WGL) in breast conserving surgery for non-palpable breast cancer

      Study design:

      A multicenter, prospective randomized clinical trial. Patients with proven non-palpable
      breast cancer will be randomized for either ROLL or WGL.

      Study population:

      316 women with a core biopsy proven non palpable cT1 breast carcinoma that are eligible for a
      breast conserving treatment and sentinel node biopsy (SNB).

      Intervention (if applicable):

      Patients in the WGL group will undergo intra tumoural injection of a nuclear radiotracer
      under stereotactic or ultrasonographic guidance. After scintigraphic imaging, to monitor the
      migration of the radiotracer, a guide wire will be inserted under stereotactic or
      ultrasonographic guidance. The excision of the primary tumour is guided by the inserted wire
      and the sentinel node procedure is performed using a gamma probe and intratumoural injection
      of patent blue.

      Patients in the ROLL group will undergo the same procedure except for the guide wire
      insertion. The excision of the primary tumour is guided by the gamma probe.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Primary study endpoints; ROLL vs WGL:

        1. The percentage of tumour-free margins (invasive and in situ)

        2. The volume and maximum diameter of the lumpectomy

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness:

      There is no pre-, per- or post operative extra burden. The radiofarmacon is already used in
      the standard care of breast cancer patients for the sentinel node biopsy. The used
      radio-active substance does not damage the patient.

      A specific burden questionnaire, aimed at evaluating the burden of the cosmetic result, will
      be administered. To further assess the net impact in terms of Health Related Quality of Life
      (HRQoL) also the EQ5D will be obtained at T = 0, 6, 12 and 26 weeks after the initial
      diagnostic work-up.

      Should the results indicate that overall the WGL procedure lead to better clinical outcome a
      cost-effectiveness analysis is foreseen using bootstrapping to assess the uncertainty with
      regard to the balance between costs and effects. All analyses will be limited to a half year
      time horizon. Accordingly, discounting of costs or effects is not applicable.
