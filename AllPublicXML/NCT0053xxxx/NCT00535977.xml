    <textblock>
      This is a parallel human intervention trial to determine to what extent a dietary
      intervention of broccoli or peas can change the expression (switching on or off) of genes in
      prostate tissue in men diagnosed with high-grade Prostate Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PIN).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is one of the main causes of death among humans in the world. Prostate cancer affects
      20,000 men in the UK alone each year. Diet is known to be a major factor that influences risk
      of cancer. Therefore, changes to the diet may alter cancer risk. Cruciferous vegetables,
      particularly broccoli, provide the diet with a substantial source of plant chemicals called
      glucosinolates. Previous research has indicated that glucosinolates break down to form
      isothiocyanates (ITCs) that can be absorbed in the body. Further research has indicated that
      ITCs may protect the body against the development of prostate cancer. However, the mechanisms
      behind this effect are not fully understood.

      ITCs are thought to be powerful anti cancer agents as they can modulate the expression
      (switching on or off) of specific genes involved in the removal of toxic substances such as
      carcinogens from the body. In this study we wish to evaluate the effect of consumption of a
      conventionally bred cultivar of broccoli containing high levels of ITCs on gene expression in
      prostate tissue to gain a better understanding of its mechanism of action. Several studies
      suggest a further protection against cancer amongst individuals who have a deletion of
      certain genes.

      This pilot study comprises a 12-month intervention of either 400g ITC-enriched broccoli per
      week of 400g garden peas in men at high risk of developing prostate cancer. Changes in gene
      expression of prostate biopsy tissue will be compared before and after 6 and 12 months of
      intervention in both dietary groups.
