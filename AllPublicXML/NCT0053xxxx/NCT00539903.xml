  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is today a growing need for culturally adapted initiatives among immigrants to prevent
      and treat T2D. Others have failed to increase the level of physical activity in this sedate
      group. The investigators believe this is due to missing assistance and lack of influence from
      the Pakistani milieu. To improve this, a culturally adapted physical activity will be
      established in this project in close cooperation with the Pakistanis themselves.

      Through this program it is the investigators' goal to increase their physical activity level
      and prevent lifestyle diseases among Pakistanis in Oslo with a high risk of developing these
      diseases.
