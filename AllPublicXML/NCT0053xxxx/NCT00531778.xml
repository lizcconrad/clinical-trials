  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improving current strategies for detection of early stage disease can impact favorably on
      long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer. To reduce the morbidity and mortality of
      ovarian cancer, screening for this disease must detect early stage disease rather than
      advanced stage disease. Thus the challenge for the future is to identify and develop highly
      sensitive and specific tumor markers that can be applied to population-based screening for
      the early detection of ovarian cancer.

      The aim of NYU Ovarian Cancer Early Detection Program is to establish an effective, early
      detection program employing state-of-the-art science and technology in collaboration with
      other nationally recognized clinicians and scientists.

      This proposed research study will foster collaboration between clinicians and scientists that
      will facilitate the rapid identification of a set of molecular, biochemical, functional, and
      genetic markers which can be employed to effectively detect and manage ovarian cancer and
      other gynecological malignancies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Women enrolled in the NYU Ovarian Cancer Early Detection Program have at least one of the
        following risk factors:

          -  A personal history of breast cancer

          -  One or more first degree relatives (mother, sister, daughter) with ovarian cancer

          -  Multiple family members with either breast and/or ovarian cancer

          -  A personal history of a positive BRCA1 or BRCA2 genetic test result

          -  A close relative with a positive BRCA1 or BRCA2 genetic test result

          -  A personal history of colon or endometrial cancer with at least two relatives with a
             Lynch/HNPCC-associated cancer (colorectal, endometrial, small bowel, ureter, or renal
             pelvis cancer)

          -  Synchronous or metachronous endometrial and colorectal cancer

          -  A personal history of a mismatch repair gene mutation (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2)

          -  A close relative with a mismatch repair gene mutation (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2)

          -  A personal history of colorectal or endometrial cancer with a mismatch repair defect
             (ie. Microsatellite instability (MSI) or immunohistochemical loss of expression of
             MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2)
