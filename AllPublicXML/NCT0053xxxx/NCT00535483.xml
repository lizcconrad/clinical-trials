    <textblock>
      The EU funded project CLINICIP (Closed Loop Insulin Infusion for Critically Ill Patients)
      aims to develop a low-risk monitoring and control device which allows maintaining metabolic
      control in intensive care units. A system will be developed comprising three subsystems: a
      body interface for the delivery of biofluids, biosensors for the determination of glucose
      concentration in these biofluids and an adaptive control algorithm that generates advice and
      thus represents a decision support system with respect to insulin infusion rate to establish
      glycaemic control in critically ill patients. Within a closed loop system, intensified
      insulin treatment will make use of the calculations leading to external regulation of
      glucose.

      It is the aim of this study to evaluate the feasibility to establish glycaemic control in
      type 1 diabetic subjects over a period of 30 hours by manually combining these three -
      previously tested - subsystems (ABS System, extracorporeal online glucose sensor and a
      laptop-based computer algorithm).
