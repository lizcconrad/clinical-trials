  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Maximum Heart Rate Increase During Exercise in Part 1 of the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>24-hours post-dose on Day 1 (of each treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of patients with an increase of more than 10 beats per minute (bpm) in their heart rate following treatment with indacaterol and salmeterol compared to treatment with placebo was determined.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Maximum Heart Rate Increase During Salbutamol Administration in Part 2 of the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours post dose on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of patients with an increase of &gt;= 10 beats per minute (bpm) in their heart rate (HR) following treatment with indacaterol and salmeterol compared to treatment with placebo over 24 hours in Part 2 was determined.
0-12 hours: post first dose measurements up to second dose
12-24 hours: post second dose measurement up to and including the 24 hour measurement
0-24 hours: all post dose measurements up to and including the 24 hour measurement</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Heart Rate During Exercise in Part 1</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hour post-dose on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum heart rate was generally taken from the continuous ECG monitoring. Analysis based on mixed effects analysis using model with treatment and period as fixed effects and subject as random effect.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Heart Rate (HR) During Salbutamol Administration in Part 2</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours post dose on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum HR (0-12 hours): maximum (max) of post dose measurement up to second administration. Maximum HR (12-24 hours): max of the post second administration of salbutamol measurements. Maximum HR (0-24 hours): max of all post dose measurements up to and including the 24 hour measurement. Mixed effects analysis model used period baseline HR as the covariate. The maximum HR for 0-24 hours (h) is the maximum of the maximum HR for the two 12h periods and thus the average (LS means) of the maximum HRs for 0-24h will be equal to or greater than the average of the maximum for the two periods.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Heart Rate During Exercise in Part 1</measure>
    <time_frame>1.5 hour post dose to max heart rate during exercise</time_frame>
    <description>Change in heart rate is calculated from the 1.5 hour post dose to the maximum heart rate during exercise.
Analysis of covariance included treatment and period as fixed effects, subject as random effect and 1.5 hour pre-exercise/post dose heart rate as a covariate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) During Part 1 and Part 2</measure>
    <time_frame>23 hours 30 minutes and 24 hours post-dose at Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 was defined as the mean of the 23 hours 30 minutes and 24 hours post morning dose FEV1 measurements. Analysis of covariance included pre-dose FEV1 as covariate.</description>

Period 2, patients received a morning single inhalational dose of indacaterol 300μg and an evening single inhalation dose of indacaterol matching placebo via the Concept1 inhaler device. Period 3, patients received single inhalation dose of indacaterol matching placebo in morning and evening via Concept1 device. In Part 2 of the study, at 20 minutes following each dose, patients received three doses of nebulized salbutamol 2.5 mg at 20 minute intervals.</description>

        <title>Maximum Heart Rate (HR) During Salbutamol Administration in Part 2</title>
        <description>Maximum HR (0-12 hours): maximum (max) of post dose measurement up to second administration. Maximum HR (12-24 hours): max of the post second administration of salbutamol measurements. Maximum HR (0-24 hours): max of all post dose measurements up to and including the 24 hour measurement. Mixed effects analysis model used period baseline HR as the covariate. The maximum HR for 0-24 hours (h) is the maximum of the maximum HR for the two 12h periods and thus the average (LS means) of the maximum HRs for 0-24h will be equal to or greater than the average of the maximum for the two periods.</description>
