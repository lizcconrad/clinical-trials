  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Participants With Response to Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who had at least 50% reduction in 28-day seizure rate from baseline to the end of the maintenance phase were considered as responders. The 28-day seizure rate was calculated as number of partial seizures in the period divided by difference of number of days in the period and number of missing diary day entries in the period, multiplied by 28.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in 28 Day Seizure Frequency at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The seizures were recorded by the participants, by a family member, by a caregiver, or by a legal guardian and documented in a daily seizure diary. Participant's 28-day seizure frequency of all partial seizure was assessed during double blind (TP + MP) phase compared with baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Proportion of 28-day Secondarily Generalized Tonic-clonic (SGTC) Seizure Rate to 28-day All Partial Seizure Rate at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Change was calculated as (proportion of SGTC seizure rate divided by all partial seizure rates during double blind phase) minus (proportion of SGTC seizure rate divided by all partial seizure rates at baseline). Negative values indicated reductions in seizures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Without Seizures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Seizure free for 28 days was defined as participants who have not experienced any seizure (simple partial, complex partial and SGTC) for at least 28 consecutive days from their last seizure until the end of the maintenance phase. Same participant could be seizure free for a specific type of seizure but not necessarily for the other types of seizure.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale - Anchored (BPRS-A) Total and Core Score at Week 7, 10, 13, 16 and Follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 7, 10, 13, 16 and Follow-up (Day 7 of taper phase)</time_frame>
    <description>BPRS-A:18-item clinician rated scale assesses somatic concern,anxiety, emotional withdrawal,conceptual disorganization,hallucinatory behavior(HB), guilt feelings,suspiciousness,disorientation,tension,mannerisms and posturing,grandiosity,depressive mood,hostility,motor retardation,uncooperativeness,unusual thought content,blunted affect,excitement. Items rated on 7-point scale 1 (not reported) to 7 (very severe). Total score=sum of items(range 18-126), core score=sum of conceptual disorganization, suspiciousness, HB, unusual thought content(range 4-28). Higher total/core score=more impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>HADS: participant rated questionnaire with 2 subscales. HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks); HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). Each subscale comprised of 7 items with range 0 (no presence of anxiety or depression) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety or depression). Total score 0 to 21 for each subscale; higher score indicates greater severity of anxiety and depression symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS-SS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Participant-rated 12-item questionnaire to assess constructs of sleep over past week; 7 subscales:sleep disturbance,snoring,awakened short of breath,sleep adequacy,somnolence (range:0-100);sleep quantity (range:0-24),optimal sleep(yes/no), and 9 item index measures of sleep disturbance provide composite scores:sleep problem summary,overall sleep problem. Except adequacy,optimal sleep and quantity, higher scores=more impairment. Scores transformed (actual raw score[RS] minus lowest possible score divided by possible RS range*100);total score range:0-100;higher score=more intensity of attribute.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Optimal Sleep Assessed Using Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep Scale (MOS-SS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>MOS-SS: participant-rated 12 item questionnaire to assess constructs of sleep over past week. It included 7 subscales: sleep disturbance, snoring, awakened short of breath, sleep adequacy, somnolence, sleep quantity and optimal sleep. Participants responded whether their sleep was optimal or not by choosing yes or no. Percentage of participants with optimal sleep are reported.</description>

          <description>Pregabalin 75 milligram (mg) capsule orally twice daily (BID) for 1 Week followed by pregabalin 150 mg orally BID up to Week 4 in the titration phase (TP). If seizure control was inadequate (adequate: at least [&gt;=] 50% reduction in seizures), pregabalin dose was escalated to 225 mg orally BID for Week 2 through Week 4. Participants who had adequate seizure control with pregabalin 150 mg or 225 mg orally BID dose in TP, continued same dose during the 12-week maintenance phase(MP). Participants who had inadequate seizure control, received pregabalin 300 mg orally BID during MP. Participants also received placebo matched to levetiracetam capsule orally BID along with pregabalin during TP and MP. After MP, participants were allowed to progress into optional (opt) blinded continuation phase, and remained on dose from MP for a maximum of 2 years or until last participant either completed or discontinued from MP. Participants underwent an end-of-study medication taper over a 1-week period.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Without Seizures</title>
        <description>Seizure free for 28 days was defined as participants who have not experienced any seizure (simple partial, complex partial and SGTC) for at least 28 consecutive days from their last seizure until the end of the maintenance phase. Same participant could be seizure free for a specific type of seizure but not necessarily for the other types of seizure.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 16</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included all randomized participants who had received at least 1 blinded dose of study drug and had at least 1 baseline and post baseline primary efficacy evaluation. N (number of participants analyzed)=participants who were evaluable for this measure.</population>

            <description>Pregabalin 75 mg capsule orally BID for 1 Week followed by pregabalin 150 mg orally BID up to Week 4 in the TP. If seizure control was inadequate (adequate: &gt;=50% reduction in seizures), the pregabalin dose was escalated to 225 mg orally BID for Week 2 through 4. Participants who had adequate seizure control with pregabalin 150 mg or 225 mg orally BID dose in TP, continued same dose during the 12-week MP. Participants who had inadequate seizure control, received pregabalin 300 mg orally BID during the MP. Participants also received placebo matched to levetiracetam capsule orally BID along with pregabalin during the TP and the MP. After the MP, participants were allowed to progress into the opt blinded continuation phase, and remained on dose from the MP for a maximum of 2 years or until the last participant either completed or discontinued from MP. Participants underwent an end-of-study medication taper over a 1-week period.</description>

        <description>HADS: participant rated questionnaire with 2 subscales. HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks); HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). Each subscale comprised of 7 items with range 0 (no presence of anxiety or depression) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety or depression). Total score 0 to 21 for each subscale; higher score indicates greater severity of anxiety and depression symptoms.</description>

If seizure control was inadequate (adequate: &gt;=50% reduction in seizures), the pregabalin dose was escalated to 225 mg orally BID for Week 2 through 4. Participants who had adequate seizure control with pregabalin 150 mg or 225 mg orally BID dose in TP, continued same dose during the 12-week MP. Participants who had inadequate seizure control, received pregabalin 300 mg orally BID during the MP. Participants also received placebo matched to levetiracetam capsule orally BID along with pregabalin during the TP and the MP. After the MP, participants were allowed to progress into the opt blinded continuation phase, and remained on dose from the MP for a maximum of 2 years or until the last participant either completed or discontinued from MP.

        <description>MOS-SS: participant-rated 12 item questionnaire to assess constructs of sleep over past week. It included 7 subscales: sleep disturbance, snoring, awakened short of breath, sleep adequacy, somnolence, sleep quantity and optimal sleep. Participants responded whether their sleep was optimal or not by choosing yes or no. Percentage of participants with optimal sleep are reported.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included all randomized participants who had received at least 1 blinded dose of study drug and had at least 1 baseline and post baseline primary efficacy evaluation. N (number of participants analyzed)=participants who were evaluable for this measure. n=number of participants evaluable at specific time points for each arm group, respectively.</population>
