  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Zinc deficiency is common in Africa. It has been shown in Asia that zinc as
      treatment for diarrhea can shorten the course of episodes of diarrhea, as well as prevent
      future episodes. The use of zinc at home to treat diarrhea in an African setting, where
      malaria, HIV and malnutrition are common, has not been well-studied.

      Objective. To evaluate if zinc treatment for diarrhea given at home in Kenyan children will
      decrease the community prevalence of diarrhea more than zinc given only in the clinic Work
      planned. We propose to do a community-randomized intervention study of 10 days of dispersible
      zinc tablets given in the home, in addition to ORS, to treat diarrhea in children under-5
      years of age living in a rural part of Bondo District. The comparison group will be children
      who receive zinc and ORS in the clinic only. The primary outcome will be a comparison of the
      prevalence of diarrhea in home zinc versus nonhome zinc villages. Secondary outcomes will be
      the incidence of repeat episodes of diarrhea, the duration of diarrheal illness, the
      prevalence of acute respiratory infection, and the effect of malaria infection on treatment
      with zinc. Thirty-three villages (approximately 1300 children) will be enrolled and children
      will be followed for 1 year.

      Significance of results. If this study shows zinc given at home to be effective, this might
      be considered by the Kenyan MOH as an essential component of the treatment of diarrhea in
      children at the community level.

    <description>Mothers recieve a blister pack of zinc tablets in home every two months for use when child in home under 5 years has diarrhea. ORS satchets also given. Instructions on when and how to use zinc and ORS and when to take child in clinic are given by community health worker. Zinc will also be given in clinic if child visits clinic with diarrhea and has not yet started zinc at home.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All children 2 to 59 months of age in households within 33 selected villages

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children under 2 months of age will not be eligible for enrollment, until they reach 2
             months of age as the role of zinc has not been well-studied in neonates. Children of
             parents who do not give written informed consent for their participation will not be
             enrolled.
