    <textblock>
      The Rural African American Families Health (RAAFH) Project is a federally funded research
      study designed to evaluate the effectiveness two prevention programs designed for rural
      African American families. One program, FUEL, helps teens develop lifestyles that prevent
      health problems such as heart disease, diabetes, and being overweight. This program deals
      with diet and exercise, the influence of TV and magazines on eating habits, and handling
      stress. The second program, the Strong African American Families Teen Program (SAAF-T), helps
      teens learn how to develop plans for the future and to avoid drug use and unsafe sex. The
      sessions deal with goal setting, peer pressure, and staying in school.
