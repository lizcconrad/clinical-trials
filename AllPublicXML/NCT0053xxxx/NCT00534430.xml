      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor stem cell transplant
      or a donor bone marrow transplant helps stop the growth of cancer and abnormal cells and
      helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the
      healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone
      marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the
      transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells.
      Giving mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine before and after transplant may stop this from
      happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and best way to give busulfan
      together with etoposide and total-body irradiation and to see how well they work in treating
      patients who are undergoing a donor stem cell or bone marrow transplant for advanced
      hematologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the efficacy of a preparative regimen comprising dose targeted busulfan,
           etoposide, and fractionated total-body irradiation followed by allogeneic hematopoietic
           stem cell or bone marrow transplantation in patients with advanced hematologic
           malignancies.

        -  To determine the efficacy of this regimen in patients with acute myeloid leukemia in
           first remission with unfavorable cytogenetics.

        -  To evaluate the early and late toxicities of this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Preparative chemotherapy regimen: Patients receive busulfan IV over 2 hours once every 6
           hours on days -14 to -8 for a total of 16 doses and etoposide IV on day -3.* NOTE:
           *Patients also receive oral or IV dilantin 1-3 times daily on days -18 to -5 for
           prophylaxis of grand mal seizures.

        -  Fractionated total-body irradiation (FTBI): Patients undergo FTBI on days -7 to -4 for a
           total of 10 fractions.

        -  Allogeneic transplantation: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell
           transplantation or bone marrow transplantation on day 0.

        -  Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV or orally
           on days -1 to 50 followed by a taper to day 180 in the absence of GVHD. Patients also
           receive mycophenolate mofetil orally or IV over 2 hours twice daily on days 0-27,
           followed by a taper until day 56.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed annually for 2 years.
