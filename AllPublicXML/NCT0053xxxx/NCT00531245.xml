  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capecitabine and oxaliplatin(XELOX) is active first-line therapy for patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer. Phase II study of TS-1, a novel oral fluoropyrimidine derivative, showed
      activity in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Preclinical data of TS-1 with
      oxaliplatin showed synergistic activity in vivo human colorectal cancer xenograft. There is
      no data about the optimal dose of TS-1 with 2 weeks schedule combined with oxaliplatin.
      Therefore in a phase I study, we would like to determine the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) of
      TS-1 and oxaliplatin and define the recommended dose for subsequent phase II study. And then,
      in a phase II study we would like to evaluate the efficacy(response rates) and toxicities of
      the new combination regimen in advanced colorectal cancer.

      Subjects meeting all of the following criteria will be considered for enrolment into the
      study.

        1. Histologically documented colorectal adenocarcinoma

        2. Previous chemotherapy up to two regimens(including adjuvant chemotherapy and first-line
           chemotherapy without oxaliplatin) is allowed in phase I portion; patients are required
           to have discontinued chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for at least 4weeks before entry
           into phase I portion. No prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy allowed(adjuvant
           chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy would be allowed) in phase II portion

        3. Age 18 to 75 years old

        4. At least one unidimensional measurable lesion with a diameter &gt;20 mm using conventional
           CT or MRI scans or &gt;10 mm using spiral CT scans (use of spiral CT must be documented in
           medical records and used consistently throughout study).

        5. In phase I study, prior radiotherapy is permitted if it was not administered to target
           lesions selected for this study, unless progression of the selected target lesions
           within the radiation portal is documented, and provided it has been completed at least 4
           weeks before study entry.

        6. Performance status (ECOG scale): 0-2

        7. Patients can take food and drugs orally

        8. Adequate organ functions

        9. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months

       10. Written informed consent
