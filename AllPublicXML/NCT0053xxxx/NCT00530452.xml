  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3 loading and
      maintenance dose levels of CG100649 administered for 21 days in the treatment of
      osteoarthritis pain.

      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects will discontinue current
      medications 5-14 days prior to randomization. Paracetamol (acetaminophen; ≤2 gm/day) may be
      used for breakthrough pain. Other NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, opioids, and corticosteroids may
      not be used at any time during this study. Only subjects recording average DPI of 4 to 8 on a
      0-10 numerical rating scale for at least 3 days, and no greater than 9 for more than 1 day,
      during the last 5 days of the washout period and meeting all other inclusion criteria will be
      randomized into the study.

      Subjects meeting screening criteria will be randomized to receive 21 days dosing of an active
      dose of CG100649 or placebo.

      Antiarthritic efficacy will be evaluated by changes in the Western Ontario and McMaster
      Universities (WOMAC) OA index completed on Day 0 (Baseline) and on Days 7, 14, 21, 28, and
      35. DPI and functional interference (BPI scales) will be evaluated by subject diary during
      the screening period and on all study days through Day 35. Pain Relief will be evaluated on
      Days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35.
