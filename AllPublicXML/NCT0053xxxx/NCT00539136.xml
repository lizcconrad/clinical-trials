             study).

          -  Normal electrocardiogram (subjects must have no clinically significant abnormalities

        Exclusion Criteria:

             of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the physician responsible,

             elevated with a repeat LFT (to be discussed with the sponsor, if necessary).

          -  Any other clinically significant laboratory abnormality.

          -  The subject has a screening ECG with values outside ranges specified in protocol.

          -  Radiation exposure, including that from the present study, exceeding a cumulative
             total effective dose equivalent of 10mSv over the last 3 years. Radiation exposure
             from previous clinical trials will be included, but clinical (therapeutic or
             diagnostic) radiation exposures will not be included.

          -  Radiation exposure from clinical trials, including that from present study, and from
             diagnostic X-rays, but excluding background radiation, exceeding a target organ
             (colon) dose of 50mSv (5 rems) from a single dose within the last 30 days or a
             cumulative dose of 150mSv (15 rems) in the last twelve (12) months. No subject whose
             occupation requires monitoring for radiation exposure will be enrolled in the study.
