  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to look at whether changing directly from one medication for HIV
      (efavirenz) to a new medication for HIV (TMC125) has any effect on the levels of TMC125 in
      the blood, compared to when TMC125 is taken without efavirenz having been taken immediately
      beforehand.

      The study aims to help the investigators understand whether it is safe to change directly
      from efavirenz to TMC125 (with no gap between the treatments) in patients who need these
      treatments.

      The study will investigate the blood levels of TMC125 when it is taken both once and twice a
      day.

      Pharmacokinetic parameters of TMC125 will be evaluated when TMC125 is given without and with
      a 14-day efavirenz intake preceding period in order to evaluate the risk of achieving sub
      therapeutic concentrations of TMC125 when switching straight from efavirenz containing
      regimens

      Safety and tolerability of medications will also be assessed by questions, physical
      examination and laboratory parameters. These will be performed at regular intervals during
      the drug study.
