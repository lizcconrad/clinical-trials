      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of preoperative smoking cessation on
      postoperative complications among patients undergoing surgery. Secondary aims are to evaluate
      effect on wound complications, short and long term effects including abstinence rate, pain,
      quality of life and effects on the immune system.

      Tobacco smokers suffers from postoperative complications after surgery more extensively than
      non-smokers. Our primary aim is to study if smoking cessation four weeks prior to elective
      surgery decreases the number of postoperative complications. Secondary aims is to analyse if
      smoking cessation four weeks prior to elective surgery decreases wound complications, analyse
      the effect on abstinence rate, effect on postoperative pain, quality of life and if smoking
      cessation normalises; the immunological response to surgery.

      The study is randomised, prospective, multicenter-based trial. Daily smokers are randomised
      to 1. Control group (standard care) or 2. smoking cessation. Patients randomised to smoking
      cessation will undergo professional motivational counselling and will receive free nicotine
      substitution. The study will include elective cases that are scheduled for surgery. Cessation
      starts 3-5 weeks prior to surgery. All patients are prospectively followed up for four weeks
      concerning post-operative complications and for one year concerning other outcomes. Outcome
      (complications) is registered by a blind observer.

      Analyses will be performed by intention to treat. The intervention group is compared with the
      control group and an adjustment for possible confounders will be done. There will also be an
      analysis in the subgroups depending on which surgical procedure was performed.Secondary
      analyses will be by protocol
