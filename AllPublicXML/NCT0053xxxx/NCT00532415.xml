      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of triamcinolone acetonide
      suspension when used for visualization of structures in the back of the eye during eye
      surgery.

    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>A video image of the posterior segment structures of the eye was taken before instillation of the test product and after. An independent masked reader evaluated the images and graded the degree of visualization on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 to 4 and anchored at the ends by &quot;Not Visible (0)&quot; and &quot;Clearly Delineated (4).&quot; The mean difference was calculated, and a higher number indicated increased visibility.</description>
