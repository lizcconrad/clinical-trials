    <textblock>
      The OsmohalerTM is a registered device in Australia. It is used to deliver a dry powder a
      commercial preparation of mannitol registered as AridolTM to test if a person has irritable
      airways such as active asthma.

      The overseas regulatory authorities need to know that people of all ages can achieve an
      adequate inspiratory flow through this device during a controlled deep inspiration. Adequate
      flow is generally regarded as greater than 30 litres per minute in children and 60 litres per
      minute in adults. The OsmohalerTM is a device with low resistance and is already in use in
      Australia to deliver mannitol. However there is a need to document inspiratory flows through
      the device during a controlled deep inspiration. The protocol requires subjects to perform a
      controlled deep inspiration from the device on three or five occasions. No substance will be
      inhaled.
