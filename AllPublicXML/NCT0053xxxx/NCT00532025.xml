  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-armed, multicentric, phase II study of Sorafenib treatment
      following surgery for NSCLC.

      The primary hypothesis is to increase the progression-free survival (PFS) of the experimental
      group in comparison to a historical control group. For sample size calculation a 2 year PFS
      of 50% was calculated for the historical control group, and a 2 year PFS of 67% was estimated
      for the intervention group. These estimates are based on the actual PFS and overall survival
      (OS) of a defined population of 120 NSCLC patients treated at a single institution with
      surgery alone or surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, which compares favorably to
      published international results, and the improvement of PFS achieved by 4 cycles of
      cisplatin/vinorelbine-based cytotoxic chemotherapy in published randomized trials.

    <description>Sorafenib will be administered as oral formulation (200 mg tablets) at a dose of 400 mg twice daily starting 28 to 42 days after surgery or surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy. The dose may be adjusted based on individual toxicities following a predetermined dose reduction schedule. Sorafenib therapy will be continued for 48 months, or until disease progression, patient refusal or intolerable toxicity, whichever comes first. Patients in remission after 48 months will be offered continued Sorafenib treatment in a roll-over study.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC pathological stages I, II or
             III A

          -  Patients must have completely resected disease and may not be treated with prior
             chemotherapy. Patients must have fully recovered from surgery prior to initiation of
             study treatment.

          -  Adjuvant radiotherapy for stage III A disease is permitted given that the patient has
             recovered from all radiation-induced toxicities. In those patients, a complete
             restaging will be performed prior to enrolment into the trial.

          -  Patients with completely resected NSCLC stage II or III A, who for medical reasons are
             not eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of a standard regimen of 4 cycles
             cisplatin/vinorelbine

          -  Patients with completely resected NSCLC stage II or III A, who are not willing to
             undergo adjuvant chemotherapy with 4 cycles of cisplatin/ vinorelbine, are also
             eligible.
