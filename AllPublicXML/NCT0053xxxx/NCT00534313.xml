    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine an optimal abatacept dosing regimen for the
      treatment of active arthritis due to psoriatic arthritis in patients who have had a prior
      inadequate response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including methotrexate and
      tumor necrosis factor alpha-blockade compounds.

The SF-36 is a 36-item instrument with physical and mental components and covers quality of life (QoL) domains: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. Responses are used to derive physical and mental component summary scores, ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better QoL. Mean change from baseline=postbaseline value-baseline value; a higher value signifies improvement.</description>

          <description>An ACR 20 responder was a participant who had a reduction of 20% or more from baseline in scores for both tender and swollen joints and had a reduction from baseline of 20% or more in 3 out of the following 5 assessments: participant’s assessment of disease activity, participant’s global assessment of disease activity, investigator’s global assessment of disease activity, participant’s assessment of physical function by HAQ–DI, and Disease Activity Score 28-C reactive protein.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who received at least 1 infusion of study medication in the double-blind (short-term) period. Missing response values were imputed as nonresponders for participants who discontinued early after receiving study medication.</population>

        <description>PCS=physical component score; MCS=mental component score. The Short-form 36 is a 36-item instrument with physical and mental components and covers quality of life (QoL) domains: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. Responses are used to derive physical and mental component summary scores, ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better QoL. Mean change from baseline=postbaseline value-baseline value; a higher value signifies improvement.</description>

          <description>The HAQ-DI assesses a participant's ability to perform the following tasks: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; maintain hygiene; and maintain daily activity over a period by marking their response on a questionnaire. Responses/scores range from: 0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, 3=to unable to do. Higher total score=greater disability.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who received at least 1 infusion of study medication at any time. Missing response values were imputed as nonresponders for participants who discontinued early after receiving study medication.</population>
