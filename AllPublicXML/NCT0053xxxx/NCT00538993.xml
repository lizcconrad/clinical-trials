      This is a randomized controlled study. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of
      the cue sheet as an aid to targeted provider behavioral counseling. All enrolled participants
      are HIV+ adults seen for regular medical care at a site affiliated with the Johns Hopkins
      AIDS Service. After consenting, participants will take an audio-assisted computer interviews
      to collect patient risk assessment data. For participants randomized to the intervention arm,
      the printed output on risk behaviors is then given to the provider along with cues for
      staged-based counseling for use during the same visit. Participants in the control arm take
      the same computerized risk assessment but there are no printed cue sheets. Risk behaviors of
      all participants are assessed at entry, at 6 months, and at 12 months. The main outcome
      measure is change in HIV transmission behaviors at 12 months for those in the intervention
      arm compared to the control arm.
