    <textblock>
      An open-label randomized multicenter clinical study comparing three regimes of
      immunosuppression : (A) tacrolimus and steroids, (B) antithymocyte induction therapy and full
      dose of tacrolimus, (C) antithymocyte induction therapy with mycophenolate mofetil and a
      reduced dose of tacrolimus.

    <description>Tacrolimus started at 0.50 mg/kg b.i.d. starting at D0, by nasogastric tube and then 1 to 2 hours before meals. The dose of tacrolimus will be adjusted as soon as possible to obtain trough concentrations of the product between 10 and 20 µg/L between D0 and 6 months and then between 8 and 15 µg/L after 6 months</description>

    <description>immunoprophylaxis allowing sparing of steroids in maintenance therapy combining induction therapy with 3 injections of antithymocyte globulins (ATG) (1.5 mg/kg/d at D0, D2 and D4) and tacrolimus at usual dosage.
In this group of patients, the first injection of ATG will be infused over a period of at least 6 hours and will be started as soon as vascular anastomosis has been completed. It will be preceded by an injection of 3 mg/kg/d methylprednisolone. The second injection of ATG at D2, post transplantation will also be infused over 6 hours and will be preceded by an injection of 1 mg/kg methylprednisolone, and then subsequently steroids will be excluded from the treatment. The third and last injection at D4 post transplantation will be administered over a 6-hour period but will not be preceded by steroids.
In this study arm, tacrolimus will be administered as in arm (A)</description>

    <intervention_name>ATG+mycophénolate mofétil+tacrolimus</intervention_name>
    <description>immunoprophylaxis allowing sparing of steroids in maintenance therapy combined with mycophenolate mofetil, at an initial dosage of 2 grams a day, and then adjusted to safety and tolerability in such a way so as to maintain PMN ≥ 750/mm3, and platelet counts ≥ 30000/mm3.
In this study arm, the patients will receive the same doses of ATG and steroids (and according to the same methods) as in arm B. Tacrolimus started at 0.05 mg/kg b.i.d. starting at D0 by nasogastric tube and then 1 to 2 hours before meals. In this study arm, the tacrolimus dose will be reduced: targeted trough concentrations will be between 7 and 12 µg/L between D0 and 6 months and then between 3 et 7 µg/L after 6 months.</description>
