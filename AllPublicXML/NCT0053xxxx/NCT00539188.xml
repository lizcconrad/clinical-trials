  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-Injurious Behavior (SIB) is a dangerous and common symptom in Borderline Personality
      Disorder (BPD) patients. Approximately 70% of patients with BPD engage in SIB at some point,
      compared to 17.5% of patients with other personality disorders. While SIB may prompt
      unnecessary psychiatric hospitalizations, it may also cause potential underestimation of the
      lethality of suicidal behavior, thus creating a major and confusing challenge in the practice
      of clinical psychiatry.

      Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) is a collection of therapeutic techniques focused on
      emotional regulation, impulse control, and improving safety in patients with BPD and others
      with marked self-destructive behavioral tendencies. Though DBT has marked ability to reduce
      BPD symptomatology, including SIB, improvement in SIB is limited and dependent on extensive
      therapy and time.

      Furthermore, the literature on the pharmacological treatment of SIB associated with BPD is
      scarce. Animal studies suggest that SIB may be associated with an imbalance between dopamine
      and glutamate in the brain. Anti-seizure medications that modulate glutamate transmission,
      such as lamotrigine and topiramate, have been suggested to be effective in the treatment of
      SIB in humans.

      Preliminary evidence suggests that antiglutamatergic medications may decrease SIB in patients
      with BPD. Early studies have focused on the antiglutamatergic drug riluzole. More recently,
      we have become interested in the amino acid N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which is used clinically
      for its antioxidant properties and is widely available as a nutritional supplement. Recent
      animal studies have suggested that NAC can modulate glutamate in the central nervous system
      in a way very similar to that proposed for riluzole, and indeed we have observed NAC to have
      an effect similar to riluzole in a case of treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive
      disorder.

      This study will be a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled evaluation of
      N-Acetylcysteine as an adjunct to DBT in the treatment of SIB associated with BPD. Subjects
      participating in this study will be recruited exclusively from the Dialectical Behavioral
      Therapy program of the Yale-New Haven Hospital, in order to maximize homogeneity of the
      psychotherapeutic care received during their participation.

      Investigators have withdrawn study due to poor subject compliance. After 3 consecutive
      participants were either unable to complete all 6 weeks of the study or dropped out of the
      DBT program, a decision was reached to discontinue recruitment and study was terminated.

    <measure>Self-Harm Inventory (SHI) Score at 6 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Harm Inventory is assessed by asking an individual to answer (yes or no) if they have ever &quot;intentionally, or on purpose&quot; tried to harm themselves. The inventory contains 22 questions and a 23rd marked &quot;other&quot; that allows the individual to indicate a self-harm behavior not previously mentioned.
The scoring of this instrument is determined by counting the number of endorsed self-harm behaviors out of the possible twenty-three asked. The maximum score any individual may achieve for the SHI is a 23. Any individual scoring 5 or greater is classified as suffering from BPD.
In this study, scoring on the SHI was primarily used to assess improvement of self-harming symptoms and throughout the study by comparing participant ratings from baseline and week 6. Positive numbers indicate a decrease (i.e. participant indicated less self-harming behavior) and negative numbers indicate an increase in self-harming behaviors reported.</description>

    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) at 6 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression is a multiple item questionnaire used to provide an indication of depression, and as a guide to evaluate recovery. Administered by a clinician, The questionnaire is designed for adults and is used to rate the severity of the patients depression by asking their mood, feelings of guilt, insomnia, agitation, weight change, suicidal ideation, and somatic symptoms. The scale also allows the clinician to assess the patient's level of retardation, and insight into their depression. Highest possible score is 52.
HAM-D Scoring 0-7 = Normal 8-13 = Mild Depression 14-18 = Moderate Depression 19-22 = Severed Depression
≥23 = Very Severe Depression
In this study, Baseline ratings were compared to those of week 6 to assess each participants change in depression throughout the study. A negative value indicates an increase in depression (i.e. the individual felt more depressed) and a positive value indicates a decrease in depression.</description>

        <title>Self-Harm Inventory (SHI) Score at 6 Weeks</title>
        <description>The Self-Harm Inventory is assessed by asking an individual to answer (yes or no) if they have ever “intentionally, or on purpose” tried to harm themselves. The inventory contains 22 questions and a 23rd marked &quot;other&quot; that allows the individual to indicate a self-harm behavior not previously mentioned.
The scoring of this instrument is determined by counting the number of endorsed self-harm behaviors out of the possible twenty-three asked. The maximum score any individual may achieve for the SHI is a 23. Any individual scoring 5 or greater is classified as suffering from BPD.
In this study, scoring on the SHI was primarily used to assess improvement of self-harming symptoms and throughout the study by comparing participant ratings from baseline and week 6. Positive numbers indicate a decrease (i.e. participant indicated less self-harming behavior) and negative numbers indicate an increase in self-harming behaviors reported.</description>

        <title>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) at 6 Weeks</title>
        <description>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression is a multiple item questionnaire used to provide an indication of depression, and as a guide to evaluate recovery. Administered by a clinician, The questionnaire is designed for adults and is used to rate the severity of the patients depression by asking their mood, feelings of guilt, insomnia, agitation, weight change, suicidal ideation, and somatic symptoms. The scale also allows the clinician to assess the patient’s level of retardation, and insight into their depression. Highest possible score is 52.
HAM-D Scoring 0-7 = Normal 8-13 = Mild Depression 14-18 = Moderate Depression 19-22 = Severed Depression
≥23 = Very Severe Depression
In this study, Baseline ratings were compared to those of week 6 to assess each participants change in depression throughout the study. A negative value indicates an increase in depression (i.e. the individual felt more depressed) and a positive value indicates a decrease in depression.</description>
