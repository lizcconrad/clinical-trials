  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the long term effects of two types of hormonal
      treatment for advanced prostate cancer (LHRH agonists and the antiandrogen bicalutamide)on
      the bone mineral density of patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Androgen ablation is the mainstay of treatment for advanced prostate cancer.
      However,luteinizing hormone-releasing (LHRH) agonists are associated with accelerated bone
      loss, osteoporosis and fractures. An alternative is the non steroidal antiandrogen,
      bicalutamide, which acts at the androgen receptor and maintains serum testosterone levels.
      Our aim was to assess the effects of these two treatments on bone mineral density (BMD) of
      selected groups of patients, based on their BMD at presentation. All patients will undergo
      peripheral bone densitometry of the forearm, using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.
      Osteoporotic patients, at high risk of fractures, will be commenced on bicalutamide.
      Osteopenic and normal BMD patients will be commenced on LHRH agonists. All osteopenic and
      osteoporotic patients will be given calcium and vitamin D supplementation.Patients will
      undergo annual bone densitometry scans, and will be seen in the clinic every 3 months to
      monitor well-being and PSA levels. Any patient who fails to respond or escapes treatment with
      hormone monotherapy will be managed according to the clinical situation by either being
      switched to a combination of LHRH and bicalutamide or additional oestrogen therapy.
