  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial is to determine the relationship within a participant between the
      time to manual detection of the reappearance of the fourth twitch (T4) measured using a
      peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS) and the time to recovery of the fourth twitch/first twitch
      (T4/T1) ratio to 0.9 measured using a Train Of Four (TOF)-Watch® SX, of 4.0 mg/kg sugammadex
      administered at 15 minutes after either a bolus dose of 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium or the last
      maintenance dose of 0.15 mg/kg rocuronium.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TOF-Watch® SX has been used for neuromuscular monitoring in all

      clinical trials with sugammadex. In clinical practice however, a PNS is commonly

      used in many hospitals worldwide. A disadvantage of a PNS is that it is not objective
      monitoring like the TOF-Watch® SX, and it can detect only the number of twitches. In this
      trial, the relationship between the time to reappearance of T4 using PNS (i.e. Ministim®
      model MS-IV) and the time to recovery of the T4/T1 ratio to 0.9 using the TOF-Watch® SX was
      determined after a dose of 4.0 mg/kg sugammadex was administered 15 minutes after the last
      dose of rocuronium. Determining this relationship will enable the provision of advice on when
      it is safe to extubate participants after administration of 4.0 mg/kg sugammadex for
      reversing neuromuscular block while using a PNS. The time to reappearance of T4 was assessed
      by a blinded PNS-assessor. This assessor was blinded for the dose of sugammadex used and for
      the TOF results measured with the TOF-Watch® SX.

    <description>Neuromuscular function was monitored by applying repetitive TOF electrical stimulations with the TOF-Watch® SX to the ulnar nerve of one forearm every 15 seconds &amp; assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle with the TOF-Watch® SX. T1 and T4 are the magnitudes (heights) of the first and fourth twitches respectively after TOF nerve stimulation, where stimulation was continued until the T4/T1 ratio reached 0.9. A higher T4/T1 ratio indicates a lower degree of neuromuscular blockade, with a value of 1.0 representing full recovery. Only participants treated with 4.0 mg/kg sugammadex are presented, where the TOF-Watch® SX on the dominant forearm n =30, and on the non-dominant forearm n = 31. The 1.0 mg/kg sugammadex group was not evaluated for this outcome measure.</description>

        <title>Time From Start of Administration of 4.0 mg/kg Sugammadex to Recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.9 Measured by a TOF-Watch® SX</title>
        <description>Neuromuscular function was monitored by applying repetitive TOF electrical stimulations with the TOF-Watch® SX to the ulnar nerve of one forearm every 15 seconds &amp; assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle with the TOF-Watch® SX. T1 and T4 are the magnitudes (heights) of the first and fourth twitches respectively after TOF nerve stimulation, where stimulation was continued until the T4/T1 ratio reached 0.9. A higher T4/T1 ratio indicates a lower degree of neuromuscular blockade, with a value of 1.0 representing full recovery. Only participants treated with 4.0 mg/kg sugammadex are presented, where the TOF-Watch® SX on the dominant forearm n =30, and on the non-dominant forearm n = 31. The 1.0 mg/kg sugammadex group was not evaluated for this outcome measure.</description>

        <title>Time From Start of Administration of 1.0 or 4.0 mg/kg Sugammadex to Recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.8 Measured by a TOF-Watch® SX</title>
        <description>Neuromuscular function was monitored by applying repetitive TOF electrical stimulations with the TOF-Watch® SX to the ulnar nerve of one forearm every 15 seconds &amp; assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle with the TOF-Watch® SX. T1 and T4 are the magnitudes (heights) of the first and fourth twitches respectively after TOF nerve stimulation, where stimulation was continued until the T4/T1 ratio reached 0.8. A higher T4/T1 ratio indicates a lower degree of neuromuscular blockade, with a value of 1.0 representing full recovery. For participants treated with 1.0 mg/kg sugammadex the TOF-Watch® SX on the dominant forearm n =15, and on the non-dominant forearm n = 14. For participants treated with 4.0 mg/kg sugammadex the TOF-Watch® SX on the dominant forearm n =30, and on the non-dominant forearm n = 31.</description>
