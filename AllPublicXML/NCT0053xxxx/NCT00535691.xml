  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the systemic exposure to tacrolimus in infants with
      atopic dermatitis after repeated application of tacrolimus ointment. Efficacy of tacrolimus
      ointment, evaluated by examination of treated areas, will also be measured.

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, double-blind, randomised phase II pharmacokinetic study in infants (3
      - 24 months old) suffering from atopic dermatitis and requiring treatment with mid potency
      topical steroids. Patients will primarily be stratified into three groups according to
      percentage body surface area to be treated and subsequently randomised into treatment groups
      of once a day (UID) or twice a day (BID) tacrolimus ointment (0.03%) regimens. There will
      ultimately be a total of six groups. The study will be conducted on an out-patient basis,
      with each patient's parent/legal representative administering the ointment at home. However
      all medications on days 1 and 14 will be applied in the clinic by the Investigator or his/her
      designee, as will the morning application on day 4. The ointment application period will be
      two weeks with a follow-up period of four days. All patients enrolled into the study, who
      applied at least one dose of study medication and who benefited from treatment will be given
      the opportunity to enter a long-term study to follow (FG-506-06-33).

      The patient will be entered into one of the following three groups:

      Stratification Group I Application area of 5 - 20% Stratification Group II Application area
      of &gt; 20 - 40% Stratification Group III Application area of &gt; 40%

      Within these groups the patients will be randomised to either UID or BID.
