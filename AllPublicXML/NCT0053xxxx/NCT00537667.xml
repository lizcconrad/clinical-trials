  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare IL-1ra and the combination of IL-1ra and PEGsTNF-RI
      with respect to their ability to reduce inflammation and bone and cartilage destruction in
      the synovium of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis.

             (Appendix C)

             source documentation

          -  Disease duration &lt; 10 years

          -  Active RA at baseline as defined by a minimum of 6 or more swollen joints and 9 or
             more tender/painful joints (based on a 66/68-joint count excluding distal
             interphalangeal joints) at screening and baseline,

        And

          -  C-reactive protein (CRP) &gt; 2 mg/dL at screening.

          -  Have active clinical synovitis in the knee as determined by the investigator based on
             clinical evaluation

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Men or non-pregnant (negative serum HCG at screening unless surgically sterile or
             postmenopausal), non-breast-feeding women may be enrolled. Females of childbearing
             potential and males must use adequate contraceptive precautions as determined by the
             principal investigator.

          -  Subjects that have taken any DMARD for less than 3 months must not have taken DMARDs
             within 4 weeks prior to screening. Subjects that have taken any DMARD for longer than
             3 months must not have taken DMARDs within 6 months of screening.

          -  Subject's doses of NSAIDs and oral corticosteroids (10 mg/day of prednisone or
             equivalent) must have been kept stable for 4 weeks before screening

          -  Subjects must not have had intrarticular injections in the joint that will be
             arthroscoped for at least 3 months prior to screening.

        Before any study specific procedure or screening is done, the subject or legally acceptable
        representative must give informed consent for participation in the study (see Section
        12.2). Before buccal smears and blood samples are taken for genetic testing, the subject or
        legally acceptable representative must give informed consent for use of those samples for
        genetic testing (see Section 12.2).
