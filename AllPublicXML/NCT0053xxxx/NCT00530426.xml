  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry is to compile a large clinical database on the medical
      management of patients hospitalized with acute heart failure, using information collected
      from acute care hospitals across the United States.

    <textblock>
      ADHERE is a phase IV, multicenter, observational, open-label registry of the management of
      patients treated in the hospital for acute heart failure (HF) in the United States. The
      target population consists of patients admitted to an acute care hospital who are treated
      actively for acute heart failure, where acute HF is defined as new-onset HF with
      decompensation; or chronic HF with decompensation. Patient eligibility is based upon the
      presence of an acute HF diagnosis and is not tied to the use of any specific therapeutic
      agent or regimen. Collect data on the episode of hospital care beginning with the point of
      initial care in the hospital and/or emergency department and ending with the patient's
      discharge, transfer out of the hospital, or in-hospital death.
