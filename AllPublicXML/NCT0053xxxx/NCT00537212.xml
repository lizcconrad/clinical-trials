  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The association between psoriasis and obesity has been questioned by physicians for many
      years. Studies have shown that the risk of having psoriasis is increased in people with a
      high body mass index, which is a measurement of obesity. There have been case reports of
      remission of psoriasis after gastric bypass surgery. Furthermore, other studies have shown
      that certain inflammatory diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis) can be improved by dietary
      changes. The purpose of this study is to assess whether a low carbohydrate or low fat diet
      can be helpful in the treatment of psoriasis.

      This study involves the use of diet as a therapeutic agent in subjects with obesity and
      psoriasis who are eligible for and willing to undergo phototherapy. Subjects undergoing
      phototherapy alone will be compared to subjects randomized to receive phototherapy and
      dietary modification with the goal of weight loss. The primary objective is to determine the
      success rate of weight loss programs in the setting of psoriasis. Secondary objectives
      include evaluating the effect of weight loss on efficacy of narrow band ultraviolet B
      phototherapy, and assessing the efficacy of lower carbohydrate and low fat diets in psoriatic
      patients.
