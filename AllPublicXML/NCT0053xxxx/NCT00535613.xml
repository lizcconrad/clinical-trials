  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to see if a small dose of propofol given intravenously (through a
      needle into a vein) at the end of anesthesia can make it less likely that children will be
      agitated as the come out of the anesthetic.

    <textblock>
      Emergence agitation is defined as a mental disturbance during the recovery from general
      anesthesia. It consists of confusion, disorientation, delusions, and hallucinations. It
      manifests in children as some combination of restlessness, moaning, inconsolable crying,
      involuntary physical activity, and thrashing about. This puts patients at risk of injuring
      themselves or their caregivers, causing bleeding or disruption of their surgical repair, and
      pulling out IVs and drains. It can be difficult to maintain necessary vital sign monitoring
      in these agitated patients, and constant one-on-one nursing is often required. When emergence
      agitation occurs, all members of the healthcare team, and the parents report dissatisfaction
      with the quality of the child's recovery from anesthesia.

      Propofol is a commonly used intravenous anesthetic agent. Studies have compared continuous
      infusions of intravenous propofol versus inhalational sevoflurane for the maintenance of
      anesthesia. These have shown a significant decrease in the incidence of emergence agitation
      in the patients who received the propofol infusions. This proposed study will investigate the
      effects of a single bolus dose of propofol at the conclusion of a sevoflurane inhalational
      anesthetic.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: 12 months to 6 years old

          -  Planned surgery/procedure: The goal is to enroll patients who will not have pain when
             they awake from anesthesia. We will include patients who are having magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRI) under anesthesia, or an eye exam under anesthesia. We will also include
             those patients who are having a surgery in which a regional or caudal block is part of
             the planned anesthetic. This will be small orthopedic procedures in the lower
             extremities; or urologic or general surgical procedures below the level of the
             umbilicus. These patients have been chosen because the regional/caudal block should
             result in the patient not having pain when they awake from anesthesia.

        (The caudal block is a single epidural injection of local anesthetic that is done when the
        pediatric patient is under general anesthesia. It is a routine procedure that results in
        numbness below the level of the umbilicus, and gives relief of pain, for about 8 hours.)

        Examples of orthopedic surgeries include, but are not limited to:

        Removal of an extra digit or syndactyly repair Club foot releases Lower extremity tendon
        releases or lengthenings Lower extremity tendon transfers Removal of hardware

        Examples of urologic surgeries include, but are not limited to:

        Circumcision or circumcision revision hypospadias repair Chordee repair Orchiopexy
        Orchiectomy

        Examples of general pediatric surgeries include, but are not limited to:

        Inguinal hernia repair Rectal muscle biopsies Excision of lower extremity or lower
        abdominal mass Burn scar releases and skin grafting

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Obstructive sleep apnea—Patients with sleep apnea are not ideal candidates for removal
             of their endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway while still somewhat anesthetized.
             It is preferable to extubate these patients awake.

          -  Developmental delays—Patients with developmental delays may not interact with their
             environment, make eye contact, have purposeful actions, or be aware of their
             surroundings even when at their baseline pre-operatively. It would be difficult to
             evaluate these features of emergence agitation in children who demonstrate this
             behavior on a routine basis.

          -  Psychological disorders—Patients with psychological disorders may have the same issues
             as those with developmental delays when it comes to evaluating their behavior after
             anesthesia.

          -  Egg white allergy—Propofol is contraindicated in patients with egg white allergies due
             to risk of allergy to the propofol lecithin base.
