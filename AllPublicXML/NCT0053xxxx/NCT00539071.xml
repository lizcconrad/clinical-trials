    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at two doses of long-acting injectable risperidone
      (Risperdal Consta). The study will use a usual dose of Risperdal Consta (50 mg given every
      two weeks) or a higher dose (75 mg-100 mg given every two weeks) to see which one is better
      at improving symptoms of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

      This six month double-blind,randomized trial is designed to compare the efficacy of high dose
      long acting risperidone ( 75 mg-100 mg q2 weeks or its equivalent) with standard doses of
      long acting risperidone (≤50 mg/q 2weeks) for Total Psychopathology, positive, negative, and
      depressive symptoms, and cognition in patients who are considered to be poor responders by
      themselves, significant others, or clinicians. This will include two types of inadequately
      responding patients—those who are treatment resistant by research criteria (Kane et al.,
      1988) and those with inadequate response

    <description>All of those who are randomized to the conventional Consta dose will receive it in the form of Consta at a starting dose of 50 mg q 2 weeks (given as two injections - active 50 mg plus placebo injection).As advised by the package insert for Consta, oral risperidone will be given (3-4 mg qd x 3 days followed by 6mg qd up to Week 3 unless symptoms warrant a quicker titration) along with the injections.Any oral risperidone the patients receive will be discontinued after Week 4.At Week 6, psychopathology will be assessed with a PANSS. Dose will remain at 50 mg q 2 weeks for those in the conventional Consta dose group.</description>

    <description>Those who are randomized to high dose Consta will receive Consta 50 mg injection plus 25 mg injection (total dose 75 mg) q 2 weeks as the starting dose after consent. As advised by the package insert for Consta, oral risperidone will be given (3-4 mg qd x 3 days followed by 6mg qd up to Week 4 unless symptoms warrant a quicker titration) along with the injections. Any oral risperidone the patients receive will be discontinued after Week 4.Psychopathology will be assessed with a PANSS at Week 6. If no improvement since baseline, dose will be increased to two 50 mg injections q 2 weeks for the remainder of the study.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be randomized to conventional dose Consta or high dose Consta. All of those who are randomized to the conventional Consta dose will receive it in the form of Consta at a starting dose of 50 mg q 2 weeks. Those who are randomized to high dose Consta will receive a Consta 50 mg injection plus 25 mg injection (total dose 75 mg) q 2 weeks as the starting dose.Oral risperidone will be given up to Week 4 along with the injections for both groups to provide a transition phase.At Week 6, psychopathology will be assessed with a PANSS. If no improvement from baseline is shown, the randomized dose of Consta will be increased to 100 mg q 2 weeks (given as two 50 mg injections ) for those in the high dose Consta group. The dose for those randomized to the conventional dose group will remain the same (50 mg plus placebo).</description>
