  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trauma patients are at high risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary
      embolism (PE). The incidence of DVT varies greatly from 5-63% among studies depending on
      patient's individual risk factors, modality of prophylaxis, and methods of detection. The
      incidence of PE may be as low (0.3-4.3%) but carries a mortality of 20-50% which makes
      prevention of DVT of the utmost importance. The current standard of care for DVT prophylaxis
      in the trauma patient with high risk of DVT is enoxaparin, a low molecular weight heparin,
      administered twice a day as long as anticoagulation in not contraindicated. Many studies have
      demonstrated its efficacy when compared to mechanical compression and to unfractionated
      heparin, however one of the most robust of these studies still reported an DVT incidence of
      35% in patients treated with enoxaparin. Another drug, fondaparinux, is a selective factor Xa
      inhibitor that could offer added benefits over enoxaparin such as once daily dosing and a
      drastically reduced risk of heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Fondaparinux has been
      already be widely used in post-operative hip surgery and major knee surgery patients with
      good results. It has also been shown to be effective in DVT prophylaxis in patients who have
      had major abdominal surgery and also in acute medical patients. Fondaparinux has yet to be
      used in trauma patients. Trauma patients are a diverse and distinct population given the
      acuity of their injuries and their increased risk of bleeding who at this time still do not
      have a perfect method for DVT prophylaxis. We hypothesize that fondaparinux will be effective
      in decreasing the risk of DVT when used in the trauma patient population. This is a non
      randomized prospective cohort study designed to test the efficacy of fondaparinux in the
      prophylaxis of DVT and PE in trauma patients.

      Patients with trauma admitted to San Francisco General Hospital and qualify for the study
      will be assigned to +fondaparinux and no fondaparinux arms based on guidelines that were
      developed for and are considered the standard of care for the use of low molecular weight
      heparin in the same group of patients for the same indication. These guidelines will separate
      patients at risk for DVT into those that are high risk and very high risk. The primary
      efficacy outcome measures will be DVT and PE. Presence of DVT will be assessed with serial
      color flow duplex ultrasound during the patients in hospital stay at weekly intervals up to 3
      weeks and when the patient has symptoms of DVT. PE will be diagnosed according to clinical
      suspicion by the patients treating physicians and subsequent imaging by CT. We plan on
      enrolling approximately 100 patients in the +fondaparinux and 100 patients in the no
      fondaparinux arm. We will compare both the incidence of DVT and PE in these groups and to the
      incidences in the literature and historical controls. A second aim of the study is to
      evaluate the adverse outcomes such as increased bleeding in patients who receive
      fondaparinux. A third and final aim of the study is to describe the effect of fondaparinux on
      antifactor Xa levels in trauma patients.

    <description>Color-flow duplex venous ultrasonography examinations of upper and lower extremities were performed within 48 hours of injury, and then weekly until discharge or 3 weeks. DVT was defined as any clot occurring in the subclavian, iliac, femoral, or popliteal location. Patients were examined daily for clinical signs and symptoms of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and PE. Small, nonocclusive clots discovered in other locations were observed for progression on sequential ultrasonography examinations.</description>
