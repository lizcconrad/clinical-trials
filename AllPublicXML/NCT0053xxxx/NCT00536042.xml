  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The tetracycline minocycline has, in addition to its anti-infective properties,
      anti-inflammatory properties which may be of use in the treatment of asthma. This study
      evaluates the benefit of minocycline as add-on therapy for adults with asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult asthmatic (ages 18 to 75 years) with a history of moderate to severe persistent asthma
      are given minocycline capsules as add-on therapy for treatment of asthma. Treatment is for
      one year. Dosing begins at 150 mg twice daily and can increase every eight weeks by 50mg BID
      to a maximum of 250 mg twice daily. This is as per patient tolerance as minocycline can cause
      dizziness and stomach upset, as well as effects of liver enzymes.Patients undergo routine
      blood toxicity screens every two months, at which time spirometry is performed Exclusion
      criteria: pregnant women (adequate contraception in mandated) previous history of
      hypersensitivity to tetracyclines, chronic liver disease Outcome measures: improvement in
      FEV1 and other spirometric parameters, decrease in oral steroid requirements, change in total
      serum IgE, improvement in quality of life
