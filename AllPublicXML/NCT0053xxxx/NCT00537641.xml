    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that noninvasive ventilation (NIV) as prescribed in
      current medical practice for use in amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients fails to
      deliver adequate breathing support over a night of use in the patient's home. ALS patients
      who come to the ALS Center for their routine 3 month follow up exam and are currently using
      NIV will be asked to complete questionnaires regarding their quality of sleep, quality of
      life and general level of function, and to undergo a home sleep study, using a safe,
      comfortable and reliable breathing monitoring system during a night of sleep. If the
      questionnaires or the sleep study show failure of the breathing device, the investigators
      will work with the patient to fix the problem and then offer a second study to make sure that
      the changes were helpful. The results of this study may help to develop subsequent studies
      and to improve the guidelines used for care of ALS patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as &quot;Lou Gehrig's Disease&quot;, is a fatal
      disorder that causes breathing failure due to progressive weakness of the muscles of
      breathing. Breathing assist devices known as noninvasive ventilation (NIV) are offered to ALS
      patients when their breathing function worsens. These devices deliver breathing assistance
      via a mask on the nose or nose and mouth, and are thought to be particularly important to be
      used during sleep, when breathing often becomes more shallow and irregular. However, although
      these devices have become the standard of therapy in ALS patients once their lung function
      worsens, it remains unclear how effective these devices actually are when a patient is
      sleeping, partly because of the practical difficulties in applying the device properly and
      keeping it applied throughout the sleep period, and partly because they are most commonly
      prescribed without objective evidence regarding how much breathing support the patient needs
      as the disease progresses and the breathing muscles weaken further.
