      A drug called AV650 (tolperisone HCl) will be given to patients who have spasticity following
      a spinal cord injury. This study has three purposes:

        1. To determine whether AV650 is safe for patients with spinal cord injury;

        2. To assess what the body does with AV650 once it is ingested; and,

        3. To gather some early evidence as to whether AV650 is effective in treating spasticity in
           patients with spinal cord injury.
