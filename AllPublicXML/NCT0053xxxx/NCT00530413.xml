    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of low-dose Phenobarbital on the
      treatment of catamenial epilepsy.

      We propose that since the catamenial seizures are associated with the reduction in levels of
      GABA-enhancing allopregnanolone, short-term replacement with the GABAR-enhancing agent
      Phenobarbital will reduce the incidence of catamenial seizures.
