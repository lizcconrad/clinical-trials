        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult outpatients, either sex, aged 45 years or older.

          -  Patients with a documented history of chronic bronchitis with a basal FEV1 &lt;70% and
             &gt;35% made in the previous 12 months and who had had at least one or more AEBC in the
             previous year and with FEV1/FVC &lt;70% (lung function tests made in the previous 12
             months).

          -  Patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis
             presumably due to bacterial infection based on all of the following signs and symptoms
             of AECB: increased sputum purulence, and at least 1 of the 2 following signs and
             symptoms (increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume).

          -  Patients with negative chest radiography (posterior/anterior and lateral views) to
             rule out a pneumonia within 48 hours before initiation of study medication or at the
             latest 24 hours after initiation of study medication (it was necessary to not include
             patients with pneumonia associated with AECB).

          -  Patients with sputum specimens collected at inclusion for gram stain and
             bacteriological culture.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
