    <textblock>
      This is multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase II trial in patients with locally advanced
      or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Primary objective: objective response rate. Secondary
      objectives: safety, time to disease progression, median duration of response, time to
      treatment failure, overall survival time, correlation between bio-pathological
      characterization (EGFR, akt, MAPks) objective response and survival

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last years, the esocrine pancreatic carcinoma presented a slow but constant
      increase of incidence. Chemotherapy determined disappointing results. Gemcitabine determined
      a slight advantage in survival and clinical benefit in comparison with gemcitabine with
      cisplatin or oxaliplatin Elevated expression of EGFR or its ligand correlates with worse
      prognosis in a variety of human cancers including pancreatic cancer. Therefore, blockade of
      EGFR activity would provide a novel strategy for the treatment of cancer. Cetuximab (C225) is
      a human/murine chimeric monoclonal antibody directed to the EGFR binding site. In a
      preclinical setting, Cetuximab has demonstrated anticancer activity both in cell culture
      experiments and in &quot;in vivo&quot; tumor xenograft animal model Since the combination of
      gemcitabine and cisplatin seems to be the more effective treatment for advanced pancreatic
      cancer and Cetuximab may improve activity of this combination we designed this phase II
      randomised trial to assess the role of Cetuximab in combination with gemcitabine and
      cisplatin in pancreatic cancer.
