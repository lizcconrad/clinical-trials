      Introduction: Ocular administration of glucocorticoids is a common and effective treatment
      for several ocular diseases. However it is often complicated with the elevation of
      intraocular pressure (IOP). Anecortave acetate (AA) is an analog of cortisol acetate and
      lacks the typical anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties of glucocorticoids. The
      effect of its anterior juxtascleral depot (AJD) injection has been evaluated in cases of
      glaucoma caused by intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide, presenting impressive results. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the AA injection as a
      possible antiglaucoma treatment alternative. Methods: A prospective clinical study will be
      carried out including 30 glaucoma patients (30 eyes). After inclusion each patient will
      receive a single AJD injection of 30 mg of AA in the selected eye. Main outcome measure
      include: intraocular pressure at 1st day, 7th day, 1st, 2nd and 3rd months.
