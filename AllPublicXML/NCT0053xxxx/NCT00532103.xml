      This study will develop a new methodology to evaluate any treatment-emergent suicidal
      ideation that might occur when an antidepressant treatment has been started and/or during
      times when doses are increased in patients with major depressive disorder.

      This is a pilot study to begin to develop a measurement procedure to help guide the clinical
      management of suicide risk in people beginning a type of antidepressant medication called a
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). The goals of the study are: 1) to identify the
      best method and assessment measures to evaluate the severity of suicidal ideation, 2) to
      determine the appropriate frequency and duration of assessment required to adequately
      evaluate this suicidal ideation, 3) to evaluate the presence of symptoms that are associated
      with suicidal ideation (such as anxiety, panic attacks, difficulty in sleeping) and 4) to
      identify the most critical time periods during which suicidal ideation appears or worsens
      (such as how long after initiation of treatment or dosage increase).

      In all, 300 adult participants with major depressive disorder (MDD), between the ages of 18
      and 75, may be enrolled at primary and psychiatric care sites across the US. All patients
      will be treated with an SSRI for eight weeks. The choice of SSRI used in treatment will be
      chosen by the study physician at each site. For this study, physicians will choose from the
      following six SSRIs: citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, paroxetine-CR, and
      fluoxetine.

      Patients beginning an SSRI for MDD in &quot;real world&quot; psychiatric and primary care settings,
      will have clinic visits and receive evaluations of their symptoms of depression, side
      effects, suicidal thinking and symptoms that are thought to be associated with suicidal risk,
      every other week for eight weeks. They will be evaluated by phone for symptoms and side
      effects each week they do not come to the clinic. They will also receive phone calls three
      times a week for the first two weeks of the study, after beginning the antidepressant, and
      after a dose increase to evaluate suicide risk.

          -  Patients must be enrolled at the primary or specialty care site, and be planning to
             continue living in the area of that clinic throughout the study

          -  Patients must be 18-75 years old

          -  Patients must meet clinical criteria for MDD, based on clinical interview and DSM IV

          -  Patients must not have taken antidepressant medication for at least 2 weeks prior to
             screen (or 4 weeks in the case of fluoxetine).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current substance abuse or dependence

          -  Two past SSRI treatment failures within the current episode, or last 2 years if

             yet translated and validated in Spanish or other languages.

          -  Some reports of SSRI-induced akathisia-like states have found them to be more highly
             correlated with either concurrent or previous treatment with a neuroleptic, even in
             patients with no history of movement disorders therefore, patients who have taken an
             anti-psychotic medication within 4 months of the screening visit will be excluded from
             the study.
