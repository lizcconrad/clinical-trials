  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visual outcomes of the eye with large subretinal hemorrhages (bleeding under the retina) due
      to Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) are poor. The Submacular Surgery Trial (SST) showed
      that no statistically significant improvement in vision resulted from surgical removal of the
      layer of abnormal blood vessels causing the bleeding. However, placement of a gas bubble into
      the gel of the eye along with removal of the blood has shown some success. However, this does
      not treat the underlying condition of the AMD.

      Intravitreal injections (into the gel of the eye) of a drug called Lucentis has been shown to
      be highly effective in the treatment of AMD, yet its penetration through areas of thick blood
      caused by subretinal hemorrhage is not known.

      This study is proposing to treat the AMD causing the subretinal hemorrhage with a vitrectomy
      (surgery involving removing the gel inside the eye, and membrane layers of the eye) followed
      by Lucentis placed between the layers of the retina and then with or without a gas bubble.

      In order to determine if the the subretinal Lucentis alone is beneficial, 5 of the 10
      patients enrolled will get a gas bubble and the other 5 will not.

      Subjects will be followed for a period of 12 months. Based on photographs and other testing
      procedures, if it is deemed in the subject's best interest, the subject may receive monthly
      injections of Lucentis to help treat the AMD.
