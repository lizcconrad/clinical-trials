    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, multi-centre, sequential cohort, open-label, dose-escalation study of the
      safety, tolerability, and PK of ANG1005 in patients with solid tumors (with or without brain
      metastases). ANG1005 will be given by IV infusion once every 21 days (1 treatment cycle).
      Each patient will participate in only 1 dose group and will receive up to 6 cycles of
      treatment provided there is no evidence of tumor progression, there is recovery to ≤Grade 1
      or baseline nonhematologic, ANG1005-related toxicity (except alopecia), the absolute
      neutrophil count is ≥1.5 x 109/L, and the platelet count is ≥100 x 109/L.

      This is a phase 1, multi-centre, sequential cohort, open-label, dose-escalation study of the
      safety, tolerability, and PK of ANG1005 in patients with solid tumors (with or without brain
      metastases). ANG1005 will be given by IV infusion once every 21 days (1 treatment cycle).
      Each patient will participate in only 1 dose group and will receive up to 6 cycles. Patients
      may receive additional cycles of ANG1005 if there is no evidence of tumor progression, there
      is recovery to ≤Grade 1 or baseline nonhematologic, ANG1005-related toxicity (except
      alopecia), the absolute neutrophil count is ≥1.5 x 109/L, and the platelet count is ≥100 x
      109/L.

      Initially, cohorts of 1 - 3 patients will be enrolled into each dose group. Dose escalation
      by dose doubling will be done for the first 3 dose groups followed by a modified Fibonacci
      dose escalation scheme with increases of 67%, 50%, 40% and 33% thereafter. If 1 or more
      patients in a cohort experience an emergent ≥ Grade 2 drug-related toxicity during the first
      treatment cycle, then a minimum of 3 patients will be enrolled into that, and all subsequent
      cohort(s) and dose doubling will be stopped if applicable.

      If &gt; 1 patient in a cohort experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first
      treatment cycle, defined as any of the following that are both treatment-emergent and at
      least possibly related to ANG1005: i) Any Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity, ii) Febrile
      neutropenia, iii) Grade 4 neutropenia of ≥7 days duration, and/or iv) Any Grade 4
      thrombocytopenia, then dose escalation will stop and prior doses will be explored as the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD), that dose-level at which ≤1 of 6 patients in a cohort develop
      an emergent DLT).

      Once the MTD is established, approximately 14 patients will be enrolled at that dose-level in
      order to further assess the safety and tolerability of ANG1005, the PK profile of ANG1005 at
      the MTD, and the preliminary anti-tumor activity of ANG1005 in patients with solid tumors
      (with or without brain metastases).
