      The purpose of this Phase II follow-up study (to study 810501) is to assess the
      immunogenicity and safety of a booster vaccination with a non-adjuvanted H5N1 influenza
      vaccine administered 12 to 17 months after a two-dose regimen of different doses of an
      adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted H5N1 influenza vaccine in a healthy young adult population. A
      data safety monitoring board will review the safety data after the booster vaccination. The
      H5N1 influenza antibody persistence 180 days after the booster vaccination will also be
      assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who participated in Study 810501 will be eligible for participation in the study
        if they:

          -  Completed the Day 42 visit in study 810501

          -  Have an understanding of the study, agree to its provisions, and give written informed
             consent prior to study entry

          -  Are clinically healthy, as determined by the Investigator's clinical judgment through
             collection of medical history and performance of a physical examination

          -  Agree to keep a daily record of symptoms for the duration of the study

          -  If female and capable of bearing children, have a negative urine pregnancy test result
             at study entry and agree to employ adequate birth control measures for the duration of
             the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a history of vaccination with an H5N1 influenza virus since the second
             vaccination in study 810501

          -  Have had an allergic reaction to one of the components of the vaccine since the second
             vaccination in Study 810501

          -  Have been diagnosed with a significant neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary
             (including asthma), hepatic, rheumatic, autoimmune, hematological, renal or metabolic
             disorder since the second vaccination in Study 810501

             scheduled booster vaccination or are currently undergoing a form of treatment that can
             be expected to influence immune response. Such treatment includes, but is not limited
             to, systemic or high dose inhaled (&gt;800µg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or
             equivalent) corticosteroids, radiation treatment or other immunosuppressive or
             cytotoxic drugs

          -  Have had severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis since the second vaccination in
             Study 810501

          -  Have a rash, dermatologic condition or tattoos which may interfere with injection site
             reaction rating

          -  Have undergone systemic corticoid therapy within 30 days prior to study entry

          -  Have a functional or surgical asplenia

          -  Have a known or suspected problem with alcohol or drug abuse

          -  Were administered an investigational drug within six weeks prior to study entry or are
             concurrently participating in a clinical study that includes the administration of an
             investigational product

          -  Are a member of the team conducting this study or are in a dependent relationship with
             the study investigator. Dependent relationships include close relatives (i.e.,
             children, partner/spouse, siblings, parents) as well as employees of the investigator
             If female, are pregnant or lactating
