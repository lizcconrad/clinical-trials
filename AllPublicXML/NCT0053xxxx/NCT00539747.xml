      This exploratory study will examine ways in which individuals approach a positive genetic
      test for Huntington Disease (HD). HD is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes emotional,
      cognitive, and movement problems, and currently there is no way to prevent, stop or reverse
      the progression of the disease. It is passed down through a mutation in a normal gene, and
      each child of an HD parent has a 50-50 chance of inheriting the HD gene. The study is
      designed to explore how individuals adjust to their new genetic status and evaluate any
      perceived mental or emotional barriers to that adjustment. Currently, little is known about
      how individuals come to terms with a positive genetic test result for a condition that has no
      known cure or effective treatment. The results of this study may give health care providers
      and counselors more information about how to help patients who are at risk for developing HD
      make sense of their new genetic status.

      Candidates will be prescreened and referred to the study by clinics that specialize in
      genetic testing and counseling. Candidates must be 18 years old or older and must have
      received a positive genetic test result for HD at least one month prior to the study. They
      must also perceive themselves to be asymptomatic-that is, without existing HD symptoms.

      During the study, participants will be interviewed and asked a series of questions about
      their decision to pursue testing, their life since the testing, and the things that they have
      found helpful or unhelpful since receiving the test results. The interviews will be recorded
      and will last approximately 60 minutes. Participants also will receive a follow-up phone call
      within two to three days to ensure their general psychological well-being after the
      interview.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Huntington Disease (HD) is a progressive neurological condition, eventually leading to death.
      Presymptomatic, predictive genetic testing can inform individuals of their genetic status. A
      positive genetic test result can be a threatening event. In adapting to threatening events
      people often try and find meaning in the experience. Meaning making refers to the attempt to
      understand an event or experience and its significance in the context of one's life. The
      search for meaning can eventually lead to acceptance of an event or experience, and is
      considered an important component of adaptation. Although it has been established that
      testing for HD can be a significantly stressful event, and that meaning making is a frequent
      response towards adaptation, little is known about this process among individuals faced with
      a positive genetic test result for HD. This study will describe meaning making in a
      population of presymptomatic individuals with a positive genetic test result for HD.

      Semi-structured interviews will be conducted, recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. A typology
      of common themes will be compiled and reported. Data gathered from these interviews will
      improve understanding of the phenomenon of meaning making in this population, and will
      contribute to the existing literature on the role of meaning making in cognitive adaptation.
      This study will specifically help gain insight into the process of meaning making among
      individuals who have tested positive for HD, and may potentially inform the ways in which
      health care professionals can help facilitate meaning-making among this population, in their
      process of adaptation to a stressful live event.

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

        Participants for this study will be men and women, age 18 or older, who have undergone
        presymptomatic genetic testing for HD, received a positive test result and currently
        perceive themselves as being asymptomatic. To obtain a range of experiences, the
        investigator (PR) will attempt to recruit individuals with a range of elapsed time since
        their positive test result.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  18 years or older

          -  Able to speak and understand English

          -  Received results that they believe are positive at least one month ago

          -  Perceive themselves to be asymptomatic

          -  Willing and able to read and describe the consent form before the phone interview

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Test result less than a month ago

          -  Believe that they got a negative test result

          -  Believe themselves to be symptomatic

          -  Obvious symptoms of dementia or serious mental illness that would preclude consent
