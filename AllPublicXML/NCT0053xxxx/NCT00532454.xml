      Primary objectives of this study is to evaluate the effects of CYP2D6 genotypes on time to
      progression after tamoxifen treatment in pre- or postmenopausal women with metastatic breast
      cancer. Furthermore, we will evaluate the effects of CYP2D6 genotypes on clinical benefit and
      response duration to tamoxifen administration in pre- or postmenopausal women with metastatic
      breast cancer and also evaluate the effects of CYP2D6 genotypes on the steady state plasma
      concentration of tamoxifen and its metabolites

          -  Positive estrogen receptor or Positive progesterone receptor.

          -  Females at least 18 years of age.

          -  Prior radiation therapy is allowed as long as the irradiated area is not the only

             (bilirubin level 1.8 mg/dL, AST, ALT 1.5xULN, albumin 2.5 g/dL), and renal (creatinine
             concentration 1.5 mg/dL) function.

          -  Informed consent from patient or patient's relative

          -  Childbearing women should use non-hormonal contraceptive method

             treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin or prior malignancy treated more than 5 years
             ago without recurrence).
