    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of bevacizumab
      in combination with valproic acid that can be given to patients with advanced cancer that has
      not responded to standard treatment or where there is no standard treatment for the disease.
      The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      Bevacizumab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the
      growth of blood vessels. Valproic acid works the same was way as bevacizumab and is also used
      in the treatment of seizures, migraine headaches, and mood disturbances in bipolar disorders.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive the study drugs
      as an outpatient. You will receive bevacizumab by vein over 90 minutes (for the first
      infusion) once every 2 weeks. Once the study doctor determines that you are able to tolerate
      the drug, it will be given over 60 minutes for the second infusion and then over 30 minutes
      for further infusions. Valproic acid will be given by mouth (capsule(s)) each day for 28
      days. You will take valproic acid once or twice a day depending on your dose. Every 28 days
      is considered 1 cycle.

      You will have blood drawn (about 2 teaspoons) and urine collected for routine tests every
      cycle, about every 1-2 weeks, so that researchers can monitor the safety of the study drugs.
      Once every 8 weeks you will have tumor markers tested as part of the routine blood draw. You
      will have a physical exam once a cycle.

      You will have either a CT or MRI scan of the tumor about every 8 weeks to check the status
      (whether it is growing or shrinking) of the cancer. If your doctor thinks other tests are
      necessary he/she will discuss those with you.

      You will continue to receive bevacizumab and valproic acid as long as the disease is
      considered stable. You will receive up to 12 cycles of the study drug. If the disease gets
      worse or you experience any intolerable side effects, you will be taken off this study.

      You will have an end-of-study visit 28 days after your last dose of bevacizumab. At this
      visit, you will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and
      blood pressure. You will have a neurological exam, and blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be
      drawn for routine and tumor marker tests. You will be asked about any medications you may be
      taking and whether you have had any side effects. You will also be asked how well you are
      able to perform daily activities.

      This is an investigational study. Bevacizumab and valproic acid are both FDA approved and
      commercially available. Their use together in this study is investigational and authorized
      for use in research only. Up to 80 patients will take part in this study. All will be
      enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with pathologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable
             and refractory to standard therapy or for whom there is no standard therapy that
             induces complete remission (CR) of at least 10% or an increased survival of at least 3
             months.

          2. There is no maximum allowable number of prior chemotherapy regimens, provided all
             other eligibility criteria are met.

          3. ECOG performance status less than 2.

          4. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: - absolute
             neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,000/mcL - platelets greater than
             50,000/mcL - total bilirubin less than 2 mg/dl - creatinine less than 2 mg/dl

          5. The effects of bevacizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             and because valproic acid is known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential
             and men who may impregnate a woman must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal
             or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the
             duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          6. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign an MD Anderson IRB approved written
             informed consent document.

          7. Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to receiving
             first dose of study drug or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to
             agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.Patients may have received palliative
             radiation immediately before (or during) treatment provided radiation is not to the
             only target lesion available.

          2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents for 28 days prior to
             first dose of drug on this study, and while pt is receiving this study drug.

          3. Patients whose brain mets or primary brain tumor includes symptoms that in the opinion
             of the principle investigator would either put the patients at unacceptable risk
             greater than the risk of the underlying cancer or if the treatment would unacceptably
             confound the analysis of the toxicity assessment.

          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to bevacizumab or valproic acid .

          5. Major surgery within the previous four weeks.

          6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, HTN (with 2 or more
             antihypertensives), unstable angina pectoris or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          7. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because valproic acid is an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with valproic acid and bevacizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with these agents.

          8. Patient who are already on antiepileptic agents, for example; phenytoin, valproic
             acid, and neurontin will be excluded.
