  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study F1J-US-HMFS comprises two identical multicenter, 9-month, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, trials (HMFSa and HMFSb). The purpose of this study is to
      compare the efficacy and safety of Duloxetine 60 milligrams (mg) once daily to placebo on
      depression in patients aged 18-65. Data from the two trials will be reported in both
      individual and pooled analyses. Pooling the two studies will allow for increased power to
      detect differences between duloxetine and placebo on secondary and exploratory objectives.
      Only one data lock is planned for this study, when all patients have completed all study
      procedures.

          <description>The 30-item BPOMS measures mood states and has 6 factors: tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anxiety-hostility, fatigue, confusion, and vigor. Item scores: 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Each factor scores range from 0 to 20. The Total score is sum of all factor scores minus the factor score for vigor (Total=Ten+Dep+Ang+Fat+Con-Vig).</description>

        <description>The 30-item BPOMS measures mood states and has 6 factors: tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anxiety-hostility, fatigue, confusion, and vigor. Item scores: 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Each factor scores range from 0 to 20. The Total score is sum of all factor scores minus the factor score for vigor (Total=Ten+Dep+Ang+Fat+Con-Vig).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 9 Month Endpoint in 30-Item Brief Profile of Mood States (BPOMS) Scale and Subscales (Tension-Anxiety, Depression-Dejection, Anger-Hostility, Vigor-Activity, Fatigue-Inertia, and Confusion-Bewilderment)</title>
        <description>The 30-item BPOMS measures mood states and has 6 factors: tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anxiety-hostility, fatigue, confusion, and vigor. Item scores: 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Each factor scores range from 0 to 20. The Total score is sum of all factor scores minus the factor score for vigor (Total=Ten+Dep+Ang+Fat+Con-Vig).</description>
