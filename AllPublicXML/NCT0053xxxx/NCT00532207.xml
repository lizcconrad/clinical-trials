        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Are postmenopausal women at least 55 years old and at least 2 years postmenopausal at
             the time of entry into the trial, and who have given informed consent before entering
             the study and after being informed of the risks, medications, and procedures to be
             used in the study. In addition, women below the age of 60 years with indeterminate
             menopause due to premenopausal hysterectomy must have their postmenopausal status
             confirmed with a serum FSH level &gt; 30 IU/L.

          -  Posterior-anterior lumbar spine (L1-L4) BMD and/or femoral neck BMD measurement at
             least &lt; 2.5 standard deviation (SD) from the mean of healthy, pre-menopausal women.

          -  Results of lumbar BMD (L1-L4) measurement must be available. The initial lumbar spine
             assessment and the determination of the patient's eligibility for entry into the
             screening phase will be made by the individual investigator. If the L-1 vertebra
             cannot be analyzed due to artifact, vertebral fracture, osteophytes, or other
             abnormalities, that vertebra should be excluded from the analysis.

          -  Normal or clinically insignificant abnormal laboratory values (as defined by the
             investigator) including serum calcium, 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels and alkaline
             phosphatase.

          -  Willing to be trained on and use a pen type injection delivery system on a daily basis
             for 12 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active liver disease - liver enzymes (ALT, AST) more than three times the upper normal
             range, or a bilirubin of &gt; 2.0 mg/dl, or clinical jaundice.

          -  Abnormal thyroid function not corrected by therapy. Normal thyroid function will be
             documented by a normal TSH during screening phase

          -  History of active nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis in the prior 2 years. Patients with
             any documented history of nephro- or urolithiasis must have had an appropriate imaging
             procedure within the prior 6 months, such as, an intravenous pyelography (IVP), supine
             radiograph of the kidney ureter bladder (KUB), or renal ultrasound, which must
             document the absence of stones

          -  History of malignant neoplasms within the prior 5 years, with the exception of
             superficial basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has been
             definitively treated. If malignant neoplasm was ever diagnosed, patient must presently
             be free of disease.

          -  Current pharmacological treatment for osteoporosis, other than calcium and Vitamin D

          -  History of Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy, osteomalacia, any secondary causes
             of osteoporosis, hyperparathyroidism (uncorrected), and intestinal malabsorption
