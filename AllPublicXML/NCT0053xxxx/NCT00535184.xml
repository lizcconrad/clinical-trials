      Comparison of the ability of DBT and FFDM to detect breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled women will undergo bilateral DBT. Prior breast imaging data (screening and
      diagnostic mammography) must have been conducted on GE equipment and the images must be
      available (or imaging must be repeated). DBT images will be read on-site by one or more
      qualified radiologists. All subjects who undergo biopsy will be asked to return in
      approximately 1 year for a follow-up mammogram. Images will be processed and evaluated by
      independent readers.
