  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the long term safety of SCH 420814 (preladenant) in
      participants with moderate to severe Parkinson's Disease who are taking an L-Dopa/dopa
      decarboxylase inhibitor and/or dopamine agonist. All participants must have participated in
      the main study (P04501; NCT00406029) entitled &quot;A Phase 2, 12 Week, Double Blind, Dose
      Finding, Placebo Controlled Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of a Range of SCH 420814
      Doses in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Parkinson's Disease Experiencing Motor Fluctuations
      and Dyskinesias.&quot;

    <description>An adverse event is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure. A serious adverse event is an adverse event that that results in death, life threatening adverse event, permanent or significant disability / unfitness for work, hospital treatment (i.e., admission to hospital) or prolongation of a patient's length of stay, or congenital deformity or birth defect.</description>

    <measure>Time Spent in &quot;Off&quot; State Per Day</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (P04501 BL; P04501 BL_LA), Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 24, Week 36</time_frame>
    <description>Participant diaires recorded time spent in the &quot;off&quot; state at half-hourly intervals for at least 3 full days before scheduled visits. &quot;Off&quot; time is defined as when the participant's medication is not working as subjectively determined by the participant and his/her physician. Higher &quot;off&quot; time values relative to Baseline (BL) signify that the Parkinson's disease symptoms are worse (i.e., participant can only move slowly or not at all). BL was determined using two methods: 1) P04501 BL refers to the starting BL of the double-blind base study P04501 and 2) P04501 BL_LA refers to BL as defined by the last assessment taken in P04501. Endpoint refers to the last observed result for participants within P05175.</description>

    <description>Participant diaries recorded time spent in the &quot;on&quot; state at half-hourly intervals for at least 3 full days before scheduled visits. &quot;On&quot; time is defined as when the participant's medication is working as subjectively determined by the participant and his/her physician. Higher &quot;on&quot; time values relative to BL mean that the Parkinson's disease symptoms are better or absent (i.e., participant can move well). BL was determined using two methods: 1) P04501 BL refers to the starting BL of the double-blind base study P04501 and 2) P04501 BL_LA refers to BL as defined by the last assessment taken in P04501.

    <measure>Time Spent in the &quot;on&quot; State With no Dyskinesias</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (P04501 BL; P04501 BL_LA), Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 24, Week 36</time_frame>
    <description>Participant diaries recorded time spent in the &quot;on&quot; state with no dyskinesias at half-hourly intervals for at least 3 full days before scheduled visits. &quot;On&quot; time is defined as when the participant's medication is working as subjectively determined by the participant and his/her physician. Dyskinesias are a side effect of long-term therapy with L-dopa consisting of unintentional twisting and/or turning movements that occur in the &quot;on&quot; time. Higher values relative to BL signify an improvement in the Parkinson's disease symptoms (i.e., participant can move well) concomitant with no dyskinesias. BL was determined using two methods: 1) P04501 BL refers to the starting BL of the double-blind base study P04501 and 2) P04501 BL_LA refers to BL as defined by the last assessment taken in P04501. Endpoint refers to the last observed result for participants within P05175.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (P04501 BL; P04501 BL_LA), Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 24, Week 36</time_frame>
    <description>Participant diaries recorded time spent in the &quot;on&quot; state with troublesome dyskinesias at half-hourly intervals for at least 3 full days before scheduled visits. &quot;On&quot; time is defined as when the participant's medication is working as subjectively determined by the participant and his/her physician. Dyskinesias are a side effect of long-term therapy with L-dopa consisting of unintentional twisting and/or turning movements that occur in the &quot;on&quot; time; troublesome dyskinesias interfere with function or cause discomfort. Higher values relative to BL signify that the Parkinson's disease symptoms are better or absent (i.e., participant can move well) concomitant with troublesome dyskinesias. BL was determined using two methods: 1) P04501 BL refers to the starting BL of the double-blind base study P04501 and 2) P04501 BL_LA refers to BL as defined by the last assessment taken in P04501.

    <description>Participant diaries recorded time spent in the &quot;on&quot; state without troublesome dyskinesias at half-hourly intervals for at least 3 full days before scheduled visits. &quot;On&quot; time is defined as when the participant's medication is working as subjectively determined by the participant and his/her physician. Dyskinesias are a side effect of long-term therapy with L-dopa consisting of unintentional twisting and/or turning movements that occur in the &quot;on&quot; time; troublesome dyskinesias interfere with function or cause discomfort.

    <description>Participant diaries recorded time spent in the &quot;on&quot; state with dyskinesias at half-hourly intervals for at least 3 full days before scheduled visits. &quot;On&quot; time is defined as when the participant's medication is working as subjectively determined by the participant and his/her physician. Dyskinesias are a side effect of long-term therapy with L-dopa consisting of unintentional twisting and/or turning movements that occur in the &quot;on&quot; time. Higher values relative to BL signify worsening of dyskinesia (i.e., more time spent with dyskinesia). BL was determined using two methods: 1) P04501 BL refers to the starting BL of the double-blind base study P04501 and 2) P04501 BL_LA refers to BL as defined by the last assessment taken in P04501.

        <title>Time Spent in &quot;Off&quot; State Per Day</title>
        <description>Participant diaires recorded time spent in the &quot;off&quot; state at half-hourly intervals for at least 3 full days before scheduled visits. “Off” time is defined as when the participant’s medication is not working as subjectively determined by the participant and his/her physician. Higher &quot;off&quot; time values relative to Baseline (BL) signify that the Parkinson’s disease symptoms are worse (i.e., participant can only move slowly or not at all). BL was determined using two methods: 1) P04501 BL refers to the starting BL of the double-blind base study P04501 and 2) P04501 BL_LA refers to BL as defined by the last assessment taken in P04501. Endpoint refers to the last observed result for participants within P05175.</description>

        <title>Time Spent in the &quot;on&quot; State With Troublesome Dyskinesias</title>
        <description>Participant diaries recorded time spent in the &quot;on&quot; state with troublesome dyskinesias at half-hourly intervals for at least 3 full days before scheduled visits. “On” time is defined as when the participant’s medication is working as subjectively determined by the participant and his/her physician. Dyskinesias are a side effect of long-term therapy with L-dopa consisting of unintentional twisting and/or turning movements that occur in the &quot;on&quot; time; troublesome dyskinesias interfere with function or cause discomfort. Higher values relative to BL signify that the Parkinson’s disease symptoms are better or absent (i.e., participant can move well) concomitant with troublesome dyskinesias. BL was determined using two methods: 1) P04501 BL refers to the starting BL of the double-blind base study P04501 and 2) P04501 BL_LA refers to BL as defined by the last assessment taken in P04501. Endpoint refers to the last observed result for participants within P05175.</description>
