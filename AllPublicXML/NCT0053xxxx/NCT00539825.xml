        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subject

          -  Aged between 18-55 years inclusive.

          -  Non-smokers

          -  Normal spirometry

          -  A signed and dated written informed consent is obtained from the subject.

          -  The subject is capable of giving informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Available to complete the study.

          -  The subject is =50kg with a body mass index within the range 19.0 to 29.9 kg/m2
             inclusive.

          -  Response to ipratropium bromide

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically relevant and important abnormality identified at the screening medical
             assessment (physical examination/medical history), clinical laboratory tests, or ECG
             (12-lead or Holter).

          -  A history of breathing problems

          -  A mean QTc(B) value &gt; 450ms, the QTc(B) of the 3 screening ECGs are not within 10% of
             the mean, a PR interval outside the range 90-210ms or an ECG that is not suitable for
             QT measurements at screening.

          -  A history of elevated resting blood pressure or a mean blood pressure higher than
             140/90 mmHg at screening.

          -  A mean heart rate outside the range 40-90 bpm inclusive at screening.

          -  History of use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 6 months of
             screening, and/or positive urine cotinine test results at screening.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood in excess of 500mL
             within a 56 day period at screening.

          -  The subject is currently taking regular (or a course of) medication, whether
             prescribed or not, including herbal remedies such as St John's Wort etc.

        The subject has taken:

          -  prescription medications for 14 days prior to first dose of study drug, or

          -  Over-the-counter (OTC) medications/preparations (including herbal remedies, etc.)
             excluding simple analgesics for 48 hours prior to first dose of study drug, unless it
             is judged by the Investigator not to compromise the subject's safety or influence the
             outcome of the study.

               -  The subject has participated in a study with a new molecular entity or any other
                  trial within a period of 3 months prior first dose of study drug.

               -  The subject has tested positive for hepatitis C antibody (third generation enzyme
                  immunoassay), hepatitis B surface antigen or HIV antibodies (if tested according
                  to site SOP's) at screening.

               -  The subject has tested positive for drugs-of-abuse at screening.

               -  The subject has tested positive for urine alcohol (including ethanol) at
                  screening.

        The detection of alcohol would not be an exclusion at screening but would need to be
        negative pre-dose and during the study.

          -  The subject is unable to use the DISKUSâ„¢ and/or HandiHaler inhaler devices correctly
             at screening.

          -  The subject has a suspected history of alcohol abuse within the six months previous to
             the screening visit.

          -  The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to magnesium stearate, milk
             protein or the excipient lactose monohydrate, iodine, ipratropium bromide, tiotropium
             bromide, atropine and/or any of its derivatives.

          -  The subject has a significant clinical history of prostatic hypertrophy or narrow
             angle glaucoma.

          -  The subject has received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant.

          -  The subject has claustrophobia that may be aggravated by entering the whole body
             plethysmography cabinet.
