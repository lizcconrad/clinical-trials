      Feasibility study to compare the effectiveness of the Paradigm Sensor Augmented System versus
      subjects continuing to administer insulin in multiple dose injections. Evaluate the
      educational materials and time required for training subjects naïve to continuous
      subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) to use the Paradigm 722 REAL Time System in preparation
      for a large multi-center clinical trial

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many subjects with Type 1 diabetes continue to manage their disease utilizing multiple daily
      injections, but despite frequent blood glucose checks, are unable to control their glycemic
      variability or lower their A1C levels. The MiniMed Paradigm REAL-Time System transmits sensor
      glucose values to the insulin pump every 5 minutes, allowing users to view their current
      glucose values as well as glycemic excursions and trends over a 24-hour period. The System
      will also alert users of high and low glucose levels, allowing subjects and their clinicians
      to make carefully monitored modifications to therapy. Additionally, data can be uploaded from
      the monitor into a personal computer, allowing the subject and clinician to see a complete
      picture of trends over time.

      Subjects learning this technology would require a new approach to training if they were to
      master operation of an insulin pump, make effective use of the sensor technology and
      understand the complete picture provided by the software component. Subjects will be trained
      to first use the insulin pump, add the sensor and then utilize the software and the
      effectiveness of the training methods and timing will be measured using questionnaires
      designed to evaluate understanding of the device, Self Efficacy and User Acceptance. The
      group wearing the System will also be compared to subjects that continue on their current MDI
      therapy over a 15-week time period.

    <description>Questionnaire evaluating change in the subjects' fear of potential hypoglycemia events assessed Week 15 and compared between arms. Likert scale of 0 - 4 used with responses graded as the lowest number being the most acceptable and highest number the least acceptable. The questionnaire has two sections, Behavior and Worry with a maximum possible score of 60 for Behavior (15 X 4) and 72 for Worry (18 X 4). The total combined scoring of these two sections was then assessed at Baseline and Week 15 and the change from Baseline to Week 15 for each arm reported as the end of study result.</description>

Likert scale of 0 - 4 used with responses graded as the lowest number being the most acceptable and highest number the least acceptable. The questionnaire has two sections, Behavior and Worry with a maximum possible score of 60 for Behavior (15 X 4) and 72 for Worry (18 X 4). The total combined scoring of these two sections was then assessed at Baseline and Week 15 and the change from Baseline to Week 15 for each arm reported as the end of study result.</description>
