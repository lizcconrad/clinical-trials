    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are the following:

        1. To demonstrate that AMG 223 will produce a statistically significant reduction in serum
           phosphorus compared with placebo over a 3 week treatment period in subjects with CKD
           receiving dialysis

        2. To describe a dose response for AMG 223

        3. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 223
