  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary fructose potently exacerbates the dyslipidemia associated with obesity, insulin
      resistance and accelerated atherosclerosis. In a randomized crossover outpatient study of 15
      overweight adults, we will measure the increase over 4 hours in serum VLDL triglyceride
      palmitate made by the liver from each single oral dose of fructose (0.5 g/kg),
      fructose:glucose 1:1 (1 g/kg) or fructose:glucose 1:1 (2 g/kg). Our hypotheses are that the
      synthesis of palmitate from dietary fructose will be 1) greater when consumed with glucose
      and 2) show a dose-response. The lipogenic responses will be compared and correlated with
      markers of carbohydrate and lipid flux measured after fasting and post-fructose. The results
      will serve as a guide to the development of a new outpatient probe of the de novo lipogenic
      pathway in subjects who vary in their lipogenic response to oral fructose. These studies
      should ultimately yield valuable new information about the mechanisms linking dietary
      carbohydrate to elevated triglycerides, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
