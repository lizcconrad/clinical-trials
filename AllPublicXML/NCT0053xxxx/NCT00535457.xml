  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is not uncommon for children to undergo surgery. Surgery is a threatening event that is
      composed of various stress-provoking stimuli. Pre-operative anxiety is a common emotional
      response among operated children and their parents. In the current study we are going to
      examine if tricks done by the anesthesiologist before anesthetic induction are equally as
      effective as oral midazolam premedication in the reduction of pre-operative anxiety in
      children before and after surgery. A successful anxiety reduction may be advantageous over
      pharmacological premedication by cost reduction, a possibly shorter post anesthesia care stay
      and by reducing postoperative maladaptive behavior rate.

      Study hypothesis: 1. similar anxiety scores will be observed in children that will watch
      their anesthesiologist performing tricks and in those who will receive oral midazolam
      premedication but no tricks.

      2. Similar rates of postoperative maladaptive behavior will be found in children that that
      will see tricks and in those that will receive midazolam premedication.
