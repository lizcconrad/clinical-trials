  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parental involvement has been shown to be a robust predictor of child conduct problems (CP)
      and drug use risk in childhood and adolescence, but relatively little attention has been paid
      to the role of parental involvement in relation to child problem behavior during the
      transition to school-age, when children are spending more time in school, after-care
      settings, and in the neighborhood. Concomitantly, as children transition from preschool to
      school-age, there is evidence to suggest that the quality and organization of schools,
      after-school care, and neighborhoods play an increasingly important role in the emergence of
      children's CP and drug use risk. Specifically, we will address: 1) the extent to which the
      quality of school environments, after-school care, and neighborhoods are associated with the
      emergence of CP during the early school-age period; 2) how parental involvement in the
      toddler and preschool period may be associated with parental involvement and monitoring in
      extra-familial contexts in the early school-age years; 3) how parental involvement in
      schools, after-care, and the neighborhood, may moderate relationships between extra-familial
      factors and children's CP; and 4) whether a parenting intervention can increase parental
      involvement in school, after-care, and neighborhood contexts and decrease risk of children's
      subsequent CP. These issues will be tested with an existing sample of 731 ethnically-diverse
      children from urban, suburban, and rural sites. As all families in the study were recruited
      based on the presence of sociodemographic, family, and child risk factors, the cohort of
      children are at high risk for displaying a persistent trajectory of clinically-meaningful CP
      and drug use risk. Thus, the study has the potential to fill a much-needed void on
      associations between extra-familial contexts and risk for early-starting CP and later problem
      behavior during the early school-age years. Equally critical, the study can provide data on
      the potential moderating influence of involved parenting, its malleability for families
      facing multiple adversities, and whether family-based interventions can make a difference for
      children facing multiple adversities.
