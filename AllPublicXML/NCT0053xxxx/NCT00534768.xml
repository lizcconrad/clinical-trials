      Objective: Even though postoperative debridement is commonly considered as an essential part
      of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), the scientific data on the efficacy or the optimal timing
      of debridement is limited. In the present study, the effect of repeated debridement during
      the first week after ESS on the endoscopic and subjective outcome was evaluated.

      Study Design: Open, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial with two parallel
      groups.

      Methods: A total of 90 patients suffering from either recurrent or chronic maxillary
      sinusitis were randomized into two groups after ESS. In the active group, the nasal cavities
      were debrided three times on the first postoperative week, while in the control group the
      patients were debrided only once on the 7th postoperative day. The primary outcome measure
      was the presence of scarring in the middle meatus at four weeks after ESS.
