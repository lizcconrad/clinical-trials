  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acromegaly is a disease due to an excess of growth hormone that abnormally occurs in
      adulthood. It is due to a benign (non cancerous) tumor located in a particular part of the
      brain that secretes several hormones, the hypophysis. The excess of growth hormones in adults
      induces an increase in bone (resulting in large enlargement of extremities), and organs. The
      disease is complicated by the apparition of cardiovascular events including retention of
      water, salt in the tissues and increase in blood pressure, that altogether might major the
      mortality of the patients. The investigators recently got experimental data suggesting that
      the retention of water and salt is mainly due to the activation by the growth hormone of a
      renal transporter of sodium. Because this transporter is highly sensitive to amiloride, a
      well know diuretic, the investigators hypothesize that this drug will be very efficient in
      treating the hypertension in patients, as compared to another diuretic, furosemide.

      To prove this, we compared the response to amiloride administrated before and after treatment
      of acromegaly in the same subject. We will also compare the response to furosemide
      administrated before and after treatment of acromegaly in the same subject. We expected that
      the response to amiloride will be greater before than after treatment, while the response to
      furosemide will be lesser before than after treatment.

      Detailed Description:

      Definition: Extended description of the protocol, including information not already contained
      in other fields, such as comparison(s) studied.

      Patients will be recruited in the Department of Endocrinology and Reproductive diseases in
      BICETRE University Hospital and will be explored in the Centre for Clinical Investigation of
      HEGP. Investigations will be performed during 4 separate day-hospital stays (2 pre-treatment
      and 2 post treatment) in the CIC of HEGP. The tests will consist of blood and urine sample
      collections before and after a single dose administration of furosemide or amiloride. The
      tests will be performed before treatment of acromegaly in random order and separated by
      48hours, interval performed before treatment, and repeated in the same order after
      normalization of IGF1 by appropriate treatment.

      The study will last for 2 years, with a 12 months maximal participation of each patient
