  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients admitted to intensive care units require mechanical ventilation. Weaning from
      assisted/controlled ventilation begins when we recognize that the patient has recovered
      adeguately from acute respiratory failure.

      If weaning is delayed, costs are increased, as are the risks of nosocomial pneumonia,
      cardiac-associated morbility, and death. On the other hand, weaning too soon often results in
      reintubation, which is associated with complications similar to those of prolonged
      ventilation.

      The aim of this trial is to establish an evidence-based approach to weaning and to determine
      when a patient is ready to be weaned from mechanical ventilation, and what is the best
      weaning technique.
