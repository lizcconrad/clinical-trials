               -  Liver function:

                    -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 times the upper limit of the standard value of each
                       institution

                    -  Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤2.5 times the upper
                       limit of the standard value of each institution.

               -  Renal function:

                    -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 times the upper limit of the standard value of each
                       institution.

          -  In the recommended phase 2 dose Cohort, the subject has an accessible tumor for biopsy
             and is willing to undergo 2 tumor biopsies.

          -  In the recommended phase 2 dose Cohort, the subject has at least 1 measurable lesion
             based on the treatment assessment standards for solid tumors.

          -  In the recommended phase 2 dose Cohort, the subject has a tumor that expresses EGFR
             and/or overexpresses erbB2.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  The subject has a symptomatic brain metastasis.

             effusion.

             melena.

          -  The subject has acute gastrointestinal ulcers.

          -  The subject has been treated with a small molecule inhibitor of EGFR or HER2 (except
