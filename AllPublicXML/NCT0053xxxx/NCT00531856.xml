    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of two carbon monoxide
      doses when administered as an inhaled gas for 1 hour in patients receiving kidney
      transplants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mechanisms by which carbon monoxide exerts its effects in preventing damage of the graft
      appear to vary among the models and organs with the common theme of carbon monoxide acting as
      a potent anti-inflammatory molecule. Carbon monoxide affects several intracellular signaling
      pathways. In addition, carbon monoxide generates increased levels of anti-inflammatory
      molecules.

      Evaluate the safety and tolerability of three carbon monoxide dose levels consisting of a
      single 0.7 mg/kg dose and a single 2.0 mg/kg dose when administered post-operatively and a
      single 2.0 mg/kg dose, a single 3.0mg/kg dose and a 3.5 mg/kg dose when administered
      intra-operatively as an inhaled gas for 1 hour, by assessment of adverse events (AEs), vital
      signs, laboratory variables, serum carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), oxygenation, electrocardiography
      (ECG), and neurocognitive status in patients receiving kidney transplants.
