    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of lapaquistat acetate, once daily
      (QD), taken with statins on cholesterol levels in subjects with hypercholesterolemia

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyslipidemias are a group of metabolic disorders produced by raised concentrations of
      lipoproteins, especially low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which is the lipoprotein that
      transports endogenous cholesterol from the liver to the peripheral tissues. Increased
      cholesterol and triglycerides levels lead to an increased risk of arteriosclerosis, which is
      the underlying cause of heart attack, strokes and peripheral vascular disease.

      Despite changes in lifestyle and the availability of potent lipid-lowering agents,
      cardiovascular disease continues to be the major cause of death in Western Europe and North
      America. Serum cholesterol levels exceeding 5 mmol/L (193 mg/dL) are common in adults in
      Britain and much of Europe, the United States, Australia and New Zealand.

      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of lapaquistat acetate taken with either
      torvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin or lovastatin (stable statin
      therapy) in subjects with hypercholesterolemia. Total participation time in this study is
      expected to be up to 12 weeks, with an optional, 48-week, open-label extension period for
      participants who qualify.
