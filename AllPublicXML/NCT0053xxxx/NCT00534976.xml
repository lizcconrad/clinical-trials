  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will see if there is a change in breathing after exercising when the child
      receives study drug ( montelukast or placebo). Breathing will be measured by a spirometer
      before exercising and measured again several times after exercising.

    <measure>Maximum Percent Fall in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) After Exercise Challenge at 2 Hours Postdose</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-exercise baseline and 0-60 minutes after the exercise challenge performed 2 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum Percent Fall in FEV1 was defined as the % change from pre-exercise baseline FEV1 to the lowest FEV1 within 60 mins (minutes) after exercise. Spirometry measurements were taken 5 mins prior to each exercise challenge and immediately, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, &amp; 60 mins after each exercise challenge. The 2-hour exercise challenges occurred 2 hours after the witnessed dose of study medication. The calculation used to produce the results was [100*(1-(X/Y))] where X= the lowest FEV1 within 60 mins after exercise &amp; Y= pre-exercise baseline FEV1. Smaller values mean greater response to therapy.</description>

    <description>Maximum Percent Fall in FEV1 was defined as the % change from pre-exercise baseline FEV1 to the lowest FEV1 within 60 mins after exercise. Spirometry measurements were taken 5 mins prior to each exercise challenge and immediately, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, &amp; 60 mins after each exercise challenge. The 24-hour exercise challenges occurred 20-24 hours after the witnessed dose of study medication. The calculation used to produce the resulted results was [100*(1-(X/Y))] where X= the lowest FEV1 within 60 mins after exercise &amp; Y= pre-exercise baseline FEV1.

    <measure>Area Under the Curve for FEV1 Percent Fall From Pre-exercise Baseline to 60 Minutes Following Exercise Challenge (AUC0-60 Min) at 2 Hours Post-dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-exercise baseline to 60 minutes after the exercise challenge performed 2 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>AUC0-60min was defined as the Area Under the Curve for FEV1 percent change from pre-exercise baseline to the 60 mins following exercise challenge. The area was computed by applying the trapezoidal rule, and including only the area below the pre-exercise baseline. If a participant received β-agonist during the 60 mins after the exercise challenge, the FEV1 measurements obtained after β-agonist administration were excluded and the last pre-rescue FEV1 measurement was carried forward to the 60 mins time point in the calculation of the AUC0-60 min. Smaller values mean greater response to therapy.</description>

    <time_frame>0-60 minutes and 0-90 minutes after the exercise challenge at 2 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>This endpoint was defined as the duration between the time at which the maximum percent fall in FEV1 occurred &amp; the time when the percent fall in FEV1 returned to within 5% of the pre-exercise baseline for the first time.
Spirometry measurements were taken 5 mins prior to each exercise challenge &amp; immediately, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, &amp; 60 mins after each exercise challenge. If participant had not returned to within 5% of the pre-exercise FEV1 value by 60 mins, then measurements were obtained at 75 &amp; 90 mins.
The 2-hour exercise challenges occurred 2 hours after the witnessed dose of medication.</description>

          <description>In Period I (screening period/ placebo run-in) participants received a single-blind dose of matching-image placebo. In Period II, participants 4-5 years of age were randomized to receive one placebo 4-mg chewable tablet (single dose). Period III was the crossover to one Montelukast 4-mg chewable tablet (single dose) after a 3- to 7-day washout period. No participants 4-5 years of age were randomized, so the 4-mg doses were not dispensed. Participants 6-14 years of age were randomized to receive one placebo 5-mg chewable tablet (single dose) in Period II, crossing over to one Montelukast 5-mg chewable tablet (single dose) in Period III after a 3- to 7-day washout period.</description>

        <title>Maximum Percent Fall in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) After Exercise Challenge at 2 Hours Postdose</title>
        <description>Maximum Percent Fall in FEV1 was defined as the % change from pre-exercise baseline FEV1 to the lowest FEV1 within 60 mins (minutes) after exercise. Spirometry measurements were taken 5 mins prior to each exercise challenge and immediately, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, &amp; 60 mins after each exercise challenge. The 2-hour exercise challenges occurred 2 hours after the witnessed dose of study medication. The calculation used to produce the results was [100*(1-(X/Y))] where X= the lowest FEV1 within 60 mins after exercise &amp; Y= pre-exercise baseline FEV1. Smaller values mean greater response to therapy.</description>

        <description>AUC0-60min was defined as the Area Under the Curve for FEV1 percent change from pre-exercise baseline to the 60 mins following exercise challenge. The area was computed by applying the trapezoidal rule, and including only the area below the pre-exercise baseline. If a participant received β-agonist during the 60 mins after the exercise challenge, the FEV1 measurements obtained after β-agonist administration were excluded and the last pre-rescue FEV1 measurement was carried forward to the 60 mins time point in the calculation of the AUC0-60 min. Smaller values mean greater response to therapy.</description>

          <title>Area Under the Curve for FEV1 Percent Fall From Pre-exercise Baseline to 60 Minutes Following Exercise Challenge (AUC0-60 Min) at 24 Hours Post-dose</title>
          <description>AUC0-60min was defined as the Area Under the Curve for FEV1 percent change from pre-exercise baseline to the 60 mins following exercise challenge. The area was computed by applying the trapezoidal rule, and including only the area below the pre-exercise baseline. If a participant received β-agonist during the 60 mins after the exercise challenge, the FEV1 measurements obtained after β-agonist administration were excluded and the last pre-rescue FEV1 measurement was carried forward to the 60 mins time point in the calculation of the AUC0-60 min. Smaller values mean greater response to therapy.</description>
          <population>The analysis of efficacy data was carried out using a completers analysis population. This population included all randomized patients who received the witnessed dose of study drug in both active treatment periods and had at least one post-exercise FEV1 measurement in both active treatment periods.</population>

          <description>In Period I (screening period/ placebo run-in) participants received a single-blind dose of matching-image placebo. Participants 6-14 years of age were randomized to receive one Montelukast 5-mg chewable tablet (single dose) in Period II or Period III, according to the randomized treatment sequence assigned. Period II and Period III were separated by a washout period of 3-7 days.</description>
