  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard for recurrent, persistent or metastatic cisplatin-resistant ovarian
      cancer is palliative chemotherapy with either topotecan, liposomal doxorubicin or
      gemcitabine, however, the results need to be improved. Epigenetic aberrations play an
      important role in cancer progression by silencing growth regulatory genes and there is now
      evidence that inhibitors of DNA methylation and HDAC inhibition synergize the cytotoxicity of
      chemotherapy.

      Objective. To determine the superiority of epigenetic therapy with hydralazine and valproate
      plus topotecan over placebo plus topotecan upon progression-free survival.

      Hypothesis. Hydralazine and magnesium valproate associated to topotecan will increase
      progression-free survival from 6 to 9 months as compared with the same regimen of
      chemotherapy plus placebo.

      Randomized, double-blind phase III trial. A total of 211 patients (alpha 0.5, power 0.8)with
      cisplatin-resistant recurrent or persistent cancer will be randomized to topotecan + placebo
      or topotecan + hydralazine + valproate for 6 courses every 4 weeks. Patients will receive an
      oral dose of hydralazine of 182mg (rapid) or 83mg (slow) according to the acetylator
      phenotype in a single daily dose and magnesium valproate at an oral dose of 40mg/Kg t.i.d.
      Both drugs in a slow-release formulation. Experimental drugs or placebo will start from seven
      days before day 1 of chemotherapy until the end of the sixth course.
