  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Any efforts to spare patients with T1 carcinomas of the rectum from low anterior resection or
      even abdominoperineal resection are linked to the risk of locoregional recurrence of about
      10% (range, 0-24). This is tolerated in the view of the morbidity and mortality risk related
      to transabdominal resection, which is as high as 7-68% and 0-6.5%, respectively. Accordingly,
      in addition to transanal local excision various adjuvant therapy schemes with chemo- and/or
      radiotherapy were developed, given the uncertainty about the lymph node stage. Another
      approach was to identify histological risk criteria in the primary tumor in terms of defining
      the limits of rectum-sparing therapy.

      In earlier experimental and clinical studies the investigators researched and applied
      dorsoposterior extraperitoneal pelviscopy, i.e. perineal access to the soft-tissue areas of
      the minor pelvis using minimally invasive surgery. in T1 carcinoma of the rectum this
      technique becomes all the more significant, as the perineal approach makes it possible to
      perform an endoscopic posterior mesorectal resection (EPMR) in combination with
      rectum-sparing surgery Thereby the relevant lymphatic field of the lower rectum can be
      removed and histologically examined. As a consequence EPMR should lower the loco-regional
      recurrence rate, since the most common causes of such are pre-existent but so far not
      detectable lymph node metastases besides the incomplete resection of the primary tumor.
