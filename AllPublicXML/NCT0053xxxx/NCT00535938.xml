      The MOBILITY Project is a prospective, non-randomized, observational, multi-centre evaluation
      of Health Utility via the SF-12® Health Survey Scores and the SF-6D in patients receiving
      BOTOX® for therapeutic use.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the SF-6D Measure Health Utility (Quality of Life) Score Using the SF-12® Questionnaire for Patients With Cervical Dystonia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, SV1 (up to 505 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Cervical dystonia is a condition in which the neck muscles contract involuntarily, causing the head to turn to one side, forward or backward. The SF-12 consists of 12 questions on various health questions. Health utility is a numerical indicator of a person's preferences for a given health state or health outcome. Health utility is a sub-score ranging from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health) and is calculated from the SF-12 total score based on the following items: physical functioning, role participation, social functioning, bodily pain, mental health, and vitality and is termed SF-6D. A positive change from baseline indicates an improvement and a negative change from baseline indicates a worsening. The length of time between Baseline and Subsequent Visit 1 (SV1) is scheduled at the physician's discretion and was a maximum of 505 days for patients with cervical dystonia.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the SF-6D Measure Health Utility (Quality of Life) Score Using the SF-12® Questionnaire for Patients With Cervical Dystonia</title>
        <description>Cervical dystonia is a condition in which the neck muscles contract involuntarily, causing the head to turn to one side, forward or backward. The SF-12 consists of 12 questions on various health questions. Health utility is a numerical indicator of a person’s preferences for a given health state or health outcome. Health utility is a sub-score ranging from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health) and is calculated from the SF-12 total score based on the following items: physical functioning, role participation, social functioning, bodily pain, mental health, and vitality and is termed SF-6D. A positive change from baseline indicates an improvement and a negative change from baseline indicates a worsening. The length of time between Baseline and Subsequent Visit 1 (SV1) is scheduled at the physician’s discretion and was a maximum of 505 days for patients with cervical dystonia.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the SF-6D Measure Health Utility (Quality of Life) Score Using the SF-12® Questionnaire for Patients With Adult Focal Spasticity</title>
          <description>Adult Focal Spasticity is a condition in which muscles are continuously tight or stiff in a certain area. The SF-12 consists of 12 questions on various health questions. Health utility is a numerical indicator of a person’s preferences for a given health state or health outcome. Health utility is a sub-score ranging from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health) and is calculated from the SF-12 total score based on the following items: physical functioning, role participation, social functioning, bodily pain, mental health, and vitality and is termed SF-6D. A positive change from baseline indicates an improvement and a negative change from baseline indicates a worsening. The length of time between Baseline and Subsequent Visit 1 (SV1) is scheduled at the physician’s discretion and was a maximum of 1,562 days for patients with adult focal spasticity.</description>
