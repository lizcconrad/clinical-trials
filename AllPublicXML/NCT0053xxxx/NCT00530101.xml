      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate MR imaging in subjects receiving
      doxorubicin chemotherapy to see if MR can detect heart damage as well as or better than MUGA
      scans.

      This research study is expected to enroll approximately 10 subjects over 12 months at the
      University of Miami / Miller School of Medicine.

    <textblock>
      Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is one of the most widely used chemotherapy agents, despite its
      well-known causation of cardiac toxicity. Doxorubicin causes apoptotic cell death, as shown
      with uptake of antimyosin antibodies on nuclear medicine studies (1,2). Myocyte damage is
      dose-related, and produces left ventricular dysfunction that may lead to clinically
      significant heart failure, especially in patients with limited cardiac reserve. An estimated
      7% of patients develop doxorubicin-related congestive heart failure (CHF) after a cumulative
      dose of 550 mg/m2 (3).

      Methods to detect and prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity have been investigated for
      years. Serial evaluation of left ventricular function using Multigated Acquisition (MUGA)
      scans (radionuclide angiocardiography) was proposed over 20 years ago as one method for
      detecting cardiotoxicity (4). More sophisticated nuclear imaging (PET) has not been able to
      demonstrate early changes of cardiotoxicity (5). There are a number of potential indicators
      of early cardiotoxicity such as toxic effects on the right ventricle and on left ventricular
      diastolic (vs. systolic) function that MUGA is not optimally suited to demonstrate. Even
      earlier, an imaging manifestation of cell death could provide the first clue to impending
      cardiotoxicity (1,2,6). Cardiac MR (CMR) has the potential to address all of these facets of
      doxorubicin toxicity. Biventricular function can be assessed from cine images, and CMR is
      well-established as a highly reliable method for cardiac functional assessment. Of even
      greater potential interest, cell injury and death can be demonstrated using gadolinium
      enhancement, both for myocardial infarction (focal enhancement) as well as myocarditis (both
      focal and diffuse enhancement) (7,8). Doxorubicin toxicity may in fact share
      pathophysiological characteristics with myocarditis (9). It is our hypothesis that CMR will
      be able to show both functional and cellular (infarct, microinfarct, or myocarditis-type)
      effects of doxorubicin toxicity as determined during and at the conclusion of doxorubicin
      therapy. Specifically, we hypothesize that myocardial tissue will demonstrate a greater
      increase in signal (decrease in T1 after contrast administration) after chemotherapy as
      compared to before chemotherapy.

      Methods 1. Patient Selection: Ten patients selected to receive doxorubicin for breast cancer
      treatment will be recruited from Oncology Services at the Sylvester Cancer Center and Jackson
      Memorial Hospital. This pilot study will select patients who are at increased likelihood to
      develop cardiotoxicity, due to borderline cardiac function at baseline, advanced age, or the
      anticipation of a high cumulative dose of administered doxorubicin. Patients who will receive
      radiation therapy to the left chest during chemotherapy (i.e., left breast cancer) will be
      excluded so as to eliminate possible cardiotoxic effects from radiation. CMR studies will be
      performed at no charge to the patient, supported by the sponsor of this study. CMR imaging
      will be subject to IRB approval, informed consent, and HIPAA regulations. Contrast-enhanced
      CMR will be obtained at three time points:

        1. Prior to the first dose of doxorubicin (image characteristics will serve as control
           values to indicate later changes).

        2. After first cycle of doxorubicin.

        3. At conclusion of therapy, typically 4-6 cycles; cumulative dose of 360 to 600 mg/m2
           doxorubicin.

      In addition to standard screening for contraindications to MR imaging, patients will be
      evaluated for estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) within 30 days prior to each MR
      scan. This is to avoid the rare but potential complication of Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis
      in patients with severe or end-stage renal failure who receive gadolinium MR contrast (10).
      GFR will be calculated from serum creatinine, patient age, gender, and race, using the MDRD
      GFR Calculator ( Stephen Z. Fadem, M.D.) at:

      http://www.kidney.org/professionals/kdoqi/gfr_calculator.cfm

      Patients will not undergo contrast-enhanced MR unless calculated GFR is equal to or greater
      than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2

      2. Imaging: CMR will be performed on the Siemens 1.5T Sonata located at the University of
      Miami Outpatient Diagnostic Imaging Center. It is anticipated that each scan will require
      approximately 60 minutes. Three imaging planes (short axis [SA] series through the
      ventricles, and individual 4 chamber [4CV] and 2 chamber [2CV] views) will be utilized.
      Sequences will consist of:

      A. Precontrast imaging:

        1. T1-weighted (SA series)

        2. TI scout (single mid-ventricular SA) [The TI scout sequence obtains images at multiple
           inversion (TI) times at a single slice level]

        3. TrueFISP cine gradient echo imaging (SA series, 2CV, 4CV)

      B. Postcontrast imaging: after 0.1 mmol/kg OptiMARK intravenous

        1. 1 minute post-injection: TI scout (single mid-ventricular SA)

        2. 2-4 minutes post-injection: Turboflash inversion recovery (single mid-ventricular SA) at
           serial TI values to determine time of myocardial nulling

        3. 5 minutes post-injection: TI scout (single mid-ventricular SA)

        4. 6-9 minutes post-injection: Turboflash inversion recovery (single mid-ventricular SA) at
           serial TI values to determine time of myocardial nulling

        5. 10-14 minutes post-injection: Segmented IR delayed imaging using TI of myocardial signal
           nulling (SA series, 2CV, 4CV)

        6. 15 minutes post-injection: TI scout (single mid-ventricular SA)

        7. 16-19 minutes post-injection : Turboflash inversion recovery (single mid-ventricular SA)
           at serial TI values to determine time of myocardial nulling

        8. 20 minutes post-injection: TI scout (single mid-ventricular SA)

        9. 21 minutes post-injection : T1-weighted (SA series)

      3. Analysis: ANOVA will be used to assess for differences in measured values of the discrete
      variables listed in A, B, C, and D below. Data will be analyzed for all three imaging
      sessions together using ANOVA, and for each pair of sessions (pretreatment vs. first cycle of
      doxorubicin, first cycle of doxorubicin vs. maximum cumulative dose, and pretreatment vs.
      maximum cumulative dose) using the paired t-test (or Wilcoxon signed-rank test if variances
      unequal). The MR image sets will be analyzed in random order.

      A. TrueFISP cine: analysis will utilize the ARGUS software package on the Siemens system.
      End-diastolic and end-systolic endocardial contours will be generated using a semi-automated
      technique whereby initial manual contouring is followed by automated contour generation,
      which are then manually edited before final calculations are performed.

        1. Ejection fraction (biventricular) and ventricular volumes (end-systole and
           end-diastole).

        2. Diastolic left ventricular function I. 1/3 peak filling rate (PFR) II. 1/3 filling
           fraction (1/3 FF)

        3. Wall motion: The AHA 17-segment model will be utilized (6 segments each at basal,
           mid-ventricular, and near-apical levels, and a single apical segment). A five-point
           scale will be assigned to each segment (normal, mildly hypokinetic, severely
           hypokinetic, akinetic, dyskinetic). Summed values will yield a single measure of
           contractility for each imaging study.

      B. T1-weighted

      Region-of-interest signal intensity in the myocardium will be measured in the mid-left
      ventricular free wall, the mid-interventricular septum, and skeletal muscle for both
      precontrast and postcontrast T1-weighted imaging. We will calculate a variable representing
      &quot;percent enhancement&quot; for each location as follows:

      % enhancement = signal intensity (postcontrast) - signal intensity (precontrast) signal
      intensity (precontrast)

      C. The TI scout image sets will provide a single TI value of optimal myocardial nulling as
      well as an exponential curve to reflect the T1 recovery of myocardium at each time point of
      acquisition (precontrast, 1 minute postcontrast, 5 minutes postcontrast, 15 minutes
      postcontrast, 20 minutes postcontrast). The TI scout will be performed at multiple time
      points due to the dynamic nature of tissue enhancement after gadolinium administration.

      D. The turboflash inversion recovery image (mid-ventricular) will provide an alternative
      single TI value of optimal myocardial nulling at each time point of acquisition (2-4 minutes,
      6-9 minutes, and 16-19 minutes postinjection). The turboflash inversion recovery image will
      be performed at multiple time points due to the dynamic nature of tissue enhancement after
      gadolinium administration.

      E. Segmented IR delayed imaging will provide images of the entire myocardium which will be
      evaluated for focal myocardial signal hyperintensities, whether due to infarction or
      myocarditis. The optimum TI value determined from (D) above will be used. If identified,
      lesions will be manually contoured with use of the irregular region of interest tool on the
      console. The infarct size will then be calculated as total infarct area multiplied by the
      section thickness and the specific gravity (assumed to be 1.05 g/mL) of the myocardium.

      Medical records will provide data regarding cardiac morbidity or mortality.
