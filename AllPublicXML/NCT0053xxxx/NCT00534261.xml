      This study was to find out if patients with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis treated
      with Interferon beta-1a had an improved quality of life after treatment with Interferon
      beta-1a

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was an open-label, multi-center, international post-marketing study (phase 4).
      Eligible patients were interferon naïve patients suffering from relapsing MS. The duration of
      a subject's participation in the study was up to a maximum 26 months.
