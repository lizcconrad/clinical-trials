  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with a deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) often develop emphysema.
      Traditional lung function tests may not be the most accurate way to measure the progression
      of emphysema. This study will compare high resolution computed tomography (CT) scans to
      spirometry to measure the progression of emphysema.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AAT deficiency is a genetic disorder associated with emphysema. Spirometry, the lung function
      test that measures how well the lungs exhale air, is used to diagnose and track the
      progression of emphysema. Some studies have suggested that forced expiratory volume in 1
      second (FEV1) measurements, a type of spirometry test, may lack accuracy in detecting disease
      progression in cases of severe AAT deficiency. Another method, high resolution chest CT
      scans, may be more accurate at measuring the progression of emphysema. The purpose of this
      study is to determine if high resolution CT scans are better at detecting the progression of
      emphysema than lung function tests. Results from this study may lead to the development of a
      more accurate way to assess lung tissue loss and may improve the understanding of lung
      destruction in AAT deficiency.

      This study will last 4 years and will enroll people with AAT deficiency who have nearly
      normal lung function test results. Study visits, each lasting about 4 hours, will occur at
      baseline and months 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36. At each visit, participants will undergo lung
      function tests, a CT scan, blood collection, and a physical exam. Female participants will
      have urine collected for a pregnancy test. All participants will also complete questionnaires
      to assess health status and lung function. Study researchers will call participants every 2
      months to collect information on lung disease symptoms and medication changes.

      50 cc of serum at visits baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months and 36 months
      will be retained. These are kept at the University of Florida in the laboratory of Dr. Mark
      Brantly.

      There is an associated but independent DNA collection that is done if the patient is willing
      through an independent study and consent process with the University of Florida Alpha-1 DNA
      and Tissue Bank. This is a public resource with a scientific advisory committee with samples
      available for researcher access.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of AAT deficiency, as determined by both of the following conditions:

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or intending to become pregnant within 4 years of study entry

          -  Previous lung transplantation

          -  Sibling of a participant who is already enrolled in the study

          -  Unable to attend scheduled clinic visits

          -  Currently smokes cigarettes or marijuana or quit smoking cigarettes or marijuana in
             the 1 year prior to study entry

          -  Current or planned use of oral tobacco products or nicotine replacement products

          -  Evidence of significant long-term or acute inflammation outside the lung, including
             connective diseases, panniculitis, or acute infection

          -  Unwilling to alter bronchodilator medications for 24 hours prior to scheduled
             quantitative CT (QCT) scans

          -  Musculoskeletal disease that limits exercise by walking

          -  Required to take any of the following medications within 48 hours of scheduled lung
             function testing: dicyclomine (Bentyl), propantheline (Pro-Banthine), mepenzolate
             (Cantil), methscopolamine (Pamine), and scopolamine (Transderm-Scop)
