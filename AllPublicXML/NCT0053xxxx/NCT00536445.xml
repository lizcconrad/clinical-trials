  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present protocol will demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of a newly developed mode
      of mechanical ventilation, Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist, commonly known as NAVA.
      During NAVA, the timing and magnitude of pressure delivered are controlled by the infants'
      diaphragm electrical activity (EAdi), a validated measurement of neural respiratory drive.
      Recent clinical trials in adults and term infants have shown that NAVA is more synchronous
      than conventional pressure support ventilation, and that NAVA delivers lower mean airway
      pressures to achieve the same ventilation and respiratory muscle unloading. NAVA has recently
      been approved for use in neonates by Health Canada and the FDA in the United States, and is
      commercially available on the Servoi ventilator (Maquet Critical Care, Solna, Sweden). The
      present protocol is designed as a &quot;case study&quot; where the researchers responsible would like
      to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of ventilating a premature baby on NAVA with the
      Servoi for 12 hours.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Preterm newborn (&gt;1 day postnatal age, gestational age &gt;23 weeks, birth weight
             &lt;1250g), intubated and mechanically ventilated, and breathing spontaneously, as
             defined by the ability to trigger the ventilator. The infant should be breathing on
             conventional ventilation (SIMV, assist control, or pressure support) with the
             following ventilator parameters: assist control/pressure support &lt; 22 cm H2O, PEEP 4-6
             cm H2O Fi02&lt;.30

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pneumothorax, degenerative neuromuscular disease, bleeding disorders, cardiovascular
             instability, cyanotic congenital cardiovascular disease, phrenic nerve
             damage/diaphragm paralysis, esophageal perforation, use of high frequency oscillatory
             or jet ventilation, contraindication to changing NG tube, or if infant is deemed &quot;too
             unstable&quot; by the clinical team. The use of narcotics is an exclusion criteria.
