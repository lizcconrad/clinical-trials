        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult subjects, aged 18 years or older, AMS diagnosed (clinically and radiologically)
             who were willing to undergo rhinoscopic aspiration or deep nasal swab at the
             baseline/pre-therapy visit. Female subjects of childbearing potential were required to
             have a negative pregnancy test before undergoing any study procedure and to use an
             accepted contraceptive method during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who were breast-feeding or pregnant, as demonstrated by serum or urine pregnancy
             tests carried out before exposure to study medication or the start of any study
             procedure that could pose a risk to the fetus;

          -  Subjects with a history of recurrent sinusitis (defined as more than 3 episodes of
             sinusitis that required antibiotic therapy in the preceding 12 months);

          -  Subjects with a history of chronic sinusitis (defined as symptoms lasting greater than
             28 days);

          -  Subjects with sphenoidal sinusitis involvement that required treatment other than oral
             antibiotics;

          -  Subjects with nosocomial-acquired sinusitis within 2 weeks (eg, hospitalization or
             nonambulatory, institutional confinement, including nursing homes);

          -  Subjects with any concomitant medication [including functionally significant, major
             obstructive anatomical lesions likely to impair resolution of infection (eg, nasal

             as: asthma, cystic fibrosis, immotile cilia syndrome, prior nasopharyngeal or sinus
             surgery, sinus polyps, clinically relevant cardiovascular (eg, congestive heart
             failure), neurologic, endocrine, or other major systemic disease that could have made
             implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study results difficult;

          -  Subjects with a need for immediate surgery for maxillary sinusitis;

          -  Subjects who used nasal, nasogastric, or nasotracheal catheters;

             the past 7 days;

          -  Subject who were long-term (&gt; than or = to 4 weeks) users of nasal decongestants like
             oxymetazoline 0.05%;

          -  Subjects with suspected nonbacterial infections;

          -  Subjects with a concomitant odontological infection that would require antibiotic
             therapy or surgery;

          -  Subjects with unknown or suspected hypersensitivity to, or a known or suspected
             serious adverse reaction to either study medication, any fluoroquinolone, or any
             macrolide antibiotic;

          -  Subjects who would likely have required on-study treatment with drugs known to have
             contraindicated drug interactions with either study medication and/or macrolides or
             fluoroquinolones in general, including, but not limited to: ergot alkaloid
             derivatives, cholinesterase inhibitors (eg, tacrine, donepezil, physostigmine)
             ketamine, carbamazepine, St John's Wort, Class IA (eg, quinidine, procainamide), or
             Class III antiarrhythmic agents (eg, amiodarone, sotalol);

          -  Subjects who required anticoagulant therapy (eg, warfarin);

          -  Subjects who received treatment with other systemic antibiotics (oral or parenteral)
             within 14 days prior to study enrollment;

          -  Subject who received moxifloxacin or another fluoroquinolone antibiotic for this
             infectious episode;

          -  Likelihood of required treatment during the study period with drugs not permitted by
             the protocol;

          -  Treatment with any investigational product in the last 1 month prior to study entry;

          -  Subjects with a progressively fatal disease; life expectancy &lt;less than or = to 3
             months;

          -  Clinically relevant cardiovascular, hepatic, neurologic, endocrine, or other major
             systemic disease making implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study
             results difficult;

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse;

          -  Impaired hepatic function [as shown by previous clinical laboratory values of AST
             (SGOT) and/or ALT (SGPT) &gt; than or = to 3 times the upper limit of reference range,
             total bilirubin &gt; than 2 times the upper limit of reference range (except for
             Gilbert's disease), encephalopathy, etc];

             previous ECG has invalidated this risk factor), or personal history of coronary
             disease, ventricular arrhythmia, bradycardia &lt; 50 beats/min, or known uncorrected
             hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, or who were treated with concomitant medication known

             CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as: protease inhibitors, ketoconazole);

          -  Subjects without a permanent residential address or home telephone number;

          -  Any waiver of these inclusion/exclusion criteria was to be approved by the
             investigator and Aventis on a case-by-case basis, prior to study enrollment. This was
