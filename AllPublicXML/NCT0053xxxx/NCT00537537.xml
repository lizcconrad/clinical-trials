    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of add-on adefovir to telbivudine in
      non-responders to telbivudine monotherapy after 24 and 36 initial weeks. Antiviral efficacy
      is assessed by hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA non-detectability (PCR &lt;300 copies/ml) by week 104
      with CHB.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Male or female, at least 18 yrs of age; HBsAg positive, HBeAg positive and anti-HBe
        negative at the time of screening; Quantifiable serum HBV DNA levels of &gt;105copies/ml; ALT
        levels any level; Treatment na√Øve; Baseline liver histology in case of ALT levels within
        normal limits performed within last 12 months) indicative of chronic hepatitis B changes
        Metavir score F &gt;2; Willing and able to comply with the study drug regimen and all other
        study requirements; The patient or guardian is willing and able to explore written informed
        consent to participate in the study. Exclusion Criteria:

        Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
        serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) at Screening visit; Patient is of
        childbearing potential (men and women) and unwilling to use a barrier method of
        contraception. It is required that a barrier method of contraception be used (i.e. condom
        with spermicide or diaphragm with spermicide) by patients of childbearing potential (men
        and women) regardless of whether a hormonal agent also is used as a method of
        contraception; Patient is co infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV. Patients will be
        tested for antibodies to HCV &amp; HIV in the Screening assessments;Patient has a medical
        condition that requires prolonged or frequent use of systemic acyclovir or famciclovir;
        Patient is currently abusing alcohol or illicit drugs, or has a history of alcohol abuse or
        illicit substance abuse within the preceding two years; Patient has a medical condition
        that requires frequent or prolonged use of systemic corticosteroids; Patients who has been
        on warfarin or other anticoagulants during 30 days prior to screening or if expected during
        the present study; Patient has any other concurrent medical condition, at clinician's
        discretion, likely to preclude compliance with the schedule of evaluations in the protocol,
        or likely to confound the efficacy or safety observations of the study Other protocol
        defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
