      Purpose of the study is to determine midazolam's safety and dose-linearity when delivered
      intramuscularly via an autoinjector. The proposed initial treatment dosage for seizures
      induced by exposure to nerve agents.

      The investigational drug product being evaluated in this study is the Midazolam Autoinjector.
      This system is composed of an autoinjector filled with the drug product midazolam EP. The
      study drug is administered IM into the anterior thigh using the preloaded autoinjector. This
      method of administration was selected as it is the method that will be used in later clinical
      trials and for the marketed product. The autoinjectors were preloaded with midazolam 5 mg or
      10 mg with a total volume of 1 or 2 mL. Healthy subjects are assigned to one of six target
      dosage groups (0.10, 0.18, 0.25, 0.33, 0.40, 0.49 mg/kg) and, based on their weight, received
      the necessary combination of fixed 5 or 10 mg doses to provide the assigned target dose.
