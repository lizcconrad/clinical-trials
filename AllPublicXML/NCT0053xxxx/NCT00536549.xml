      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Guardian Continuous Glucose Monitoring
      System in the home setting is more useful than frequent self blood glucose monitoring with a
      view to modifying patient's diet and exercise habits or improvement self disease control
      efforts and at last glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In diabetes management, compliance, disease awareness and empowerment of the patient play an
      important role and the immediate feedback on the effects of diet and exercise that the self
      monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) may provide, could enhance patient empowerment. Increased use
      of SMBG has been shown to be associated with improved medication compliance and better
      metabolic control by several studies. However, because of many factors, including pain and
      inconvenience, many diabetic patients do not accept frequent fingersticks for self blood
      glucose monitoring (SBGM) levels. In addition, the SBGM result gives the data for only a few
      seconds, without any information on glucose trends.

      So we need new glucose monitoring method that could reflect glucose trends and glycemic
      excursion continuously because glucose monitoring still remains the cornerstone of evaluating
      the efficacy of therapy and motivating self disease control in subjects with diabetes.

      Few studies have examined the effects of real time continuous glucose monitoring system
      targeting type 2 diabetes. So our goal is to determine whether the Guardian Continuous
      Glucose Monitoring System in the home setting is more useful than frequent self blood glucose
      monitoring with a view to modifying patient's diet and exercise habits or improvement self
      disease control efforts and at last glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes
