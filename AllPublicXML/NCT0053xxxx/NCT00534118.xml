      RATIONALE: Giving an infusion of donor lymphocytes may be able to kill cancer cells in
      patients with hematologic cancer that has come back after a donor stem cell transplant.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well donor lymphocyte infusion works in treating
      patients with recurrent or persistent hematologic cancer after donor stem cell transplant.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine if the complete response rate exceeds 10% in patients with recurrent or
           persistent hematologic malignancies treated with donor lymphocyte infusion.

      Secondary

        -  Estimate the complete response rate in these patients.

        -  Assess the toxicity of donor lymphocyte infusion in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive up to four donor lymphocyte infusions at least 1 month apart in the
      absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or uncontrolled graft-versus-host
      disease.
