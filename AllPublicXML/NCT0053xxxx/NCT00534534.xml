  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective studies have shown, that about half of the patients will have a recurrent
      episode after the first acute alcoholic pancreatitis. Of the patients in hospital, more than
      half annually are treated for recurrent acute pancreatitis. Because alcohol has been shown an
      important factor in the development of recurrent pancreatitis, it was hypothesized, that by
      attempting intensively to diminish the individual alcohol consumption the number of recurrent
      pancreatitis could be decreased. Two protocols will be compared: A) initial intervention
      against alcohol abuse and B) repeated interventions at 6 month intervals.

    <description>All these patients will be advised, i.e. undergo behavioural intervention, against alcohol use in the standard fashion. No drugs will be used. In addition, they also will undergo repeated similar interventions at 6 mo intervals. They are re-examined at two years for alcohol consumption and for the number of recurrent pancreatitis during the two year period.</description>

    <description>All these patients will be advised, i.e. undergo &quot;behavioural intervention&quot;, against alcohol use in the standard fashion as those in the standard group. No drugs will be used as part of the intervention. They also will undergo repeated interventions at outpatient visits at 6 mo intervals. They are re-examined at two years for alcohol consumption and for the number of recurrent pancreatitis during the two year period.</description>
