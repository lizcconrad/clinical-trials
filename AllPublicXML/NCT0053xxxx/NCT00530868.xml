  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this trial is to show that the combination of Avastin and hormone therapy
      should be more effective than hormone therapy alone for the treatment of breast cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical and clinical data have demonstrated that up-regulation of tumor cell VEGF is an
      important mechanism to subvert estrogen dependence in hormone responsive breast cancer
      resulting in reduced therapy response or tumor resistance to hormonal therapy; thus, it is
      hypothesized that the combination of an anti-VEGF agent (Avastin, an anti-VEGF monoclonal
      antibody) and hormonal therapy should be more effective than hormonal therapy alone for the
      treatment of breast cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients must meet the following criteria to be eligible for study entry:

          -  Pathologically confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive lobular carcinoma of
             the breast, T2-T3 / T4a-c / N0-2 / M0, with positive estrogen and/or progesterone
             receptors, and Her-2-neu negative. Patients with inflammatory breast cancer will not
             be included (T4d). Patients previously treated patients with no measurable disease or
             patients with metastatic disease will be excluded.

          -  Give written informed consent prior to study specific screening procedures, with the
             understanding that the patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time,
             without prejudice.

          -  Patients must be postmenopausal, defined as one of the following:

               -  Patients &gt; 50 years of age with no spontaneous menses for at least 12 months,

               -  Bilateral oophorectomy

          -  Be ambulatory (outpatient) and have an ECOG PS &lt;1.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease by mammogram and/or breast ultrasound (in
             special cases a dedicated breast MRI may be clinically indicated). The target lesion
             must not have been previously irradiated.

          -  No prior chemotherapy.

          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined as follows: absolute
             neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mm3, hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dl, platelets &gt; 75,000/mm3, total
             bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl, serum creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dl, Transaminases (AST, ALT) may be up to
             2 x institutional upper limit of normal. In addition &lt; 1 gr of protein in 24 hr urine
             collection and urine protein/creatinine ratio &lt; 1.0.

          -  No life threatening parenchymal disease or rapidly progressing disease warranting
             cytotoxic chemotherapy.
