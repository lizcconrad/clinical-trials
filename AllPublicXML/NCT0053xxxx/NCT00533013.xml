  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a nurse-led, comprehensive disease
      management program is effective in reducing recurrent hospital admissions and deaths in
      community dwelling patients with moderate to severe heart failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure remains a significant cause of death, in spite of recent declines in overall
      mortality from cardiovascular disease. Heart failure is associated with increasing costs for
      healthcare, mainly for recurrent hospital admissions. Disease management programs aimed to
      improve patients outcome while containing healthcare costs,were employed in heart failure
      patients with varying results. Such programs contain various components, including patient
      education and empowerment, monitoring patients' adherence to therapy, telemonitoring of vital
      parameters, etc. Designated heart failure clinics were also employed in care given to these
      patients.
