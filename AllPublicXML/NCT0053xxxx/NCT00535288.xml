  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate efficacy and safety of 4 doses of esmirtazapine, compared to placebo, in the
      treatment of moderate to severe hot flushes (vasomotor symptoms) associated with the
      menopause. Co-primary efficacy endpoints are the frequency and severity of hot flushes after
      4 and 12 weeks as compared to Baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most direct treatment of hot flushes may be by means of 5-HT2A receptor antagonist.
      Mirtazapine is a potent blocker of 5-HT2A receptors and was found to be effective in reducing
      the number and intensity of hot flushes in preliminary trials. Also several Selective
      Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and other similar compounds have been investigated to
      manage hot flushes, confirming the role of the serotonergic system. In the present trial, the
      efficacy and safety of four different doses of esmirtazapine compared to placebo were
      investigated in women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with the
      menopause. The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate superior efficacy in at
      least one of the four doses of esmirtazapine as compared to placebo on the four following
      co-primary endpoints: 1) the mean change from baseline in average daily frequency of moderate
      and severe vasomotor symptoms at Week 4; 2) the mean change from baseline in average daily
      frequency of moderate and severe vasomotor symptoms at Week 12; 3) the mean change from
      baseline in average daily severity of moderate and severe vasomotor symptoms at Week 4; 4)
      the mean change from baseline in average daily severity of moderate and severe vasomotor
      symptoms at Week 12. The number and severity of hot flushes was recorded by means of
      electronic diary by the subjects.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Frequency of Moderate/Severe Vasomotor Symptoms (Frequency Score A) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded the frequency (number) of vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes) on an electronic diary card (LogPadÂ®) on a daily basis during screening and treatment. Frequency Score A was based on the number of moderate hot flushes + the number of severe hot flushes in one day. Baseline average was derived from, at most, 7 completely observed pre-treatment days. Weekly averages during treatment were calculated if at least 4 days with non-missing data were completely observed; if less than 4 days were completely observed, the averages of the previous week were carried forward (last observation carried forward, or LOCF). If the number of days observed in Week 1 were not sufficient, baseline values were carried forward.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Severity of Moderate/Severe Vasomotor Symptoms (Severity Score A) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded the severity of hot flushes on a LogPad on a daily basis during screening and treatment. The severity of hot flushes was defined as: mild (sensation of heat without sweating); moderate (sensation of heat with sweating, able to continue activity); and severe (sensation of heat with sweating, causing cessation of activity). Severity Score A was calculated as the number of moderate hot flushes x 2 + the number of severe hot flushes x 3, divided by the total number of moderate and severe hot flushes per week. If no hot flushes were experienced, this was to be recorded as 'no sensation of heat'. Baseline values were based on, at most, 7 completely observed pre-treatment days. If less than 4 days were completely observed during treatment, the averages of the previous week were carried forward (LOCF). If the number of days observed in Week 1 were not sufficient, baseline values were carried forward.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) Sleep Problems Symptoms Domain Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The WHQ is a 36-item, user-friendly, and rapid way of assessing nine domains of physical and emotional health for mid-aged women. Participants self-administered the WHQ questionnaire; scoring is based on a 4-point scale as follows: 'Yes definitely=1', 'Yes sometimes=2', 'No not much=3' and 'No not at all=4'. Each score is transformed to a value '1' for scores '1' and '2' and to a value '0' for scores '3' and '4'. Sleep problems encompass Items 1, 11, and 29 of the 36 total items. The transformed sums of items 1, 11, and 29 were divided by 3 to get the score; therefore, the domain ranges from 0 to 1, where lower values are better.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Frequency of Moderate/Severe Vasomotor Symptoms (Frequency Score A) at Week 4</title>
        <description>Participants recorded the frequency (number) of vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes) on an electronic diary card (LogPadÂ®) on a daily basis during screening and treatment. Frequency Score A was based on the number of moderate hot flushes + the number of severe hot flushes in one day. Baseline average was derived from, at most, 7 completely observed pre-treatment days. Weekly averages during treatment were calculated if at least 4 days with non-missing data were completely observed; if less than 4 days were completely observed, the averages of the previous week were carried forward (last observation carried forward, or LOCF). If the number of days observed in Week 1 were not sufficient, baseline values were carried forward.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Severity of Moderate/Severe Vasomotor Symptoms (Severity Score A) at Week 4</title>
        <description>Participants recorded the severity of hot flushes on a LogPad on a daily basis during screening and treatment. The severity of hot flushes was defined as: mild (sensation of heat without sweating); moderate (sensation of heat with sweating, able to continue activity); and severe (sensation of heat with sweating, causing cessation of activity). Severity Score A was calculated as the number of moderate hot flushes x 2 + the number of severe hot flushes x 3, divided by the total number of moderate and severe hot flushes per week. If no hot flushes were experienced, this was to be recorded as âno sensation of heatâ. Baseline values were based on, at most, 7 completely observed pre-treatment days. If less than 4 days were completely observed during treatment, the averages of the previous week were carried forward (LOCF). If the number of days observed in Week 1 were not sufficient, baseline values were carried forward.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Frequency of Moderate/Severe Vasomotor Symptoms (Frequency Score A) by Week Excluding Weeks 4 and 12</title>
        <description>Participants recorded the frequency (number) of vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes) on a LogPad on a daily basis during screening and treatment. Frequency Score A was based on the number of moderate hot flushes + the number of severe hot flushes in one day. Baseline average was derived from, at most, 7 completely observed pre-treatment days. Weekly averages during treatment were calculated if at least 4 days with non-missing data were completely observed; if less than 4 days were completely observed, the averages of the previous week were carried forward (LOCF). If the number of days observed in Week 1 were not sufficient, baseline values were carried forward.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Severity of Moderate/Severe Vasomotor Symptoms (Severity Score A) by Week Excluding Weeks 4 and 12</title>
        <description>Participants recorded the severity of hot flushes on a LogPad on a daily basis during screening and treatment. The severity of hot flushes was defined as: mild (sensation of heat without sweating); moderate (sensation of heat with sweating, able to continue activity); and severe (sensation of heat with sweating, causing cessation of activity). Severity Score A was calculated as the number of moderate hot flushes x 2 + the number of severe hot flushes x 3, divided by the total number of moderate and severe hot flushes per week. If no hot flushes were experienced, this was to be recorded as âno sensation of heatâ. Baseline values were based on, at most, 7 completely observed pre-treatment days. If less than 4 days were completely observed during treatment, the averages of the previous week were carried forward (LOCF). If the number of days observed in Week 1 were not sufficient, baseline values were carried forward.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Severity of Moderate/Severe Vasomotor Symptoms (Severity Score A) by Week Excluding Weeks 4 and 12</title>
          <description>Participants recorded the severity of hot flushes on a LogPad on a daily basis during screening and treatment. The severity of hot flushes was defined as: mild (sensation of heat without sweating); moderate (sensation of heat with sweating, able to continue activity); and severe (sensation of heat with sweating, causing cessation of activity). Severity Score A was calculated as the number of moderate hot flushes x 2 + the number of severe hot flushes x 3, divided by the total number of moderate and severe hot flushes per week. If no hot flushes were experienced, this was to be recorded as âno sensation of heatâ. Baseline values were based on, at most, 7 completely observed pre-treatment days.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Frequency of Mild to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms (Frequency Score B) by Week</title>
        <description>Participants recorded the frequency (number) of vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes) on a LogPad on a daily basis during screening and treatment. Frequency Score B was based on the number of mild hot flushes + the number of moderate hot flushes + the number of severe hot flushes in one day. Baseline average was derived from, at most, 7 completely observed pre-treatment days. Weekly averages during treatment were calculated if at least 4 days with non-missing data were completely observed; if less than 4 days were completely observed, the averages of the previous week were carried forward (LOCF). If the number of days observed in Week 1 were not sufficient, baseline values were carried forward.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Severity of Mild to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms (Severity Score B) by Week</title>
        <description>Participants recorded the severity of hot flushes on a LogPad on a daily basis during screening and treatment. The severity of hot flushes was defined as: mild (sensation of heat without sweating); moderate (sensation of heat with sweating, able to continue activity); and severe (sensation of heat with sweating, causing cessation of activity). Severity Score B was calculated as the number of mild hot flushes + the number of moderate hot flushes x 2 + the number of severe hot flushes x 3, divided by the total number of all hot flushes per week. If no hot flushes were experienced, this was to be recorded as âno sensation of heatâ. Baseline values were based on, at most, 7 completely observed pre-treatment days. If less than 4 days were completely observed during treatment, the averages of the previous week were carried forward (LOCF). If the number of days observed in Week 1 were not sufficient, baseline values were carried forward.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Severity of Mild to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms (Severity Score B) by Week</title>
          <description>Participants recorded the severity of hot flushes on a LogPad on a daily basis during screening and treatment. The severity of hot flushes was defined as: mild (sensation of heat without sweating); moderate (sensation of heat with sweating, able to continue activity); and severe (sensation of heat with sweating, causing cessation of activity). Severity Score B was calculated as the number of mild hot flushes + the number of moderate hot flushes x 2 + the number of severe hot flushes x 3, divided by the total number of all hot flushes per week. If no hot flushes were experienced, this was to be recorded as âno sensation of heatâ. Baseline values were based on, at most, 7 completely observed pre-treatment days. If less than 4 days were completely observed during treatment, the averages of the previous week were carried forward (LOCF). If the number of days observed in Week 1 were not sufficient, baseline values were carried forward.</description>
          <population>The ITT population, defined as all randomized participants who had at least one pre-baseline and at least one post-baseline average of the number of hot flushes in a week.</population>

        <title>Total Number of Responders by Week</title>
        <description>A participant was defined as a (hot flush) responder for a study week if a reduction of at least 50% for average daily frequency of moderate/severe vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes) (Frequency Score A) compared to Baseline was recorded. A study week was taken into account if at least 4 days were completely observed. The last observation was carried forward if there were less than 4 complete days observed. In cases where Week 1 did not have 4 days that were completely observed, the participant was considered a non-responder. An LOCF approach was used.</description>

        <description>A participant was defined as a (hot flush) remitter for a study week if at most one moderate/severe vasomotor symptom per day on average was recorded. A study week was taken into account if at least 4 days were completely observed. The last observation was carried forward if there were less than 4 complete days observed. In cases where Week 1 did not have 4 days that were completely observed, the participant was considered a non-remitter.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) Sleep Problems Symptoms Domain Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The WHQ is a 36-item, user-friendly, and rapid way of assessing nine domains of physical and emotional health for mid-aged women. Participants self-administered the WHQ questionnaire; scoring is based on a 4-point scale as follows: âYes definitely=1â, âYes sometimes=2â, âNo not much=3â and âNo not at all=4â. Each score is transformed to a value â1â for scores â1â and â2â and to a value â0â for scores â3â and â4â. Sleep problems encompass Items 1, 11, and 29 of the 36 total items. The transformed sums of items 1, 11, and 29 were divided by 3 to get the score; therefore, the domain ranges from 0 to 1, where lower values are better.</description>
