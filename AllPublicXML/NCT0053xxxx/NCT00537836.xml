  <official_title>A Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo and Active Controlled, Multicenter Study to Investigate Efficacy and Safety After Oral Administration of 2 and 3 mg ZK 283197, 1 mg 17ß-estradiol and Placebo Once Daily for 8 Weeks in Postmenopausal Women With Hot Flushes</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the planned study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of ZK 283197
      in the dosage of 2 and 3 mg ingested once daily during a period of 8 weeks for the treatment
      of hot flushes. In order to be able to assess the efficacy of the test substance, this is
      compared with the efficacy of 1 mg Estradiol and placebo. The comparator Estradiol is a
      certified hormone preparation, which is already used for the treatment of hot flushes as
      standard treatment. After passing the screening, volunteers will start with a run-in phase
      followed by a 8 weeks treatment and a follow-up phase. 112 postmenopausal women with hot
      flushes and without relevant prior diseases will participate in three European countries (2
      study sites in Germany, 1 study site in Great Britain and 1 study site in The Netherlands) in
      this study.
