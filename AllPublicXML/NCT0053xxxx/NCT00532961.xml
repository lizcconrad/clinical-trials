    <textblock>
      Phase IV, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group clinical trial comparing the ocular
      tolerability and steroid-induced intraocular pressure (IOP) effects of Zylet wth that of
      TobraDex in healthy volunteers, when either product was administered QID (at approximately
      4-hour intervals) for 28 days.
