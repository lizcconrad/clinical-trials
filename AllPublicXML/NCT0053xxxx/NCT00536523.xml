      RATIONALE: Gathering information about changes in serotonin levels in patients undergoing
      chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer may help
      doctors learn more about constipation caused by chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how blood levels of serotonin effect constipation
      caused by chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer, fallopian tube
      cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine if there are any alterations in serotonin levels in patients undergoing
           chemotherapy for ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer and if this is
           associated with increased constipation.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo blood sample collection prior to beginning of planned postoperative
      chemotherapy, after 3 and 6 courses of chemotherapy, and at the 3-month surveillance visit.
      Patients also complete a bowel function questionnaire at these time points.

      A blood sample (5 ml red top tube) will be drawn before the patient's first chemotherapy
      treatment, after the 3rd cycle of chemotherapy, at the post chemotherapy follow-up visit
      (approximately 30 days after chemotherapy is completed) and approximately 4 months after
      completion of chemotherapy at the time of a routine follow-up visit. Whenever possible, the
      blood will be drawn at the same time blood is being collected for clinical purposes therefore
      flexibility is allowed in the timing of the research related bloods.
