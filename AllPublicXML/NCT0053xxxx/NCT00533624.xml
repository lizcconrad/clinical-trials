      The comparison the incidence of G.I. toxicity between Myfortic® vs. Cellcept® in 150
      sequential patients, in which 75 will be randomized to Cellcept® and 75 to Myfortic® in first
      and second living or deceased donor renal transplant recipients.

      Purpose and Description:

      The purpose of the study is to determine if gastrointestinal toxicity of an anti-rejection
      medication Myfortic® (mycophenolic acid delayed release) is less than equivalent doses of a
      similar anti-rejection medication Cellcept® (mycophenolate mofetil, MMF) in patients
      receiving their first or second kidney transplant from cadaver or living donors.

      This study consist of two randomized groups, 75 patients given 3 doses of Thymoglobullin
      (Group I) vs. 75 patients given 3 doses of Thymoglobulin and 2 doses of Basiliximab (Group
      II).

      Our standard maintenance protocol dosing of tacrolimus, IMPDH inhibitor (vide infra) and one
      week course of corticosteroids.

      Patients will be randomized to receive Myfortic® 1,440 mg/day vs. Cellcept® 2,000 mg/day,
      each in two divided doses (induced with either the IL-2 receptor inhibitors or
      thymoglobulin). Tacrolimus will be dosed to 12-hour trough levels of 8-10 ng/ml.
      Methylprednisolone is to be given as per our center protocols, weaning to dose levels of &lt;0.1
      mg/kg by 3-6 months post-operatively.
