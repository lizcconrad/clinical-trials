      Evaluation of NLA Nasal Spray with regard to taste perversion and local tolerance

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral or intranasal antihistamines is the first line treatment for allergic rhinitis.
      Cetirizine is a second-generation selective antihistamine widely used in an oral formulation
      for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Local administration of cetirizine has been shown to
      reduce symptoms after allergen challenge, and has the potential to shorten the time to onset
      and decrease systemic side effects. However, local irritation and nasal burning/pain has been
      reported after nasal administration. For the compliance of the patients taking a nasal spray,
      the taste and tolerance of the product is of particular importance. NLA Nasal Spray contains
      cetirizine in a liposomal formulation aiming to improve the tolerability. The present study
      aims to compare the NLA Nasal Spray with cetirizine in an aqueous formulation and placebo
      with regard to taste perversion and local tolerance. This will be investigated off-season in
      patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis after provocation with allergen.
