      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of JNJ-18054478 measured by the
      percent change from baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in one Second (FEV1) after 12 weeks
      of therapy in patients with persistent asthma.

    <textblock>
      Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide. This is a randomized (study
      medication assigned by chance), double-blind study (neither the physician or the patient
      knows which drug they are receiving, active or placebo) to Investigate the effectiveness and
      safety of 12 weeks of dosing with JNJ-18054478 (300 mg taken orally once daily) compared with
      placebo in patients with persistent asthma. The hypothesis is that the study drug will be
      more effective in treatment of asthma than placebo as measured by the percent change from
      baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in one Second (FEV1) after 12 weeks of therapy, without
      any significant adverse events. Safety evaluations will include, monitoring for adverse
      reactions, clinical laboratory tests of blood and urine, ECGs to monitor the cardiovascular
      system, vital signs and physical examinations. Patients will take three capsules (100 mg) of
      JNJ-18054478 orally once daily for 12 weeks or placebo for the same period.
