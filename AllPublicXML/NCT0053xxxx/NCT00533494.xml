  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the advent of efficacious medicines, there is a gap between ideal and actual care in
      the achievement of recommended outcomes among diabetic patients. The study enrolled 429
      diabetic patients attending four HMO clinics in Israel, two in the northern region and two in
      the southern region. All clinics were randomly selected from all clinics affiliated with the
      Faculty of Health Sciences of the Ben Gurion University. The objective of the study was to
      compare the effects of a multi-component physician-patient intervention to physician feedback
      alone on a combined outcome of diabetes, blood pressure and serum lipids control. We
      hypothesized that in medical practices where physicians have received feedback on quality of
      care indicators, patients who received a letter encouraging them to discuss a list of
      important diabetes-related issues with their doctors, would experience better outcomes
      compared to patients who did no received such a letter.
