      This study will evaluate how the immune system responds to influenza infection and compare
      how the infection differs in patients with a weakened immune system versus those with a
      healthy immune system.

      Patients at the NIH Clinical Center who are older than 2 years of age and who are diagnosed
      with influenza A or B may be eligible for this study. Patients with healthy immune systems
      and weakened immune systems are included.

      Participants answer questions about how they are feeling and have a physical examination to
      evaluate their symptoms. Blood and nasal fluid are collected on the first day and then every
      other day for a total of 8 days. Nasal fluid is collected by either inserting a small tube in
      the nose and washing the nose with salt water and collecting the fluid obtained, or by
      rubbing the inside of the nose with a swab. Physical examinations are repeated on the days
      that blood and nasal fluid are collected.

      Influenza viruses cause significant morbidity each year, and past epidemics and pandemics
      have caused significant mortality. The impact influenza has or could have on the increasing
      number of patients who are immunocompromised due to acute and chronic diseases as well as
      immunosuppressive therapies is largely unknown. Limited information is available about the
      innate immune response to influenza and how chronic illness and immunosuppression may affect
      the immune response to the virus in comparison to that seen in normal hosts.

      We will evaluate both immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised (control group) patients
      from the local community, Washington Hospital Center, and the NIH Clinical Center. Patients
      with known or suspected influenza will be evaluated by recording their symptoms, collecting
      their blood and nasal fluid specimens, and isolating their viruses. Each patient s infection
      will be mapped by performing genomic analysis of the viral isolates collected during the
      patient s infection (which will include analysis of sequences known to confer resistance to
      antiviral medication), measuring cytokine levels in blood and nasal fluid, and measuring
      influenza-specific antibody responses. Correlation of these results with clinical symptoms
      and clinical outcomes will be evaluated. Elucidation of these responses and the genomic
      changes the virus may undergo during infection and treatment for influenza in both normal and
      immunocompromised patients may help to better understand the impact influenza has on the
      overall health of patients, as well as what strategies may be performed to better protect or
      treat patients during the emergence of a new pandemic.
