    <textblock>
      Depression is very common in epilepsy. Depression is the strongest predictor of poor quality
      of life in patients with epilepsy. The biological basis for depression in epilepsy remains
      poorly understood. This study uses functional MRI (fMRI) to examine brain response to
      emotional and non-emotional stimuli in healthy control subjects and in patients with epilepsy
      who are either depressed or not depressed. Results from this study will contribute to a
      better understanding of depression in epilepsy, which may eventually inform development of
      better treatment modalities..
