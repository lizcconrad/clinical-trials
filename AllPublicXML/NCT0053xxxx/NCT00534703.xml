  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine the safety and feasibility of giving an adeno-associated
      viral vector expressing the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2a), driven by the
      CMV promoter (AAV1-CMV-SERCA2a), to heart failure patients that have received a left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) for an accepted clinical indication. It is a randomised,
      double-blind study of 24 patients that will be randomised to receive either the study drug
      (AAV1.SERCA2a) or placebo.

      The purpose of gene transfer of SERCA2a is to improve systolic and diastolic function of the
      failing ventricle. Studies show that reduction of SERCA2a in failing ventricle is a key
      factor in depression of contraction, and that restoration of SERCA2a levels can improve
      function to near normal levels. The vector will be delivered during a cardiac catheterisation
      procedure by a 10-minute infusion into the coronary arteries.

      Myocardial tissue is obtained at the time of LVAD placement, as a routine part of device
      implantation. Further samples will be obtained when the heart is transplanted or the LVAD
      removed. Measures of tissue inflammation as well as efficacy of gene transfer will be made by
      comparing these two samples. Recovery of contractile function of the heart will be assessed
      during attempts to wean patients from the LVAD using standard protocols.

      The results will be assessed in conjunction with two companion studies which will start
      earlier in the US, one performing SERCA2a gene transfer with the same vector, but delivered
      by direct injection into the myocardium during LVAD insertion, and one using AAV1-CMV-SERCA2a
      delivered percutaneously in heart failure patients. The latter has both a dose-ranging and
      placebo-controlled arm.
