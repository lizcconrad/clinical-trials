      This is an open-label, multicenter pilot study in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare progression-free survival using a treatment
      regimen selected by molecular profiling with progression-free survival for the most recent
      regimen the patient has progressed on.

      To be eligible, patients must have received at least two lines of prior chemotherapeutic,
      hormonal or biological regimens for advanced disease, have measurable or evaluable,
      refractory disease and have clear documentation of the time between treatment start and
      documented progression on the last treatment prior to study entry. Eligible patients must
      undergo or have available a tumor biopsy for molecular profiling within 2 months of IHC/FISH
      and/or DNA microarray analysis.
