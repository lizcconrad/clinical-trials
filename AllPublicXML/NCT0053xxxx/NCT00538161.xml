  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose that as low tidal volume ventilation has proven to be beneficial in patients with
      established ARDS it may have a role in preventing the onset of acute lung injury in the
      cardiac surgical population. Institution of low tidal volume ventilation in the operating
      room may reduce the release of the cytokines and interleukins that have been known to
      contribute to the development of acute lung injury. In this study, we propose that the
      institution of low tidal volume ventilation in the operating room will reduce the incidence
      of acute lung injury. Measurement of PaO2 to FiO2 ratio twenty four and forty eight hours
      post operatively will help determine if there is a difference in oxygenation between the two
      groups. Chest X-ray findings, time to extubation and length of ICU stay will also determine
      if there is a role for low tidal volume ventilation in the operating room. We will also
      attempt to establish a causative mechanism by measuring plasma levels of cytokines known to
      be associated with the development of ARDS.

      Methods- A single center randomized controlled trial was undertaken in 149 patients comparing
      ventilation with 6 ml/kg TV to ventilation with 10 ml/kg TV in patients undergoing elective
      cardiac surgery. Study ventilator settings were applied immediately after induction of
      anesthesia and continued throughout surgery and the subsequent Intensive Care Unit stay. The
      primary endpoint of the study was time to extubation. Secondary endpoints included the
      proportion of patients extubated at 6 hours, indices of lung mechanics and gas exchange as
      well as patient clinical outcomes.
