  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of Technique Kangourou (TK) between low
      birth weight (LBW) infants and their mothers started as soon as possible within 24 hours
      after birth in developing country.

      For the purpose of this study, TK is defined as skin-to-skin direct and continuous (24 hours)
      contact between LBW infants and their mothers or any other people who substitute mothers.
