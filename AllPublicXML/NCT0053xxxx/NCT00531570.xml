  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer to develop in women and
      causes more deaths than all other gynecologic malignancies combined. Because of the
      difficulties in detecting early stage ovarian cancer, 75% of women continue to be diagnosed
      with advanced stage disease (stage III or IV).

      The National Ovarian Cancer Early Detection Program (NOCEDP) as part of the National Cancer
      Institute's Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) is committed to the development of
      effective means for the accurate detection of early stage ovarian cancer.

      The last decade has seen rapid technological advances in diagnostic ultrasonography with the
      recent development of three-dimensional imaging.

      Initial studies suggest that these new technologies improve upon the diagnostic accuracy of
      two-dimensional transvaginal imaging in the differentiation between benign and malignant
      pathology.

      This improved diagnostic accuracy may promote improved patient care by separating complex
      benign masses from ovarian cancer therefore facilitating appropriate treatment.
