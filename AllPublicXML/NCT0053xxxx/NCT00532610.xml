      This study assesses for change in heart rhythm of healthy volunteers taking GSK189075 for 3
      days at a normal dose and a higher than normal dose compared to placebo or to a single dose
      of moxifloxacin. Treatments are GSK189075 500mg daily for three days plus moxifloxacin
      placebo on Day 3; GSK189075 4000mg daily for three days plus moxifloxacin placebo on Day 3;
      placebo tablets daily for three days plus moxifloxacin placebo on Day 3; placebo tablets
      daily for three days plus Moxifloxacin 400mg on Day 3. Volunteers are blindfolded during
      dosing. Each volunteer participates in all four treatment periods and will have received each
      dose combination at study end. Volunteers will stay at the research unit from the day before
      the first dose of study drug until the day after the last dose of study drug of each period.
      Safety measures include vital signs, laboratory tests on blood and urine, physical exams and
      ECGs. Volunteers wear a Holter monitor (a device that records heart rate and rhythm
      continuously) on days 1 and 3. Study drug levels are assessed by multiple blood draws, most
      of which occur on day 3.
