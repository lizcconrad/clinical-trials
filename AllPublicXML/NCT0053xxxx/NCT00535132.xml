  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate medication satisfaction after at least 4 weeks of
      paliperidone ER (extended-release), an antipsychotic, treatment in patients with
      schizophrenia who were previously taking either 4 or 6 mg of risperidone daily by mouth, but
      who are not satisfied with their treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paliperidone ER has been shown to be effective compared to placebo (&quot;a sugar pill&quot;) in the
      acute treatment and maintenance of patients with schizophrenia. Paliperidone ER combines an
      active metabolite of another antipsychotic, risperidone, with manufacturing technology
      allowing more gradual release of the drug and less difference in high and low blood levels of
      the drug. Side effects to medications are sometimes due to wide differences in these high and
      low blood levels. Recent research has shown that many patients with schizophrenia discontinue
      their antipsychotic medication due to &quot;subject-choice&quot;. Therefore, it is important that
      research studies attempt to measure patients' satisfaction with antipsychotic medication, in
      addition to measuring how they respond on tests of effectiveness. This study has been
      designed to evaluate antipsychotic medication satisfaction in patients who continue to have
      symptoms of schizophrenia, and who say they are dissatisfied with their current risperidone
      treatment. The primary outcome is the change in the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire
      (MSQ) score, from baseline to the Week 6 endpoint. These patients are randomized (like
      flipping a coin) as to when their risperidone (4 mg to 6 mg per day) is switched to
      paliperidone ER. Because the study is 'blinded', neither the study doctor nor the patient
      will know when treatment with risperidone is stopped and treatment with paliperidone ER
      begins. Throughout the study all patients continue to receive antipsychotic medication daily.
      Patients will continue on the same daily dose of risperidone until their randomly assigned
      switch to paliperidone ER. All patients will be switched to paliperidone ER over the course
      of study and once switched continue to take paliperidone ER for the remainder of the study.
      Paliperidone ER is started at 6 mg/day and can be increased to 9 mg/day or 12 mg/day at the
      doctor's discretion. Effectiveness and safety will be measured at visits scheduled weekly for
      the first four weeks and then at the Week 6 endpoint. At each visit, patients will be asked
      to complete psychiatric tests and questionnaires that will measure effectiveness and patient
      satisfaction with the medicine. They will also complete tests and evaluations for safety,
      including electrocardiograms (ECGs, electrical tracings of the heart) and blood samples at
      the beginning and end of the study. Each patient receives two blinded capsules by mouth once
      daily in the morning for 6 weeks. Patients taking risperidone receive either a 4-mg or 6-mg
      capsule plus a placebo capsule. When patients are switched, Paliperidone ER is started at 6
      mg/day the day after risperidone is discontinued and can be increased to 9 mg/day or 12
      mg/day at the doctor's discretion. Paliperidone 3-mg and 6-mg capsules are combined with
      placebo to equal the total dose in two capsules.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 6 LOCF</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a 2-part questionnaire that assesses sleep quality and disturbances in seven domains: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction. Each domain is rated on a 4-point scale as follows: 0=Not during the past month, 1=Less than once a week, 2=Once or twice a week, 3=Three or more times a week. Total scores range from zero to 21; increasing scores indicate poorer sleep quality and total scores greater than 5 suggest significant sleep disturbance.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 6 LOCF</time_frame>
    <description>The standard COVI Anxiety Scale is an investigator-assessed measure of the severity of anxiety symptoms on 4 items: verbal report, behavior, somatic symptoms, and relationship to study drug. Each dimension is assessed in 5 to 10 minutes using a 5-point scale as follows: 1=Not at all, 2=Somewhat, 3=Moderately, 4=Considerably, to 5=Very much. For this study, the standard COVI Anxiety Scale was modified to improve psychometric properties by incorporating anchor points for symptom severity, frequency, and duration and for functional impairment. Worst value is 20 and best value is 4.</description>

    <measure>Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score Change From Baseline to Week 6 Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 6 LOCF</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to capture numerous symptoms of schizophrenia, including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale as follows: 1=Absent, 2=Minimal, 3=Mild,4=Moderate, 5=Moderate Severe, 6=Severe, 7=Extreme. This scale has been shown to be sensitive to changes associated with medication treatment. In addition to a total score, this assessment yields separate scores along a Positive Syndrome, a Negative Syndrome, and a General Psychopathology Scales. Worst value is 210, best value is 30.</description>

            <groups_desc>Sample size for this study was based on changes in the MSQ scores within subjects from baseline to endpoint using a one-sample paired t-test. A sample size of 97 subjects was shown to have 90% power at endpoint to detect a mean change from baseline of 0.5 units on the MSQ score, with a standard deviation of 1.5. Allowing for extra variability from subjects with prior generic risperidone (instead of branded risperidone) use, this number was increased to 150 subjects.</groups_desc>

        <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to capture numerous symptoms of schizophrenia, including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale as follows: 1=Absent, 2=Minimal, 3=Mild,4=Moderate, 5=Moderate Severe, 6=Severe, 7=Extreme. This scale has been shown to be sensitive to changes associated with medication treatment. In addition to a total score, this assessment yields separate scores along a Positive Syndrome, a Negative Syndrome, and a General Psychopathology Scales. Worst value is 210, best value is 30.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 is a well-validated and widely used quality-of-life instrument employed in numerous disease states, including schizophrenia. It is a self-administered survey that measures eight domains of health including: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health (role-physical), bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems (role-emotional) and general mental health. Scoring of the SF-36 was based on the SF-36 Manual and Interpretation Guide. Worst value is 0 and best value is 100.</description>

        <title>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Change From Baseline to the Week 6 Endpoint</title>
        <description>The PSQI is a 2-part questionnaire that assesses sleep quality and disturbances in seven domains: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction. Each domain is rated on a 4-point scale as follows: 0=Not during the past month, 1=Less than once a week, 2=Once or twice a week, 3=Three or more times a week. Total scores range from zero to 21; increasing scores indicate poorer sleep quality and total scores greater than 5 suggest significant sleep disturbance.</description>

        <title>Modified COVI Anxiety Scale (m-COVI) Change From Baseline to the Week 6 Endpoint</title>
        <description>The standard COVI Anxiety Scale is an investigator-assessed measure of the severity of anxiety symptoms on 4 items: verbal report, behavior, somatic symptoms, and relationship to study drug. Each dimension is assessed in 5 to 10 minutes using a 5-point scale as follows: 1=Not at all, 2=Somewhat, 3=Moderately, 4=Considerably, to 5=Very much. For this study, the standard COVI Anxiety Scale was modified to improve psychometric properties by incorporating anchor points for symptom severity, frequency, and duration and for functional impairment. Worst value is 20 and best value is 4.</description>
