  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease caused by mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
      conductance regulator (CFTR). The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of
      miglustat on CFTR function in cystic fibrosis patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 12 years and older

          -  Male or female

          -  Non-pregnant women who are to remain non-pregnant for 3 months after the end of the
             study: only women who are surgically sterile, who are in the menopause (no
             menstruation for at least one year) or those of childbearing potential who are using a
             reliable method of contraception. Reliable methods of contraception for female
             patients include the following:

               -  Barrier type devices (e.g., female condom, diaphragm and contraceptive sponge)
                  used ONLY in combination with a spermicide

               -  Intrauterine devices

               -  Oral contraceptive agent

               -  Depo-Provera™ (medroxyprogesterone acetate)

               -  Levonorgestrel implants Abstention, the rhythm method or contraception by the
                  partner alone are NOT reliable methods of contraception.

        For children, a reliable method of contraception must be considered, if appropriate.

          -  Accepting for the duration of the study and for 3 months thereafter to use a condom
             and not to procreate a child (males only)

          -  Cystic fibrosis patients homozygous for the ΔF508 mutation as confirmed by genetic
             test

          -  Signed informed consent prior to any study-mandated procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition prohibiting the correct measurement of the NPD such as upper respiratory
             tract infection

          -  Acute upper respiratory tract or pulmonary exacerbation requiring antibiotic
             intervention within 2 weeks of screening

          -  Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min as per Cockroft and Gault)

          -  Female patients who will not undergo a pregnancy test prior to enrollment in the study

          -  History of significant lactose intolerance

          -  History of neuropathy

          -  History of cataracts or known increased risk of cataract formation

          -  Presence of clinically significant diarrhea (&gt;3 liquid stolls per days for &gt;7 days)
             without definable cause within 1 month prior to screening

          -  Any known factor of disease that might interfere with treatment compliance, study
             conduct or interruption of the results such as drug or alcohol dependence or
             psychiatric disease

          -  FEVI &lt;25% of predicted normal

          -  Oxygen saturation at rest &lt;88%

          -  Active or passive smoking as measured using the Smokelyzer®

          -  Hypersensitivity to miglustat or any excipients

          -  Planned treatment or treatment with another investigational drug or therapy (e.g.,
             gene therapy) within 1 month prior to randomization
