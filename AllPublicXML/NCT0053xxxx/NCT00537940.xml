    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in 28-day Seizure Frequency at Week 21.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks Baseline, 21 weeks through End of MP for 27 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The seizures were recorded by the participants, by a family member, by a caregiver, or by a legal guardian and documented in a daily seizure diary. Participant's 28-day seizure frequency of all partial seizure was assessed during double blind (TP + MP) phase compared with baseline. Total partial seizure is defined as the total number of (simple partial seizure + complex partial seizure + secondary generalized tonic clonic seizure [SGTC]).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With 75% Reduction From Baseline in 28-day Seizure Rate at Week 21.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks Baseline, 21 weeks through End of MP for 27 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who had at least 75% reduction in seizure frequency from Baseline to double-blind treatment (TP + MP) were considered as 75% responders. If percent change from baseline &lt;= -75 then 75% responder rate = 1 (yes) otherwise responder rate = 0 (no). Total partial seizure is defined as the total number of (simple partial seizure + complex partial seizure + SGTC).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Without Seizures.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks Baseline, 21 weeks through End of MP for 27 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Seizure free for 28 days was defined as participants who have not experienced any seizure (simple partial, complex partial and SGTC) for at least 28 consecutive days from their last seizure until the end of the MP. Same participant could be seizure free for a specific type of seizure but not necessarily for the other types of seizure.</description>

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 21</time_frame>
    <description>HADS: participant rated questionnaire with 2 subscales. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - anxiety (HADS-A) assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks); Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - depression (HADS-D) assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). Each subscale comprised of 7 items with range 0 (no presence of anxiety or depression) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety or depression). Total score 0 to 21 for each subscale; higher score indicates greater severity of anxiety and depression symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS-SS) Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 21</time_frame>
    <description>Participant-rated 12-item questionnaire to assess constructs of sleep over past week; 7 subscales: sleep disturbance, snoring, awakened short of breath, sleep adequacy, somnolence (range:0-100); sleep quantity (range:0-24), optimal sleep (yes/no), and 9 item index measures of sleep disturbance provide composite scores: sleep problem summary, overall sleep problem. Except adequacy, optimal sleep and quantity, higher scores=more impairment. Scores transformed (actual raw score [RS] minus lowest possible score divided by possible RS range*100); total score range:0-100; higher score=more intensity of attribute.</description>

             been unresponsive to treatment with at least two but no more than five prior
             antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and at the time of study enrollment are on stable dosages
             of 1 or 2 standard AEDs.

          -  They must have had a 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) without clinically significant
             abnormal findings prior to randomization.

          -  Subjects must have had magnetic resonance imaging or contrast enhance computed
             tomography scan of the brain that demonstrated no progressive structural central
             nervous system abnormality at the time of the diagnosis of epilepsy.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must be established on an effective method of
             contraception during the study. Women should also have a negative pregnancy test prior
             to study entry.

          -  During the 6-week baseline period, subjects must have had a minimum of four partial
             seizures, with no 28 day period free of partial seizures with or without secondary
             generalization. A caregiver or witness must be with the subject for a sufficient
             duration to accurately chronicle the occurrence of seizures. These seizures must have
             been documented in the subject's diary.

          -  Subjects with electroencephalograph (EEG) testing done within 2 years of
             randomization. EEG abnormalities should be consistent with a diagnosis of focal-onset
             epilepsy.

          -  Signed and dated informed consent will be obtained from each subject (only include
             those able to consent) in accordance with the local regulatory and legal requirements.

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other trial procedures. Subjects who are willing, but need
             assistance for self administered questionnaires may be considered acceptable, but must
             first be discussed on a case-by-case basis with the Pfizer monitor prior to any to any
             screening tests or procedures for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             course of the trial.

          -  Subjects with other neurologic illness that could impair endpoint assessment, or
             patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, absence seizures, status epilepticus within the
             12 months prior to study entry, or with seizures due to an underlying medical illness
             or metabolic syndrome.

          -  Subjects with clinically significant liver disease or with a calculated creatinine
             clearance of &lt;60mL/min.

          -  Subjects with a history of lack of response, hypersensitivity or poor tolerability to
             gabapentin or pregabalin.

          -  Previous use of gabapentin or pregabalin within 2 weeks prior to screening or
             likelihood of engaging in these treatments during the study period.

          -  Use of prohibited medications as listed in the protocol in the absence of appropriate
             washout phase or the likelihood of requiring treatment during the study period with
             drugs not permitted by the study protocol.

          -  Participation in any other studies involving investigational or marketed products,
             concomitantly or within 30 days prior to entry in the study.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with trial participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             trial results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this trial.

          -  Subjects who are not suitable to be treated with pregabalin or gabapentin according to
             the respective local labeling.

          -  Subjects with a history of retinal abnormalities or treatment with retinotoxic agents.

          <title>Pregabalin</title>
          <description>Pregabalin was initiated at 150 mg/day [50 mg capsules orally three times a day (TID)] for 1 Week followed by pregabalin 300 mg/day (100 mg TID) orally TID up to Week 5 in the Titration Phase (TP). Participants who had adequate seizure control (adequate: &gt;=50% reduction in seizures) with acceptable tolerability with pregabalin 300 mg/day in TP, continued same dose until the end of TP (Week 9) and then entered the maintenance phase (MP) on this dose. If seizure control was inadequate, the pregabalin dose was escalated to 450 mg/day orally (150 mg TID) from Weeks 5 through 9. If the participants had adequate seizure control with acceptable tolerability on this dose, then they entered the MP on this dose. If there was inadequate seizure control at the end of Week 9, the dose was escalated a final time to 600 mg/day (200 mg TID) at which time they entered the MP.</description>

At the end of Week 1 (Day 7), the dose was increased to 1200 mg/day (400 mg TID) and remained on this dose for the next 4 weeks). Participants who had adequate seizure control (&gt;=50% reduction in seizure frequency) with acceptable tolerability during this initial 5-week period, remained on this dose until the end of theTP (Week 9), then entered the MP on this dose. If seizure control was inadequate, the gabapentin dose was escalated to 1500 mg/day (500 mg TID) during Weeks 5 through 9. If they had adequate seizure control with acceptable tolerability on this dose, they entered the MP on this dose. If there was inadequate seizure control at the end of Week 9, the dose was escalated a final time to 1800 mg/day (600 mg TID), at which time they entered the MP.</description>

        <description>Participant-rated 12-item questionnaire to assess constructs of sleep over past week; 7 subscales: sleep disturbance, snoring, awakened short of breath, sleep adequacy, somnolence (range:0-100); sleep quantity (range:0-24), optimal sleep (yes/no), and 9 item index measures of sleep disturbance provide composite scores: sleep problem summary, overall sleep problem. Except adequacy, optimal sleep and quantity, higher scores=more impairment. Scores transformed (actual raw score [RS] minus lowest possible score divided by possible RS range*100); total score range:0-100; higher score=more intensity of attribute.</description>

Participants who had adequate seizure control (adequate: &gt;=50% reduction in seizures) with acceptable tolerability with pregabalin 300 mg/day in TP, continued same dose until the end of TP (Week 9) and then entered the maintenance phase (MP) on this dose. If seizure control was inadequate, the pregabalin dose was escalated to 450 mg/day orally (150 mg TID) from Weeks 5 through 9. If the participants had adequate seizure control with acceptable tolerability on this dose, then they entered the MP on this dose. If there was inadequate seizure control at the end of Week 9, the dose was escalated a final time to 600 mg/day (200 mg TID) at which time they entered the MP.</description>

At the end of Week 1 (Day 7), the dose was increased to 1200 mg/day (400 mg TID) and remained on this dose for the next 4 weeks). Participants who had adequate seizure control (&gt;=50% reduction in seizure frequency) with acceptable tolerability during this initial 5-week period, remained on this dose until the end of theTP (Week 9), then entered the MP on this dose. If seizure control was inadequate, the gabapentin dose was escalated to 1500 mg/day (500 mg TID) during Weeks 5 through 9. If they had adequate seizure control with acceptable tolerability on this dose, they entered the MP on this dose. If there was inadequate seizure control at the end of Week 9, the dose was escalated a final time to 1800 mg/day (600 mg TID), at which time they entered the MP.</description>

Participants who had adequate seizure control (adequate: &gt;=50% reduction in seizures) with acceptable tolerability with pregabalin 300 mg/day in TP, continued same dose until the end of TP (Week 9) and then entered the maintenance phase (MP) on this dose. If seizure control was inadequate, the pregabalin dose was escalated to 450 mg/day orally (150 mg TID) from Weeks 5 through 9. If the participants had adequate seizure control with acceptable tolerability on this dose, then they entered the MP on this dose. If there was inadequate seizure control at the end of Week 9, the dose was escalated a final time to 600 mg/day (200 mg TID) at which time they entered the MP.</description>

      <desc>The same event may appear as both an adverse event (AE) and a serious adverse event (SAE). However, what is presented are distinct events. An event may be categorized as serious in one participant and as nonserious in another participant, or one participant may have experienced both a serious and nonserious event during the study.</desc>

          <title>Pregabalin</title>
          <description>Pregabalin was initiated at 150 mg/day [50 mg capsules orally three times a day (TID)] for 1 Week followed by pregabalin 300 mg/day (100 mg TID) orally TID up to Week 5 in the Titration Phase (TP). Participants who had adequate seizure control (adequate: &gt;=50% reduction in seizures) with acceptable tolerability with pregabalin 300 mg/day in TP, continued same dose until the end of TP (Week 9) and then entered the maintenance phase (MP) on this dose. If seizure control was inadequate, the pregabalin dose was escalated to 450 mg/day orally (150 mg TID) from Weeks 5 through 9. If the participants had adequate seizure control with acceptable tolerability on this dose, then they entered the MP on this dose. If there was inadequate seizure control at the end of Week 9, the dose was escalated a final time to 600 mg/day (200 mg TID) at which time they entered the MP.</description>

          <title>Gabapentin</title>
          <description>Gabapentin was initiated at 300 mg/day [100 mg capsules orally three times a day (TID)] followed by gabapentin 600 mg/day (200 mg TID) on Day 3. At the end of Week 1 (Day 7), the dose was increased to 1200 mg/day (400 mg TID) and remained on this dose for the next 4 weeks). Participants who had adequate seizure control (&gt;=50% reduction in seizure frequency) with acceptable tolerability during this initial 5-week period, remained on this dose until the end of theTP (Week 9), then entered the MP on this dose. If seizure control was inadequate, the gabapentin dose was escalated to 1500 mg/day (500 mg TID) during Weeks 5 through 9. If they had adequate seizure control with acceptable tolerability on this dose, they entered the MP on this dose. If there was inadequate seizure control at the end of Week 9, the dose was escalated a final time to 1800 mg/day (600 mg TID), at which time they entered the MP.</description>
