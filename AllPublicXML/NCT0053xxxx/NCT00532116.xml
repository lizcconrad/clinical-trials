             (Appendix II).

          3. In general good health as ascertained by physical examination (PE) including
             measurement of supine and standing vital signs, medical history, clinical laboratory
             studies, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).

          4. Females must have a negative serum pregnancy test during screening confirmed by a
             negative urine pregnancy screen at the baseline visit. Women of childbearing potential
             must agree to continuously use a medically acceptable method of birth control during
             the course of the study. Acceptable birth control methods are hormonal contraceptives,
             intrauterine devices or double barrier method (a combination of condom plus
             contraceptive foam). Postmenopausal females will be eligible to participate if their
             last normal menses was at least one (1) year prior to study entry.

          6. Able and willing to follow a modified diet.

          7. Able and willing to follow the requirements of the study; willing to wear a patch, no
             swimming, no excessive exercise, etc.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of significant acute or chronic medical disorder that might complicate or
             interfere with MAO inhibitor therapy, such as:

               1. Any cardiovascular or cardiac condition requiring drug treatment. Upon review
                  with Sponsor, subjects with well controlled hypertension or hyperlipidemia will
                  be allowed.

               2. History of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, or in the investigator's best
                  clinicaljudgment a clinically significant postural decrease in systolic blood
                  pressure at screening or baseline.

               3. Type I diabetes mellitus, or poorly controlled Type II diabetes mellitus.

               4. Malignancy and/or chemotherapy within 1 year prior to screening, other than basal
                  cell carcinoma. Malignancies more than 1 year may not preclude participation and
                  will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Somerset Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
                  medical monitor.

               5. Any skin condition (e.g., eczema, psoriasis, dyshydrosis) that might interfere
                  with application and adherence of the STS.

               6. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to selegiline or other MAO inhibitors.

                  cancer, brain tumors, decompensated cardiac, hepatic or renal failure.

               8. Neurological disorders including delirium, history of head trauma, movement
                  disorders, dementia, multiple sclerosis, stroke, within the past 6 months
                  preceding the study.
