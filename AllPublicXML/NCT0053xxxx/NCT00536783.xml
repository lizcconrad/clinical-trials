      The purpose of this study is the use of magnetoencephalography or MEG (a machine that
      measures magnetic activity in your brain) and electroencephalography or EEG (a technique that
      measures electrical activity in your brain) to study how sounds are processed in individuals
      with schizophrenia after three months of taking the antipsychotic medication quetiapine.

      .Problems with attention and perception are core features of schizophrenia and are
      hypothesized to result from defects in the filtering or gating of sensory input. Examination
      of this requires neuoimaging techniques with high temporal resolution. High-density EEG and
      MEG in combination with structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) are used to map sensory
      gating. In a number of recent studies patient treated with novel antipsychotics have been
      shown to have P50 gating ratios resembling those of normal controls rather than that of
      schizophrenia subjects treatment with conventional antipsychotics. To date, there is no
      literature on the effects of quetiapine on sensory gating. Subjects who meet all inclusion
      criteria and have been on a stable dose of quetiapine for three months will receive a
      clinical interview, an MRI, MEG, and neuropsychological testing to determine if patients with
      schizophrenia who are treated with quetiapine will demonstrate a sensory gating ratio similar
      to normal controls, indicating no deficit in sensory gating.
