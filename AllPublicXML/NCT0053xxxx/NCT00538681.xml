  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended for patients with advanced, not amenable to surgery, or metastatic
      lung cancer who have not received any prior chemotherapy. The study will be conducted in 2
      parts:

        -  Part 1 is intended to evaluate safety of pemetrexed + cisplatin + enzastaurin
           combination chemotherapy

        -  Part 2 whose main objective is to compare the efficacy of pemetrexed + cisplatin +
           enzastaurin versus pemetrexed + cisplatin + placebo. Patients to be included in Part 2
           are those with Nonsquamous NSCLC.
