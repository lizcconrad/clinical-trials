      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile of iron oligosaccharide in
      patients with congestive heart failure with a need for parenteral iron.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron dextrans have been marketed for more than 50 years and the compiled preclinical and
      clinical experience with iron dextrans in general is well established. Pharmacosmos A/S
      already markets the iron dextran CosmoFer® worldwide, except in the US where the product is
      named INFeD®. A new iron oligosaccharide has been manufactured by Pharmacosmos A/S and it is
      a further development of CosmoFer® where ferric hydroxide has been combined with low
      molecular weight oligosaccharides in a relatively strong complex. This iron carbohydrate
      complex builds on the well established efficacy and safety profile of existing iron dextran
      but with a significantly reduced anaphylactic potential.

      In order to ensure that iron oligosaccharide will not lead to unexpected adverse events the
      existing clinical information on iron dextrans in general needs to be supplied with clinical
      safety data from a limited number of relevant patients exposed to iron oligosaccharide in
      open label non-comparator studies.

      The primary objective of the present study is to obtain safety reassurance with the use of
      iron oligosaccharide given either as repeated IV boluses or as total dose infusion for the
      correction of anaemia in patients with congestive heart failure in order to ensure that iron
      oligosaccharide will not lead to unexpected adverse events in these patients.
