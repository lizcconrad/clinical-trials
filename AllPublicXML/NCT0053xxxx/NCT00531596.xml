      Examine adhesive and dermal tolerability of EMSAm 6mg/24hr and 12mg/24hr in healthy elderly
      and non-elderly subjects.

      The primary objectives of this study are to examine the adhesion characteristics and dermal
      tolerability (irritation) of EMSAM in two populations consisting of non-elderly (18 - 64
      years) and elderly (65 years and older) healthy volunteers. EMSAM will be dosed over the
      range of proposed sizes for marketing [(6mg/24hr), (9mg/24hr), and (12mg/24hr)]. Adhesion and
      tolerability (irritation) will be examined at three different application site areas (upper
      torso [includes chest and back], upper arm, and upper thigh).

      The secondary objective is to examine if the adhesion characteristics and dermal tolerability
      (irritation) of EMSAM may be influenced by the secondary factors such as gender, race,
      physical activity, and bathing/showering practices.

             demonstrate use of an acceptable form of birth control, such as hormonal
             contraceptive, intrauterine device or barrier method (i.e. condom w/spermicide). NOTE:
             Abstinence and partner vasectomy are not acceptable methods of contraception.

          -  In general good health as ascertained by physical examination, supine and standing
             vital signs, laboratory test results, 12 lead ECG and medical history.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any of the following conditions will exclude subjects from eligibility for study
        participation:

          -  Subjects with a past or present condition that includes any of the following:

               1. In the opinion of the Investigator, any significant cardiovascular disease or
                  disorder including myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension or
                  recurrent episodes of orthostatic hypotension.

               2. Any skin abnormalities at or near designated patch application sites that might
