      Evaluate response rate of Docetaxel in combination with Carboplatin or Cisplatin as first
      line chemotherapy in epithelial ovarian cancer. Assess the progression free survival,
      tolerance, duration of response and survival in the same patient population.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Patients with peritoneal
             carcinomatosis are also eligible, without necessarily having histological proof of a
             primary source in the ovary, provided that the tumour is not mucin-secreting, and that
             there is no evidence of a primary fallopian tube cancer (see exclusion criteria).

          -  Female, aged 18 or over- FIGO stages Ic-IV with or without successful cytoreductive
             surgery at staging laparotomy. Stage Ic patients will be limited to those with
             malignant cells in ascitic fluid, peritoneal washings or with tumour on the surface of
             the ovary

          -  Patients with ruptured capsule as the only evidence of stage Ic will not be eligible
             for entry into the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  ECOG performance status &gt; 2

          -  Prior treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

          -  Patients with, pre-existing fluid retention such as pleural effusion, pericardial
             effusion and ascites are not excluded from the study, but should be monitored closely
             for any deterioration. Efforts should be made to determine by cytological analysis
             whether any significant pre-existing fluid collections are due to ovarian cancer, and
             subsequent drainage is recommended before initiating chemotherapy.

          -  Inadequate bone marrow function defined as neutrophils &lt; 1.5 x 109/l or platelets &lt;
             100 x 109/l.

          -  Inadequate renal function as defined by serum creatinine &gt; 1.25 x upper limit of
             normal.

          -  Inadequate liver function as defined by bilirubin &gt; upper limit of normal or AST/ALT &gt;
             1.5 x upper limit of normal or ALP &gt; 3 x upper limit of normal.

          -  Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled co-morbid medical condition (i.e. uncontrolled
             infection, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within
             previous 6 months, congestive heart failure)

          -  Patients with mixed mesodermal tumours.

          -  Patients with borderline ovarian tumours or tumours termed 'possibly malignant'.

          -  Adenocarcinoma of unknown origin, if histologically shown to be mucin-secreting cancer
             or thought to be possible primary fallopian tube carcinoma.

          -  History of previous malignancy within the previous 5 years (except curatively treated
             carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix, or basal cell carcinoma of the skin), or
             concurrent malignancy (e.g. coexisting endometrial cancer) .

          -  History of prior serious allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylactic shock).

          -  History of other relative contraindications to corticosteroid administration

          -  Pregnant or lactating women (or potentially fertile women not using adequate
             contraception).

          -  Symptomatic peripheral neuropathy &gt; NCIC-CTC grade II.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
