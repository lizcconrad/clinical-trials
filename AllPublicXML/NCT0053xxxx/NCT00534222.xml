    <textblock>
      With this observational study we want to examine if the intensity of agitation, the intensity
      of psychotic symptoms and the presence of sleeping disorder predict the success of the
      treatment with a atypical antipsychotic after 12 weeks of treatment with patients with a
      psychotic and/or manic episode. In this study it will be examined what the percentage of
      patients with a 2-point improvement at the CGI-scale is. Of these group, the responders,
      retrospective the profile of the responders will be analysed (key-factors and confounders).

      PLEASE NOTE: Seroquel SR and Seroquel XR refer to the same formulation. The SR designation
      was changed to XR after consultation with FDA.
