      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of the 7F Ensure Medical
      Vascular Closure Devices to facilitate hemostasis in patients undergoing diagnostic or
      interventional coronary procedures using a standard 7F introducer sheath.

      Achieving hemostasis at the arterial puncture site after percutaneous cardiac catheterization
      is a potential cause of bleeding, hematomas, pseudoaneurysms, and various other vascular
      complications. Hemostasis at the femoral artery access site after diagnostic or
      interventional procedures is typically achieved using either manual compression or the
      deployment of a vascular closure device. Manual compression is time consuming for the
      health-care provider, and painful for the patient. In addition, prolonged periods of
      immobilization and bed rest may be required. Vascular closure devices have been developed to
      avoid manual compression, shorten bed rest, and allow earlier ambulation.

      The Ensure Medical Vascular Closure device (VCD) is intended for femoral artery puncture site
      closure in patients who have undergone coronary catheterizations using a standard 7F
      introducer sheath. The device is comprised of a bio-absorbable plug and a plug delivery
      system. The plug delivery system is designed to position the bio-absorbable plug to the
      extravascular surface of the femoral artery access site, facilitating a hemostasis response.
      The Ensure Medical VCD has been studied in a prior feasibility trial of 149 patients
      utilizing a 6F introducer sheath, which demonstrated that: (1) the device could be used to
      successfully obtain rapid hemostasis and early ambulation in patients undergoing
      catheterization procedures; and (2) the low incidence and relatively minor nature of the
      observed closure related complications suggests that the device is safe for its intended
      purpose.
