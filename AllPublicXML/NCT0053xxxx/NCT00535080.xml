  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to provide this investigational drug to patients who cannot be
      optimally treated with conventional therapies and to collect efficacy and safety data on the
      use of Metvix PDT in subjects with field actinic keratoses, large/multiple superficial basal
      cell carcinomas (BCCs) or Bowen's disease.

    <description>Metvix (methyl aminolevulinate) (MAL), Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), cream, 160 mg/g. MAL cream will be applied for 3 hours then will be removed. The target area will then be exposed to red light (using a large-field LED light source: Aktilite 128) for 7 to 10 minutes at a dosage of 37 J/cm².</description>

               -  Biopsy-confirmed large, or multiple (several in the same anatomical area) primary
                  superficial BCC lesions that are macroscopically and histologically consistent
                  with superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC) and have no histological evidence of
                  aggressive growth patterns; or

               -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of Bowen's disease from a biopsy taken within
