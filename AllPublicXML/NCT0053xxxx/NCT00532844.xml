      This Phase 2, randomized, open-label, 2-treatment, 2-sequence, 2-period crossover,
      pharmacokinetic (PK) study will compare plasma concentrations of BH4 in subjects with
      endothelial dysfunction following 14 days of treatment by each of 2 regimens: 6R-BH4 with
      vitamin C and 6R-BH4 alone.

          -  Myocardial infarction, stroke, or surgery within the last 60 days prior to screening.

          -  History of alcohol and/or drug abuse or a positive alcohol or drug test at screening.
