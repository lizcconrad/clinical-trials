      The purpose of this study is to determine if the pressure in the eye of a severely
      head-injured person correlates with the pressure in the person's skull. This is a prospective
      study of patients aged 18 and older who have experienced a traumatic closed head injury and
      are intubated either before or during the time they are in the Emergency Department (ED).
      Identified patients have an eye pressure measurement performed in the trauma bay by an OSU ED
      physician not involved in their care. Information about their hospital stay, including the
      first brain pressure measurement if a such a measuring device is used, will be collected. In
      addition, the outcome of their hospital stay will be recorded.

      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United
      States, with an estimated 1.5 million American sustaining a TBI and 50,000 people dying from
      a TBI each year. While the immediate, or primary, injury causes significant damage, secondary
      injury is caused by cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, and resultant
      hypoperfusion and ischemia. Elevated intracranial pressure is strongly associated with poor
      recovery and death; failure to control intracranial pressure is likewise associated with poor
      outcomes and mortality.

      Early detection of elevated ICP allows for the initiation of early therapy. However, patients
      with significant head injuries are often intubated for airway protection. The sedation
      required for intubation obscures the ED neurologic exam. Precise measurement of elevated ICP
      has required invasive monitoring via ventriculostomy. Yet this method is only provided at set
      institutions with neurosurgical services. Further there are distinct time delays between the
      trauma occurrence, transportation to a facility with neurosurgical services and placement of
      ventriculostomies. There is at the forefront, then, to establish non-invasive measures of ICP
      that are both time efficient and reliable.

      Previous studies, including a pilot study conducted at this institution, showed a correlation
      between intraocular and intracranial pressure. However, this relationship has not been tested
      in an acute care trauma setting. We propose an observational cohort study of critically
      injured trauma patients with suspected closed head injury. Patients requiring intubation and
      mechanical ventilation pose a significant challenge to assess neurologically, as they are
      almost always sedated and often chemically paralyzed to facilitate airway management.
      Therefore, it is in this population of intubated trauma patients with suspected head injury
      that we will evaluate the use of tonometry to predict intracranial pressure from intraocular
      pressure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with suspected acute traumatic head injury

          -  Intubated prior to arrival in the Emergency Department or in the Emergency Department,
             including patients transferred from other facilities

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Too unstable to allow the investigator access to the head of the bed to perform
             tonometry.

          -  Severe ocular or facial trauma such that an intact globe is not accessible

          -  Known history of glaucoma

          -  Penetrating head injury

          -  Patients that undergo operative decompression prior to the placement of an
             intracranial pressure monitor may be screened in the trauma bay and have an
             intraocular pressure obtained; however, these patients will not be included in the
             intraocular / intracranial pressure analysis.

          -  Known allergy to latex or tetracaine
