        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unstable cardiac or respiratory status, including cardiac defects so severe that
             survival was not expected or for which cardiac transplantation was planned or
             anticipated

             continuous positive airway pressure or other mechanical respiratory or cardiac support

          -  Associated non-cardiac anomalies or end organ dysfunction resulting in anticipated
             survival of less than six months or unstable abnormalities of end organ function

          -  Acute respiratory illness, or other acute infection or illness Note: children with any
             respiratory symptoms must have had a negative RSV test prior to randomization

          -  Chronic seizure or evolving or unstable neurologic disorder

          -  Known immunodeficiency

          -  Mother with HIV infection (unless the child had been proven to be not infected)

          -  Known allergy to Ig products

          -  Receipt of any polyclonal antibody (for example, Hepatitis B IG, IVIG, VZIG) within 3
             months prior to randomization

          -  Receipt of palivizumab (Synagis®) within 3 months prior to randomization

          -  Use of investigational agents within the past three months (other than investigational
             agents commonly used during cardiac surgery or the immediate post-operative period,
             e.g., nitric oxide)

          -  Current participation in other investigational protocols of drugs or biological agents

          -  Previous participation in MI-CP124 (Season 1)

      <recruitment_details>A total of 1236 subjects were randomized at 162 sites in 16 countries within the northern hemisphere between 21Oct2005 and 14Dec2005 in Season 1 and 02Oct2007 and 31Dec2007 in Season 2; each subject participated in the study for a single RSV season.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects were randomized 1:1 on Study Day 0 to receive either 15 mg/kg motavizumab or 15 mg/kg palivizumab. A permuted-block randomization method was used and a separate randomization schedule was generated for each site and cyanotic CHD strata combination.</pre_assignment_details>
