  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is the purpose of this trial to provide evidence for safety and efficacy of long term home
      parenteral nutrition with either Lipofundin MCT or Lipoplus in patients with proven
      insufficient enteral resorption.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long term parenteral nutrition is indicated in the home care setting of patients who are
      unable to completely cover their daily caloric requirements by oral/enteral nutrition due to
      e.g. pre existing malnutrition or compromised intestinal absorption.

      An appropriate nutritional supplementation ensuring the provision of patients basic
      requirement of amino acids, glucose, lipids, micronutrients and electrolytes is therefore
      required to stop weight loss, increase quality of life and to reduce unfavorable consequences
      of malnutrition in those patients.

      Major causes for malnutrition and compromised intestinal absorption are malignant processes.
      Tumor cachexia, weight loss due to insufficient nutrition of &lt; 60 -80 % of the calculated
      substrate need for &gt; 14 days, antineoplastic therapy and surgical intervention are
      consequences of the malignant disease and lead to catabolic processes.
