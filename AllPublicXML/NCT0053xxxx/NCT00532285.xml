      This is an open labeled phase II single arm trial. The patients with clinical stage II and
      III will undergo core-needle biopsy of breast tumor for histologic diagnosis,
      immunohistochemical studies for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor(PR), HER-2/neu
      and others. PET or ultrasound results will determine the positivity of lymph node metastasis.

      Patients will be treated as follows:

      PG x 4®operation®AC x 4®radiation ± tamoxifen/AI(postmenopausal)

      Intravenous infusion of Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2, over 60 min, on D1 and D8 Followed by
      intravenous infusion of Gemcitabine 1200 mg/m2, over 30 min, on D1 and D8

      The cycle repeats every 3 weeks for 4 times. Premedication includes antiemetics,
      dexamethasone, famotidine, pheniramine as routinely given.

      After the operation, standard adjuvant chemotherapy (doxorubicin 60 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide
      600 mg/m2, every 3 weeks x 4 cycles) will be given.

    <description>Treatment will be delivered in the outpatient setting. Each three-week cycle consists of paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 (day 1, 8) and gemcitabine 1200 mg/m2 (day1, 8).Patients will receive four cycles of therapy unless there is any evidence of no response (SD or PD) or unacceptable toxicity defined as unpredictable, irreversible, or Grade 4, or noncompliance by patient with protocol requirements.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have histologically confirmed and newly diagnosed breast cancer:
             node-positive stage IIA and any stage IIB, III. PET results will determine node
             positivity. If PET was not utilized, sonographically positive node should be confirmed
             cytologically by fine needle aspiration.

          -  No prior hormonal, chemotherapy or radiotherapy is allowed.

          -  No breast operation other than biopsy to make diagnosis is allowed.

          -  Age: 18-years and older, not pregnant pre-, and postmenopausal women with good
             performance status (ECOG 0-1)

          -  Adequate hematopoietic function: Absolute granulocyte count ³1500/mm3, platelet
             ³100,000/mm3, Hemoglobin ³ 10 g/mm3

          -  Adequate renal function: Serum creatinine £ 1.5 mg/dl

          -  Adequate hepatic function: total bilirubin: £ 1.5 mg/dl, AST/ALT: £ two times normal,
             Alkaline phosphatase: £ two times normal

          -  Adequate cardiac function: normal or nonspecific EKG taken within 1 mo of enrollment

          -  Patients with node-negative stage IIA breast cancer

          -  Patients who have history of cancer other than in situ uterine cervix cancer or
             nonmelanotic skin cancer
