  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will assess the maximum tolerated dose, and dose-limiting toxicities,
      of Xeloda administered concurrently with radiation therapy, in children with newly diagnosed
      diffuse intrinsic brain stem gliomas and high grade gliomas. Xeloda will be administered
      twice daily, at a starting dose of 500mg/m2 bid, beginning within 24 hours of the start of
      radiation therapy. Subsequent dose escalations will be in increments of 30%, using a standard
      dose escalation schema. Post-radiation therapy with Xeloda will continue after a 2 week
      break. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size
      will not exceed 30 evaluable patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Capecitabine.</measure>
    <time_frame>Upto 11 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD was the dose level at which six evaluable patients had been treated and at most one patient experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the next highest dose level was too toxic. Dose escalation occurred if 0 out of 3 or at most 1 out of 6 patients experienced DLT while being treated at a dose level; otherwise the dose was declared unsafe and thus above the MTD.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Upto 11 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DLT was defined as any of the following events occurring during the 11 week dose-finding period: any event that leads to interruption of planned radiation for 5 consecutive days or 10 days total; Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia; Grade 3 thrombocytopenia that required a platelet transfusion on 2 or more occasions; any Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity (with the exception of grade 3 nausea or vomiting of less than 5 days duration, Grade 3 transaminases that returned to baseline value within 7 days of study drug interruption and that did not recur upon re-challenge with study drug, and/or Grade 3 fever or infection of &lt;5 days duration); Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicities that persisted for &gt;7 days and required treatment interruption, or any other capecitabine-related adverse events that required need for dose reduction or permanent cessation of therapy, interruption of study drug for &gt;7 days or recurred on re-challenge with capecitabine rapidly disintegrating tablets (RDTs).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 06 years</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is an unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Toxicity was monitored and graded according to the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. Adverse events that were not included in the CTCAEv3.0 were reported and graded under the other AE within the appropriate category.</description>
