  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of anti-HIV therapy is to prevent HIV from replicating. Long-term control of HIV
      requires at least two anti-HIV drugs that are active against the virus. Drug resistance is a
      problem for many treatment-experienced, HIV-infected people. The purpose of this study was to
      determine the benefit of adding a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) to a new
      anti-HIV drug regimen for the suppression of HIV.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two or more fully active antiretrovirals (ARVs) are recommended for successful suppression of
      HIV. In people infected with resistant HIV virus, finding two drugs that are fully active
      against HIV can be a challenge. However, the new generation of anti-HIV drugs has been
      designed to suppress drug-resistant HIV. These drugs include the FDA-approved protease
      inhibitors (PIs) darunavir and tipranavir, the investigational non-nucleoside transcriptase
      inhibitor (nNRTI) etravirine, the FDA-approved fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide, the recently
      FDA-approved CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc, and the investigational integrase inhibitor
      raltegravir. Also, it is not yet known whether multiple, partially-active drugs have the same
      rate of success in suppressing HIV. The purpose of this study was to use HIV resistance
      testing to predict the potency of a suggested ARV regimen using second generation ARVs and
      determine if the benefits of adding NRTIs to this new drug regimen outweigh the risks of drug
      toxicity and pill burden. All participants had treatment experience or resistance to NRTIs,
      nNRTIs, and PIs, and received novel agents.

      An active screening period (after enrollment but before randomization or treatment
      dispensation), occurred for up to 75 days for all participants, and study participation
      lasted an additional 96 weeks for those who qualified for either randomization or assignment
      (i.e. not randomized), to the study intervention. During active screening, all participants
      remained on their current drug regimen. During screening, phenotypic and genotypic HIV
      resistance tests were performed on participants' blood samples, as well as a coreceptor
      tropism assay. Using this information and medication history, the study team determined the
      best new regimen options for each participant. Each clinician, along with the study
      participant, then chose a new regimen based on the recommendations of the study team and the
      participant's preference.

      Evaluation for study outcomes began when participants started their new regimen as assigned
      by either randomization or determined assignment. Stratification between Arms A (Add NRTIs)
      and B (Omit NRTIs) or Arm C (Non-randomized to Add NRTIs) was based on predicted activity of
      the new regimen. Those assigned to a regimen with higher predicted activity were randomly
      assigned to Arm A (Add NRTIs) or B (Omit NRTIs); those assigned a regimen predicted to have
      lower activity were not randomized, but were assigned to Arm C (Add NRTIs).

      Participants in Arms A and C were instructed to take their newly assigned study regimen plus
      at least 2 NRTIs (personalized from expert recommendation and choice by local provider and
      participant) for 96 weeks. Participants in Arm B were instructed to take their newly assigned
      study regimen with no NRTIs for 96 weeks. Participants in all arms who met the primary
      efficacy outcome of regimen failure remained in the study in order to be followed for
      important secondary outcomes.

      All participants were scheduled to have 13 clinical visits, which included blood collection.
      At some visits, urine collection and quality of life and adherence questionnaires occurred. A
      neurocognitive assessment was performed for all participants at time of starting the new
      study regimen. Participants may also have consented to have cerebrospinal fluid collected via
      lumbar puncture following study treatment assignment and/or at Week 24. Those participants
      who consented to cerebrospinal fluid collection also had neurocognitive assessments at the
      times of collections. Participants were responsible for obtaining certain ARVs not provided
      by the study, including the ARVs they during the active screening period.

      The primary and secondary study objectives and comparisons relate to the randomized arms, and
      therefore, results are not provided for the non-randomized arm (C). The purpose of the
      non-randomized arm (C) was to include persons higher baseline resistance (and thus, lower
      activity scores) in order to address an exploratory objective related to the predictive power
      of these activity scores (and thus a larger range of scores by inclusion of arm C), on
      certain, virologic outcomes.

    <measure>Percent of Participants With Regimen Failure, Defined as a Confirmed Virologic Failure or Discontinuation of Randomized NRTI Component of Study Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>From study entry to end of Week 48 evaluation window</time_frame>
    <description>Virologic failure defined as confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA meeting 1 of the following 4 criteria: &lt; 1.0 log10 copies/mL reduction from baseline level and &gt;= 200 copies/mL at or after week 12 evaluation; &gt;= 200 copies/mL after 1 measurement &lt; 200 copies/mL; absence of any values &lt; 200 copies/mL by and including week 24 evaluation; &gt;= 200 copies/mL at week 48 evaluation. Discontinuation of Randomized NRTI component of Study Treatment is defined as permanently stopping all NRTIs among those randomized to add NRTIs, or starting any NRTI among those randomized to omit NRTIs. Subjects leaving the study for reasons other than death, relocation, incarceration, or site closure were reviewed for the discontinuation outcome by a blinded, independent panel. Additionally, any participant failing to start study treatment after randomization and prior to closure was also reviewed. Results report percent of participants reaching regimen failure outcome by week 48 evaluation using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <description>Events following permanent discontinuation of NRTI assignment are excluded (i.e. censoring at time of this event, if applicable). Week 96 study visit could occur up to 110 weeks following randomization. Censoring time was the latest study visit when participant was evaluated or when NRTI assignment was discontinued (when applicable). Event time was the exact number of weeks following treatment initiation when the qualifying sign/symptom started (for those safety events triggered by a sign/symptom), or exact number of weeks following treatment initiation when specimen from qualifying laboratory result was drawn (for those safety events triggered by a laboratory abnormality).</description>

    <description>First study ARV modification included any discontinuation or substitution of any chosen and initiated ARV for any reason. Events prompting study medication change could include protocol required (e.g. safety), protocol recommended but not required (e.g. virologic failure), or participant motivated (such as non-adherence, loss to follow-up or death; in other words, not protocol recommended or required). Event times were the exact weeks from treatment initiation to the time of qualifying regimen modification. Censoring times were the exact weeks from treatment initiation to the last date of study drugs. The week 96 (final study visit) could occur up through 110 weeks following randomization.</description>

        <description>Virologic failure defined as confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA meeting 1 of the following 4 criteria: &lt; 1.0 log10 copies/mL reduction from baseline level and &gt;= 200 copies/mL at or after week 12 evaluation; &gt;= 200 copies/mL after 1 measurement &lt; 200 copies/mL; absence of any values &lt; 200 copies/mL by and including week 24 evaluation; &gt;= 200 copies/mL at week 48 evaluation. Discontinuation of Randomized NRTI component of Study Treatment is defined as permanently stopping all NRTIs among those randomized to add NRTIs, or starting any NRTI among those randomized to omit NRTIs. Subjects leaving the study for reasons other than death, relocation, incarceration, or site closure were reviewed for the discontinuation outcome by a blinded, independent panel. Additionally, any participant failing to start study treatment after randomization and prior to closure was also reviewed. Results report percent of participants reaching regimen failure outcome by week 48 evaluation using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
