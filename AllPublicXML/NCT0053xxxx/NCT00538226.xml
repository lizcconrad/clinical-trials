    <textblock>
      This is an open label pilot study to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of the Flowaid
      device in increasing local circulation in the legs.

      15 patients with a diagnosis of Peripheral Vascular Disease will be enrolled in this study.
      They will recieve tratment with the Flowaid device and monitored continuously by means of
      Laser Doppler Flowmetry as well as by tcPO2 and Digital Thermography. Subjective data will
      also be collected.

      This is a 15 patient pilot study to evaluate efficacy and safety of use of the Flowaid device
      in increasing local circulation in the legs of patients with Peripheral Vascular Disease.
      Patients will be evaluated and scored prior to treatment and then treated with the Flowaid
      device for a period of two hours. During the treatment period patients will be continuously
      monitored by digital thermograph as well as by tcPO2 and Laser Doppler Flowmetry. Patients
      will also be monitored for a brief period immediately after cessation of treatment to
      evaluate continued effect of the device on local circulation in the leg.

      The study will be individually controlled with each patients treated leg evaluated against
      the contralateral non- treated leg.

      Subjective data including distance able to walk, pain and vibratory sensation threshold will
      also be collected and evaluated appropriately.
