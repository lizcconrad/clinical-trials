      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of lacidipine and losartan in elderly
      hypertensive patients on reducing the 24 hour systolic BP variability, which is one of the
      potential parameter to consider in treating elderly hypertensive patients.

    <textblock>
      In this study, we investigate the effects of two anti-hypertensive medications on systolic BP
      variability profile as a pilot study. This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded
      end point (PROBE), parallel group study with two treatment arms. At the end of an initial
      2-week washout period, during which any eventual anti-hypertensive drug is discontinued,
      patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria are randomly treated with the lacidipine (4 mg) or
      losartan (50 mg), both given once daily at the same hour in the morning (approximately at 8
      AM) for 12 weeks. If the BP goal (SBP &lt; 140 mmHg and DBP &lt; 90 mmHg) has not been attained
      after 4 week's treatment, 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide (HCTS) once daily can be added.

      Patients are checked 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) at the end of the washout period
      and after 12 weeks of active treatment. At each visit, seated cuff SBP and DBP, heart rate,
      use of concomitant medication and spontaneously reported adverse events are recorded.
