      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given
      together with carboplatin and paclitaxel in treating patients with advanced solid cancer.
      Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving veliparib together with carboplatin and paclitaxel may help kill more tumor
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended dose for phase II studies of veliparib (ABT-888 ) that can be
      administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid
      malignancies. (Stratum I) II. To determine the recommended dose for phase II studies of
      veliparib that can be administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients
      with advanced solid malignancies that harbor a germline BRCA1/2 mutation. (Stratum II) (added
      04/07/09)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the dose-limiting toxicity and other toxicities associated with the use of this
      combination.

      II. To obtain preliminary evidence of antitumor activity in patients treated with this
      combination.

      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of veliparib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel
      when administered as a combination.

      IV. To conduct correlative science studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of veliparib. Patients are stratified
      according to BRCA status (no [stratum I] vs yes [stratum II]).

      Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 3
      hours on day 3 and veliparib orally (PO) twice daily on days 1-7 until the recommended phase
      II dose is determined. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 6 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo peripheral blood mononuclear cell collection periodically for
      pharmacokinetic and biomarker studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.

    <description>Changes will be summarized as means and standard deviations. A statistical test of the null hypothesis of no change in each variable will be done using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks procedure.

    <description>Response will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee. Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.</description>

    <measure>Time to progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from start of treatment to time of progression, assessed up to 4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by RECIST. TTP will be displayed for all patients and for patients who have responded; no formal statistical analysis is planned.</description>

    <measure>Toxicities as assessed by CTCAE v.4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time of their first treatment with veliparib to up to 4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicities will be defined as regimen-related if they are possibly, probably or definitely related to treatment. The maximum grade of toxicity for each category of interest will be recorded for each patient and the summary results will be tabulated by category, grade and dose level. Serious (≥ Grade 3) toxicities will be described on a patient-by-patient basis and will include any relevant baseline data.</description>
