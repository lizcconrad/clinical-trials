  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration is one of the major
      causes of blindness in the western world. It is already known that the vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) plays a major role in the development of CNV. Photodynamic therapy
      (PDT), subretinal surgery, and intravitreal injection of VEGF- inhibitors are the common
      treatments. These methods are either very invasive or need to be repeated several times over
      long periods of time in order show some effect. Furthermore PDT can only be performed in eyes
      with pigment epithelium detachments (PED) of maximum 50% of the avascular zone, while
      intravitreal injections can lead to endophthalmitis and acute glaucoma. A systemic treatment,
      which would only need to be administered 3 times within 6 weeks would be a major effort in
      macular degeneration therapy.

      Bevacizumab (AvastinÂ®, Genentech Inc.) is a new anti-vascular endothelial growth factor
      (anti-VEGF) which has shown promising results as a combination therapy with 5-fluorouracil,
      leucovorin, and oxaliplatin in first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer14,15.
      Since intraocular anti-VEGF therapies for CNV in AMD have already shown promising results,
      the idea of this study is to administer the anti-VEGF bevacizumab intravenously, as a
      systemic therapy, in AMD-patients.

      The rationale of the present study is to determine the effect of systemic bevacizumab therapy
      in patients with fibrovascular pigment epithelium detachment (PED), involving the geometric
      center of the foveal avascular zone, in comparison to placebo treatment with sodium chloride
      0,9%.

      The patients will receive 3 intravenous infusions of 5mg/kg bevacizumab at 2 weeks intervals
      or 3 intravenous infusions of 100ml sodium chloride 0,9% at 2 weeks intervals. Medical
      internal reviews, ETDRS and Radner visual acuity assessment, ophthalmologic examinations,
      ocular imaging with OCT 3, multifocal ERG, fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine
      angiography will be performed. The follow-up time is 6 months.
