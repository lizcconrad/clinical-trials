  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity affects one in five children in the UK and undoubtedly causes increased ill health
      with rising levels of childhood and adolescent diabetes, obesity induced liver disease and
      increased risk of early heart disease. There are few clinics offering effective treatment for
      childhood obesity. However, the clinic for childhood obesity at Bristol Royal Hospital for
      Children (BCH) has been successful in around 83% of cases. This pilot study aims to examine
      the feasibility of transferring the success of the hospital clinic to primary care in
      preparation for a full RCT. The study will entail training a practice nurse, community
      dietician and exercise specialist to deliver the same clinical service in primary care as
      that offered in BCH. Initial work will gather the views of staff delivering the hospital
      service and those of patients and parents to identify the crucial components of the
      intervention that are likely to be needed in primary care and to then to refine the
      intervention.A pilot trial will examine how feasible it is to recruit patients into the
      service and get some initial idea as to whether weight management is equally good, patient
      satisfaction and retention improves and what data needs to be collected for a full economic
      assessment. If found to be effective, the next step will be to use knowledge gained in this
      study to design and undertake a more extensive, formal study across Bristol in various
      primary care settings.This larger study will address how such a service can be delivered
      across a complete spectrum of primary care populations, so that similar services could be
      developed across the country.
