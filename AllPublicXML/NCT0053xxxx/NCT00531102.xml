  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, newborns receive 100% supplemental oxygen by free flow when they remain cyanotic
      despite demonstrating regular respiratory effort. Resuscitating infants with continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) in room air may improve oxygen saturations more quickly than
      providing FFO2 because of its ability to establish functional residual capacity in the lungs.
      Our primary hypothesis is that in this blinded, randomized control trial, more infants (≥35
      weeks gestation) resuscitated with CPAP in room air will have an oxygen saturation ≥80% at
      five minutes of age compared to infants resuscitated with the 50% FFO2.

      INTERVENTION Resuscitation will proceed as per standard of care and infants are only to
      receive respiratory support if they remain cyanotic despite 30 seconds of spontaneous regular
      respirations. All infants will have a pulse oximetry probe placed on the right hand
      (pre-ductal position) immediately after birth. Alarm limits will not be set. The pulse
      oximetry probe will first be placed on the infant and then attached to the cable connected to
      the pulse oximeter as this has been shown to result in a shorter time to detecting a good
      quality signal. The pulse oximeter will be set at &quot;maximum&quot; sensitivity with an averaging
      time of 2 seconds.

      Randomization will occur at the time of delivery. Infants that meet the entry criteria will
      be randomized to resuscitation with one of two Neopuff CPAP circuits:

      GROUP 1 (21% CPAP) - infants will receive CPAP with 21% oxygen at 6 cm H2O continuously for
      at least 5 minutes.

      GROUP 2 (50% FFO2) - infants will receive the equivalent of 100% FFO2 for at least 5 minutes.
      Note that infants receiving 100% FFO2 actually inspire approximately 50% oxygen because of
      entrained room air. To allow us to maintain blinding of the intervention, infants in the FFO2
      group will actually receive 50% oxygen provided via a T-piece infant resuscitator that has
      been modified so as not to deliver any pressure to the airways.

      The FiO2 (21% or 50%) will be set by the study investigator attending the delivery. An
      anaesthesia monitor (Datex Ohmeda) will be connected in-line between the Neopuff T-piece and
      the face mask to record airway pressures, end tidal carbon dioxide levels and concentration
      of inspired oxygen (to confirm that infant are receiving either 21% or 50% oxygen).

      A treatment failure for both groups will be defined as any of the following:

        1. Infant stops making a spontaneous respiratory effort

        2. Infant fails to achieve an oxygen saturation of 75% by 3 minutes of age or 80% by 5
           minutes of age. These values are near the lower limit of normal for healthy infants
           transitioning in room air.

        3. Heart rate &lt;60 beats per minute

      In the event of a treatment failure, resuscitation will proceed with intermittent PPV
      delivered with 100% oxygen using a flow-inflating bag and mask system which is available on
      all of our resuscitation warmers. We have chosen to switch to a bag and mask system in this
      instance so as not to unblind the study (see section on blinding). Chest compressions will be
      started after 30 seconds of tactile stimulation and positive pressure ventilation have failed
      to increase the HR to &gt;60 bpm. We recognize that there is no data to suggest that providing
      100% oxygen is the best approach in treating bradycardia in the preterm newborn. However, it
      is the current standard of care. None of the preterm infants enrolled in our room air
      resuscitation study have required chest compressions.

      If the pulse oximeter does not register a good signal, resuscitation will continue at the
      current inspired O2 concentration as long as the HR &gt;100 bpm. This also applies to the period
      of time immediately following birth prior to the POM giving a clear reading. In our
      experience, we are able to reliably obtain a good-quality pulse oximetry signal within 30
      seconds of probe application in newborn infants using the method suggested by O'Donnel and
      colleagues.

      Blood gases will be drawn within 30 to 60 minutes of admission to the NICU as per routine
      practice for infants admitted for respiratory support. All intubated infants will have
      arterial access established via either an umbilical artery, left radial artery, right or left
      posterior tibial arteries (all post-ductal in location) or via the right radial artery
      (pre-ductal location). Infants without arterial access will not have blood gas data collected
      given the limited utility of PaO2 estimates from capillary or venous samples.

      RANDOMIZATION AND CONCEALEMENT Block randomization will be used with random block sizes of 2
      and 4 using a computer generated randomization schedule to increase the likelihood of equal
      enrolment into each group. The randomization procedure will occur on site and treatment
      assignment (21% CPAP, 50% FFO2) will be kept in opaque (manila envelopes with foil inserts),
      sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes in a locked drawer in the NICU. Infants will be
      randomized immediately prior to birth since randomizing infants following clinical assessment
      would delay the onset of resuscitative procedures. It is recognized that some infants who are
      randomized will not require respiratory support. While central and computer randomization
      have definite advantages over the use of opaque envelopes, their use in a resuscitation study
      is difficult given the time constraints. Treatment assignment will be concealed from everyone
      apart from the study investigator attending the delivery. The resuscitation team,
      biostatistician, data collector and clinical team providing ongoing care for the infant in
      the NICU will be blinded to the intervention. This will be achieved by randomizing infants to
      either a modified or standard T-piece infant resuscitator circuit. The circuit for the 50%
      FFO2 group will be altered so that pressure is not generated when the mask is held against
      the infant's face. The circuit for the 21% CPAP group will be unaltered and hence will
      generate CPAP when held against the face. It is not possible to detect if a unit has been
      modified without dismantling it. The circuit pressure gauge will also be covered. The study
      investigator will not be blinded so that he/she can appropriately set the FiO2 to either 21%
      or 50%.

      We have a custom mobile research cart which shields the oxygen blender, pulse oximetry
      monitor, T-piece infant resuscitation unit and the anaesthesia monitor from the view of the
      resuscitation team

      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION The sample size estimate is based on the primary outcome of
      proportion of infants reaching an oxygen saturation of ≥80% by 5 minutes of age. A sample
      size of 138 infants (69 in each group) would be required to detect a difference of 20% (71%
      to 91%) with 80% power at the 5% level of significance (two-tailed). The sample size estimate
      for the secondary outcome measure of proportion of infants reaching an oxygen saturation of
      ≥90% by 10 minutes of age is 214 (107 in each group). This will have 80% power to detect a
      difference of 20%(43% to 63%) between two adjacent means at the 5% level of significance
      (two-tailed test).

      We plan to enroll 220 infants (110 in each group) to provide adequate power to address both
      our primary and secondary outcomes.

      DATA ANALYSIS An intention to treat principal will be used so that infants receiving
      respiratory support will be analyzed in the group to which they were randomized. Exclusion
      after randomization will occur only for those infants that would not have qualified to
      receive 50% FFO2 as per NRP guidelines. A comparison of the proportion of infants achieving
      the target saturations at 5 and 10 minutes of age will be performed using the Chi-squared
      test.

      Other clinical parameters that are continuous variables will be analyzed using t-tests where
      the distributions are approximately normal. These variables include duration of respiratory
      support in NICU, length of stay in NICU and PaO2 at time of NICU admission. If normalizing
      transformations cannot be found or if censored observations occur, the time variables will be
      analyzed using survival analysis techniques. Binary outcomes (occurrence of air leaks, IVH,
      death, NICU admission) will be compared using the Chi Square test. Apgar scores at 1, 5 and
      10 minutes are ordinal variables and will be compared using the Mann-Whitney U test (Wilcoxon
      rank sum test). An interim analysis is not planned.
