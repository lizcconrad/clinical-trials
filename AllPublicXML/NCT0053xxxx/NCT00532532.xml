    <textblock>
      A drug called AV650 (tolperisone HCl) will be given to patients who have spasticity
      associated with multiple sclerosis. This study has three purposes:

        1. To determine whether AV650 is safe for patients with multiple sclerosis;

        2. To gather some early evidence as to whether AV650 is effective in treating spasticity in
           patients with multiple sclerosis; and,

        3. To assess what the body does with AV650 once it is ingested (Germany and Czech Republic
           sites only).
