      This is an observational study of pain and outcomes from females undergoing transvaginal
      NOTES removal of their appendix or gallbladder. Female subjects who elect to have a
      transvaginal NOTES removal of their appendix or gallbladder and agree to be in this study
      (through signature on the informed consent form) will be followed per standard of care, with
      additional follow-up for data collection including the following:

        -  Subjects will complete a 7 day pain/temperature log after surgery

        -  Subjects will complete a standardized sexual function questionnaire (Female Sexual
           Function Index) prior to surgery and 6 months after surgery

        -  Subjects will receive a phone call at 6 months and at 1 year after surgery to capture
           data related to safety, adverse events, hospitalizations and patient satisfaction

      Additional data related to pain and outcomes will be collected at baseline/screening and at
      follow-up as necessary.

        Group #1: NOTES Appendectomy - Transvaginal approach:

        Subjects will be female between the ages of 18-75 who present to the emergency room and are
        subsequently diagnosed with acute appendicitis. Following diagnosis, investigators will
        determine if the procedure can be completed via the transvaginal approach. If the patient
        satisfies the listed criteria then researchers will present study information and offer
        participation.

        Group # 2: NOTES Cholecystectomy - Transvaginal approach:

        Female subjects, between the ages of 18-75 who present in the UCSD surgery clinic for
        elective cholecystectomy will be offered participation in this study.
