  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects 2-3% of the population and leads to a great deal
      of suffering. Many patients benefit from established treatments, the mainstay of which are
      cognitive behavioral therapy and a group of antidepressant medications known as serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors. However, 20-30% of patients get minimal benefit from these established
      therapeutic strategies. New avenues of treatment are urgently needed.

      Existing medications for obsessive-compulsive disorder affect the neurotransmitters serotonin
      or dopamine; but increasing evidence suggests that functional disruptions of a different
      neurotransmitter, glutamate, may contribute to some cases of OCD. The researchers are
      therefore interested in using medications that target glutamate as novel treatment options
      for those OCD patients who do not benefit from established treatments.

      One such medication is the drug N-Acetylcysteine, whose glutamatergic antagonistic properties
      may be effective in reducing the glutamatergic hyperactivity that is thought to contribute to
      the pathophysiology of OCD and major depressive disorder (MDD).

      Riluzole, which is FDA approved for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's
      disease) is also a glutamatergic agent. There is evidence that riluzole possesses
      anti-depressant, anti-obsessional, and anti-anxiety properties.

      The modulation of glutamatergic activity is a promising new approach to the treatment of mood
      disorders. The researchers are therefore now recruiting patients to participate in a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of N-Acetylcysteine, added to whatever other OCD
      medications they are taking.

    <measure>Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS)at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Y-BOCS is a 10 item clinician-rated scale used to both determine the severity of OCD and to monitor symptom improvement throughout the course of the study. The Y-BOCS, specifically measures the severity of symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder without being biased towards the type of obsessions or compulsions present. The scale includes questions about the amount of time spent on, how much impairment or distress experienced from, and how much resistance and control over these obsessive thoughts and compulsions.
Each item is rated from 0 (&quot;no symptoms&quot;) to 4 (&quot;extreme symptoms&quot;) and yields a total possible score range from 0 to 40, with the following ranges indicating degree of severity:
0-7 = sub-clinical 8-15 = mild 16-23 = moderate 24-31 = severe 32-40 = extreme
In this study, baseline ratings are compared to those of week 12 to produce a &quot;percent of change&quot; with positive percentages indicating a decrease in symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>The Hamilton Depression Inventory (HAM-D)at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression is a multiple item (traditionally 17) assessment used to provide an indication of depression and as a guide to evaluate recovery. The clinician-rated assessment is designed for adults and is used to rate the severity of patient depression by asking about mood, feelings of guilt, insomnia, agitation, weight change, suicidal ideation, and somatic symptoms. The scale also allows the clinician to assess the patient's level of retardation, and insight into their depression.
In this study, the HAM-D17 (17 items scored) was used to obtain depression severity ratings with a maximum possible score of 52. Baseline ratings are compared to those of week 12 to produce a &quot;percentage of change&quot;, where positive values indicate a decrease in depressive severity/symptoms. Maximum score is a 52.
Ranges
0-7 = Normal 8-13 = Mild Depression 14-18 = Moderate Depression 19-22 = Severe Depression
≥23 = Very Severe Depression</description>

        <title>Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS)at Baseline</title>
        <description>The Y-BOCS is a 10 item clinician-rated scale used to both determine the severity of OCD and to monitor symptom improvement throughout the course of the study. The Y-BOCS, specifically measures the severity of symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder without being biased towards the type of obsessions or compulsions present. The scale includes questions about the amount of time spent on, how much impairment or distress experienced from, and how much resistance and control over these obsessive thoughts and compulsions.
Each item is rated from 0 (&quot;no symptoms&quot;) to 4 (&quot;extreme symptoms&quot;) and yields a total possible score range from 0 to 40, with the following ranges indicating degree of severity:
0–7 = sub-clinical 8–15 = mild 16–23 = moderate 24–31 = severe 32–40 = extreme
In this study, baseline ratings are compared to those of week 12 to produce a &quot;percent of change&quot; with positive percentages indicating a decrease in symptom severity.</description>

        <title>The Hamilton Depression Inventory (HAM-D)at Baseline</title>
        <description>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression is a multiple item (traditionally 17) assessment used to provide an indication of depression and as a guide to evaluate recovery. The clinician-rated assessment is designed for adults and is used to rate the severity of patient depression by asking about mood, feelings of guilt, insomnia, agitation, weight change, suicidal ideation, and somatic symptoms. The scale also allows the clinician to assess the patient’s level of retardation, and insight into their depression.
In this study, the HAM-D17 (17 items scored) was used to obtain depression severity ratings with a maximum possible score of 52. Baseline ratings are compared to those of week 12 to produce a &quot;percentage of change&quot;, where positive values indicate a decrease in depressive severity/symptoms. Maximum score is a 52.
Ranges
0-7 = Normal 8-13 = Mild Depression 14-18 = Moderate Depression 19-22 = Severe Depression
