      This is an observational study of pain and outcomes from patients undergoing transgastric
      NOTES removal of their appendix or gallbladder. Subjects who elect to have a transgastric
      NOTES removal of their appendix or gallbladder and agree to be in this study (through
      signature on the informed consent form) will be followed per standard of care, with
      additional follow-up for data collection including the following:

        -  Subjects will complete a 7 day pain/temperature log after surgery

        -  Subjects will receive a phone call at 6 months and at 1 year after surgery to capture
           data related to safety, adverse events, hospitalizations and patient satisfaction

      Additional data related to pain and outcomes will be collected at baseline/screening and at
      follow-up as necessary.

        There will be 2 groups in this study: Of special note, the inclusion criteria clearly
        states subjects must be seen within 36 hours of the onset of pain and have an ASA
        Classification of I. This is intended to avoid obtaining informed consent from a subject
        who is in severe pain and incapable of making an informed decision, as well as avoid
        coercion. An ASA Classification of I defines a healthy normal individual.

          1. Group 1 will be transgastric laparoscopic assisted appendectomy

          2. Group 2 will be transgastric laparoscopic assisted cholecystectomy
