      Purpose:

      The purpose of the correlative studies is to evaluate levels of serum factors of circulating
      VEGF and soluble VEGFR, circulating tumor cells and circulating endothelial cells assayed at
      baseline and over the course of initial treatment in order to explore relationships with
      baseline patient factors, measurable disease response and clinical progression.

      Hypothesis soluble markers of angiogenic growth factors and receptors, and circulating
      endothelial and tumor cells can serve as markers for biologic activity of temsirolimus and/or
      sorafenib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is recognized that the measurable disease RECIST criteria response rate with mTOR
      inhibition is likely to be low and that the benefit of such therapy will also include effects
      on disease stabilization. Disease stabilization is difficult to interpret in the phase II
      setting. Thus, it is desirable to develop biomarkers which will provide additional
      information on novel treatment effects and how they might relate to disease progression

      Approx. 40ml of blood for correlative studies will be drawn at predetermined time points:
      baseline, after cycle 1, at time of treatment failure/discontinuation of protocol therapy.

      10 unstained slides from original patient specimen (nephrectomy specimens only) will be
      collected within 6 months after enrollment.
