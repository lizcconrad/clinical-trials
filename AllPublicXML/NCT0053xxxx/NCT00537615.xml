      The purpose of this study is to investigate the absorption, metabolism and excretion of [14C]
      PD 0332334 to characterize plasma, fecal and urinary radioactivity and identify any
      metabolites of [14C] PD 0332334.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment
        into the trial:

          1. Healthy male subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive. (Healthy is
             defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical
             history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate
             measurement, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests).

          2. Body Mass Index (BMI) of approximately 18 to 30 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg
             (110 lbs).

          3. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject (or a legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all
             pertinent aspects of the trial.

          4. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled confinement period,
             treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other trial procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the trial:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic,
             orallergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          2. Subjects enrolled in a previous radionucleotide study or who have received
             radiotherapy within 12 months prior to screening or such that total radioactivity
             would exceed acceptable dosimetry.

          3. Subjects whose occupation requires exposure to radiation or monitoring of radiation
             exposure.
