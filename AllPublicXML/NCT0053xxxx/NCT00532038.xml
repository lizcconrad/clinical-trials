    <textblock>
      ThermoProfen is a transdermal ketoprofen patch that is integrated with a long-lasting CHADD
      (Controlled Heat-Assisted Drug Delivery) unit for the treatment of chronic pain associated
      with osteoarthritis. This study will evaluate the safety of long-term administration of
      ThermoProfen™ for the pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee in adults. The study
      will be conducted in patients with pain associated with osteoarthritis and who have completed
      a previous efficacy study of ThermoProfen.
