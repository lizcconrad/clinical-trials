    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to estimate the tumor response rate of temozolomide
      administered in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b to pediatric patients with
      unresectable Stage III, metastatic, or recurrent cutaneous melanoma.

    <textblock>
      This study is for children with malignant melanoma and high risk features (at high risk of
      melanoma returning or spreading to other parts of the body) or who have recurrent disease.
      The study has two treatment groups based on the stage of the disease. Patients with stage
      IIC, IIIA or IIIB melanoma whose tumors have been removed by surgery will be treated in study
      group A. These patients will receive 4 weeks of high dose interferon alfa-2b followed by 48
      weeks of peginterferon. Patients with stage IIIC or IV melanoma, stage III melanoma that
      could not be removed by surgery and those with recurrent disease will be treated in study
      group B. These patients will receive peginterferon alfa-2b and temozolomide.

      Stratum A: Resected Stages IIC, IIIA, and IIIB patients

      Induction therapy (weeks 1-4): Subjects will receive recombinant interferon alfa-2b 20
      million units/m2 per day intravenously over 20-30 minutes on 5 consecutive days per week for
      4 weeks. Subjects will receive peginterferon alfa-2b 1 mcg/kg/week subcutaneously for a total
      of 48 weeks.

      Stratum B: Resected Stage IIIC, unresectable Stage III, Stage IV, and recurrent patients

      Stratum B is divided into 2 groups based on the presence (Stratum B1) or absence (Stratum B2)
      of measurable disease. Subjects will receive 8 weekly doses of peginterferon alfa-2b 0.5
      mcg/kg/dose subcutaneously in combination with temozolomide 75mg/m2/dose by mouth daily for 6
      weeks followed by 2 week break. The duration of each treatment course will be 8 weeks. Strata
      B2 (no measurable disease) will proceed with 7 courses as outlined.

      Surgery interventions -Associated with both Strata A and B Surgery description: All subjects
      with initial presentation of melanoma (T1-4) will be treated with primary wide local excision
      with a minimum of 1cm margin (if anatomically feasible) surrounding the primary lesion or
      biopsy scar. For lesions with Breslow's thickness of &gt; 1mm or &lt;or= with ulceration or Clark's
      level IV/V, a 2 cm margin is preferred when anatomically feasible. Subjects with sentinel
      lymph node(s) positive for disease, will undergo complete lymph node dissection of the
      involved nodal basin.

      Additional objectives include:

        -  To assess the safety of temozolomide administered in combination with peginterferon α-2b
           to pediatric patients with resected AJCC Stage IIIC, unresectable Stage III, metastatic,
           or recurrent cutaneous melanoma (Stratum B).

        -  To study the feasibility and safety of administering peginterferon α-2b weekly for 48
           weeks following an initial induction phase with intravenous high dose interferon α-2b
           for 4 weeks to pediatric patients with resected thick melanomas (&gt; 4mm) with ulcerations
           (AJCC Stage IIC) and resected melanomas with regional lymph node metastases (AJCC Stage
           IIIA and IIIB) (Stratum A).

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response rate of stratum B1 participants was evaluated after 1 treatment course of temozolomide plus peginterferon ɑ-2b. Complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) confirmed with repeated scan at least 4 weeks apart following completion of course 1 therapy. CR defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions with no new lesions detected. If available, no disease must be detected by immunocytology or serum tumor markers. PR defined as at least 30% decrease in disease measurement compared to disease measurement at study entry with no new lesions detected. Progressive disease (PD) defined as at least 20% increase in the disease measurement compared to the smallest disease measurement recorded since start of treatment, or appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable disease defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD compared to smallest disease measurement since start of treatment.</description>

      <recruitment_details>A total of 29 patients were enrolled between May 9, 2008 and August 22, 2012. Of the 29 participants, 21 were enrolled at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH), 7 at MD Anderson, and 1 at Rady Children's Hospital. Twenty-three participants met stratum A eligibility, 2 met stratum B1 eligibility and 4 met stratum B2 eligibility.</recruitment_details>

        <title>Tumor Response Rate</title>
        <description>Tumor response rate of stratum B1 participants was evaluated after 1 treatment course of temozolomide plus peginterferon ɑ-2b. Complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) confirmed with repeated scan at least 4 weeks apart following completion of course 1 therapy. CR defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions with no new lesions detected. If available, no disease must be detected by immunocytology or serum tumor markers. PR defined as at least 30% decrease in disease measurement compared to disease measurement at study entry with no new lesions detected. Progressive disease (PD) defined as at least 20% increase in the disease measurement compared to the smallest disease measurement recorded since start of treatment, or appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable disease defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD compared to smallest disease measurement since start of treatment.</description>

Grade 4 non-hem toxicity that is NOT constitutional symptoms (fever, chills, fatigue and/or pain)
Grade 3 elevations in creatinine or BUN that are determined to be probably or definitely related to protocol therapy

        <description>The objective was to study the feasibility and safety of administering peginterferon a-2b weekly for 48 weeks following the initial induction phase to Stratum A participants.
Accrual was suspended during the 48-week course if 2 or more of 6, 4 or more of 12, 6 or more of 18, 8 or more of 24, 10 or more of 30 participants experienced target toxicity defined as:
Grade 4 non-hematologic (non-hem) toxicity that does not resolve to ≤grade 1 within 2 weeks from the time next dose is due and is determined to be probably or definitely related to protocol therapy
Grade 4 non-hem toxicity that is NOT constitutional symptoms (fever, chills, fatigue and/or pain)
Grade 3 elevations in creatinine or BUN that are determined to be probably or definitely related to protocol therapy

Samples were analyzed for pegylated interferon ɑ-2b concentrations by using the VeriKine Human Interferon Alpha ELISA Kit following the manufacturer's instructions, and concentration-time data were analyzed by nonlinear-mixed effects modeling as implemented in NONMEM.</description>
