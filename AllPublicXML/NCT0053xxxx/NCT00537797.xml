  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see how well FDG-PET scans can determine the malignancy
      of thyroid nodules that have already been tested (and come back positive) by fine needle
      aspiration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While FNA is a sensitive test for diagnosing thyroid tumors, it cannot differentiate benign
      from malignant follicular nodules and sometimes yields equivocal results due to inadequate
      sampling or indeterminate cytology. The standard of care for patients with equivocal or
      follicular histology is surgical removal of these nodules, most of which are benign in
      nature. FDG-PET, as evidenced by our prior experience and studies from other groups, may have
      application in discriminating benign from malignant disease in these patients with equivocal
      or follicular FNA results using standardized uptake value determination. We have demonstrated
      the feasibility and preliminary clinical utility of using limited neck FDG-PET exams in
      patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules in a pilot study. The purpose of this trial is to
      prospectively evaluate a larger series of patients with equivocal or follicular histology on
      FNA to more accurately define the sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET for diagnostic
      imaging of these nodules. In addition, the utility of this modality in identifying metastatic
      foci in patients with thyroid cancer having follicular or equivocal histology on FNA will be
      assessed. If the sensitivity and specificity of this modality are determined to be high
      (â‰¥95%) for diagnosing malignant nodules in these patients, many patients with benign disease
      may potentially benefit by avoiding unnecessary operations.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented history of a solitary thyroid nodule or a dominant nodule within
             multinodular disease, with fine needle aspiration demonstrating a follicular or
             indeterminate cytologic examination. If a core needle biopsy was performed instead of
             a fine needle aspiration, demonstrating follicular or indeterminate cytology, the
             patient is eligible if the biopsy procedure was felt to be minimally disruptive to the
             nodule architecture, based on a review by the PI or nuclear medicine investigator.

          -  Thyroid nodule must be palpable on physical examination or have a minimum size of 1 cm
             in diameter by ultrasonography, CT or MRI. The minimum size criterion was established
             to address the spatial resolution limitations of PET/CT imaging.

          -  Scheduled for surgical excision of thyroid nodules within 3 months of the date of the
             FDG-PET/CT scan.

          -  Ability to tolerate lying supine for a FDG-PET/CT examination.

          -  Age &gt;/= 18 and &lt;/= 105 (This disease is rare in children and therefore the study will
             be limited to adults.)

          -  Willing to participate in all aspects of the study (patient may opt out of the tissue
             collection portion.)

          -  Patient must be euthyroid with a serum TSH or a free T4 level within the institutional
             upper and lower limits of normal, measured within 6 months of registration. NOTE: mild
             deviations from the institutional normal limits may be considered acceptable if the
             patient has achieved a clinically euthyroid state with medication at a stable dose for
             &gt;3 months, and the TSH is considered to be at target by the patient's treating
             physician. In patients with hyperthyroidism requiring treatment, this euthyroid state
             may be achieved with administration of a thionamide such as propylthiouracil prior to
             FDG-PET/CT exam. Patients with hyperthyroid inflammatory conditions such as
             thyroiditis and toxic multinodular goiter often exhibit increased glucose uptake
             resulting in diffuse uptake of FDG which may obscure visualization of a thyroid tumor.

          -  If female, patient must have a negative pregnancy test at the time of registration, be
             post-menopausal (with no period in the last twelve months), have had a tubal ligation
             at least twelve months ago, or have had a hysterectomy.

          -  In patients with multinodular disease and a dominant nodule, the nuclear medicine
             physician responsible for FDG-PET/CT scan interpretation must determine whether the
             indeterminate nodule can be discriminated on FDG-PET/CT imaging prior to enrollment.

          -  A signed and dated written informed consent obtained from the patient or the patient's
             legally acceptable representative prior to study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a fasting glucose level &gt; 200 mg/dL at the time of the PET/CT scan

          -  Patient has had prior neck surgery or radiation that in the opinion of the
             investigator has disrupted tissue architecture of the thyroid

          -  Patient has evidence of infection localized to the neck in the 14 days prior to the
             FDG-PET/CCT scan

          -  Patient does not meet any of the inclusion criteria
