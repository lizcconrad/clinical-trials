  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Factors which delay recovery following uncomplicated abdominal surgery include uncontrolled
      pain, intolerance of diet and poor mobility. Enhanced recovery after Surgery (ERAS)
      programmes are perioperative care pathways that address systematically these issues (i.e.
      improved dynamic pain relief, optimised nutritional care and enforced mobilisation) to
      promote a faster recovery and a shorter stay. The key treatments that improve outcome within
      an ERAS programme are not known. Moreover there are few acceptable, objective endpoints to
      assess key outcome variables such as return of GI function. This randomised trial will assess
      the potential synergy between early recovery of GI function (laxation) and early
      postoperative oral nutritional support(with associated preoperative preconditioning using
      carbohydrate/fluid loading). The main overall outcome targets being improved recovery of
      gastrointestinal function, postoperative nutritional status and physical function. It will
      validate the use of a novel, objective technique to measure gastric motility (surrogate for
      GI function). Such refinement of ERAS should result in shorter hospital stay and better use
      of limited health care resource.
