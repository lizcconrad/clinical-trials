      The purpose of this prospective clinical data collection is to document the performance and
      clinical outcomes of the ExploR® Modular Radial Head. This data collection effort will
      document the clinical outcomes of the radial head.

      Data collection intervals are:

      Pre-operative, Operative, 3 Months Post-op, 1 Year Post-op, 3 Years Post-op, and 5 Years
      Post-op.

      Data collected includes:

      Historical data, Operative record, Mayo Clinic Performance Index for the Elbow, Quick DASH
      Outcome Measure, Complications, Lost to Follow-up, Protocol Deviations, and Radiographic
      evaluation of elbow and wrist.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The inclusion criteria will be the same as the indications stated in the FDA cleared
        (510(k) K040611) and (510(k) K051385) labeling for the device.

          1. Replacement of the radial head for degenerative or post-traumatic disabilities
             presenting pain, crepitation, and decreased motion at the radio-humeral and/or
             proximal radio-ulnar joint with:

               1. Joint destruction and/or subluxation visible on x-ray

               2. Resistance to conservative treatment

          2. Primary replacement after fracture of the radial head

          3. Symptomatic sequelae after radial head resection

          4. Revision following failed radial head arthroplasty

        The device is intended for single use with or without bone cement.

        Modular Radial Head replacement prostheses have received FDA clearance for cemented and
        non-cemented application.

        Patient selection factors to be considered include: 1) need to obtain pain relief and
        improve function, 2) ability and willingness of the patient to follow instructions,
        including control of weight and activity levels, 3) a good nutritional state of the
        patient, and 4) the patient must have reached full skeletal maturity.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The exclusion criteria will be the same as the contraindications stated in the FDA cleared
        labeling (510(k) K040611) and (510(k) K051385) for the device. These contraindications
        include:

        Absolute contraindications:

          1. Infection

          2. Sepsis

          3. Osteomyelitis

        Relative contraindications:

          1. Uncooperative patient or patient with neurologic disorders who is incapable or
             unwilling to follow directions

          2. Osteoporosis

          3. Metabolic disorders which may impair bone function

          4. Osteomalacia

          5. Distant foci of infections which may spread to the implant site

          6. Rapid joint destruction, marked bone loss or bone resorption apparent on
             roentgenogram.
