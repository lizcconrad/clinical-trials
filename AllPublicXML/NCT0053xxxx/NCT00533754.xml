      The aim of the study is to show a higher expression of the Y402H polymorphism in the
      complement factor H in patients with AMD compared to healthy individuals.

      Additionaly a correlation between a subsided infection with chlamydia and patients with AMD
      and a factor H polymorphism will be investigated. An interrelationship with the VEGF-plasma
      level shall give more hints into the pathomechanism of AMD.
