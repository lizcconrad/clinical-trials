  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate, by MRI, knee cartilage and structure in all subjects.
      Half the subjects in this study will take collagen hydrolysate each day for 48 weeks and the
      other half of the subjects will take a placebo dose, that looks like and tastes like the
      collagen hydrolysate, each day for 48 weeks. MRIs will be taken at Study Weeks -1, 24, and
      48.

      This is a single-site, double-blind, pilot study to evaluate the sensitivity of MRI to detect
      cartilage structure and composition in subjects taking daily oral collagen hydrolysate (a
      nutritional supplement) or placebo for 48 weeks. 30 subjects will be randomized to collagen
      hydrolysate or placebo (1:1 ratio). The goal is to evaluate, by MRI, knee cartilage and
      structure in all subjects. The primary functional outcome measure will be the WOMAC
      questionnaire and the primary pathological outcome measure will be knee cartilage structure
      and composition as measurements done by MRI imaging. Subjects will have contrast dGEMRIC MRIs
      done at Study Weeks -1, 24 and 48.
