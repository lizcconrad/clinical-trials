      This is a cross-sectional study to determine, via iliac crest bone biopsies, the effect of
      long-term treatment with raloxifene on histomorphometry and bone quality in patients who
      participated in the Continuing Outcomes Relevant to Evista Study.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have completed the CORE protocol within 3 months (90 days) prior to study entry and
             enrollment.

          -  Have taken randomized study material for at least 7 years since enrollment in the MORE
             protocol. If the patient opted not to receive randomized study material for a period
             of 6 months at any point during either the MORE or CORE protocol, this period must
             have occurred in its entirety before Visit 3 of the CORE protocol.

          -  Overall, were at least 75% compliant with randomized study material during the MORE
             and CORE protocols.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have an allergy or other intolerance to tetracycline hydrochloride that would preclude
             its administration in conjunction with the bone biopsy procedures. If the patient is
             not allergic to all tetracyclines, then this exclusion may be waived by the sponsor
             and a different tetracycline to which the patient is not allergic may be used.

          -  Have undergone two previous transiliac bone biopsies (one in each iliac crest).
             Patients with one previous transiliac bone biopsy are eligible provided that the new
             sample is obtained from the contralateral iliac crest.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, have any medical or anatomical condition that
             potentially could put the patient at additional risk of an adverse event due to the
             procedure (for example, coagulation abnormality, extreme obesity, etc.).

          -  Have a history of bone metabolic diseases, Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy,
             osteomalacia, any secondary causes of osteoporosis, hyperparathyroidism (uncorrected),
             and intestinal malabsorption.

          -  Have a history of malignant neoplasms in the prior 5 years, with the exception of
             superficial basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has been
             definitively treated. If malignant neoplasm was ever diagnosed, patient must presently
             be free of disease.
