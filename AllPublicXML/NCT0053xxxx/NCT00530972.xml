  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy and safety of Peginterfer√≥n alfa-2a (40 KD) plus Ribavirin in
      patients who have relapsed or not responded to a previous suboptimal therapy based in
      Interferon.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An important number of co-infected patients were treated suboptimally in the past with others
      ineffective therapies interferon-based.

      All co-infected patients should be an opportunity of retreatment with actually therapies.
