    <textblock>
      This study will determine the best doses of docetaxel and lonafarnib when the two anti-cancer
      agents are used in combination. Patients with tumors for which treatment with docetaxel would
      be appropriate are eligible. A second part of the study will further examine the
      effectiveness of the combination treatment in men with prostate cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For Part 1: Subjects may be male or female and must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  For Part 1: Cancer for which docetaxel treatment is appropriate.

             administration.

          -  Adequate organ function within 3 weeks prior to first study drug administration.

          -  Performance status (ECOG) is less than or equal to 2.

          -  Subject understands and agrees to procedures and participation by signing informed
             consent form.

          -  Agrees to use medically accepted form of contraception.

          -  Surgery within 3 weeks prior to first study drug administration.

          -  History within 5 years prior to first study drug administration of another malignancy
             except adequately treated Stage I/II basal/squamous cell skin cancer.

          -  Radiation therapy within 3 weeks prior to first study drug administration.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to prednisone, docetaxel, polysorbate 80, lonafarnib, or any
             excipients associated with these medications.

          -  Known contraindication to steroid use.

          -  Known leptomeningeal or CNS metastasis.

          -  Heart, vascular, or seizure disorder (detailed list in the protocol) within 6 months
             prior to first study drug administration.

          -  Baseline QTc interval greater than 450 msec.

          -  Grade 2 or more peripheral neuropathy or drug-related toxicity per CTCAE. Exceptions
             are noted in the protocol.

          -  Any clinically significant condition or situation that the investigator thinks would
             interfere with the study evaluations or subject's participation.

          -  Subject is part of staff personnel involved in the study.

          -  Subject has known clinically significant immunosuppression.
