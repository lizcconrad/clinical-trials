  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish the extent to which BIIB014, following 8 to 12 consecutive days of dosing at
      selected dose levels, occupies the brain's A2A receptors. Receptor occupancy will be assessed
      by PET scanning using a radiolabelled tracer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled sequentially into cohorts of 2 to 4 subjects. PET scan results will
      determine the actual number of cohorts enrolled and the BIIB014 dose given to each subject.
      Since all enrolled subjects will be receiving BIIB014, this study is being listed as a 1-arm,
      Single Group study (actual study design is dose escalation).

      Participating subjects will be required to reside in the clinical unit for 10 to 14
      consecutive days. Participants will receive 1 oral dose of BIIB014 daily for 8 to 12
      consecutive days. During the study, subjects will undergo 2 PET scans and 1 MRI. Frequent
      blood sample for pharmacokinetic assessments will also be performed.

    <description>11C]SCH442416 is a radiolabelled tracer molecule that specifically binds to adenosine A2A sites and will be used to evaluate receptor occupancy. The target activity will be 370 MBq. [11C]SCH442416 will be administered IV as a bolus injection over 30 seconds following the start of each PET scan.</description>
