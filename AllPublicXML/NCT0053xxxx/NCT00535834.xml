      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients before and after
      treatment may help doctors learn more about the effects of the treatment on cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying samples collected from patients with localized
      prostate cancer who received treatment on clinical trial NCI-00-C-0154.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the formation of antibody complexes in serum samples taken before initiation of
           treatment and after completion of therapy in prostate cancer patients previously
           enrolled on clinical trial NCI-00-C-0154.

        -  Evaluate immunologic response.

      Secondary

        -  Clone the underlying tumor antigens discovered through SEREX.

      OUTLINE: Samples previously collected on clinical trial NCI-00-C-0154 (whole blood, serum,
      and peripheral mononuclear blood cells) are analyzed for immunologic responses and evidence
      of formation of anti-tumor antibodies. Western blot is used to detect any evidence of
      vaccine-induced autoantibody responses. If there is an indication of response, SEREX is used
      to clone the underlying antigens.
