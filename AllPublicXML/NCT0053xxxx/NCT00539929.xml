  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, multicenter study to assess the efficacy and safety of E6201 topical
      administration to pre-identified marker lesions in adult subjects with chronic plaque type
      psoriasis. Treatment duration is 8 weeks, followed by a 4-week period without treatment.
      Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained pre-and post treatment.

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Males and females 18 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of mild-to-moderate
             plaque-type psoriasis for â‰¥12 months prior to screening

          -  Female participants postmenopausal &gt;1 year or surgically sterile

          -  Two representative and similar target lesions for the condition, each of 15-25
             centimeters squared (cm^2), up to 50 cm^2 in surface area

          -  Target lesion severity score of 4-8 on a scale of 0 to 12, where, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, 0 equals no evidence of disease and 12 equals severe induration,
             erythema, scaling, and pruritus

          -  Prescription medications, if applicable, for chronic conditions allowed but must be on
             a stable regimen prior to and during the study; this is also applicable for dietary
             supplements and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs

          -  Participants able and willing to give informed consent

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Use of any, concomitant, topical treatment for psoriasis, excluding emollients

          -  Use of any, concomitant, systemic treatment for psoriasis, including ultraviolet
             radiation (UVR) light

          -  Evidence of significant hepatic, gastrointestinal, renal, respiratory, endocrine,
             hematological, neurological, psychiatric, musculoskeletal, rheumatologic, or
             cardiovascular system abnormalities

          -  Evidence of any clinically significant deviation from normal with respect to medical
             history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), or
             clinical laboratory determinations. If any participant has an abnormal clinical
             laboratory test finding that meets specified criteria, that participant will be
             re-tested by repeated blood draw and clinical laboratory assessment. If the abnormal
             test finding is confirmed, the participant will be excluded from the study.
