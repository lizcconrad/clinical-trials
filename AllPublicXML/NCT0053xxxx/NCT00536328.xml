  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric distress is a common phenomenon in our society. Heartburn and regurgitation occur
      daily in about 7% of the adult population,weekly 14-20% pf the adults and monthly in 34-44%
      of adults. The yearly prevalence of recurrent stomach complaints are frequent reason for
      consulting a primary care physician and are an important reason for using OTC medication. A
      good diagnosis is important as functional GERD with possible complications such as strictures
      and Barrett's esophagus or ulcer disease with life threatening complications such as bleeding
      &amp; perforations. The clinical diagnosis of reflux disease is mainly based on symptom
      evaluation. This, however, is hindered by the variety of complaints with different etiology.
      Treatment with a proton pump inhibitor can be used to confirm the diagnosis reflux disease. A
      major part of the patients with acid related stomach complaints indeed will experience
      symptom relief after starting PPI therapy. In this view, it is important to identify these
      patients who will react on treatment with PPI in quick, accurate, non-invasive and cheap
      manner. The Reflux Impact Scale (RIS) is validated, short, self explanatory questionnaire
      which asks for the presence &amp; impact of reflux symptoms. The RIS is developed for PCP to aid
      in the evaluation &amp; selection of these patient who will profit from treatment with PPI. The
      aim of this present study is to determine which questions of the RIS can be predictive for
      reaching treatment success with PPI. Treatment success is determined by asking for patients'
      satisfaction &amp; completion of the McMaster Overall Treatment Evaluation Heartburn
      questionnaire.
