  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of Study 20060172 was to measure echocardiographic parameters and biomarkers in a
      subgroup of study subjects enrolled in Study 20050222 (the RED-HF Trial). This substudy
      20060172 was terminated early due to feasibility constraints. All subjects enrolled in
      20060172 were also enrolled in Study 20050222, which is ongoing. Study data will be analyzed
      when Study 20050222 ends, since unblinding before then would adversely affect Study 20050222.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent for Study 20060172

          -  Randomized into Study 20050222

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition or situation that, in the investigator's opinion, may put the subject at
             significant risk, render the subject unsuitable for accurate echocardiography, may
             confound the study results, or may interfere significantly with the subject's
             participation in Study 20060172 or in Study 20050222.
