  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EDIPP is a multisite trial of early identification and intervention to prevent the onset of
      psychosis in adolescents and young adults, carried out at six sites across the United States.
      The hypothesis is that very early identification and intervention will be effective in
      delaying or preventing onset of psychosis and improving social and occupational functioning.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is structured as a cutoff, regression discontinuity design, in which lower
      risk-for-psychosis participants will not be treated by protocol but followed up for two
      years. Those at higher risk will be treated with anti-psychotic, antidepressant and mood
      stabilizing medications by symptom indications, and systematically provided psychoeducational
      multifamily group treatment, supported education and employment, and intensive clinical case
      management, using key elements of Assertive Community Treatment. Both arms of the study will
      be followed for two years and assessed at 6, 12, and 24 months. Outcome measures include
      rates of conversion to psychosis, relapse of psychosis, development of psychotic disorder
      diagnoses, levels of positive, negative and general symptoms, social and vocational
      functioning, family functioning, and neurocognitive functioning.

      The six sites include Sacramento, California; Salem Oregon; and surrounding counties,
      Ypsilanti and Washtenaw County, Michigan; Portland, Maine; Albuquerque, New Mexico and Glen
      Oaks, New York.

      In addition to symptomatic and functional outcomes, impact on incidence of psychotic
      disorders, including schizophrenia, will be assessed, as will cost-benefit effects.

    <description>Psychotic symptoms were assessed and scored using the Structured Interview for the Prodromal Syndrome (SIPS) and the Scale of Prodromal Symptoms (SOPS). The SOPS provides a measure of four domains of symptoms, including positive, negative, disorganized and general symptoms. The Positive Symptom sub-scale score reported is the sum of all five symptom items in the Positive Symptom sub-scale. The Positive Symptom sub-scale assesses psychotic symptoms, each item on a scale of 0-6. The sum scale score is 0-30, with 30 indicating severe psychotic symptoms, while 0 indicates no psychotic symptoms.</description>

          <title>Psychotic symptoms</title>
          <description>Psychotic symptoms were assessed and scored using the Structured Interview for the Prodromal Syndrome (SIPS) and the Scale of Prodromal Symptoms (SOPS). The SOPS provides a measure of four domains of symptoms, including positive, negative, disorganized and general symptoms. The Positive Symptom sub-scale score reported is the sum of all five symptom items in the Positive Symptom sub-scale. The Positive Symptom sub-scale assesses psychotic symptoms, each item on a scale of 0-6. The sum scale score is 0-30, with 30 indicating severe psychotic symptoms, while 0 indicates no psychotic symptoms.</description>
