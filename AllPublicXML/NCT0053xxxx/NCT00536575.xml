  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm Phase I/II study of sorafenib and bortezomib with dose optimization in
      initial patients. The initial patients on the dose-finding portion of this study will be
      enrolled through a single institution. Following establishment of the Phase II dose the study
      will open enrollment throughout the Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI) Oncology Research
      Consortium.

      The purpose of this study is to develop the combination of bortezomib (which is proven to be
      clinically active in patients with multiple myeloma) with sorafenib (a potent inhibitor of
      angiogenesis). This regimen will be developed in a schedule that is convenient for patients,
      and that is as minimally toxic to patients as possible.

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of sorafenib with weekly bortezomib, as measured by objective
      response rate and progression-free survival in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple
      myeloma.

      Secondary Objective:

      To evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of sorafenib with weekly bortezomib in the treatment
      of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

    <description>The trial was designed as a single-arm Phase I/II study of sorafenib and bortezomib with dose optimization in initial patients. Phase I consisted of cohorts of 3 patients at each of three dose levels. Patients received bortezomib (Dose Level 1 - 1.3 mg/m2; Dose Level 2 - 1.6 mg/m2) by IV bolus on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 5-week cycle with continuous oral dosing of sorafenib at 200 mg twice daily. Dose level 3 was planned as bortezomib 1.6 mg/m2 IV bolus on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 with sorafenib 400 mg by mouth twice daily throughout each 5-week cycle.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible participants must have been previously diagnosed using standard criteria and
             have received no more than 2 prior regimens for the treatment of multiple myeloma.

          -  Participant must be defined as Relapsed or Refractory Disease by one of the following
             criteria prior to enrollment: Relapsed Disease after high-dose therapy (autologous
             stem cell transplantation) as part of the first-line line treatment program. These
             patients may have received a maximum of 1 previous regimen, Refractory Disease or
             Relapsed Disease after &gt; 1 prior therapy for multiple myeloma. Prior bortezomib
             treatment permitted if the patient achieved a documented response.

          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1, or 2.

          -  WBC &gt;= 3000; ANC &gt;= 1000; platelets &gt;= 50,000 (Patients with platelets &gt;= 30,000 are
             eligible if thrombocytopenia is felt to be due to extensive bone marrow involvement
             with myeloma).

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL for a calculated or measured creatinine clearance &gt; 30

          <description>The trial was designed as a single-arm Phase I/II study of sorafenib and bortezomib with dose optimization in initial patients. Phase I consisted of cohorts of 3 patients at each of three dose levels. Patients received bortezomib (Dose Level 1 - 1.3 mg/m2; Dose Level 2 - 1.6 mg/m2) by IV bolus on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 5-week cycle with continuous oral dosing of sorafenib at 200 mg twice daily. Dose level 3 was planned as bortezomib 1.6 mg/m2 IV bolus on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 with sorafenib 400 mg by mouth twice daily throughout each 5-week cycle.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The 15% response rate was substantially lower than the designed rate of 60% for this trial. Coupled with the influx of new compounds for the treatment of multiple myeloma it was decided that this study should be closed early.</limitations_and_caveats>
