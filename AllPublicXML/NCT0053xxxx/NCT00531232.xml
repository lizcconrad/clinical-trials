      There is no well accepted standard care for patients who fail or are intolerant to any of the
      currently approved therapies for Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS). In this study, patients
      will be assigned to receive 25mg of oral clofarabine daily for 5 days. Patients may receive
      up to 8 cycles of treatment with clofarabine as long as the patient continues to benefit and
      in the absence of progressive disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a pathologically confirmed secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia (following a history
             of MDS) or MDS with an intermediate 1 (with marrow blasts great than or equal to 5%)
             intermediate 2 or high risk score as assessed by the International Prognostic Scoring
             System (IPSS) at study, entry. Patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts in
             transformation (RAEB-t) recognized by the French-American-British (FAB) system, and
             chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) will be allowed into the study. Pathologic
             confirmation is the responsibility of the site investigator.

          -  Have previously treated MDS defined as follows: a.)Patients must have had at least
             one, but no more than two, prior treatment regimens [A treatment regimen is defined as
             any drug or drug combination administered for treatment of MDS with the intent of
             inducing at least hematologic improvement (consistent with International Working Group
             [IWG] criteria); Inadequate treatment, due to drug intolerance or other factors, will
             still be considered a prior treatment regimen. Hematopoietic growth factors,
             hydroxyurea, anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), or supportive care measures (e.g., blood
             transfusions, immunosuppressive agents, antibiotics) will not be considered treatment
             regimens for the purpose of study entry.] b.)One of the treatment regimens must have
             been either 5-azacytidine or decitabine. If 5-azacytidine or decitabine is given as a
             treatment regimen more than once, it will be considered as 2 different treatment
             regimens. c.)Patients must not have been refractory (i.e., progression of disease, or
             no evidence of response, while on the treatment) to more than one prior treatment
             regimen (to be considered refractory to decitabine or 5-azacitidine, patients must
             have received greater than or equal to 4 cycles).

          -  Have documentation of prior transfusion requirements for the preceding 8 weeks (8
             weeks prior to first dose of study drug).

          -  Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2.

          -  Be able to comply with study procedures and follow-up examinations.

          -  Have adequate renal and hepatic functions as indicated by predefined laboratory
             values: a.)Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x institutional Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) except
             for unconjugated hyperbilirubin secondary to treatment for MDS or Gilbert's syndrome;
             and b.)Aspartate aminotransferase(AST) and Alanine aminotransferase(ALT) &lt; 2.5 x ULN;
             and c.)Serum creatine &lt; 1.0 mg/dL, then the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
             must be &gt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2 as calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
             (MDRD) equation.

          -  Be non-fertile or agree to use birth control during the study through the end of last
             treatment visit and at least 90 days after.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have had an adjustment of dose and/or schedule of erythropoietin, granulocyte colony
             stimulating factor (G-CSF) or other growth factors within 8 weeks prior to the first
             dose of oral clofarabine.

          -  Have had any prior therapy for treatment of sAML. Hydroxyurea must not have been
             received within 24 hours prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  Have had any other chemotherapy or any investigational therapy within four weeks of
             first dose of study drug.

          -  Have had any prior pelvic radiotherapy.

          -  Have had a prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant for MDS.

          -  Have not recovered to &lt; grade 2 from any drug-related non-hematologic toxicity prior
             to first dose of the study drug.

          -  Have an uncontrolled systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection (defined as
             exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection and without improvement,
             despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment).

          -  Have a psychiatric disorder that would interfere with consent, study participation, or
             follow-up.

          -  Have any other severe concurrent disease, or have a history of serious organ
             dysfunction or disease involving the heart, kidney, or liver, in particular: a.)New
             York Heart Association (NHA) classification stage II, III, or IV congestive heart
             failure; b.)Coronary artery disease or arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease
             (angina, myocardial infraction) within 3 months of first dose of study drug; c.)Any
             other primary cardiac disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, increases the
             risk of ventricular arrhythmia.

          -  Have any other severe concurrent disease, or have a history of serious organ
             dysfunction or disease involving the heart had any prior treatment with Clofarabine.

          -  Have had a diagnosis of another malignancy, unless the patient has been disease-free
             for at least 3 years following the completion of curative intent therapy with the
             following exceptions: a.)Patients with treated non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ
             carcinoma, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, regardless of the disease -free
             duration, are eligible for this study if definitive treatment for the condition has
             been completed. b.)Patients with organ-confined prostate cancer with no evidence of
             recurrent or progressive disease based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values are
             also eligible for this study if hormonal therapy has been initiated or a radical
             prostatectomy has been performed.

          -  Have prior positive test for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

          -  Have currently active gastrointestinal disease, or prior surgery that may affect the
             ability of the patient to absorb oral clofarabine.

          -  Participating in other concurrent investigational protocols that are not restricted to
             data and/or sample collection for patient demographic and/or sample collection for
             patient demographic and/or disease purposes.

          -  Have had prior treatment with a known nephrotoxic drug within 2 weeks of the first
             dose of study drug, unless the patient has a calculated GFR &gt;30 at 2 time points no
             less than 7 days apart during the 2-week period prior to the first dose of study drug.
