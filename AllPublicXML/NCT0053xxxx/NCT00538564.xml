  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to compare the effect of tadalafil with placebo (an inactive
      substance that looks like the study drug, but should have no effect) on the frequency of
      recurrent priapism (prolonged erection, unassociated with sexual interest or desire) and the
      nature of sexual experiences in male patients with sickle cell disease.

      This study will investigate phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE 5) inhibitor therapy as a potential
      treatment for recurrent ischemic priapism. Enrolled participants will be randomized to
      receive oral 10 mg tadalafil tablets 3 times a week or receive matching placebo. Patients
      will be instructed to use the medication in the morning a few hours after awakening from
      night time sleep, and they will be instructed against engaging in any form of sexual activity
      or excitement within 8 hours of dosing. Treatment duration will be 2 months for each
      participant. After the 2 month period, participants on tadalafil and placebo will be offered
      tadalafil (same dosing regimen) for an additional 2 months.

      The study duration will be 4 months.

      Tests and procedures will include: consent; medical history; physical examination; clinical
      laboratory tests; completion of questionnaires; and medication dispensation.
