  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) experience significant functional limitations
      due to ischemic symptoms (claudication) and are at high risk for CVD morbidity and mortality
      resulting from untreated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and aggressive
      atherosclerosis. The overall Goal of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to examine
      the synergistic effect of a multifactor risk reduction on walking distance, blood flow and
      quality of life in 300 patients with PAD.

      Specifically, we will compare the effects of 24 months of a novel, yet well-tested multiple
      risk factor reduction program, the Health Education and Risk Reduction Training (HEAR2T)
      Program for PAD versus enhanced standard care on: 1) symptom limited walking distance as
      assessed by treadmill exercise testing and walking impairment questionnaire; 2) endothelial
      function as measured by flow mediated vasodilation (FMVD) via brachial artery ultrasound. We
      will also explore the association between FMVD and decreased oxidative stress (as measured by
      oxygen radical absorbance capacity and urinary isoprostanes) and reduced degradation of
      nitric oxide (NO) and/or increased NO biosynthesis (as measured by urine nitrogen oxide,
      plasma nitrogen oxide, plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine, plasma, urine and platelet cyclic
      GMP).

      Secondary hypotheses examine the association between reducing CVD risk factors, improved
      endothelial function, increased walking distance, improved quality of life and number of
      metabolic syndrome abnormalities in PAD patients.

      Significance. This study will contribute to evidence on the efficacy of multiple risk factor
      reduction on improving physical function and quality of life in the understudied, elderly PAD
      patient. This study will also provide preliminary evidence for the biological basis for the
      efficacy of multifactor risk reduction in restoring vascular homeostasis, critical because of
      its role in antiatherogenesis and maintaining vasoreactivity, both necessary for slowing the
      progression of atherosclerosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects eligible for this study include:

          1. Age 50 years or older with one or more CVD risk factor

          2. PAD secondary to atherosclerosis with significant claudication

          3. Claudication is defined as pain, ache, cramp, numbness or severe fatigue of muscles of
             one or both lower extremities, reproducibly provoked by walking causing the patient to
             slow or stop walking pace

          4. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) &lt; 0.90

          5. In diabetics ABI is inaccurate, in which case, we will substitute toe pressures &lt; 60
             mmHg

          6. ABI one minute after exercise is at least 20% lower than index leg resting ABI

          7. Capable of walking at least 50 feet

          8. Primary limitation to walking is claudication, not coexisting conditions such as
             severe CAD, uncontrolled hypertension, pulmonary disease, severe arthritis, or
             orthopedic conditions

          9. Difference of walking time between two consecutive (of four) baseline treadmill tests
             must be &lt; 25%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria include:

          1. Active malignancy or tumor or other condition that would severely limit life
             expectancy

          2. Any type of major surgery during the last 3 months (i.e. aortic or lower extremity
             arterial surgery, angioplasty, or lumbar sympathectomy, leg amputation above the
             ankle)

          3. Residence in a long-term institutional setting

          4. Psychiatric disorders with currently active manifestations

          5. Uncontrolled metabolic disorders (renal failure, liver failure, thyrotoxicosis)

             failure

          7. Lack of phone access (either by self or through neighbors/family members)

          8. Other specified circumstances incompatible with case-management (i.e., plan to move
             away from area)

          9. Presence of another household member or first-degree relative already enrolled in the
             study
