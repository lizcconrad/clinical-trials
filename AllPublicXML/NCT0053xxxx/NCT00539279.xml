    <textblock>
      This project represents the first randomized clinical trial of psychotherapy for older
      veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It will compare relaxation training (RT)
      to prolonged exposure therapy (PE). The project will also examine whether cognitive
      impairment influences psychotherapy outcome.

      Primary hypotheses: (1) Subjects in the PE condition will have significantly less severe PTSD
      symptoms, depressive symptoms, and functional impairment than subjects in the RT condition at
      posttest; (2) Executive functioning will modify the response to both treatments, such that
      those with impaired executive functioning will demonstrate a smaller reduction in PTSD
      symptoms (representing less clinically significant change).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is associated with high rates of mortality from suicide and health complications, high
      healthcare costs, and diminished health and quality of life. Many military veterans have PTSD
      due to combat, and many veterans continue to carry the symptoms of PTSD into late life. The
      percentage of older veterans is expected to increase substantially in coming years
      (especially as Vietnam-era veterans become older adults). The psychosocial intervention with
      the most rigorous empirical support for treating PTSD in the general population is a
      cognitive-behavioral treatment known as exposure therapy (which involves helping patients
      face feared memories and situations), yet there have been no controlled studies of any
      psychosocial interventions for PTSD in samples of older adults. Some have argued that older
      adults will not respond well to exposure because of their cognitive limitations. However,
      several empirical studies have shown exposure therapy to be safe and effective with older
      adults with anxiety disorders other than PTSD.

      The current project represents the first randomized clinical trial of psychotherapy for older
      veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It will compare relaxation training (RT)
      to prolonged exposure therapy (PE). The project will also examine whether cognitive
      impairment influences psychotherapy outcome. The five-year Research Plan is divided into
      three phases. Phase 1 (Year 1) involves the development of procedures for assessment and
      preparation for the clinical trial. Phase 2 (Years 2-4) will entail the first randomized
      clinical trial of psychosocial treatments for PTSD in late life. One hundred veterans aged 60
      years or older, with chronic PTSD, will be recruited from the San Diego VA PTSD Clinical Team
      and randomly assigned to 12 sessions of PE or 12 sessions of RT. Phase 3 (Year 5) will be
      comprised of final data collection, scoring and interpretation of all neuropsychological
      tests, data cleaning and analysis, and writing for publication of results. Primary
      hypotheses: (1) Subjects in the PE condition will have significantly less severe PTSD
      symptoms, depressive symptoms, and functional impairment than subjects in the RT condition at
      posttest; (2) Executive functioning will modify the response to both treatments, such that
      those with impaired executive functioning will demonstrate a smaller reduction in PTSD
      symptoms (representing less clinically significant change).

    <measure>PTSD Checklist (PCL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The PTSD Checklist is a self-report questionnaire about PTSD symptoms. The version used in this study is called the PCL-S, which denotes a specific traumatic event for subjects to respond to. There are 17 items, each with response categories from 1 to 5. Thus, the total score ranges from 17 to 85. Higher scores reflect higher levels of PTSD symptoms, and a score of 50 or above is commonly interpreted to designate clinically significant PTSD symptoms.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Subscale (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a self-report questionnaire about depressive symptoms. There are 9 scored items, each with response categories from 0 (zero) to 3. Thus, the total score ranges from 0 to 27. Higher scores reflect higher levels of depressive symptoms, with interpretation as follows:
0 (zero) No depression 1-4 Minimal depression 5-9 Mild depression 10-14 Moderate depression 15-19 Moderately severe depression 20-27 Severe depression</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale Severity Score (CAPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS is a clinician-administered interview about PTSD symptoms. There are 17 scored items for PTSD severity, each with response categories from 0 (zero) to 4 separately for both frequency and severity. Thus, each item can receive a score of 0 (zero) to 8, and the total severity score ranges from 0 to 136. Higher scores reflect higher levels of PTSD symptoms. Scores of 60 or above are generally considered clinically significant, and changes of 10 points or more (e.g., between pre-treatment and post-treatment) are considered clinically significant changes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The PTCI is a self-report questionnaire about thoughts following traumatic events. There are 33 scored items, each with response categories from 1 (Totally Disagree) to 7 (Totally Agree), summed to create the total score. Thus, the total score ranges from 7 to 231. Higher scores reflect higher levels of negative cognitions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory State Scale (STAI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The STAI-S is a self-report questionnaire about state (present state) anxiety. There are 20 scored items, each with response categories from 1 (Not at All) to 4 (Very Much So). Some items (e.g., &quot;I feel calm&quot;) are reversed scored so that the total score appropriately reflects state anxiety. Thus, the total score ranges from 20 to 80. Higher scores reflect higher levels of state anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS is a self-report questionnaire about functioning. There are 3 scored items (Work/School; Social Life; and Family Life/Home Responsibilities), each with response categories from 0 (zero; Not at All) to 10 (Extremely). Thus, the total score ranges from 0 to 30. Higher scores reflect lower (poorer) levels of functioning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Neuropsychological Deficits (Standardized, Composite)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Among our battery of seven neuropsychological tests, we worked with our neuropsychologist to choose 13 key scales. We used a conversion system to equally weight areas where there were large deficits, even if there were only one or two deficits, to prevent such scores from being minimized among the large range of T scores for the other scales. We converted T scores as follows: &gt;40 = 0; 35-39 = 1; 30-34 = 2; 25-29 = 3; 20-24 = 4; &lt; 20 = 5. Higher scores mean a higher global cognitive deficit.</description>

          <description>The PTSD Checklist is a self-report questionnaire about PTSD symptoms. The version used in this study is called the PCL-S, which denotes a specific traumatic event for subjects to respond to. There are 17 items, each with response categories from 1 to 5. Thus, the total score ranges from 17 to 85. Higher scores reflect higher levels of PTSD symptoms, and a score of 50 or above is commonly interpreted to designate clinically significant PTSD symptoms.</description>

          <description>The CAPS is a clinician-administered interview about PTSD symptoms. There are 17 scored items for PTSD severity, each with response categories from 0 (zero) to 4 separately for both frequency and severity. Thus, each item can receive a score of 0 (zero) to 8, and the total severity score ranges from 0 to 136. Higher scores reflect higher levels of PTSD symptoms. Scores of 60 or above are generally considered clinically significant, and changes of 10 points or more (e.g., between pre-treatment and post-treatment) are considered clinically significant changes.</description>

          <title>Global Neuropsychological Deficits (Standardized, Composite)</title>
          <description>Among our battery of seven neuropsychological tests, we worked with our neuropsychologist to choose 13 key scales. We used a conversion system to equally weight areas where there were large deficits, even if there were only one or two deficits, to prevent such scores from being minimized among the large range of T scores for the other scales. We converted T scores as follows: &gt;40 = 0; 35-39 = 1; 30-34 = 2; 25-29 = 3; 20-24 = 4; &lt; 20 = 5. Higher scores mean a higher global cognitive deficit.</description>

        <title>PTSD Checklist (PCL)</title>
        <description>The PTSD Checklist is a self-report questionnaire about PTSD symptoms. The version used in this study is called the PCL-S, which denotes a specific traumatic event for subjects to respond to. There are 17 items, each with response categories from 1 to 5. Thus, the total score ranges from 17 to 85. Higher scores reflect higher levels of PTSD symptoms, and a score of 50 or above is commonly interpreted to designate clinically significant PTSD symptoms.</description>

          <title>Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)</title>
          <description>The SDS is a self-report questionnaire about functioning. There are 3 scored items (Work/School; Social Life; and Family Life/Home Responsibilities), each with response categories from 0 (zero; Not at All) to 10 (Extremely). Thus, the total score ranges from 0 to 30. Higher scores reflect lower (poorer) levels of functioning.</description>

        <title>Global Neuropsychological Deficits (Standardized, Composite)</title>
        <description>Among our battery of seven neuropsychological tests, we worked with our neuropsychologist to choose 13 key scales. We used a conversion system to equally weight areas where there were large deficits, even if there were only one or two deficits, to prevent such scores from being minimized among the large range of T scores for the other scales. We converted T scores as follows: &gt;40 = 0; 35-39 = 1; 30-34 = 2; 25-29 = 3; 20-24 = 4; &lt; 20 = 5. Higher scores mean a higher global cognitive deficit.</description>

        <title>Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale Severity Score (CAPS)</title>
        <description>The CAPS is a clinician-administered interview about PTSD symptoms. There are 17 scored items for PTSD severity, each with response categories from 0 (zero) to 4 separately for both frequency and severity. Thus, each item can receive a score of 0 (zero) to 8, and the total severity score ranges from 0 to 136. Higher scores reflect higher levels of PTSD symptoms. Scores of 60 or above are generally considered clinically significant, and changes of 10 points or more (e.g., between pre-treatment and post-treatment) are considered clinically significant changes.</description>
