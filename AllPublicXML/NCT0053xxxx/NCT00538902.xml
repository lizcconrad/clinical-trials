      A study to assess the safety and efficacy of adalimumab administered as a subcutaneous
      injection in adult Chinese subjects with rheumatoid arthritis and treated with methotrexate
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multi-center, Phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind (DB), parallel group, placebo
      controlled, safety and efficacy study in adult Chinese RA subjects. The duration of the study
      was approximately 116 weeks. This included a 4-week (28 days) Screening period, a 12-week
      Double-Blind (DB) period, a 90-week Open-Label (OL) Period, and a 10-week (70 days) Follow-up
      period. The 70-day Safety Follow-up period was initiated after the last dose of study
      medication.

      During the DB period, 302 Chinese subjects with RA and concomitantly treated with MTX were
      enrolled at 11 clinical sites located throughout China. Subjects were randomly assigned to
      one of the three treatment groups in a 2:2:1 ratio: 80 mg adalimumab, 40 mg adalimumab, or
      placebo. From Week 0 to Week 10, subjects received blinded study drug. Subjects who
      successfully participated and completed Week 12 of the DB portion of the study participated
      in the OL period. All subjects in the OL period received adalimumab 40 mg. Throughout the
      study, the study drug was administered subcutaneously (SC) every other week (eow).

      Subjects that completed the Week 24 visit, prior to the approval of Protocol Amendment 1, had
      70 days from the last dose of study drug to re-enter the study. The Investigator confirmed
      that the subject did not develop any of the exclusion criteria and completed the procedures
      defined by the OL Screening visit.

      Results through Week 24 of this study were presented in the regulatory dossier for the
      marketing authorization application of Humira in China, fulfilling the requirement for
      clinical data in Chinese patients. However, in order to continue to provide treatment to
      patients who responded well to adalimumab, subjects had the option to continue in the OL
      extension of this study until Week 92.

    <measure>Mean Change in the Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Scores From Baseline to Week 12 of the Double-Blind Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ is a self-reported, subject-oriented outcome measure. The Standard Disability Index of HAQ for a subject is calculated as the mean of the following 8 category scores (range: 0-3): dressing and grooming, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. The score of each category is calculated as the maximum of the scores for the questions of that category. The Disability Index cannot be computed if the patient does not have scores for at least 6 categories. A decrease in the Disability Index = improvement in disease (0 = no difficulties). Week 12 = end of Double-Blind period.</description>

    <description>SF-36 (v.2) is a standardized health survey consisting of 36 questions to measure functional health status. The SF-36 score has two components: physical (PCS) and mental (MCS). Summary scores are calculated using the following 8 scales: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The score for a component is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0 (not functioning) to 100 (highest functioning). An increase in SF-36 PCS or MCS indicates improved health status.</description>

        <description>Sixty-eight or 66 joints or regions (34 or 32 per body side [hip joints excluded]) were assessed by pressure and joint manipulation on physical examination for tender joint count (TJC) or swollen joint count (SJC), respectively. Both joint tenderness and swelling were classified as either present (&quot;1&quot;), absent (&quot;0&quot;), replaced (&quot;9&quot;), or no assessment (&quot;NA&quot;). The Total TJC or SJC was derived as the sum of all 1s evaluated; the range for TJC and SJC were 0 - 68 and 0 - 66, respectively. The higher the joint count, the worse the rheumatoid arthritis.

        <description>Visual analog scale (VAS) was used for the physician's (PhGA) and patient's (PGA) global assessment of disease activity and the patient's assessment of pain. PhGA assessed the patient's current status, PGA assessed status within the last 24 h, and patient's assessment of pain assessed pain status during the last week. All 3 assessments were scored on a 100 mm horizontal scale. The scores range from 0 (no symptoms) to 100 (maximum symptoms); therefore lower VAS scores represent a better disease state.

        <title>Mean Change in Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (Visual Analog Scale [VAS]) Through Week 92 of the Open-Label Period</title>
        <description>Visual analog scale (VAS) was used for the physician's (PhGA) and patient's (PGA) global assessment of disease activity and the patient's assessment of pain. PhGA assessed the patient's current status, PGA assessed status within the last 24 h, and patient's assessment of pain assessed pain status during the last week. All 3 assessments were scored on a 100 mm horizontal scale. The scores range from 0 (no symptoms) to 100 (maximum symptoms); therefore lower VAS scores represent a better disease state.</description>

        <description>HAQ is a self-reported, subject-oriented outcome measure. The Standard Disability Index of HAQ for a subject is calculated as the mean of the following 8 category scores (range: 0-3): dressing and grooming, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. The score of each category is calculated as the maximum of the scores for the questions of that category. The Disability Index cannot be computed if the patient does not have scores for at least 6 categories. A decrease in the Disability Index = improvement in disease (0 = no difficulties). Week 12 = end of Double-Blind period.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in the Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Through Week 92 of the Open-Label Period</title>
        <description>HAQ is a self-reported, subject-oriented outcome measure. The Standard Disability Index of HAQ for a subject is calculated as the mean of the following 8 category scores (range: 0-3): dressing and grooming, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. The score of each category is calculated as the maximum of the scores for the questions of that category. The Disability Index cannot be computed if the patient does not have scores for at least 6 categories. A decrease in the Disability Index indicates an improvement in disease (0 = no difficulties).</description>

        <title>Mean Change in the SF-36 Health Survey Index Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) at Week 12 of the Double-Blind Period</title>
        <description>SF-36 (v.2) is a standardized health survey consisting of 36 questions to measure functional health status. The SF-36 score has two components: physical (PCS) and mental (MCS). Summary scores are calculated using the following 8 scales: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The score for a component is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0 (not functioning) to 100 (highest functioning). An increase in SF-36 PCS or MCS indicates improved health status.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in the SF-36 Health Survey Index Mental Component Summary (MCS) Through Week 92 of the Open-Label Period</title>
        <description>SF-36 (v.2) is a standardized health survey consisting of 36 questions to measure functional health status. The SF-36 score has two components: physical (PCS) and mental (MCS). Summary scores are calculated using the following 8 scales: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The score for a component is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0 (not functioning) to 100 (highest functioning). An increase in SF-36 PCS or MCS indicates improved health status.</description>
