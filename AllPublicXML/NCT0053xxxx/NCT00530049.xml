      RATIONALE: Developing a questionnaire that patients can use to assess their quality of life
      related to the appearance of their face after surgery may help doctors plan the best
      treatment for patients undergoing surgery and reconstruction for head and neck cancer in the
      future.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is developing a questionnaire for assessing quality of life
      related to facial appearance in patients who have undergone or are planning to undergo
      surgery and reconstruction for head and neck cancer; and after dermatologic surgery for
      patients with cutaneous skin cancers.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To develop and validate a new patient-reported outcome measure of quality of life
           related to facial appearance following oncologic head and neck resection and
           reconstruction.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Part 1 (questionnaire content generation and development of preliminary instrument
           [post-operative patients only]): Patients undergo semi-structured interview with a
           trained interviewer and answer open-ended questions. Statements concerning facial
           appearance post-resection and reconstruction are extracted to generate items for the
           preliminary instrument. The preliminary instrument is developed from review of the
           literature, qualitative interviews with patients, and expert opinion (head and neck
           surgeons, reconstructive surgeons, and other relevant health care providers, including
           nurse clinicians). The instrument is then pre-tested on a small sample of patients via
           mail to clarify ambiguities in the wording of items, confirm appropriateness, and
           determine acceptability and completion time.

        -  Part 2 (field-testing with item reduction and development of final rating scale):
           Post-operative patients complete 2 copies of the preliminary questionnaires in the mail
           or clinic approximately 2 weeks apart. Pre-operative patients complete the questionnaire
           prior to surgery (during preoperative appointment) and again at least 1 month after
           surgery (via mail). Data are analyzed to determine the most valid grouping of items into
           measurement scales for development of the final instrument.

        -  Part 3 (psychometric evaluation of the patient-reported outcome questionnaire):
           Post-operative patients complete 2 copies of the questionnaires in clinic or by mail
           approximately 2 weeks apart. They also complete several other well-established,
           validated instruments used to measure patient-reported quality of life and
           symptomatology in order to aid in the evaluation of convergent and discriminant
           validity. Pre-operative patients complete the final questionnaire prior to surgery
           (during preoperative appointment) and again at least 1 month after surgery by mail or in
           clinic.

    <description>The purpose of this study is to develop a PRO instrument that measures quality of life as relates to facial appearance after head and neck cancer reconstruction surgery and after dermatologic surgery for patients with cutaneous skin cancers. . To develop this measure, we will adhere to the following sequential steps recommended by quality of life experts. Thus, the study will have three parts:
Questionnaire content generation and development of preliminary instrument
Field-testing the preliminary questionnaire with item reduction and development of final questionnaire
Psychometric evaluation of final questionnaire</description>

        Potential research subjects will be identified by a member of the patient's treatment team,
        the protocol investigator, or research team at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
        (MSKCC), or specified plastic surgeon at outside institution.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 to 99 years.

          -  Patients who have altered facial appearance secondary to an oncologic head and neck
             surgical resection and reconstruction. Reconstruction will be defined as complex
             linear closures, skin grafts, local flaps or free tissue transfer (oncologic Post-op
             cohort).

          -  Patients who have undergone cosmetic plastic surgery procedures to the head and neck
             unrelated to a diagnosis of cancer (non-oncologic Post-op cohort).

          -  Patients with cutaneous skin cancers of the head and neck region treated in the
             dermatologic surgery setting (dermatology Post-op cohort)

          -  Patients who have completed surgery at MSKCC between 1 week to 7 years ago (Post-op
             cohorts).

          -  Patients who have completed facial surgery 6 weeks (+/- 1 week) ago (early
             postoperative subset-Phase I).

          -  Patients who are scheduled to undergo oncologic head and neck resection and
             reconstruction with anticipated altered facial appearance (Pre-op).

          -  Patients who are scheduled to undergo dermatologic surgery due to diagnosis cutaneous
             skin cancers of the head and neck region (dermatology Pre-op cohort)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active psychiatric illness, cognitive or sensory impairment that in the opinion of the
             investigator is severe enough to preclude participation in the study.

          -  Moderate to severe cognitive impairment.

          -  Blindness.

          -  Physical impairment that may prevent the respondent from filling out the paper and
             pencil survey.
