      RATIONALE: Gathering information about how often problems with neurocognitive functioning
      occur in patients with newly diagnosed upper aerodigestive tract cancers may help doctors
      learn more about the disease.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying neurocognitive functioning in patients with newly
      diagnosed upper aerodigestive tract cancers receiving treatment at Henry-Joyce Cancer Clinic.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To establish an estimate of the prevalence of baseline neurocognitive impairment prior
           to initiation of outpatient cancer treatment.

        -  To establish an estimate of the incidence of neurocognitive impairment during outpatient
           cancer treatment.

        -  To describe how neurocognitive functioning changes over time during cancer treatment.

      Secondary

        -  To identify sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with neurocognitive
           impairment.

        -  To examine health-related outcomes associated with neurocognitive impairment.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo interview to complete measures of domain-specific neurocognitive
      functioning, global neurocognitive functioning, subjective neurocognitive functioning,
      delirium, physical functioning, symptom prevalence and distress, mood states, and medications
      at baseline before initiation of cancer treatment, at scheduled treatment visits, and at the
      follow-up visit 3 months after completion of cancer treatment.

      Measures of comorbidity, alcohol use, sensory functioning (vision and hearing), and
      sociodemographic are completed at baseline only. Cancer-related information (diagnosis,
      staging, and sites of metastasis, if applicable), treatment-related information (planned
      treatment regimen - chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy), and current medications are
      obtained at baseline by medical record review.

      Health service use and complications are assessed at each scheduled treatment visit and at
      the 3-month post-treatment follow-up visit. Measures of domain-specific neurocognitive
      functioning, coping, and quality of life are completed at baseline and at the 3-month
      follow-up visit.
