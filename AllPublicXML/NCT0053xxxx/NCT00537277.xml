      This trial is conducted in Europe.

      This is a clinical trial investigating the effectiveness and the safety of using biphasic
      insulin aspart 30 both for initiation and intensification of insulin treatment in type 2
      diabetes.

            <description>Subjects received individually adjusted dose of biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30) once daily for 16 weeks. If the treatment target of HbA1c below 7% was reached after 16 weeks of treatment, the subject continued the reached dose until week 48 (end of trial). If the treatment target of HbA1c below 7% was not achieved at week 16, then BIAsp 30 treatment was increased to twice daily for additional 16 weeks. If the treatment target of HbA1c below 7% was reached after 32 weeks of treatment, the subject continued the reached dose until week 48 (end of trial). If the treatment target of HbA1c below 7% was not achieved at week 32, then BIAsp 30 treatment was increased to three times daily for additional 16 weeks until week 48 (end of trial).</description>
