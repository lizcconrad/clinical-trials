  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anal sphincter preserving operations are now commonplace for both cancer and non-cancerous
      rectal diseases. However, this has not always been the case and this development has been
      facilitated by the invention of circular stapling instruments, which allow the bowel to be
      reconnected to the anal sphincters, where it would almost be impossible to do so manually.
      Nevertheless, some patients still require a permanent ostomy, as even with stapling devices
      ultra low joins of the bowel and sphincter muscles cannot always be performed by a
      conventional surgery. Therefore, a variety of alternative techniques have been proposed to
      avoid a permanent ostomy, but these have not become widespread due to the technical
      difficulty in performing them, their failure to completely eradicate rectal disease, and the
      damage they inflict upon the anal sphincters resulting in poor bowel function after surgery.

      The ideal ultra low sphincter preserving operation should remove the rectal disease entirely,
      allow the small or large bowel to be safely joined to the anal sphincters under direct
      vision, and retain the sphincter mechanism in its entirety. We propose such a technique that
      we term the APPEAR procedure, which approaches the lower third of the rectum via an incision
      between the scrotum or vagina, and the anal sphincters. This procedure preserves sphincter
      integrity, and allows either a stapled or manual join of the bowel to the sphincter
      mechanism, under direct vision. This trial is being conducted as a pilot study, with the
      procedure only offered to patients for whom a conventional sphincter saving procedure was
      technically impossible, or contraindicated.

    <textblock>
      This study is recruiting patients with distal third rectal pathology, for whom a conventional
      sphincter saving procedure is contraindicated, or likely to be technically impossible.

      Recruited patients will initially undergo trial dissection by conventional sphincter
      preserving surgical techniques, which if successful will result in patients entering study
      arm 1.

      However, should this not be possible, a trial anterior perineal dissection will be attempted,
      with patients entered into study arm 2 if perineal dissection is adequate to allow full
      rectal excision, and preserve sphincter integrity.

      If during a trial of anterior perineal dissection it is decided that sphincter preservation
      is not safe, or will not allow eradication of rectal disease, conventional proctectomy will
      be performed, with patients entering study arm 3.
