      The objective of the RADAR trial is to determine the impact of External Beam Radiation
      Therapy (EBRT) on aortic valve restenosis following successful percutaneous balloon aortic
      valvuloplasty (BAV) in elderly patients with severe calcific aortic stenosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RADAR trial is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, two-stage,
      adaptive clinical trial. Following successful Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty, patients with
      severe aortic stenosis will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to External Beam Radiation Therapy
      (EBRT) plus standard medical therapy or standard medical therapy along with sham EBRT
      (placebo). During Stage One, approximately 110 patients will be enrolled in order to have 80
      patients randomized and 66 patients with valid 6 month data. The sample size for Stage Two
      will be calculated at the end of Stage One. At the time of study commencement, the
      expectation is that the total sample size will be approximately 155 patients with valid
      6-month data, and thus 195 will be randomized and up to 250 enrolled.

      Patients will be followed for a period of two (2) years. Echocardiographic and clinical
      endpoint data will be collected and analyzed.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Calcific aortic valve stenosis with an echocardiographically derived AV index of less
             than 0.45 cm2/m2.

          -  Any symptoms of severe AS, including near syncope/syncope, angina, excessive fatigue
             and/or shortness of breath with NYHA functional class II-IV limitation.

          -  Age greater than 75 and risk of aortic valve replacement surgery greater than or equal
             to 15 percent. This may be assessed by using the STS Risk Predictor (see appendix C),
             confirmed by consultation with a cardiac surgeon experienced in high risk aortic valve
             surgery

          -  OR by having a cardiac surgeon experienced in high risk aortic valve surgery document
             comorbid conditions (such as porcelain aorta, malnutrition or other comorbidities not
             captured by the STS scoring system) that make the risk greater than or equal to 15
             percent by the estimation of the surgeon.

          -  If age greater than or equal to 90 a cardiac surgeon experienced in high risk aortic
             valve surgery must document that BAV is a better option for the patient than aortic
             valve replacement surgery.

          -  Probable survival greater than 6 months after successful valvuloplasty.

          -  Patient is competent, willing to comply with follow-up, understands risks, benefits
             and alternatives and has signed the Informed Consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has undergone previous BAV or AVR.

          -  Patient is undergoing BAV as a bridge to AVR.

             to 3 times ULN or stroke less than or equal to 6 weeks prior to planned BAV procedure.

             0.45cm2/m2 at peak dobutamine infusion. See Appendix D for suggested protocol.

          -  Patients who do not achieve successful BAV performed as a part of RADAR Trial: success

             interpretation of the study results. This includes any prior radiation to the thoracic
             contents, except for radiation treatments for malignant or benign lesions of the skin.
