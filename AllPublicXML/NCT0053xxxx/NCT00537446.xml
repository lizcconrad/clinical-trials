  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), or &quot;Lou Gehrig's Disease&quot;, is a fatal disorder that
      causes progressive degeneration and weakening of the muscles of breathing, leading to
      breathing insufficiency and eventually breathing failure. This breathing insufficiency is
      commonly treated with a breathing assistance device, known as noninvasive positive pressure
      ventilation (NIPPV). While generally well tolerated and accepted, it is not clear whether or
      to what extent NIPPV in fact helps breathing function: some data suggest that NIPPV preserves
      breathing function over time, whereas other data suggest that it actually causes breathing
      function to decline more quickly. No studies have shown what the acute effect of NIPPV is on
      breathing muscle function in ALS patients.

      This study will test the hypothesis that the acute use of NIPPV, at pressure levels that are
      in common clinical use, will cause measurable changes in tests of breathing function,
      compared to baseline and to lower levels of NIPPV. We expect that the results of this study
      will help to clarify whether and to what extent NIPPV assists respiratory muscle function in
      patients with ALS.
