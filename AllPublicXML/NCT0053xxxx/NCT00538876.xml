  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase I study designed to explore the feasibility, safety and biologic
      activity of epigenetic priming with decitabine prior to standard cytarabine, daunorubicin
      induction chemotherapy in younger patients with less-than-favorable risk AML.

      Primary Objective: To find an appropriate dose level for decitabine when used as priming for
      cytarabine and daunorubicin &quot;7+3&quot; induction chemotherapy in AML.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To establish the safety and expected toxicities of decitabine when used as priming for
           cytarabine and daunorubicin &quot;7+3&quot; induction chemotherapy in AML.

        2. To establish the optimal dose schedule of decitabine required to broadly demethylate
           cytosine residues in genomic regulatory regions.

        3. To investigate, in selected cases, the molecular and cellular consequences of
           decitabine-induced hypomethylation by a) establishing the extent and degree of
           hypomethylation at specific genomic loci required to reactivate the expression of
           repressed genes and by b) determining the effect of hypomethylation on the
           differentiation and/or apoptosis of leukemic blasts.

    <description>Decitabine will be administered by intravenous injection at a dose of 20 mg/m2/day as a daily 1hr infusion (Arm A) or by continuous infusion (Arm B) for 3, 5 or 7 days. On the day following the final dose of decitabine, standard &quot;7+3&quot; induction chemotherapy will begin.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

               -  A history of an antecedent Philadelphia-chromosome negative myeloproliferative
                  disorder (e.g., polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, primary
                  myelofibrosis);

               -  Treatment-related AML believed secondary to prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for an

                  limits.

          -  ECOG performance status &gt; = 2.

          -  Patient has adequate hepatic/renal function as defined by:

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL. Patients with documented evidence of Gilbert's
                  Syndrome resulting in elevated total bilirubin levels will be eligible, provided
                  all other eligibility criteria are met.
