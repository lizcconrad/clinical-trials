      This is a nonrandomized, open-label, phase II study of irinotecan plus capecitabine in
      patients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes. Up
      to 44 qualified patients will be enrolled according to the exact single stage design.

      Irinotecan 90 mg/m2 intravenously for 90 minutes once a week for 2 weeks (Days 1 and 8)
      followed by 1-week rest period. Capecitabine is administered orally at a dose of 1,000 mg/m2
      twice daily (total daily dose 2,000 mg/m2) as an intermittent regimen in 3-week cycles (2
      weeks of treatment followed by a 1-week rest period). For practical reasons, capecitabine
      doses are rounded to the nearest dose that could be administered with a combination of 500-mg
      and 150-mg tablets of drug. Capecitabine is given approximately 12 hours apart and taken
      orally with water within 30 minutes after ingestion of food (breakfast or dinner).

          -  Previous chemotherapy with anthracyclines and taxane in adjuvant setting

          -  Previous hormonal therapy in adjuvant and metastatic setting is allowed

          -  Prior radiation therapy is allowed as long as the irradiated area is not the only
