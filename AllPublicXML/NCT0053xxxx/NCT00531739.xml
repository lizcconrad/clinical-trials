    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of SurgiWrapTM: (1) prevents/lowers the
      incidence of Grade 2 or higher soft tissue attachments under the incision made during
      abdominal surgery, (2) reduces post-operative bowel obstruction.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is 18 years of age or older of either gender

          -  Patient has primary diagnosis requiring a two-stage colectomy or procto-colectomy

          -  Patient or his/her legal representative has read and signed the Institutional Review
             Board (IRB) approved Informed Consent form before randomization.

          -  Patient must be able and willing to follow study procedures and instructions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is participating in another clinical study which may influence adhesion
             formation.

          -  Patient has had barriers, solutions, or anti-adhesive therapy, other than SurgiWrapTM,
             as planned at randomization, placed in the abdomen at the time of the initial surgery

          -  Patient who, at the initial surgery, had administration of irrigants containing
             corticosteroids, heparin, salicylates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or
             dextran 70

          -  Patient has one or more medical condition(s), including severe renal, hepatic,
             hematologic, neurologic, or immune disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             would make the patient an inappropriate candidate for this study.

          -  Patient is taking chronic (i.e., &gt; 2 weeks) therapeutic doses of medications known to
             affect healing such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Prophylactic aspirin
             (less than or equal to 325 mg once daily) for cardiovascular indications will be
             permitted in patients.

          -  Patient has an infection in the intra-abdominal or pelvic area.
