      This study is being done to look at the electrical activity of the heart. This study will
      help decide whether taking recordings for a 24-hour period gives more useful information than
      recording it for a few seconds in a doctor's office. The study will compare 24 hour
      electrocardiogram (ECG) results of patients taking thioridazine (Mellaril) to those of other
      patients taking different medications that took part in another study.

      The objective of the study is to assess the Tpe and QTc measures in 24 hr Holter
      echocardiograms in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drgs (APDs). The primary
      comparisons of interest are olanzapine (no QTc prolongation) to ziprasidone (QTc
      prolongation) and thioridazine (QTc prolongation) as well as ziprasidone (possibly low TdP
      risk) to thioridazine (TdP risk). Secondary comparisons will be among all APDs available. In
      a previously approved study, conventional 24 hr Holter electrocardiograms were recorded from
      a total of 78 subjects during the course of treatment with psychotropic medications and
      without medication (in the case of normals and unmedicated patients). These recordings will
      be analyzed to yield Tpe, QTc and heart rate, and other measures. Data from additional
      patients is needed, therefore this study will include only patients currently treated with
      Mellaril (thioridazine), Risperdal (risperidone) and Seroquel (quetiapine).

    <description>All subjects will be fitted with a device to obtain 24-hour Holter EKG continuous recordings of bipolar leads C5C5R. They will also receive a standard 12-lead EKG recording prior to the placement of the Holter device. The subjects will be asked to keep a diary during the course of the 24 hours to record information such as wake and sleep times and symptoms such as shortness of breath, heart palpitations, lightheadedness, etc.
From each recording, 12 sets of 10 consecutive QRS epochs, plus QRS samplings obtained during sleep will be analyzed by a cardiologist blind to the medication status of subjects.</description>
