      RITuximab AntiphosPholipid Syndrome (RITAPS) Study is designed to evaluate whether a
      medication called rituximab would reduce the signs and symptoms of antiphospholipid antibody
      (aPL) -related certain clinical problems.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persistently antiphospholipid antibody (aPL)-positive patients, age 18 - 75 years of age,
      with anticoagulation-resistant manifestations of APS and fulfilling protocol defined study
      inclusion criteria will receive two doses of Rituximab, and will be followed for 6 and 12
      months for clinical and safety outcomes, respectively.

      Patients are eligible to take part in this study if their blood test is persistently positive
      for aPL and they have one or more of the aPL-related clinical problem(s) listed below: low
      platelet (blood cells involved in the prevention of bleeding) count; anemia (deficiency of
      red blood cells); heart valve disease; skin ulcers; kidney smal vessel blood clots; and/or
      memory problems.
