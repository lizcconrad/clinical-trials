  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will assess the safety and effect on response rate of a combination of
      rituximab and chlorambucil in previously untreated participants with B-cell chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia. Participants will receive 6 monthly cycles of combination treatment,
      followed by up to 6 cycles of chlorambucil alone. Rituximab will be administered on Day 1 of
      each cycle, at a dose of 375 milligrams per square meter (mg/m^2) intravenously (IV) in Cycle
      1, and 500 mg/m^2 in subsequent cycles, and chlorambucil will be administered on Days 1-7 of
      each cycle at a dose of 10 mg/m^2/day per oral (PO).

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious AE (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 56 days from the beginning of the last treatment cycle that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both SAEs as well as non-serious AEs.</description>

          <title>Rituximab + Chlorambucil</title>
          <description>Participants received combination therapy of rituximab plus chlorambucil for first 6 cycles (28 day cycles). Participants who did not achieve complete response (CR) after Cycle 6 then received chlorambucil alone from Cycle 7 onwards until either they achieved a CR or for a maximum of 6 additional cycles. Rituximab: 375 milligrams per square meter (mg/m^2) intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1; 500 mg/m^2 on Day 1 of Cycles 2-6. Chlorambucil: 10 milligrams per square meter per day (mg/m^2/day) oral administration (PO) on Days 1 to 7 of Cycles 1-6; 10 mg/m^2/day PO on Days 1 to 7 of Cycles 7-12, if applicable.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious AE (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 56 days from the beginning of the last treatment cycle that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both SAEs as well as non-serious AEs.</description>

Most questions used a 4- point scale (1 'Not at All' to 4 'Very Much'); 2 questions used a 7-point scale (1 'Very Poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Scores were averaged and transformed to 0-100 scale; a higher score for Global Qol/functional scales=better level of QoL/functioning, or a higher score for symptom scale=greater degree of symptoms.</description>

            <description>Participants received combination therapy of rituximab plus chlorambucil for first 6 cycles. Participants who did not achieve CR after Cycle 6 then received chlorambucil alone from Cycle 7 onwards until either they achieved a CR or for a maximum of 6 additional cycles. Rituximab: 375 mg/m^2 IV infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1; 500 mg/m^2 on Day 1 of Cycles 2-6. Chlorambucil: 10 mg/m^2/day PO on Days 1 to 7 of Cycles 1-6; 10 mg/m^2/day PO on Days 1 to 7 of Cycles 7-12, if applicable.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline (CFB) in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Scores</title>
          <description>EORTC QLQ-C30: included global health status (GHS)/quality of life (QOL), functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), and single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Most questions used a 4- point scale (1 'Not at All' to 4 'Very Much'); 2 questions used a 7-point scale (1 'Very Poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Scores were averaged and transformed to 0-100 scale; a higher score for Global Qol/functional scales=better level of QoL/functioning, or a higher score for symptom scale=greater degree of symptoms.</description>
