    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality in patients on hemodialysis therapy
      (HD), accounting for 30 to 50% of all death. Although angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)
      are effective for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease in reducing or preventing
      cardiovascular diseases, there has been no decisive study that demonstrated treatment with
      ARBs is effective in patients on HD.
