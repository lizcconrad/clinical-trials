  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the MicronJet microneedle device is
      effective for inducing rapid and painless local anesthesia prior to insertions of intravenous
      catheters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Local anesthesia is routinely administered to reduce patient discomfort and improve the
      outcome of a wide variety of painful medical procedures. However, injection of a local
      anesthetic agent into the skin using a regular needle is in itself painful. Therefore, common
      procedures involving needle pricks (e.g. venipuncture) which may be quite painful are usually
      performed without local anesthesia.

      NanoPass has developed a microneedle injection device (MicronJet) which enables painless
      delivery of drugs directly into the superficial layers of the skin.

      The objective of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of this device for
      intradermal injection of a local anesthetic agent before insertion of an intravenous catheter
      to healthy adults.

      Each subject will receive an injection of a local anesthetic to one arm, and a control
      placebo injection of physiological water to the other arm. Both injections will be
      administered intradermally using the MicronJet. Following the injections, an intravenous
      catheter will be inserted into the injection site in each arm, and the subject will rate the
      pain caused by the insertion. Safety parameters will be recorded throughout the study.
