  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As evidence accumulates that atherogenesis or Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) may not be simply
      a disorder of lipid metabolism, but an inflammatory disease, the focus of treatment has
      shifted. A-002 or Varespladib is an anti-inflammatory drug for treatment of chronic and acute
      diseases. It acts by inhibiting secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2 ) - one of a family of
      enzymes leading to inflammation - which may be important in: 1) the development of
      atherosclerosis and 2) the increase in occurence of cardiovascular events after angioplasty.
      Previous studies have demonstrated that sPLA2: 1) facilitates the pro-atherogenic effects of
      low-density (LDL or bad cholesterol) and 2) increased levels post-angioplasty correlate with
      an increased risk of events at followup contact. Therefore this study proposes to investigate
      the ability of A-002 to prevent or reduce myocardial damage after angioplasty by inhibiting
      the cascade of inflammatory mediators.

      Substudy - Subjects who agree will also have a vascular ultrasound 24h post-PCI to assess
      endothelial function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tissue injury after angioplasty is likely due to micro-emboli from mechanical trauma to a
      thrombotic lesion during angioplasty. In response to the ischemia sPLA2, possibly localized
      within atherosclerotic vascular tissue as well as from macrophages and monocytes, is
      released. Following ischemia-induced release, sPLA2 can bind to ischemically challenged
      cardiomyocytes and adversely affect their survival either directly through toxic effects on
      cardiomyocytes or indirectly by facilitating inflammation. It may be possible through sPLA2
      inhibition to salvage non-lethally jeopardized cells following an ischemic episode thereby
      reducing the infarcted area and amount of tissue damage. Previous studies in patients with
      unstable angina support this hypothesis, and conclude that sPLA2 levels can be used to
      predict clinical outcomes. We hypothesize that sPLA2 inhibition with A-002 will reduce
      myocardial injury post-angioplasty.

      Substudy - Peripheral vascular ultrasound should be done prior to receiving study drug and
      24h post-PCI. Coronary endothelial function will be assessed at the time of PCI.
