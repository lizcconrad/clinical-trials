  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral weight loss, the current treatment of choice for moderate obesity, achieves
      impressive short term results, however, weight regain following treatment is a major problem.
      Over 50% of participants in behavioral weight loss programs report difficulty with internal
      antecedents to unhealthy weight control behaviors and this difficulty is associated with
      weight regain following treatment. Current treatment approaches do not adequately address
      these antecedents. The aim of this series of studies is to develop, implement, and evaluate a
      behavioral weight loss program modified to provide participants with skills to deal
      effectively with affective and cognitive difficulties. The study targets men and women with
      BMI of 27-40 who self-report difficulty with emotional and/or cognitive antecedents to
      unhealthy weight control behaviors. The study is an uncontrolled pilot study in 20
      participants to initially assess acceptability and efficacy of the innovative treatment. The
      long-term goal of this research is to improve the weight loss maintenance outcomes of
      behavioral weight loss programs by addressing affective and cognitive antecedents to
      unhealthy weight control behaviors.
