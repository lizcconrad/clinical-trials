  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the reduction of LDL-cholesterol level after
      treatment with 50 mg per day of lapaquistat acetate once daily (QD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine the potential of lapaquistat acetate 50 mg per day
      to lower LDL-C levels compared with placebo. This study is also being conducted to further
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of lapaquistat acetate 50 mg over a period of 12 weeks.
      An optional, 48-week, open-label extension will follow the 12 week, double-blind treatment
      period to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of lapaquistat acetate 50 mg/day.
