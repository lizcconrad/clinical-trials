      RATIONALE: Internal radiation therapy uses radioactive material placed directly into or near
      a tumor to kill tumor cells. Using radiolabeled glass beads to kill tumor cells may be
      effective treatment for liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiolabeled glass beads work in treating
      patients with metastatic liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Provide supervised access to treatment with yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres
           (TheraSphere®) to eligible patients who are not candidates for surgical resection of
           metastatic intrahepatic carcinoma.

        -  Evaluate patient experience and toxicities associated with yttrium Y 90 glass
           microspheres treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a humanitarian device exemption use study.

      Patients receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere®) into the liver tumor through
      a percutaneously placed catheter into the hepatic artery. Patients may receive additional
      therapy 4-12 weeks after initial treatment at the discretion of the study physician.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 2 weeks, 30 days, and then once a
      year for approximately 2 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of metastatic intrahepatic carcinoma

               -  Histopathology confirmation may be waived in patients with a radiographically
                  identifiable liver mass AND known laboratory or clinical risk factors for cancer
                  or elevated tumor markers such as AFP

          -  Unresectable disease

          -  No portal hypertension with portal venous shunt away from the liver

          -  FDA approval to receive compassionate use of yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres

          -  No significant extrahepatic disease representing an imminent life-threatening outcome

          -  No evidence of potential delivery of &gt; 16.5 mCi (30 Gy absorbed dose) of radiation to
             the lungs on either of the following:

               -  First administration of yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere ®)

               -  Cumulative delivery of radiotherapy to the lungs over multiple treatments

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Serum bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL (in some cases where there is an elevated bilirubin, and
             the tumor may be isolated from a vascular standpoint, treatment may proceed)

             any of the following:

               -  History of severe allergy or intolerance to any contrast media, narcotics,
                  sedatives, or atropine, that cannot be controlled using basic angiographic
                  techniques
