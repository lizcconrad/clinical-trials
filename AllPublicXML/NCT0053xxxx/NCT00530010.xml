      RATIONALE: Internal radiation therapy uses radioactive material placed directly into or near
      a tumor to kill tumor cells. Using radiolabeled glass beads to kill tumor cells may be
      effective treatment for liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiolabeled glass beads work in treating
      patients with liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Provide supervised access to treatment with yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres
           (TheraSphere®) to eligible patients with cancer of the liver who are not candidates for
           surgical resection.

        -  Evaluate patient experience and toxicities associated with yttrium Y 90 glass
           microspheres (TheraSphere®) treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a humanitarian device exemption use study.

      Patients receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere®) into the liver tumor through
      a percutaneously placed catheter into the hepatic artery. Patients may receive additional
      treatment 4-12 weeks after initial treatment at the discretion of the study physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 2 weeks, 30 days, and then once
      a year for approximately 2 years.

    <description>The target dose of TheraSphere® is 80-150 Gy (8,000-15,000 rad). Patients may receive a single dose to the whole liver, or lobar treatment delivered as a sequence of treatments approximately 30 -90 days apart.</description>

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of intrahepatic carcinoma

               -  Histopathology confirmation may be waived in patients with a radiographically
                  identifiable liver mass AND known laboratory or clinical risk factors for cancer
                  or elevated tumor markers such as AFP

          -  Unresectable disease

          -  No portal hypertension with portal venous shunt away from the liver

          -  No significant extrahepatic disease representing an imminent life-threatening outcome

          -  No evidence of potential delivery of &gt; 16.5 mCi (30 Gy absorbed dose) radiation to the
             lungs on either of the following:

               -  First yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere®) administration

               -  Cumulative delivery of radiation to the lungs over multiple treatments

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL (unless using non-iodinated contrast or on dialysis)

          -  Serum bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL (in some cases where there is an elevated bilirubin and
             the tumor may be isolated from a vascular standpoint, treatment may proceed)

          -  Not pregnant or nursing

          -  Negative pregnancy test

          -  Fertile patients must use effective contraception

             catheterization:

               -  History of severe allergy or intolerance to any contrast media, narcotics,
                  sedatives, or atropine, that cannot be controlled using basic angiographic
                  techniques

               -  Bleeding diathesis, not correctable by usual forms of therapy

               -  Severe peripheral vascular disease that would preclude catheterization

          -  Evidence of any detectable Tc-99 macroaggregated albumin flow to the stomach or
             duodenum, after application of established angiographic techniques to stop such flow

          -  Severe liver dysfunction or pulmonary insufficiency

          -  Active uncontrolled infection

          -  Significant underlying medical or psychiatric illness
