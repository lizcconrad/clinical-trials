    <textblock>
      GSK182771 is a domain antibody targeting the interleukin (IL)-1 receptor which is being
      developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. This study is being done in healthy
      volunteers to verify the safety and tolerability of GSK182771

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adult men or women as determined by a responsible physician, based on a
             medical evaluation including history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac assessment.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential.

          -  Male subjects must agree to abstain from or agree to use adequate contraception, in
             addition to having their female partner use another form of contraception. This
             criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until
             Pharmacokinetic levels are determined to be below the LLQ.

          -  Men or women who are between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) within the range of 18-35 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2)
             inclusive.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a positive pre-study urine drug/urine alcohol screen. A minimum list
             of drugs that will be screened for includes amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine,
             opiates, cannabinoids and benzodiazepines.

          -  A history of regular alcohol consumption averaging &gt;7 drinks/week for females or &gt;14
             drinks/week for males. One drink is equivalent to (12 g alcohol) = 5 ounces [150
             milliliter (mL)] of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of 80
             proof distilled spirits

          -  The subject is unwilling to abstain from alcohol consumption from 48 hour prior to
             dosing until discharge from the clinic, and for 48 hour prior to all other out-patient
             clinic visits.

          -  Smoked or used tobacco or nicotine-containing products within the previous 6 months
             prior to the first dose of current study medication.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received a drug or a new
             chemical entity within 30 days or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the
             biological effect of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of current
             study medication.

          -  Previous exposure to or treatment with PEGylated molecules.

          -  Use of anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (anti-TNF) drugs within 60 days prior to dosing.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days , or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the
             Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study
             procedures or compromise subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof, or a
             history of drug or other allergy (including antibiotics) which, in the opinion of the
             investigator and/or GSK Medical Monitor, contraindicates the subject's participation.

          -  Positive pregnancy test at Screening or on Day -1 (females only).

          -  Any clinically significant abnormality identified on the screening medical assessment
             or examination, or ECG.

             or on Day -1.

          -  History of significant cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic, renal, hepatic, or
             gastrointestinal conditions that in the opinion of the investigator and/or GSK Medical
             Monitor, places the subject at an unacceptable risk as participant in this trial.

          -  History of any autoimmune or current inflammatory conditions including rheumatoid
             arthritis or any other joint disease.

          -  History of malignancy, except for surgically cured basal cell carcinoma or cured

          -  Current evidence of ongoing or acute infection.

          -  The subject has a history of repeated, chronic or opportunistic infections which, in
             the opinion of the investigator and/or GSK Medical Monitor, places the subject at an
             unacceptable risk as a participant in this trial.

          -  History of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or any other previous Mycobacterium infection.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen, positive Hepatitis C antibody, or
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody testing result.

          -  History of a severe allergic reaction, angio-edema, anaphylaxis or immunodeficiency

          -  History of elevated blood pressure or blood pressure &gt;140/90 millimeters of mercury
             (mmHg) at screening.

          -  Corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 450 milliseconds.

          -  Where participation in study would result in donation of blood in excess of 500 mL
             within 56 days of starting the study.

          -  Subject whose calculated creatinine clearance is less than 80 mL/min

          -  Liver function tests above the upper limit of normal at screening (alkaline
             transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) or bilirubin).
