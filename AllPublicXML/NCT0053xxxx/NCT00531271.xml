        Exclusion Criteria:

        Phase I Study

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study.

          1. Concurrent therapy (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, kinase inhibitors, immunotherapy,
             etc) for breast cancer. Bisphosphonates are allowed.

          2. Parenchymal brain metastases, unless documented to be clinically and radiographically
             stable for at least 6 months after treatment.

          3. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          4. Patients with significant cardiovascular disease including congestive heart failure
             (New York Heart Association Class III or IV), active angina pectoris or recent
             myocardial infarction (within the last 6 months).

          5. History of other malignancy within the last 5 years which could affect the diagnosis
             or assessment of breast cancer excluding non-melanomatous skin cancer and cervical
             carcinoma in situ.

          6. Patients who have received an investigational drug within the previous 4 weeks.

          7. Patient is currently enrolled in any other clinical study in which investigational
             procedures are performed or investigational therapies are administered. A patient may
             not enroll in such clinical trials while participating in this study.

          8. Pregnant or nursing women.

          9. Patients with history of allergic reactions attributed to solvent-based
             docetaxel(Taxotere).

         10. ECOG performance status 3-4.

         11. Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with docetaxel. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in
             patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated.

        Phase II Study

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study.

             adjuvant regimen, at least 12 months should have transpired since completion of taxane
             regimen.

          2. Concurrent therapy (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, kinase inhibitors, immunotherapy,
             etc) for breast cancer.

             stable for at least 6 months after treatment.

          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          5. Patients with significant cardiovascular disease including congestive heart failure
             (New York Heart Association Class III or IV), active angina pectoris or recent
             myocardial infarction (within the last 6 months).

          6. History of other malignancy within the last 5 years which could affect the diagnosis
             or assessment of breast cancer excluding non-melanomatous skin cancer and cervical
             carcinoma in situ.

          7. Patients who have received an investigational drug within the previous 4weeks.

          8. Patient is currently enrolled in any other clinical study in which investigational

             docetaxel(Taxotere).

             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with docetaxel.
