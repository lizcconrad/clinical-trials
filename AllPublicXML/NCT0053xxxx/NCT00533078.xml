  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), a high proportion will suffer from
      inflammation of the large bowel (colitis) during their intensive treatment. As there is no
      standard treatment available for this potentially lifethreatening condition, the
      investigators focus on the role of parenteral nutrition which these patients inevitably
      require. Preclinical and clinical data have shown strong anti-inflammatory properties of fish
      oil preparations containing poly-unsaturated omega3 fatty acids (PUFA) as opposed to other
      lipid fractions. There may be a therapeutic benefit of adding omega3 PUFA to standard
      nutrition in patients with chemotherapy-induced colitis. In this small phase II study, the
      investigators address the effectiveness of this approach to reduce the incidence and severity
      of colitis in AML patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Experimental and clinical data attribute multiple anti-inflammatory effects to a diet
      enriched in omega-3 PUFA containing oils, mainly FO. These effects are mediated by their
      active metabolites, the EPA- and DHA-derived eicosanoids, which antagonize the predominantly
      pro-inflammatory derivates of omega-6 PUFA origin. In cardiovascular disease these data are
      supported by several large-scale trials, but there also is growing evidence of beneficial
      effects of an omega-3 PUFA rich diet in GI conditions such as postoperative trauma and
      inflammatory bowel disease. AML patients with neutropenic colitis suffer from a condition
      which is pathophysiologically closely related to the studied diseases. It is therefore
      reasonable to raise the question whether this cohort would equally benefit from a novel
      nutritional regimen enriched in omega-3 PUFA.

      The proposed pilot study will address the question of the clinical value of adding an omega-3
      PUFA containing lipid emulsion to the TPN regimen as regards protection against colitis ≥ °3
      (primary objective). A numerical cutoff will be provided to support the decision whether
      further investigation is warranted or the intervention is considered not promising.

      Target accrual is n=35 patients receiving TPN. An interim analysis will be performed after
      n1=13 patients will be evaluable for the primary endpoint. The results of this interim
      analysis will determine whether continuation of the trial is of interest or the trial be
      stopped. The sample size has been calculated by the use of Simon's two-stage minimax design.

    <description>Trial participants are prescribed TPN by the attending physician as soon as indicated, which will be administered via a central venous line over a time period of approximately 20 hours per day. The formulation given to all patients is Nutriflex lipid spezial®, an emulsion containing the full supply of carbohydrates, amino acids and lipids (SO:MCT = 1:1) with a total energy content of 2215 kcal in a 1875 ml volume, see Investigator's Brochure. In addition, they receive daily infusional Omegaven® 100 ml over 4 hours, which equal FO 10 g/d or omega-3 PUFA 3-6 g/d.</description>
