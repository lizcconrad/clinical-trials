  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic injury to muscular tissue is common in cardiovascular medicine. The most effective
      treatment to avoid ischemic damage is the rapid re-establishment of reperfusion. However,
      reperfusion itself can result in additional damage to ischemic tissue. This phenomenon is
      called ischemia - reperfusion (IR) injury and is caused by different pathologic mechanisms.

      Therapies are required which can be administered after the onset of an ischemic event to
      protect the tissue against IR injury. Therefore, a promising strategy to reduce IR injury is
      post-conditioning.

      Likewise, pharmacological therapies administered after the onset of reperfusion might prevent
      tissue injury. We have recently shown that high concentrations of exogenous vitamin C
      abrogate experimental IR injury of the forearm vasculature in patients with peripheral artery
      disease and in healthy subjects.

      Study hypothesis

      We hypothesize that the administration of mechanical post-conditioning or of high-dose
      vitamin C may protect skeletal muscle against IR injury. This shall be studied employing MR
      spectroscopy of the leg, which is an established model to assess muscle aerobic energy
      metabolism.

      Design

      Three periods, three way cross over study in 10 volunteers. One screening visit, three
      one-day study days with two washout periods of &gt;3 days in between are scheduled for each
      participant. The order of experimental days will be randomized. After the last treatment a
      final follow-up examination will be performed within one week.
