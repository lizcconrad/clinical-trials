      The purpose of our study is to evaluate the diagnostic validity of a new immunofecal occult
      blood test (IFOBT) (Teco Diagnostics) in U.S. veterans and to compare it with the guaiac
      based FOBT.

      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men and women in the United States
      with an estimated 147,000 new cases and more than 56,000 deaths each year. Early detection of
      colon cancer and removal of precancerous adenomatous polyps have been shown to reduce its
      morbidity, mortality and incidence. There are several recommended CRC screening tests,
      including fecal occult blood test (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy, air-contrast barium enema,
      and colonoscopy. In the VA, FOBT is the predominant screening test for CRC. Numerous
      randomized controlled trials have established the efficacy of FOBT in CRC screening. Its
      advantages include privacy, noninvasiveness, and cost-effectiveness. Use of guaiac-based
      testing, however, is hampered by low patient compliance, sensitivity, specificity, and
      positive predictive value. The poor patient compliance, and low specificity and positive
      predictive value, may be related to the testing procedure. For example, dietary and
      medication restrictions are recommended to decrease false-negative and false-positive tests.
      Such restrictions may impede patient compliance. Recently, several studies have evaluated the
      effectiveness immunochemical-based testing as a potential alternative, with reportedly better
      compliance, sensitivity, and specificity than guaiac-based tests. The purpose of our study is
      to evaluate the diagnostic validity of a new IFOBT (Teco Diagnostics) in U.S. veterans and to
      compare it with the guaiac based FOBT.
