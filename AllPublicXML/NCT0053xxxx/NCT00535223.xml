      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine if Group Based Exposure
      Therapy (GBET) is more effective than treatment as usual in reducing the symptoms of
      war-related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 250,000 veterans with war-related PTSD were treated in the VA system in the VA system
      last year. Although the VA set up over 140 specialized PTSD programs and 206 Vet Centers to
      treat these veterans, a survey of practice patterns suggests that most VA PTSD treatment is
      not consistent with published treatment guidelines. This is mainly due to the very rare use
      of exposure therapy which is surprising considering that there is more empirical support for
      exposure therapy than for any other PTSD treatment. The failure to utilize evidence-based
      treatment may explain why studies have generally failed to support the efficacy of VA PTSD
      treatment. Group Based Exposure Therapy (GBET) is consistent with PTSD treatment guidelines
      and includes a large amount of exposure therapy. An open trial of 102 war veterans suggests
      that GBET produces clinically significant and lasting PTSD symptom reductions, as measured by
      the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), with a large effect size of 1.20 (generalized
      d). Clinically significant symptoms reductions, defined as a reduction in total CAPS score of
      10 or more points, were found in 81 percent of patients. These symptom reductions were
      maintained on 6-month post-treatment assessments for most patients. Self-report measures of
      depression, anger, suicidal ideation and PTSD were also significantly reduced when
      pre-treatment measures were compared to post-treatment scores. This magnitude of symptom
      change has rarely been reported with VA war-related PTSD patients and there was a low dropout
      rate (&gt;3%). Caution should be used in interpreting these unusual findings due to the treating
      clinicians conducting study assessments. Unconscious bias or a desire by patients to please
      their therapists may have affected outcomes. GBET is a 16-week program during which patients
      attend group therapy twice a week for three hours of group per day and are required to make
      two war trauma presentations to their group. These are recorded and the patients are required
      to listen to these recordings a minimum of 10 times. There are generally 10 patients per
      group and through the combination of making their own presentations, listening to recordings
      of these presentations, and hearing the presentations of the other nine group members, there
      are over 60 hours of exposure. Patients learn about PTSD symptoms, sleep hygiene, specific
      stress/anger management techniques, and ways to cognitively restructure trauma-related
      thinking. Although these findings are encouraging critical questions remain about the
      generalizability of GBET. The three primary questions are: 1) would similar outcomes be found
      with the more rigorous test of a randomized controlled trial, 2) can new psychotherapists
      produce similar outcomes, and 3) can similar outcomes be found at other sites. The proposed
      study would take the next step by conducting the first controlled trial in which 88 veterans
      with war-related PTSD will be randomly assigned to either GBET or Treatment as Usual control
      condition (44 per condition). GBET treatment would be provided by four psychotherapists
      without prior GBET experience. Independent Assessors blind to treatment condition would
      assess patients prior to treatment, at post-treatment, 6-months post-treatment and one year
      post-treatment using CAPS and other standardized measures. If GBET is supported, multi-site
      study will be proposed to investigate the third primary question.

      Potential Impact on Veteran Health Care: GBET was developed within a specialized PTSD
      program, by VA clinicians working with war veterans and has been a primary mode of treatment
      within this program for over three years. Most VA PTSD programs have staffing similar to the
      one the developed GBET and many have more staff. GBET is manualized and could be adopted
      easily by other VA PTSD programs and Vet Centers. The proposed study would serve as a
      feasibility study for a multi-site study. If a multi-site study found that GBET produced
      superior treatment outcomes to those currently in use, it could have a direct impact on the
      lives of a large number of veterans by leading to better PTSD treatment within the VA.

    <description>This is an interview regarding the frequency and intensity of each of the 17 PTSD symptoms found in DSM IV and includes information about the degree to which these symptoms are interfering with functioning. This interview includes that clinician rating the participants responses for both the frequency of each symptom and the intensity of each symptom on a scale of zero to four. A score of 0, best possible score, would indicate that the participant is no longer reporting any of the 17 DSM IV symptoms of PTSD. The worse possible score is 136, this would indicate that a participant was reporting every symptoms of PTSD occurring daily or almost daily and that each symptom is causing the most extreme level of distress.</description>

    <description>This 36 item self-report measure is designed to assess the degree to which a participant agrees with thoughts and beliefs that have been found to be common for individuals who suffer from PTSD. Each item is rated between 1 ( Totally Disagree) to 7 ( Totally Agree). The best score would be 36, indicating that the participant totally did not agree with any of the thoughts that have been associated with PTSD. The worse score would be 252, which would indicate that the participant totally agreed with all of the cognitions that have been associated with PTSD</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male veterans diagnosed with war-related PTSD as assessed by the CAPS. Patients must
             provide a DD214 or other documentation of war exposure.

          2. Patients must have the ability to provide informed consent and function at an
             intellectual level sufficient to allow accurate completion of all assessment
             instruments (as evident by the ability to pass informed consent test, to fill out
             self-report assessment measures and to respond appropriately during the clinical
             interview).

          3. Patients must be either stable on psychotropic medication (defined as no additional
             psychotropic medications or significant increases in previously prescribed
             psychotropic medications for a period of at least three months) or not on psychotropic
             medication.

          4. Patients must be currently in treatment within the Mental Health Clinic (MHC) of the
             Atlanta VA Medical Center for a minimum of four months prior to participation. This
             would insure adequate psychiatric coverage and case management. If a change in
             medication were needed during the study, it would be made. Such changes would be
             tracked for analysis if they occur in a significant number of patients.

          5. Patients must have the support of their current Mental Health Clinic Treatment Team to
             participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria are intended to exclude patients who might be harmed by study
        participation and to yield as ecologically valid a sample as possible.

          1. Patients with current or history of mania or schizophrenia would be excluded because
             the stress of exposure therapy may precipitate an increase in symptoms of these
             co-morbid conditions that could interfere with the patient's ability to benefit from
             treatment.

          2. Patients suffering from current active psychosis, active mania, or sufficient mental
             impairment, as assessed by a Mini Mental State Exam score below 24, which would
             prevent the patient from providing valid consent or participating safely or
             understanding the treatment.

          3. Patients with current, prominent suicidal ideation. All patients would be screened for
             suicidal ideation and intention by the RC in the initial screening and again by the IA
             in the initial assessment through a brief clinical interview. A BDI #9 score above 3
             would prompt a more in-depth inquiry concerning suicidal thoughts and intentions
             during the initial assessment.

          4. Patients who currently meet diagnostic criteria for substance abuse or dependence or
             have met such criteria during the previous three months (as measured by the clinical
             interview and the Kreek-McHugh-Schluger-Kellogg scale (50)).

        <description>This is an interview regarding the frequency and intensity of each of the 17 PTSD symptoms found in DSM IV and includes information about the degree to which these symptoms are interfering with functioning. This interview includes that clinician rating the participants responses for both the frequency of each symptom and the intensity of each symptom on a scale of zero to four. A score of 0, best possible score, would indicate that the participant is no longer reporting any of the 17 DSM IV symptoms of PTSD. The worse possible score is 136, this would indicate that a participant was reporting every symptoms of PTSD occurring daily or almost daily and that each symptom is causing the most extreme level of distress.</description>

Group Based Exposure Therapy: GBET is a 16-week program during which patients attend group therapy twice a week for three hours of group per day and are required to make two war trauma presentations to their group. These are recorded and the patients are required to listen to these recordings a minimum of 10 times. There are generally 10 patients per group and through the combination of making their own presentations, listening to recordings of these presentations, and hearing the presentations of the other nine group members, there are over 60 hours of exposure. Patients also learn about PTSD symptoms, sleep hygiene, specific stress/anger management techniques, and ways to cognitively restructure trauma-related thinking.</description>
