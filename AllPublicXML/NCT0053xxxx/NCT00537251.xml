  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy (in terms of metabolic control evaluated through HbA1c levels) of
      treatment with insulin glargine as basal insulin and insulin analogue (insulin lispro) as
      mealtime insulin with a regimen of insulin NPH as basal insulin with regular insulin, as
      mealtime insulin, after a 16 week treatment phase with each regimen and to compare the safety
      of both treatments, evaluated through hypoglycemic rates.

      Multicenter, open-label, randomized (allocation ratio 1:1), cross-over with two treatment
      phases of 16 weeks each in two treatment groups:

        -  Study arm with insulin glargine + insulin lispro (phase 1) and insulin NPH + regular
           insulin (phase 2)

        -  Insulin NPH + regular insulin (phase 1) and insulin glargine + insulin lispro (phase 2)
