    <textblock>
      This is a research study designed to compare the single-dose effectiveness of
      albuterol-HFA-BAI (breath activated inhaler) and albuterol-HFA-MDI (metered dose inhaler) in
      asthmatics with poor inhaler coordinating abilities. Patients must be 7 to 70 years of age to
      participate in this study.
