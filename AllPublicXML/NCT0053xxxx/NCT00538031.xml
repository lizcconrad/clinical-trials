      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Celecoxib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth. Giving cyclophosphamide together with celecoxib may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving cyclophosphamide together
      with celecoxib works compared to cyclophosphamide alone in treating patients with recurrent
      or persistent ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the response rates in patients with recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian,
      fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are treated with oral cyclophosphamide alone
      or oral cyclophosphamide with celecoxib.

      II. To assess the time to disease progression in this group of patients. III. To further
      describe the toxicities of oral cyclophosphamide with or without celecoxib in the above
      patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide once daily and oral celecoxib twice daily on
      days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
