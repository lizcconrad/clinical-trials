    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies different high-dose chemotherapy regimens with or without total-body
      irradiation (TBI) to compare how well they work when given before autologous stem cell
      transplant (ASCT) in treating patients with hematologic cancer or solid tumors. Giving
      high-dose chemotherapy with or without TBI before ASCT stops the growth of cancer cells by
      stopping them from dividing or killing them. After treatment, stem cells are collected from
      the patient's blood or bone marrow and stored. More chemotherapy may be given to prepare for
      the stem cell transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the
      blood forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the progression free survival (PFS) distribution for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL),
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM) for each disease-specific high dose
      therapy regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the PFS distribution for amyloidosis, acute leukemia and selected solid tumors
      for each disease-specific high dose therapy regimen.

      II. Explore the role of risk factors in the outcome of all treated patients. III. Examine the
      high dose therapy regimen-related toxicity (RRT) and overall survival after bone marrow
      transplant (BMT).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are assigned to conditioning regimens based on disease, age, and co-morbidities.
