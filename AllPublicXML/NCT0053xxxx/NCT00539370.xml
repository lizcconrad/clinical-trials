      This protocol will enable IRB (institutional review board) review of proposed research using
      human samples and data collected under the terminated NIH studies 04-EI-0065 and 96-EI-0096.
      Data and samples may include demographic and personal health information, psychological or
      psychiatric testing, blood, urine, CSF or other body fluids or tissues and results of medical
      and physiological evaluation and medical imaging.

      Data and sample analyses are limited to those approved under the original protocols unless
      additional specific institutional review board approval is obtained.

      and data collected under other branch protocols.

      Study population: Participants that were followed in terminated branch protocols under which
      data or samples were collected.
