      RATIONALE: Gathering information about genetic changes in patients with lobular carcinoma in
      situ of the breast may help doctors learn more about the disease and find better methods of
      treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the genetics of women with lobular carcinoma in situ
      of the breast.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Identify inherited variation that predisposes women to develop lobular carcinoma in situ
           (LCIS) of the breast.

        -  Identify the frequency of these variants and determine the effect they have on tumor
           risk.

        -  Determine how worthwhile it would be to test for these variants in the clinical setting
           so that those at higher risk could be identified, counseled, and screened.

      Secondary

        -  Analysis of genetic changes within LCIS with the aim of identifying cases of LCIS which
           may progress to invasive cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients and control participants undergo blood collection. DNA is extracted from
      blood samples and used to genotype at selected polymorphisms, compare allele frequencies
      (used to associate alleles with disease) using a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism
      (SNP) screen. Archival tumor samples (if available) from patients are used for DNA-, RNA-, or
      protein-based analyses.

      All participants complete a questionnaire about family history, a brief medical history, and
      provide epidemiological data to a genetic counselor. Participants identified to be at risk
      for known hereditary predisposition to cancer will be referred to a clinical genetics
      service. Individual results of this study are not disclosed to participants.

      Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,000 participants (1,000 patients and 1,000 matched controls)
      will be accrued for this study.
