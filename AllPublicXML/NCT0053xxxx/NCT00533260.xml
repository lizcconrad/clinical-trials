  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The basic hypothesis of this trial is that forgetfulness and failure to establish a routine
      that facilitates medication adherence are prominent reasons for non-adherence. Daily use of
      the SMS text messages is designed to enhance patient adherence with medication by promoting
      daily routine and demonstrate the feasibility of using SMS technology within normal clinical
      practice in The Netherlands.

      PLEASE NOTE: Seroquel SR and Seroquel XR refer to the same formulation. The SR designation
      was changed to XR after consultation with FDA.
