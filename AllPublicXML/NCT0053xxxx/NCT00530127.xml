    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of
      deferiprone in subjects with Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA).

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of deferiprone for the treatment of FRDA,
      as assessed by a 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), Low-Contrast Letter
      Acuity test (LCLA), International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS), and Friedreich's
      Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS).

      The tertiary objectives are to evaluate the effect of deferiprone on:

        1. cardiac function as measured by changes in Left Ventricular Shortening Fraction (LVSF),
           Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) and Left Ventricular (LV) mass using
           echocardiogram (ECHO),

        2. quality of life using quality-of-life surveys, and

        3. functional status using Activities of Daily Living (ADL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. A
      total of 80 patients with Friedreich's ataxia will be enrolled. Eligible patients will
      receive deferiprone oral solution or placebo at a total daily dose of 20 mg/kg/day, 40
      mg/kg/day or 60 mg/kg/day, divided into two-daily doses for 6 months.

             psychological or psychiatric risks, and for whom participation in an investigational
