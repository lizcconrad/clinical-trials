  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of blocking the blood vessels to the
      tumor in your liver with small beads alone (Bead Block) versus blocking them with the same
      bead that contains and releases doxorubicin (a chemotherapy agent). The reason for the study
      is to see if adding doxorubicin kills more tumor than would be killed by just blocking the
      blood supplying the tumor. The chemotherapy, doxorubicin, has been used for many years to
      treat patients with cancer. This procedure to block the blood vessels is called embolization.
      Embolization is a common treatment for patients with liver cancer who cannot have surgery.
      The investigators are comparing the standard treatment (using the small beads alone) with
      another that should be at least as good, but possibly better (with the addition of the drug,
      doxorubicin). There is no guarantee that the new treatment is better and it is possible that
      there might be more side effects (related to the doxorubicin) than what is seen with the
      standard treatment.

      Biocompatibles LC Bead (also known as DC Bead in Asia &amp; Europe) microspheres are preformed
      soft, deformable microspheres that may be loaded with doxorubicin and used to occlude blood
      flow to a cancerous tumour. LC Bead microspheres consist of a macromere derived from PVA. The
      fully polymerized microsphere is approximately 90% water and is compressible to approximately
      30% by diameter. The microspheres can be delivered through conventional catheters (4-5Fr) or
      micro-catheters in the 2-3Fr range. These microspheres, like all agents used for arterial
      embolization, are mixed with radiographic contrast prior to administration in order to allow
      for fluoroscopic control of the embolization procedure.
