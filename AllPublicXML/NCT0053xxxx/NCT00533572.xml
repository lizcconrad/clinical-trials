  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) is a severe inherited blistering skin
      disease caused by absence of type VII collagen. Patients with RDEB develop large, severly
      painful blisters and open wounds from minor trauma to their skin. In the future, we hope to
      start a gene transfer study on a specific group of RDEB subjects and we are screening
      subjects for that potential trial now.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a preparation for a gene transfer trial. In the gene transfer trial, we will
      transfect autologous RDEB keratinocytes with a type VII collagen containing retrovirus
      vector. We then plan to graft the genetically engineered and corrected autologous
      keratinocytes back on to wounds of the RDEB subject. We expect the grafts to attach as normal
      keratinocytes and replace the damaged skin with skin that is able to make type VII collagen
      and anchor normally to the dermis. We are trying to define the number of subjects 18 or older
      who meet the criteria for the gene transfer trial. We are offering the subjects the
      opportunity to be evaluated for the potential trial.

    Study was suspended until FDA approved the IND. Study has since been terminated and a new
    screening process has been implemented.
