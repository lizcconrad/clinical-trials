  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to study the effects of switching from an antiretroviral
      combination that includes two ritonavir boosted protease inhibitors to replacement of these
      two protease inhibitors with a new protease inhibitor called Darunavir (also boosted with
      ritonavir).

      The study will investigate the effect of the switch on viral load (the levels of the HIV
      virus in the blood), on immunological parameters (CD4 count) and on other safety parameters
      and also on quality of life.

      In a subgroup of patients the impact of the switch on the body's response to the hormone
      insulin will also be measured (Euglycaemic clamp sub group)

      HIV-RNA and CD4+ cell count to monitor virological and immunological response on switching to
      DRV/r.

      Routine safety bloods to include haematology and biochemistry (including U&amp;E, fasted glucose
      and insulin, liver function test, fasting cholesterol and triglycerides and serum lactate
      measurements).

      Quality of life EuroQOL questionnaires at baseline, and throughout the study to evaluate
      quality of life in the continued treatment/ treatment switch arms.

      A sub group of 10 patients will undergo two euglycaemic clamp procedures in order to
      determine the extent of glucose disposal. The first clamp will be performed prior to the
      switching from a double boosted PI therapy to DRV/r and the second one following
      administration of DRV/r for 4 weeks.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. HIV-1 infected as documented by a licensed HIV-1 antibody ELISA test

          2. At least 18 years of age

          3. Currently on an antiretroviral regimen including a ritonavir boosted double protease
             inhibitor

          4. The subject is virologically suppressed with a viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL for three
             months or longer

          5. The subject has a CD4+ count above 100 cells/mL

          6. ≤ Three DRV associated mutations on previous genotypic resistance test -or if no
             resistance test available, likely to have ≤ four protease inhibitor mutations based on
             their clinical history

          7. If the subject is a woman of child bearing potential, she must agree to use a barrier
             method of contraception

          8. The ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, prior to
             participation in any screening procedures and must be willing to comply with all study
             requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or lactating women

          2. Individuals with prior darunavir exposure

          3. Previous allergic or hypersensitivity reaction to darunavir

          4. Clinical or laboratory evidence of significantly decreased hepatic function or
             decompensation, irrespective of liver enzyme levels (liver insufficiency)

          5. Subjects diagnosed with acute viral hepatitis at screening

          6. Subjects with a grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality as defined by DAIDS grading table
             (see appendix 3: DAIDS AE grading Table), with the following exceptions unless
             clinical assessment foresees an immediate health risk to the subject:

               -  Subjects with pre-existing diabetes or with asymptomatic glucose grade 3 or 4
                  elevations

               -  Subjects with asymptomatic triglyceride or cholesterol elevations of grade 3 or
                  4.

          7. Presence of any currently active AIDS defining illness (Category C conditions
             according to the CDC Classification System for HIV Infection 1993) with the following
             exceptions: Stable cutaneous Kaposi's Sarcoma (i.e., no internal organ involvement
             other than oral lesions) that is unlikely to require any form of systemic therapy
             during the study; Wasting syndrome due to HIV infection.

             Note: An AIDS defining illness that is not clinically stabilized for at least 30 days
             will be considered as currently active.

          8. Active drug abuse, including alcohol or recreational drugs, which, in the opinion of
             the investigator, is expected to interfere with the subject's ability to adhere to the
             study procedures and treatment regimen. Subjects on a methadone program will be
             accepted if deemed appropriate by the investigator.
