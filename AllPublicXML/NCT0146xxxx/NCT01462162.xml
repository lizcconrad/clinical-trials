  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study will investigate the effect of tocilizumab on fatigue in
      participants with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have an inadequate response to
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) drugs. Data
      will be collected from participants for 6 months.

    <measure>Regression Coefficient Between Change in Fatigue Score as Measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F) at Week 12 and Change in Main Variables at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Regression analysis between change in FACIT-F scale and change in following variable were assessed: DAS28-ESR (total score range: 0-9.4, higher score=more disease activity), Epworth sleepiness scale (total score range: 0-24, higher score=higher degree of sleepiness), back depression inventory (total score range: 0-63, score higher than 18 indicates moderate to severe symptoms of depression). The total score of the FACIT-F questionnaire ranges from 0=worse score to 52=better score. Regression coefficient (R) and coefficient of determination (R^2) were calculated. Difference (1-R^2)=the variation in the changes in fatigue not explained by independent variables, that is, independent contribution of these changes in fatigue to the assessment of RA. Only variables with available data were reported.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 and 24 in Fatigue Score as Assessed by FACIT-F</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), greater was the participant's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score).</description>

        <title>Regression Coefficient Between Change in Fatigue Score as Measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F) at Week 12 and Change in Main Variables at Week 12</title>
        <description>Regression analysis between change in FACIT-F scale and change in following variable were assessed: DAS28-ESR (total score range: 0-9.4, higher score=more disease activity), Epworth sleepiness scale (total score range: 0-24, higher score=higher degree of sleepiness), back depression inventory (total score range: 0-63, score higher than 18 indicates moderate to severe symptoms of depression). The total score of the FACIT-F questionnaire ranges from 0=worse score to 52=better score. Regression coefficient (R) and coefficient of determination (R^2) were calculated. Difference (1-R^2)=the variation in the changes in fatigue not explained by independent variables, that is, independent contribution of these changes in fatigue to the assessment of RA. Only variables with available data were reported.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 and 24 in Fatigue Score as Assessed by FACIT-F</title>
        <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Larger the participantâs response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), greater was the participantâs fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participantâs response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score).</description>

        <title>Regression Coefficient Between Change in Fatigue Score as Measured by the FACIT-F at Week 12 and 24 With Change in Disease Activity Parameters at Week 12 and 24</title>
        <description>Regression analysis between change in FACIT-F scale and change in following variable were assessed: DAS28-ESR (total score range: 0-9.4, higher score=more disease activity), Epworth sleepiness scale (total score range: 0-24, higher score=higher degree of sleepiness), back depression inventory (total score range: 0-63, score higher than 18 indicates moderate to severe symptoms of depression), serum hemoglobin, swollen joint count, morning stiffness (time taken to achieve maximum improvement), degree of pain (assessed on horizontal visual scale, 0=no pain; 10=maximum pain). The total score of the FACIT-F questionnaire ranges from 0=worse score to 52=better score. Regression coefficient (R) and coefficient of determination (R^2) were calculated. Difference (1-R^2)=the variation in the changes in fatigue not explained by independent variables, that is, independent contribution of these changes in fatigue to the assessment of RA. Only variables with available data were reported.</description>

        <title>Regression Coefficient Between Change in Hemoglobin Level at Week 12, 24 and Change in Disease Activity at Week 12 and 24</title>
        <description>Regression analysis between change in hemoglobin level and change in following variable were assessed: Epworth sleepiness scale (total score range: 0-24, higher score=higher degree of sleepiness), back depression inventory (total score range: 0-63, score higher than 18 indicates moderate to severe symptoms of depression), swollen joint count, morning stiffness (time taken to achieve maximum improvement), degree of pain (assessed on horizontal visual scale, 0=no pain; 10=maximum pain). Hemoglobin level was measure in g/L. The regression coefficient (R) and coefficient of determination (R^2) were calculated. Difference (1-R^2) indicates the variation in the changes in hemoglobin not explained by the independent variables, that is, independent contribution of these changes in hemoglobin to the assessment of RA. Only variables with available data were reported.</description>

        <description>Regression analysis between change in hemoglobin level and change in following variable were assessed: Epworth sleepiness scale (total score range: 0-24, higher score=higher degree of sleepiness), back depression inventory (total score range: 0-63, score higher than 18 indicates moderate to severe symptoms of depression), swollen joint count, morning stiffness (time taken to achieve maximum improvement), degree of pain (assessed on horizontal visual scale, 0=no pain; 10=maximum pain). Hemoglobin level was measure in g/L. The regression coefficient (R) and coefficient of determination (R^2) were calculated. Difference (1-R^2) indicates the variation in the changes in hemoglobin not explained by the independent variables, that is, independent contribution of these changes in hemoglobin to the assessment of RA. Only variables with available data were reported.</description>

The Epworth Sleepiness Scale evaluates how likely a person is to doze off or fall asleep in 8 different sedentary situations, using for each item possible scores of 0 to 3 (0=never, 1=mild, 2=moderate and 3=severe). A final score is obtained between 0-24, where a higher score indicates a higher degree of sleepiness. Baseline data is reported separately for Weeks 12 and 24 to include only those participants who had available data at Weeks 12 and 24, respectively.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Sleepiness Score as Assessed on Epworth Sleepiness Scale at Week 12, 24 - Safety Population</title>
        <description>Degree of sleepiness was assessed by Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale evaluates how likely a person is to doze off or fall asleep in 8 different sedentary situations, using for each item possible scores of 0 to 3 (0=never, 1=mild, 2=moderate and 3=severe). A final score is obtained between 0-24, where a higher score indicates a higher degree of sleepiness. Baseline data is reported separately for Weeks 12 and 24 to include only those participants who had available data at Weeks 12 and 24, respectively.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Scale (DAS28) Score at Week 12, 24</title>
        <description>DAS28-4 erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was calculated from SJC and tender joint count (TJC) using 28 joints count, ESR millimeter per hour (mm/hr) and patient global assessment (PtGA) of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity assessment). The DAS28-ESR score (14) was calculated using the following formula: DAS28 = 0.56 x (square root TJC) + 0.28 x (square root SJC) + 0.70 x [Ln(ESR)] + 0.014 x (PtGA).Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score=more disease activity. DAS28-4 (ESR) less than or equal to (&lt;=) 3.2 implied low disease activity and greater than (&gt;)3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate to high disease activity, and DAS28-4 (ESR) less than (&lt;)2.6 = remission. PtGA measured using a 100 mm VAS ranging from 0 = very good to 100 = very bad. Baseline data is reported separately for Weeks 12 and 24 to include only those participants who had available data at Weeks 12 and 24, respectively.</description>

          <description>DAS28-4 erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was calculated from SJC and tender joint count (TJC) using 28 joints count, ESR millimeter per hour (mm/hr) and patient global assessment (PtGA) of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity assessment). The DAS28-ESR score (14) was calculated using the following formula: DAS28 = 0.56 x (square root TJC) + 0.28 x (square root SJC) + 0.70 x [Ln(ESR)] + 0.014 x (PtGA).Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score=more disease activity. DAS28-4 (ESR) less than or equal to (&lt;=) 3.2 implied low disease activity and greater than (&gt;)3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate to high disease activity, and DAS28-4 (ESR) less than (&lt;)2.6 = remission. PtGA measured using a 100 mm VAS ranging from 0 = very good to 100 = very bad. Baseline data is reported separately for Weeks 12 and 24 to include only those participants who had available data at Weeks 12 and 24, respectively.</description>
