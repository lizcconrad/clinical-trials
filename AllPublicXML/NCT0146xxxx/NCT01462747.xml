  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of rectally administered activated carbon
      (medical device KULIST) in chronic, uncomplicated, perianal fistulas.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic uncomplicated perianal fistulas located below levator ani will be
      treated twice daily with KULIST for 8 weeks. The efficacy will be evaluated by means of an
      overall clinical evaluation of fistula closure, as well as by anal ultrasonography.

      Also changes in Patient Assessment of Symptoms and Impact on Daily Function will be
      evaluated. Safety will be evaluated by standard adverse event /adverse device effects
      reporting.
