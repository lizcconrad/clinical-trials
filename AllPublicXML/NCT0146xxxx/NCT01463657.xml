  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting to the clinic for treatment of moderate to severe Nasolabial folds will
      be recruited to receive either ELAPR002b or ELAPR002d for the treatment of one Nasolabial
      fold and Juvéderm® Ultra Plus for the treatment of the second, opposite Nasolabial fold.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment will be repeated on Day 29 (if required) and Day 57 (if required) to achieve
      optimum cosmetic results (OCR).

      Each treatment will consist of up to 15 injections in total, each consisting of up to 0.1 ml
      of product, delivered to the mid to deep dermis of the skin of each Nasolabial fold using a
      27G needle.

      Each patient will receive the same preparation implanted as a bolus of 0.1mL at Day 1 into
      the mid-deep dermis of the skin of the medial aspect of the upper arm using a 27G needle, and
      two 2mm biopsies will be taken at the same visit on Day 57, Day 85 or Day 169 depending on
      randomisation for histopathology assessment.

    <description>Each treatment will consist of up 15 injections in total, each consisting of up to 0.1 ml of product, delivered to the mid to deep dermis of the skin of each NLF using a 27G needle. The needle will be inserted at an approximate angle of 30o parallel to the skin, and the product may be injected by a retrograde injection or by deposition of a bolus. ELAPR and the control may be implanted parallel or perpendicular to the NLF. Exactly the same technique will be used for the treatment of both NLFs for each patient.</description>
