  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see whether rifaximin, an antibiotic that works in the
      intestines, can lower the amount of germs in the intestines of HIV infected persons. It is
      possible that when the amount of these germs is lowered, an HIV-infected person's immune
      system will become less active and will have a better chance of recovering. Also, the study
      will evaluate the safety of using rifaximin in HIV-infected subjects.

      A5286 is a randomized, open-label, two-arm, pilot (phase II) study that evaluated whether 4
      weeks of treatment with rifaximin, a non-absorbable antibiotic, decreases markers of immune
      activation and levels of translocated gut microbial products in HIV-1 infected subjects
      virally suppressed on ART with CD4+ T-cells &lt; 350 cells/mm^3. Rifaximin were admistered to
      subjects for 3 weeks. Follow-up continued to week 12. The total sample size was 73 subjects.
      Subjects were randomized at a 2:1 ratio (rifaximin: no study treatment), using permuted
      blocks, without institutional balancing.

      Subjects were seen through week 12 for clinical and laboratory evaluations, including plasma
      HIV-1 RNA, CD4+ T-cell count, and safety laboratories. Subjects had 2 baseline visits -- at
      pre-entry and entry. Study visits were scheduled at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. CD4+ T-cell counts
      and HIV-1 RNA were measured at all weeks; measures of activations, gut-homing markers, and
      soluble biomarkers were also performed at all weeks.

             or more antiretroviral medications. (Ritonavir ≤ 400 mg/day will not be considered a
             separate antiretroviral agent.)

          -  No plans to change the antiretroviral regimen at least in the next 3 months after
             study entry.

          -  CD4+ cell count &lt; 350 cells/mm3 obtained within 120 days prior to study entry at any
             laboratory that has a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification
             or its equivalent.

          -  All previous CD4+ cell counts should be &lt; 350 cells/mm3 for at least 96 weeks prior to
             study entry while subjects were on ART. (A single CD4+ cell count ≥ 350 cells/mm3 is
             permitted within 96 weeks prior to study entry while subjects were on ART.)

          -  Documentation of HIV-1 RNA below the limit of detection (e.g., &lt; 50 copies/mL on Roche
             Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor assay, &lt; 75 copies/mL on the Versant HIV-1 RNA assay by
             branched DNA, &lt; 400 copies/mL on a standard Roche Amplicor assay, &lt; 40 copies/mL on
             the Abbott m2000sp/m2000rt real-time PCR test, &lt; 48 copies/mL on the COBAS
             AmpliPrep/TAQMAN HIV-1 assay) verified by at least two measurements prior to study
             entry, one of which must be at least 48 weeks prior to study entry and one measurement
             that was obtained between 121 days and 48 weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Screening HIV-1 RNA below the limit of detection obtained within 120 days prior to
             study entry using a FDA -approved assay (e.g., &lt; 50 copies/mL on Roche Amplicor HIV-1
             Monitor assay, &lt; 75 copies/mL on the Versant HIV-1 RNA assay by branched DNA, &lt; 40
             copies/mL on the Abbott m2000sp/m2000rt real-time PCR test, &lt; 48 copies/mL on the
             COBAS AmpliPrep/TAQMAN HIV-1 assay). (The virologic assay must have a lower limit of
             detection of ≤ 75 copies/mL.)

          -  All other plasma HIV-1 RNA measurements in the 48 weeks prior to study entry must be
             below the limit of detection. (A single detectable measurement of ≤ 200 copies/mL is
             permitted if RNA levels immediately before and after are below the limits of detection
             for the assay.)

          -  Certain fasting laboratory values obtained within 45 days prior to entry as indicated
             in Section 4.1.9 of the protocol.

          -  Pre-entry peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) specimen for assay of the primary
             immune activation endpoint (change in CD8+ T-cells activation (%HLA-DR+CD38+CD8+
             T-cells) has been obtained. Sites must receive confirmation from the processing lab
             via phone, e-mail, or fax, that this specimen has been entered into the ACTG's
             Laboratory Data Management System (LDMS).

          -  Female subjects of reproductive potential must have a negative serum or urine β-HCG
             pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL performed within 24 hours
             prior to study entry.

          -  If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the female subject
             must agree to use one form of contraceptive as listed in section 4.1.11 of the
             protocol while receiving protocol-specified treatment and for 4 weeks after stopping
             the treatment.

          -  If the female subject is not of reproductive potential, she is eligible without
             requiring the use of a contraceptive. Self report is acceptable documentation of
             sterilization, other contraceptive methods, and menopause.

          -  Ability and willingness of subject or legally authorized representative to provide
             informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active diarrhea (3 or more unformed stools per day) within 28 days prior to study
             entry (except if site investigator or primary care provider attributes diarrhea to
             antiretroviral or azithromycin use).

          -  History of or active inflammatory bowel disease.

          -  History of or active Clostridium difficile colitis.

        <description>Change in CD38+ of CD8+ MFI (Median Fluorescence Intensity) from baseline to week 4, where baseline value is the average of pre-entry and entry.
MFI measures the shift in fluorescence intensity of a population of cells. MFI values are based on control to demonstrate an increase or decrease in expression of the marker. MFI in this study was automatically calculated in FlowJo. The median is the relative intensity value below which 50% of the events are found. MFI is an arbitrary unit of relative intensity.</description>

        <description>Change in CD38+ of CD8+ median fluorescence intensity (MFI) from week 4 to week 8.
MFI measures the shift in fluorescence intensity of a population of cells. MFI values are based on control to demonstrate an increase or decrease in expression of the marker. MFI in this study was automatically calculated in FlowJo. The median is the relative intensity value below which 50% of the events are found. MFI is an arbitrary unit of relative intensity.</description>

        <description>Change in CD38+ of CD8+ median fluorescence intensity (MFI) from week 4 to week 12.
MFI measures the shift in fluorescence intensity of a population of cells. MFI values are based on control to demonstrate an increase or decrease in expression of the marker. MFI in this study was automatically calculated in FlowJo. The median is the relative intensity value below which 50% of the events are found. MFI is an arbitrary unit of relative intensity.</description>
