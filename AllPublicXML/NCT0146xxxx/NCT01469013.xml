    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2b, outpatient, randomized, double-blinded (with a single-blind extension),
      placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, parallel-group study of LY3009104 in Japanese participants
      with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on background methotrexate (MTX) therapy. LY3009104
      will be orally administered once a day with background methotrexate (6 to 16 mg/week) therapy
      for 12 weeks in the double-blind treatment period (1, 2, 4 or 8 mg/day, or placebo), and for
      52 weeks in the single-blind extension period (4 or 8 mg/day).

          -  Have a positive result of the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test or a purified protein
             derivative (PPD) test
