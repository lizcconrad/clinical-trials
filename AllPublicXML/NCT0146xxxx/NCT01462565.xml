      The purpose of this multicentre, open label, single-arm study in approximately 20 adult
      patients is to evaluate the Impact on lifestyle of a new thermo stable formulation of
      epoprostenol sodium in subjects with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, open label, single-arm study in approximately 20 adult patients (18 -
      75 years old) designed to evaluate the Impact on lifestyle of a new thermo stable formulation
      of epoprostenol sodium in subjects with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). The co-primary
      objectives are 1) to describe the effect of the new thermo stable formulation of epoprostenol
      sodium on quality of life and 2) to determine the dose titration requirement in patients
      switching from the currently marketed FLOLAN (epoprostenol sodium) to the new thermo stable
      formulation. Secondary objectives include assessing the safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      the thermo stable formulation of epoprostenol sodium and the exploratory objective is to
      evaluate the effect of the new thermo stable formulation of epoprostenol sodium on
      haemodynamic parameters in a subset of subjects.

      Subjects who are already receiving FLOLAN (epoprostenol sodium) for the treatment of PAH and
      have been on a stable dose for at least 3 months and on stable doses of other PAH treatments
      for at least 30 days prior to screening will be enrolled. After a screening visit, eligible
      subjects will have a 4-week run-in period with their existing FLOLAN (epoprostenol sodium)
      treatment. At the end of the 4-week period, they will be admitted to the clinic for baseline
      assessments and for switching to study medication (the new thermo stable formulation of
      epoprostenol sodium). Subjects will remain in hospital for a minimum of 6 hours to ensure
      clinical and hemodynamic stability prior to discharge. Subjects may stay in hospital for up
      to 24-48 hours after switching to the new thermo stable formulation of epoprostenol sodium at
      the discretion of the investigator. Dose titration requirement will be assessed at the time
      of discharge. Haemodynamic parameters will be obtained in a subgroup of subjects enrolled in
      centres where the collection of haemodynamic data is considered part of the standard of care.
      Subjects will receive the study medication as a continuous intravenous infusion for a 4-week
      treatment period. Those who complete the 4-week treatment period will have the option of
      entering an extension phase of the study to continue receiving the new formulation.

    <description>Subject-rated measure of health status comprised of 36 items: 8 subscale scores (physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health), 2 summary scores (physical component and mental component), and a self-evaluated change in health status. Subscale and summary scores range: 0-100. Higher subscale and summary scores was considered as better health status.

An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect and medically significant and all events of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinaemia. Only treatment emergent AEs and SAEs were reported in this outcome measure. Specifically, this study reported 2 SAEs, but only 1 was categorized as treatment emergent.</description>

      <recruitment_details>A total of 17 participants were recruited from 23 November 2011 to 16 May 2012, out of which 16 participants entered the treatment phase. Study was conducted across 5 centres in the United States, 1 centre in Canada and 1 centre in the Netherlands.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>There was a 4-week run-in period during which 1 participant was assessed to be a screen failure at the Baseline Visit (Visit 2) due to the participant self-titrating their epoprostenol sodium.

Subscale and summary scores range: 0-100. Higher subscale and summary scores was considered as better health status.

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that occurred during the course of the trial after study treatment had started. An adverse event was therefore any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect and medically significant and all events of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinaemia. Only treatment emergent AEs and SAEs were reported in this outcome measure. Specifically, this study reported 2 SAEs, but only 1 was categorized as treatment emergent.</description>

World Health Organization functional class was analyzed at Baseline (Visit 2 i.e. Day-14 [+ or - 7 days]) and Week 4. The classed were defined as Class I: No symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension with exercise or at rest, Class II: No symptoms at rest but uncomfortable and short of breath with normal activity, Class III: May not have symptoms at rest but activities greatly limited by shortness of breath, fatigue, or near fainting and Class IV: Symptoms at rest and severe symptoms with any activity. Hence the severity increased from class I (better) to Class IV (worse).</description>
