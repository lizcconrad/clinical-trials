  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate both pharmaceutical therapy and advanced treatment
      techniques for infertile patients requiring in-vitro fertilization utilizing donor eggs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical pregnancy rate of micronized
      progesterone (Endometrin, Ferring Pharmaceuticals) compared to progesterone in oil injections
      in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) donor egg recipients. The secondary objective is to evaluate
      the effectiveness of freezing/vitrification of donor eggs. Effectiveness of vitrification
      will be evaluated by egg thaw/survival, fertilization, and implantation rates.
