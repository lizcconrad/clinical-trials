  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present proposal is designed to investigate the response to CRT in patients who were
      previously paced from the right ventricle (RV). The negative physiologic and structural
      changes associated with chronic RV pacing are well documented, but patient response following
      upgrade to CRT after chronic RV pacing has not been well characterized in a large cohort.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RV apex has historically been used as the site for ventricular pacing in cases of sinus
      node dysfunction or atrioventricular block because of its relatively accessible location for
      lead implantation. Initial studies showed RV pacing improved symptoms, exercise capacity,
      quality of life, and survival in these patients.11-13 However, more recent studies have
      illustrated that chronic RV pacing may actually impair LV systolic function and increase the
      risks of heart failure, hospitalization, and death in some patients.

      The primary hypothesis is that patients upgraded to CRT from a RV pacemaker respond better
      than those receiving CRT as a first time device. To test this hypothesis the investigators
      will compare changes in cardiac size and function, and hospitalization and survival rates
      between the two patient groups.

      The second hypothesis will investigate whether changes in septal dyssynchrony are correlated
      with changes in ejection fraction in previously RV paced patients. The investigators believe
      that the patients with the most improvement in septal dyssynchrony due to RV pacing will see
      the greatest improvement in LV function following upgrade to CRT. A significant correlation
      between change in IM-S and change in EF will support the hypothesis.
