  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Hodgkins lymphoma (HL) is a highly treatable cancer. However, if HL does not respond to
           chemotherapy or returns after chemotherapy, further treatments often are not successful.

        -  Some HL cells have a molecule called cluster of differentiation 25 (CD25) on the
           surface. Daclizumab is a drug that can detect CD25 on cells. In a treatment study for HL
           that did not respond to chemotherapy, daclizumab plus a radioactive atom called Yttrium
           90 helped kill these HL cells. Researchers want to combine this 90Y daclizumab with
           high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. This treatment may be more effective
           than the daclizumab alone.

      Objectives:

      - To see if yttrium-90 daclizumab, high-dose chemotherapy, and stem cell transplants can
      treat HL that has not responded to earlier treatments.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have Hodgkins lymphoma that has not responded to
      chemotherapy.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also
           have blood and urine tests.

        -  Participants will have filgrastim and plerixafor to move stem cells into the blood. Stem
           cells will be collected with apheresis.

        -  Four weeks after stem cells are collected, participants will have the 90Y daclizumab and
           normal daclizumab to treat the HL. Chemotherapy will start 9 days after the first
           treatment.

        -  Most participants will have a second dose of 90Y daclizumab 6 weeks after the first
           dose.

        -  After each daclizumab treatment, participants will have several imaging studies of the
           chest and abdomen. Blood samples will also be collected.

        -  On the day after the last day of chemotherapy, participants will receive the stem cells
           collected earlier. Filgrastim injections will help stimulate stem cell growth....

      Background:

        -  Although Hodgkins lymphoma (HL) is considered a highly treatable cancer, patients with
           relapsed and chemotherapy refractory disease represent a major therapeutic challenge.

        -  Only 30-65% of relapsed patients will achieve long-term disease free survival with the
           current standard of care high-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell
           transplant (ASCT).

        -  The malignant Reed-Sternberg cells of HL and the surrounding benign T cell infiltrates
           often express CD25, the high affinity interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R alpha).

        -  In study NCI-97-C-0110, we treated 30 patients with CD25-expressing relapsed or
           refractory HL with radioimmunotherapy (RIT) using (90)Y-labeled daclizumab (anti-CD25),
           and achieved a 63% response rate including 12 complete responses with few serious
           adverse events other than MDS in 4 patients.

        -  We propose integrating (90)Y-labeled daclizumab RIT into the induction regimen of ASCT
           in an effort to improve the response and disease-free survival in relapsed and
           refractory HL.

      Objectives:

      Phase I Primary Objectives:

        -  To assess the safety and adverse events associated with (90)Y-daclizumab (humanized
           anti-CD25) radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in combination with high-dose BEAM (carmustine,
           etoposide, cytarabine, [Ara-C, cytosine arabinoside] and melphalan) chemotherapy and
           autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in patients with relapsed or
           refractory Hodgkin s lymphoma (HL) with adverse prognostic factors.

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose in mCi of (90)Y-daclizumab RIT in combination
           with high-dose BEAM chemotherapy and ASCT in patients with relapsed or refractory HL.

      Phase II Primary Objectives:

        -  To assess the frequency of the failure to engraft, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS),
           secondary leukemia for the development of abnormal bone-marrow cytogenetics in
           refractory or relapsed HL patients treated with (90)Y-daclizumab RIT in combination with
           high-dose BEAM chemotherapy and ASCT.

        -  To estimate the response rate (the number of complete and partial responses) in patients
           with refractory or relapsed HD to (90)Y-daclizumab RIT administered in combination with
           high-dose BEAM chemotherapy and ASCT.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of relapsed or refractory HL with at least 10%
           of malignant Reed-Sternberg cells or infiltrating T-cells expressing CD25 (IL-2R alpha).
           A. Patients must have at least one of the following: (1) had an initial relapse less
           than 12 months after achieving a complete response (CR) with primary chemotherapy for
           HL; (2) were Staged at III/IV at diagnosis; (3) exhibited chemotherapy resistant disease
           or (4) did not achieve a CR with cytoreductive chemotherapy prior to a planned
           transplant. B. Patient must have a lesion of at least 1.0 cm in its greatest diameter.
           C. Patients with lymphocyte predominant HL are excluded. D. Patients with pre-existing
           myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or marrow cytogenic abnormalities will not be eligible to
           participate.

        -  Omission of cytotoxic chemotherapy or other systemic therapy of HL for at least 4 weeks
           prior to entry into the trial.

        -  No prior ASCT or allogeneic stem cell transplant.

      Design:

        -  A single institution non-randomized open-label phase I/II trial.

        -  Patients will undergo peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) mobilization with
           granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF, filgrastim) and Plerixafor followed by
           apheresis to collect a target dose of 4 x 106 cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34)
           cells/kg (minimal dose of 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg) of actual body weight.

        -  Phase I study will be carried out using a standard 3 + 3 cohort dose-escalation design:

             -  Dose level 1: Patients will receive a single dose of 15 mCi 90Y-daclizumab RIT (day
                -15 2 days) followed by high-dose BEAM chemotherapy (beginning Day -6) and ASCT
                (Day 0).

             -  Dose levels 2-7: Patients will receive two doses of 90Y-daclizumab RIT 6 weeks
                apart (Day -56 and -15 2 days) followed by high-dose BEAM chemotherapy (beginning
                day -6) and ASCT (Day 0). The first dose of 90Y-daclizumab will be fixed at 15 mCi.
                The second dose will be escalated in 15 mCi increments from 15 mCi until maximum
                tolerated dose, not to exceed 90 mCi.

        -  Phase II: All patients will receive two doses of 90Y-daclizumab (Day -56 and -15 2 days)
           followed by high-dose BEAM chemotherapy (beginning Day -6) and ASCT (Day 0). The first
           dose of RIT will be 15 mCi. The second dose will be the maximum tolerated dose as
           determined from phase I.

           111In-daclizumab (5 mCi) imaging may be performed concurrently with each 90Ydaclizumab
           RIT and at day 100 after ASCT.

        <title>Overall Response Rate</title>
        <description>Overall response rate is defined as the number of complete and partial responses in patients with refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's disease. Response is assessed by the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. Complete response requires all of the following: complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease related symptoms if present before therapy. A post treatment residual mass is permitted as long as it is positron emission tomography negative. Partial response requires all of the following: at least a 50% reduction in the sum of the product of the diameters of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses should be selected according to all of the following: they should be clearly measurable in at least two perpendicular dimensions; if possible they should be from disparate regions of the body; and they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved.</description>
        <time_frame>Response is evaluated at day 100 post autologous stem cell transplant, then 1-4 times yearly for 5 years</time_frame>
