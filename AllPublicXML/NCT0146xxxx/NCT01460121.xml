  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis and management of acute vertigo and dizziness is most of the time an easy task
      for the general practitioner. However, following an acute vestibular disorder and very often
      with no any overt cause, a considerable number of patients complain on chronic dizziness and
      subjective disturbance of balance despite normal clinical and laboratory tests. Patients
      describe that perceptual visual stimulus provoke or aggravate their symptoms that are
      frequently accompanied by anxiety. These cases have been described in the medical literature
      as Phobic Postural Vertigo, Visual Vertigo, Chronic Subjective Dizziness and Motion and Space
      Discomfort (2,3,4,5). Treatment of these conditions includes physical therapy (similar to
      vestibular rehabilitation exercises) and anti-anxiety or anti-depressant agents such as
      benzodiazepines and SSRI, however, the effectiveness of these approaches is debatable.

      Because visual stimuli play a crucial role in space orientation and motion perception, it is
      reasonable to hypothesize that certain visual stabilizing signals applied on the peripheral
      visual field (that is involved mainly in the perception of motion) could be of help in
      patients suffering from dizziness. This is the rationale of a new technology (SMB- Senso
      Mental Balance Technology) developed to alleviate the feelings of dizziness.

      Trial is conducted in Meir Medical Center, Israel. Recruitment only in Israel!
