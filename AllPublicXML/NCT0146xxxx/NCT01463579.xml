  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test if a 6-week programme of exercise improves physical
      function and health related quality of life in patients following intensive care who are
      discharged from hospital. In this study the investigators will compare the physical function
      and health related quality of life of patients who attend the programme with patients who do
      not. The 6 week exercise programme will be run by physiotherapy staff, and will mostly take
      place in a hospital gym. The investigators will measure patients' physical function, exercise
      capacity, level of breathlessness and their quality of life before and after the 6-week
      programme, and 6 months later. The investigators will also interview patients to ask their
      views about the acceptability, enjoyment and satisfaction with the exercise programme. If
      this study shows that the physical function and health related quality of life are improved
      in those who took part in the exercise programme, then it will provide useful information
      which will help the development of services for patients after critical illness. The results
      will also provide information which will help us design future clinical trials for this
      patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most critically ill adult patients require ventilatory support during their intensive care
      unit stay. Following discharge home patients often still suffer from reduced physical
      function, exercise capacity, health related quality of life and social functioning for at
      least 2 years. There is usually no support to address these longer term problems specific to
      critical illness for patients after hospital discharge. Little research has been carried out
      into interventions which could improve physical function and quality of life, or enhance
      speed of recovery in these patients. While there is evidence to support the rehabilitation of
      critically ill patients within intensive care units, there is a paucity of literature to
      support rehabilitation following discharge from intensive care and hospital. Therefore, there
      is a clear and urgent need to investigate interventions which could improve the recovery of
      patients discharged home after intensive care. This is emerging as a prominent therapeutic
      objective for the future for this population.

      This study will investigate whether a programme of exercise following discharge from hospital
      will improve outcome in patients following critical illness compared to standard care.

    <measure>Physical Functioning subscale of the SF-36</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be physical function as measured by the physical functioning (PF) subscale of the SF-36v2 following the exercise programme. This is an important outcome that is meaningful to patients. This has been shown to be an acceptable, reliable and valid tool following critical illness.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients have indicated to us that hand function is particularly slow to return after critical illness and that this is important to them. Strength and dexterity will specifically be measured by dynamometry and the Nine Hole Peg Test.</description>

    <measure>Incremental Shuttle Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise capacity will be measured with the Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT). This is a valid and standardised test of exercise capacity which is responsive to exercise based interventions in other populations. Furthermore the ISWT was used in our pilot study and demonstrated the feasibility and responsiveness of this measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Limitations Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health related quality of life (HRQoL) will also be measured using Functional Limitations Profile (FLP) questionnaire. The FLP questionnaire is a well validated and widely used generic instrument to measure health status in a variety of conditions including critical illness. It provides an estimate of sickness related dysfunction and has both physical and psychosocial dimensions. It was used in our pilot study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>other subscales of the SF-36</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) is also assessed using other subscales of the SF-36v2, role limitations due to physical health, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. Scores are provided for each of these health domains, and two summary measures of physical and mental health: the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety and depression function will be measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS contains 14 statements and scores from 0-21. Scores of 8-10 indicate the possibility of anxiety or depression, and 11 and above indicate that these are likely to be present. It has been validated in the critical care population.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>'Readiness to change' questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's readiness to exercise and self efficacy to exercise are important aspects of feasibility when commencing an exercise programme. Readiness to commence exercise following critical illness will be obtained by assessing components relating to the transtheoretical model (stages, processes, decisional balance, self-efficacy). There is evidence of reliability and validity of the questionnaires designed to measure these constructs.</description>

    <measure>Chronic Disease Self Efficacy Scale (Exercise component)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>

    <description>Patients will complete three exercise sessions per week (2 supervised and 1 unsupervised) for 6 weeks. They will receive a written exercise manual which facilitates completion of their exercise programme. The exercise programme will consist of a warm-up, an exercise circuit, a period of aerobic exercise, and a cool down. The programme will be tailored to each patient's ability and needs.
At the end of the 6 weeks patients will receive a short consultation to set goals relating to continuing exercise at home.</description>
