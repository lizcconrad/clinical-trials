    <textblock>
      Chronic HCV infection is one of the common causes of the chronic liver disease. Approximately
      6-10% of the general public is expected to be suffering from this infection. In case that
      these patients are not treated at an appropriate time, these patients develop the sequelae of
      the chronic liver disease e.g. cirrhosis of liver, Ascites, and Hepatocellular carinoma.
      Interferon alpha 2 a or alpha 2b injections and Ribavirin combination is the treatment of
      choice for people suffering from Chronic HCV infection and this combination need to be
      administered for 6-12 months. Interferons are biological agents and are to be administered
      parenterally. Interferons are expensive and are associated with number of minor and major
      adverse effects. Ribavirin is also associated with significant adverse effects. These
      compounds cannot be considered as one of the ideal forms of the treatment.

      In the past, quite a few natural products have been tested to assess their hepatoprotective
      activity and possibly anti viral activity as well. These include Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid),
      Vitamin E, Zinc, Silymarin, Red beet roots, crushed licorice and etc. etc.

      Rationale Iodine , Potassium iodide and Ascorbic acid are natural products used in the
      management of Thyroiditis and chronic cutaneous fungal infections. This combination of iodine
      compounds along with ascorbic acid is being used for the management of chronic hepatitis B &amp;
      C in the central Asian states e.g. Kazakhstan etc.

      The investigators have conducted a feasibility study in which oral Iodine Compound
      {RENESSANS} was given to patients suffering HCV related Chronic Active Hepatitis and
      anti-viral activity and safety has been analyzed. In this study, RENESSANS containing regimen
      has been well tolerated by all the patients and has shown some antiviral activity.

      In this study the investigators will assess whether the administration of RENESSANS {oral }
      improves the antiviral activity in patients receiving standard interferon therapy.

      1. Primary

           The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of combination therapy
           comprising of RENESSANS, INTERFERONS and RIBAVIRIN in the management of treatment na√Øve
           HCV related Chronic Active Hepatitis patients.

        2. Secondary

           The secondary objectives of this study are:

             1. Determine the biochemical or virological improvement in patients suffering from HCV
                related Chronic Active Hepatitis.

             2. Determine the safety and tolerability of Renessans {oral} when administered as a
                part of antiviral activity outlined in this protocol.

        3. ENDPOINTS

           The primary endpoint will be the number of subjects achieving

             1. Virological response as evident by Rapid Viral Response(RVR), Early Viral
                Response(EVR) and Sustained Viral Response(SVR).

             2. Biochemical response as evident by normalization of ALT.

           The secondary endpoint will be

           a. Assessment of the safety and tolerability of RENESSANS through: routine physical
           examination, routine clinical laboratory tests, clinical monitoring and adverse events
           reporting.

        4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN

           Study Design.

           This is an open labeled, active controlled, three arm, parallel-group study of the
