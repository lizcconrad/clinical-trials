  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of 400 mg of oral zinc gluconate on
      genital warts. Our hypothesis is that there will be a 10% difference in complete clearance of
      genital warts in the group randomized to oral plus standard of care compared to those
      randomized to placebo plus standard of care.

    <textblock>
      Clients presenting to the BCCDC STI clinic with genital warts will be randomized to either
      400 mg zinc gluconate or placebo (200mg BID) for 8 weeks in addition to the standard of care.
      Clinical assessment of warts and additional standard treatment will occur every 7-10 days for
      a maximum of 8 weeks. A telephone call will occur at week 20 to determine if any of the warts
      have cleared or re-appeared. The appearance of new warts will also be noted. The proportion
      of subjects who have complete clearance of genital warts at 8 weeks will be compared between
      groups.
