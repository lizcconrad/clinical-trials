  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is common among non-demented individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) and
      is a significant source of disability and reduced quality of life. Unfortunately, there are
      no successful interventions to address these impairments. Prospective memory impairment is a
      particularly functionally- and clinically-relevant problem in PD. The investigator's project
      will determine if a targeted intervention strategy improves PD participants' prospective
      memory. The investigator's goal is to improve PD patients' everyday prospective memory so
      they can successfully perform desired activities and roles.

      Cognitive impairment is common among non-demented individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) and
      is a significant source of disability and reduced quality of life. Unfortunately, there are
      no successful interventions to address these impairments. Prospective memory impairment is a
      particularly functionally- and clinically-relevant problem in PD. The investigator's project
      will determine if a targeted intervention strategy improves PD participants' prospective
      memory. The investigator will use a randomized controlled design and a laboratory-based
      assessment of prospective memory to test the effect of the strategy in a controlled
      environment. The investigator will also see if PD participants, with support from an
      occupational therapist (OT), can generalize the strategy to their complex, real-world
      environments and tasks. Our goal is to improve PD patients' everyday prospective memory so
      they can successfully perform desired activities and roles.

    <description>Prospective memory is central to performance in everyday life as it serves to bind together goal-directed actions and enables people to carry out their plans and wishes meaningfully and appropriately. Everyday prospective memory tasks include remembering to run errands, keep appointments, and turn off the stove after using it.</description>
