  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center study of patients with intracranial or peripheral
      aneurysms who are treated by the PC 400 System. The primary objective is to gather post
      market data on the Penumbra Coil 400 (PC 400) System in the acute treatment of intracranial
      and peripheral aneurysms. Approximately 2,000 patients with intracranial or peripheral
      aneurysms treated by the PC 400 System at up to 100 centers will be enrolled. Data for each
      patient are collected up to discharge or 3 days post-procedure, whichever occurs sooner. Long
      term follow-up to one year will be conducted in accordance to the standard of care at each
      participating hospital.

    <description>The Penumbra Embolization Coil is indicated for the endovascular embolization of aneurysms. The Embolization Coil functions to selectively embolize aneurysms by packing a sufficient quantity of soft platinum coils to achieve occlusion. The Coil Implant is constructed of 92% Platinum and 8% Tungsten round wire with a diameter approximately 0.0015in Â± 0.0001in. The maximum primary diameter is 0.022in and the coil implant will have a semi-spherical atraumatic distal tip.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients enrolled in this study must be those treated according to the cleared indication
        for the PC 400 System which is for the endovascular embolization of:

          -  Intracranial aneurysms

          -  Other neurovascular abnormalities such as arteriovenous malformations and
             arteriovenous fistulae

          -  Arterial and venous embolizations in the peripheral vasculature

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in whom endovascular embolization therapies other than Penumbra Coils are
             used will be excluded from this study. However, adjunctive use of balloon and stent
             are acceptable.
