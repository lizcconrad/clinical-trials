    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of temozolomide and pazopanib
      hydrochloride when given together and to see how well they work in treating patients with
      advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNET) that cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Pazopanib
      hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      tumor growth. Giving temozolomide together with pazopanib hydrochloride may be an effective
      treatment for patients with PNET.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of temozolomide and pazopanib (pazopanib
      hydrochloride) combination in patients with advanced PNET. (Phase I) II. Determine the
      overall response rate (ORR). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine safety and toxicity profile of the combination of temozolomide and pazopanib in
      this population. (Phase I) II. Describe the pharmacokinetics of temozolomide alone and in
      combination with pazopanib. (Phase I) III. Observe the ORR. (Phase I) IV. Determine
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), and
      duration of response (DOR). (Phase II) V. Determine the safety and toxicity profile of the
      combination in a larger cohort of patients. (Phase II)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine the relationship between tumor blood flow, as measured by perfusion functional
      computed tomography (f CT), and overall response.

      II. Correlate the expression of tissue methyl-guanine methyl transferase (MGMT) as measured
      by immunohistochemistry (IHC) with ORR and PFS.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7 and 15-21 and pazopanib
      hydrochloride PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
