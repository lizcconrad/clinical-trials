      The primary objectives of this evaluation are: 1) To attempt to refine the current clinical
      understanding of &quot;balance&quot; 2) To determine if patients with quantifiably balanced knee joints
      exhibit improved clinical outcomes versus patient with residual imbalance, as measured by the
      VERASENSE™ Knee System

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Determine whether a difference in inter-compartment loads and soft tissue tension exists
           between the physicians intra-operative feel compared to the quantifiable data measured
           by the VERASENSE™ Knee System

        -  Determine which ligament releases are performed by the surgeon to improve soft tissue
           balance while utilizing the information from the VERASENSE™ Knee System

        -  Evaluate range of motion, pain, physical function, activity level, and patient
           satisfaction between baseline (pre-operative) and post-operative follow-up as well as
           radiographic success and survivorship of the knee implants

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be a candidate for a primary total knee replacement

          -  Subject must be diagnosed with one or more of the following conditions:
             osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, rheumatoid or other inflammatory arthritis
             post-traumatic arthritis

          -  Subject's joint must be anatomically and functionally suited to receive the selected
             implant

          -  Subject is 50 years of age or older (≥ 50 yrs) at the time of consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior total knee arthroplasty

          -  Subject has a mental condition that may interfere with the subject's ability to give
             an informed consent or willingness to fulfill the study requirements (i.e., severe
             mental retardation such that the Subject cannot understand the informed consent
             process, global dementia, prior strokes that interfere with the Subject's cognitive
             abilities, senile dementia, and Alzheimer's Disease)

          -  Ligament insufficiencies, prior surgeries such as ACL or PCL reconstructions,
             posterolateral reconstructions, osteotomies, tibia plateau fractures

          -  Range of Motion less than 90 degrees, flexion contracture of more than 20 degrees
