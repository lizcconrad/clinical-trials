    <textblock>
      This project seeks to collect data on healthcare utilization and expenditure rates in
      Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) patients from across the US, correlate these costs with
      disease activity and outcome measures and determine methods by which to reduce the economic
      impact while improving outcomes.

      SPECIFIC AIMS AND OBJECTIVES

      The specific aims of this registry protocol are:

        -  To create and maintain a secure online database of patients with JIA

        -  To collect data elements related to cost of care in patients with JIA

        -  Compare standard outcome and disease activity measures to health care expenditures in
           JIA

        -  To determine methods by which to reduce costs while improving outcomes and quality of
           care

      The study plans to enroll 300 or more subjects from 3 medical centers in the US over a 24
      month period. Subjects in the study are patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis.

      Enrollment into the protocol will include key demographic and clinical data including,
      medication exposures, disease severity, and function including disease-specific data
      elements; and estimates of health care service utilization and health care expenditures. Data
      will be collected once per subject within the context of a standard of care visit.
