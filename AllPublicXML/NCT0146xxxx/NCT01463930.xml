  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Information provided to patients modifies their expectations with surgery. The effects of
      preoperative audiovisual information on expectations with total knee replacement (TKR) have
      not been investigated. The purposes of this study were to investigate the effectiveness of an
      educational videodisc on the modification of pre-operative patients' expectations with TKR
      and to find a biophysical profile of subjects in whom this videodisc could be most effective.
      It was hypothesized that patients receiving standard information plus additional medical
      information through audiovisual videodiscs would modify their pre-operative expectations more
      than those only receiving the standard information through medical interviews.

    <description>The study measures the patient's expectatives about the improvement of pain, function, and psychological well-being after undergoing total knee replacement. These expectatives are measured through the Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Replacement Expectations Survey (KRES), and a score ranging from 0 to 100 is reported.</description>

    <description>General and specific medical verbal information and ten-minute DVD where the process from admission to the surgical intervention, recovery room, immediate postoperative care, and outpatient care at two, six, and twelve months after surgery was shown. The video included experiences of patients with respect to pain and function and examples of functionality during daily life activities such as stairs, kneeling or squatting. The video also demonstrated the facilities and rehabilitation techniques employed in the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Service.</description>
