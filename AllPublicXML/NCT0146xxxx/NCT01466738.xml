  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and clinical characteristics of a
      quantity of human rhinovirus Type 16 (HRV-16) in healthy volunteers. This source of HRV-16
      will be subsequently used in viral challenge studies with new compounds that are intended to
      treat respiratory diseases.

      This is an open-label study in which all participants know the investigational substance
      being tested. Participants will be inoculated in the nose with HRV-16 and evaluated for the
      occurrence of cold symptoms and other indicators. There will be 3 phases: a screening phase,
      an HRV-16 infection phase, and a follow-up phase. The dose of virus being tested in this
      study has been previously used in other challenge studies. The total length of participation
      in the study will be about 4 weeks. Participant safety will be monitored.
