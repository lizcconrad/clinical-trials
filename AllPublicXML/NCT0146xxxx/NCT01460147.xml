    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate bone mineral density in adult subjects with
      hemophilia versus a comparator population without hemophilia (non-hemophilia age- and
      gender-matched database) by using the following diagnostic means: dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA) scanning, clinical scales, quality of life (QOL) scales and biomarkers.
      In addition to this osteoporosis study, hemophilic arthropathy of the knee with respect to
      loss of knee cartilage will also be explored by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI
      substudy). No investigational product will be dispensed.
