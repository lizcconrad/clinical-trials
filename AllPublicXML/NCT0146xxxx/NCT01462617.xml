    <textblock>
      The study will comprise three Parts:

      Part A will consist of two cohorts of healthy male volunteers to assess the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ascending single doses of nebulised GSK2269557. Blinded
      safety and available PK data will be reviewed before each dose escalation.

      Part B will be one cohort to examine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a
      repeated dose of GSK2269557 given by nebuliser for 7 days in healthy male volunteers. The
      total daily dose will be the same as, or lower than, doses that are well tolerated in Part A.

      Part C will consist of two cohorts of single nebulised doses in healthy male smokers, to
      assess pharmacodynamic endpoints in sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included at the
             Investigator's discretion provided the abnormality will not jeopardize subject safety
             or study integrity .

          -  Male between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed
             consent.

          -  Subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of the

             time of the first dose of study medication until the follow up visit.

          -  Body weight greater than or equal to 55kg and BMI within the range 18-31 kg/m2
             (inclusive).

             wine or 1 (25 ml) measure of spirits.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 90 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).
