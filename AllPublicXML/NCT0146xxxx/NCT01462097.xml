  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is exceedingly common in older adults, in whom it is associated
      with impairment in cognition and physical function. The purpose of this study is to test the
      effects of 12 months of aerobic and resistance exercise training compared to health education
      on cognitive and physical performance in 120 older adults with CKD not requiring dialysis.
      The results of this study will be essential for demonstrating the effectiveness of exercise
      in improving function and ultimately preventing disability in this high-risk population of
      older adults.

    <textblock>
      This is a parallel-group randomized controlled trial comparing 12 months of aerobic and
      resistance exercise training vs. health education (attention control) on neurocognitive and
      physical performance among community-dwelling older adults (age &gt;55) and CKD stage 3b and 4.
      Co-primary outcomes are change in physical performance (including aerobic capacity and
      submaximal walking) and neurocogntivie performance (including executive functions).

      Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and after 6- and 12 months. Exercise training
      will occur thrice weekly at a dedicated research exercise center and will be supervised by
      exercise specialists.

    <description>12 months of treadmill walking and strength training exercise. Exercise is gradually progressed in walking speed and time on the treadmill based on the individual's tolerance, abilities, and safety. For months 1-6 exercise will take place 3 times per week at the research center. For months 6-12 exercise will take place 2 times per week at the center and 1 time per week at home.</description>
