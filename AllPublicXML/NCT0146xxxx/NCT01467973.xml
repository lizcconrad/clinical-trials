      The Gulf Heart Association (GHA) sponsored Gulf acute heart failure registry (Gulf CARE)is a
      multinational , multicentre, prospective, observational, hospital-based registry of patients
      with acute heart failure(AHF) with 3 month and one year follow-up.

      Study Hypothesis: Due to variations in age at presentation, risk factors for heart failure
      particularly high prevalence of rheumatic heart disease in certain Gulf countries, variable
      medical practices and heart failure management setup in the Gulf region, AHF patients in the
      Gulf states are expected to have different presentation and receive different management than
      patients in European countries resulting in different outcome. It is also hypothesized that
      there is considerable gap between heart failure management guidelines and clinical practices
      in the Gulf region.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Gulf Heart Association (GHA) initiated Gulf acute heart failure registry (Gulf CARE)is
      designed to assess epidemiology, clinical data, management and outcomes of AHF in six Gulf
      countries and whether published, professional guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of
      heart failure are being applied appropriately in patients with heart failure. The registry
      will also provide a quantitative estimate as well as qualitative description of the hospital
      disease activity related to heart failure. The information gathered will identify management
      gaps in diagnosis and care of AHF patients that may be addressed by more effective
      implementation of current guidelines or development of AHF guidelines which may be
      appropriate to this region. Findings from this registry may help in knowing the current
      status of heart transplantation in the Middle-East countries as well as identify issues in
      establishing future heart transplant programme including selection of appropriate candidates
      and donors, requirements for pre- and post-transplant support.
