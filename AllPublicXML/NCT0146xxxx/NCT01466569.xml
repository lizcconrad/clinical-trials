      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability profile including the
      dose limiting toxicity of AbGn-7 in patients with chemo-refractory advanced solid tumor of
      epithelial origin, and of AbGn-7 in combination with FOLFOX7 in patients with
      chemo-naive/chemo-refractory recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer.

      Monoclonal antibodies, alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, have been proven
      to be effective treatment for many malignant diseases in human. Antibodies can mediate
      cytotoxicity through complement dependent cytotoxicty (CDC), antibody dependent cell mediated
      cytotoxicity (ADCC) or apoptosis.

      AbGn-7 was identified based on its direct killing (apoptosis-inducing) activities towards
      cancer cells expressing its epitope. In vitro data also demonstrated its ability to elicit
      CDC and ADCC. The in vivo xenograft study of AbGn-7 demonstrated that AbGn-7 alone or in
      combination with chemotherapeutic agents successfully suppressed the growth of gastric,
      pancreatic, and colorectal tumours. The NHP study proved the safety profile of AbGn-7. The
      present Phase 1 clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AbGn-7
      alone in patients with solid tumors of epithelial origin (Phase 1a) and in combination with a
      current chemotherapeutic regimen FOLFOX7 in patients with recurrent, locally advanced or
      metastatic gastric carcinoma (Phase 1b).
