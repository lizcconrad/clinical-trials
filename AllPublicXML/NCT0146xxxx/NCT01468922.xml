  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Pazopanib is an anticancer drug that blocks the growth of new blood vessels in tumors. It
      has been approved to treat renal cell cancer. ARQ 197 is an experimental drug that blocks a
      protein called c-MET, which cancer cells need to grow. Studies suggest that some drugs that
      block blood vessel growth can increase the production of c-MET in tumors, which helps cancer
      cells keep growing. Blocking both blood vessel growth and c-MET with pazopanib and ARQ 197
      may help kill cancer cells faster. This study will use these drugs to treat solid tumors that
      have not responded to earlier treatments.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of pazopanib and ARQ 197 for advanced solid tumors.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced solid tumors that have not responded
      to earlier treatments.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also
           have blood and urine tests, and imaging studies.

        -  The study drugs will be given in 4-week cycles of treatment. Participants will take
           pazopanib once a day and ARQ 197 twice a day by mouth. Some participants will start with
           pazopanib or ARQ 197 alone for the first week. Then they will take both drugs together
           for the rest of the study.

        -  Participants will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies. Optional
           tumor samples may be collected during different treatment cycles.

      Background:

        -  Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signal
           transduction pathways have synergistic effects on promoting angiogenesis and growth
           factor expression. Hypoxia caused by treatment with VEGF inhibitors results in the
           upregulation of c-MET, the receptor for HGF. In a mouse model, combined blockade of
           VEGFR and c-Met significantly prolonged survival compared with inhibition of either
           target alone.

        -  We hypothesize that co-administration of the MET inhibitor ARQ 197 will prevent the
           adaptive response to hypoxia resulting from treatment with the VEGFR inhibitor
           pazopanib, and conversely, that co-administration of pazopanib will prevent the effect
           of increased VEGF and reduced thrombospondin 1 in tumors after treatment with ARQ 197.
           Therefore, the combination of these agents may result in improved antitumor effects.

      Objectives:

        -  Establish the safety and tolerability of the combination of pazopanib with ARQ 197 in
           patients with refractory advanced solid tumors.

        -  Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of pazopanib with ARQ 197
           in patients with refractory advanced solid tumors.

        -  Evaluate changes in MET and phospho-MET following treatment with pazopanib and ARQ 197
           in patients with refractory advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pazopanib and ARQ 197.

        -  Determine and compare levels of total MET, phospho MET, HIF-1 , and
           epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers (e-cadherin, beta catenin) in tumor biopsy
           samples prior to and following administration of the study drugs.

        -  Determine and compare levels of circulating levels of HGF, soluble MET (sMET), VEGF-A,
           and soluble VEGFR2 (sVEGFR2) prior to and following administration of the study drugs.

        -  Determine polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 and correlate these with the observed toxicities,
           and the PK of ARQ 197.

        -  Evaluate antitumor activity of the combination of pazopanib and ARQ 197 in patients with
           refractory advanced solid tumors.

      Eligibility:

      -Adults with advanced, refractory solid tumors. Patients enrolling in the expansion cohorts
      must have advanced sarcoma, gastric cancer, and MET-expressing malignancies, have disease
      amenable to biopsy, and be willing to undergo pre-and post-treatment biopsies.

      Study Design:

        -  ARQ 197 will be administered orally twice daily and pazopanib orally once daily, in
           28-day cycles.

        -  Dose escalation will proceed using the traditional 3+3 design.

        -  Once the MTD is established, an additional cohort will be accrued for pharmacodynamic
           (PD) studies in tumor biopsies (required in the expansion phase). For the first week,
           patients will receive pazopanib alone to compare PK and PD results; combination therapy
           will be given from week 2 onwards.

             to enrollment is less than 140/90 mmHg.

          -  The effects of study drugs on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for at least 2 months after dosing with study
             drugs ceases. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or
             her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test
             prior to entry.

             metastases are eligible to participate.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to pazopanib or ARQ 197.

          -  Eligibility of subjects receiving any medications or substances known to affect or
             with the potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of pazopanib or ARQ 197
             will be determined following review of their cases by the Principal Investigator.
             Efforts should be made to switch subjects with gliomas or brain metastases who are
             taking enzymeinducing anticonvulsant agents to other medications.

          -  Certain medications that act through the CYP450 system are specifically prohibited in
             subjects receiving pazopanib and ARQ 197 and others should be avoided or administered
             with extreme caution.

               -  Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin,
                  atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinivir, retonavir, saquinavir,
                  telithromycin, voriconazole may increase pazopanib concentrations and are
                  prohibited; although, in exceptional circumstances they may be administered in
                  conjunction with lowering the dose of pazopanib by 50% of what would otherwise be
                  administered. Grapefruit juice is also an inhibitor of CYP450 and should not be
                  taken with pazopanib.

               -  Strong inducers of CYP3A4, such as rifampin, may decrease pazopanib
                  concentrations, are strictly prohibited.

               -  Medications which have narrow therapeutic windows and are substrates of CYP3A4,
                  CYP2D6, or CYP2C8 should be avoided and, if necessary, administered with caution.

               -  Inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C19 should be avoided and, if necessary,
                  administered with caution.

          -  Cardiovascular baseline QTc greater than or equal to 480 msec will exclude patients
             from entry on study. Medications that may cause QTc interval prolongation are listed,
             and should be avoided by patients entering on trial. Patients for whom a given
             medication that may cause QTc interval prolongation cannot be discontinued may be
             eligible at the discretion of the study PI. A comprehensive list of agents with the
             potential to cause QTc prolongation can be found at
             http://www.azcert.org/medical-pros/drug-lists/bycategory.cfm. (Note: If subjects must
             take medications with a risk or possible risk of Torsades de Pointes, they should be
             watched carefully for symptoms of Torsades de Pointes, such as syncope. Performing
             additional EKGs on subjects who must take one or more of these medications is not
             required; however, additional investigations, including EKGs, may be performed as per
             the treating physician s judgment.)

                  medications/investigational product including:

          -  any lesion, whether induced by tumor, radiation or other conditions, which makes it
             difficult to swallow capsules or pills

          -  prior surgical procedures affecting absorption including, but not limited to major
             resection of stomach or small bowel

             -Subjects with any condition that may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding
             or gastrointestinal perforation, including

          -  active peptic ulcer disease

          -  known intraluminal metastatic lesions

          -  inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis, Crohn s disease) or other
             gastrointestinal conditions which increase the risk of perforation

          -  history of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation or intraabdominal abscess
             within 28 days prior to beginning study treatment

                  first dose of study drug.

               -  Urine protein/creatinine ratio should be screened by urine analysis. If protein
                  is 1+ or higher, 24-hour urine protein should be obtained and the level should be
                  less than 1g for patient enrollment. Patients with less than 1+ proteinuria are
                  eligible following initial determination by urinalysis within 1 week prior to
                  enrollment and do not need the urinalysis repeated.

                  participate.

               -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of the study
                  drugs on the developing fetus are unknown. Because there is an unknown but
                  potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of
                  the mother with the study drugs, breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to
                  the first dose of study drug and women should refrain from nursing throughout the
                  treatment period and for 14 days following the last dose of study drug.

               -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible
                  because of the potential for PK interactions.

               -  Patients who require use of coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin
                  are excluded. Low molecular weight heparin is permitted for prophylactic use, but
