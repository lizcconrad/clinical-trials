    <textblock>
      This observational study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of triple negative or HR+
      patients with HER2-metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer treated with Avastin
      (bevacizumab) as first line therapy for at least 12 months and without disease progression
      for at least 12 months. Data will be collected retrospectively (from the diagnosis to the
      inclusion in the study) and for 18 months from study start.

    <description>Objective tumor response was assessed using RECIST. PD was defined as the appearance of new lesion(s) or at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum obtained at Screening or during treatment. Participants who withdrew from the study early for insufficient therapeutic response without tumor assessment for PD were also included within the definition of PD. Time to progression was defined as the time from treatment start to PD. Participants who did not experience PD were censored from the last tumor assessment. Time to progression was estimated using Kaplan-Meier and expressed in months. Inclusion (baseline) here was the time after the retrospective phase and at the start of prospective phase.</description>

        <title>Time to Progression</title>
        <description>Objective tumor response was assessed using RECIST. PD was defined as the appearance of new lesion(s) or at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum obtained at Screening or during treatment. Participants who withdrew from the study early for insufficient therapeutic response without tumor assessment for PD were also included within the definition of PD. Time to progression was defined as the time from treatment start to PD. Participants who did not experience PD were censored from the last tumor assessment. Time to progression was estimated using Kaplan-Meier and expressed in months. Inclusion (baseline) here was the time after the retrospective phase and at the start of prospective phase.</description>
