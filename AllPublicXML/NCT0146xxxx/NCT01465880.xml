  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a fit-for-purpose biochemical verification tool that
      can be used to detect concomitant use of a few (less than 5) conventional cigarettes.

      This study will be performed in two parts. The first part, Part A, is a dose titration study
      in healthy smokers with incremental cigarette consumption performed in confinement. The
      second part, Part B, is an observational study on healthy non-smokers in an ambulatory
      setting

      PART A (smokers only)

      A screening visit will be conducted within 4 weeks prior to admission to the investigational
      site. The 8-day confinement period consists of the admission day (Day1), 1 day ad-libitum
      smoking (Day0), 3 days of smoking abstinence (Day1-3), 2-day exposure period smoking 2 and 4
      cigarettes (Day4-5), and the day of discharge (Day6) followed by a 7-day safety follow-up
      period. Urine collection will be performed for each subject from Day0 to Day5 in 4 intervals.

      PART B (non-smokers)

      Screening visit will be conducted within 4 weeks prior to the ambulatory Visit 1 (collection
      of 24-hour urine and spot urine) to the investigational site. The minimum interval between
      the screening and Visit 1 is of 7 days.

          5. Having acceptable health conditions as judged by the Investigator at the screening
             visit based on clinical laboratory parameters (clinical biochemistry, urine analysis
             and standard haematology), spirometry, serology, urine drug screen, vital signs,
             physical examination, ECG, and medical history

             Specific to smokers

             non-mentholated conventional cigarettes (no brand restrictions) with a maximum tar
             yield of 10 mg (ISO method, as labelled on the cigarette package) smoking at least for
             the last 3 consecutive years. The smoking status will be verified at screening based
