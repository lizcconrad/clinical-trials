      A Randomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      The patients after 1-3 years NAs treatment and having achieved HBeAg loss and HBV DNA
      &lt;200IU/ml will be switched to Pegasys for 48 or 96 weeks (with a 12 weeks period of overlap
      with the NA for safety reasons). The subjects will be randomized into 2 groups:

      Group 1 : 48-week standard treatment by Peginterferon alfa 2a 180µg/week Group 2 : 96-week
      prolonged treatment by Peginterferon alfa 2a 180µg/week.

      All the patients will be followed up for 48 weeks after discontinuation of the study
      medication.

      Note: NAs will be stratified LAM, ETV and ADV, with the ratio 1:1:1.
