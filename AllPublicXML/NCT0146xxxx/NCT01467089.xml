      The purpose of this project is to determine the equivalency of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)
      and tardive dyskinesia (TD) examinations conducted via live two-way video versus live
      examinations completed in-person

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and tardive dyskinesia (TD) are one of the most frequent and
      troublesome adverse events when taking antipsychotic agents. The investigators aim in this
      study to determine if the investigators can conduct examinations for EPS and TD remotely
      using live two-way video. It is potentially beneficial for patients, especially those who are
      located far away from psychiatrists if they could be seen by trained clinicians and assessed
      for EPS and TD via two-way video in the future. Participants will be asked to have a medical
      assessment which consists of simple questions and some examination of their movements via
      two-way video and in person. The investigators will compare the results of video examinations
      with the results of live examinations.

    <description>Inclusion Criteria: Inpatients and outpatients aged 18-75 years old who have been taking antipsychotics for longer than 6 months in their life time, and that have been compliant for the past week. Patients will be referred by their treating doctors if they have some evidence of movement disorder based on the physician's clinical judgment. We will also include 25% of the sample without any evidence of movement disorder.
Exclusion Criteria: Patients who have medical conditions which make it difficult to perform a physical examination. Patients who are clinically too ill to consent and/or unable to cooperate with the examination procedures.</description>
