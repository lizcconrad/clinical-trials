  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Water imbalance and consecutive electrolyte disturbances are common in the postoperative
      course of neurosurgical patients after pituitary surgery. Diabetes insipidus (DI) may
      complicate the postoperative course in as many as 30% of patients. Early and accurate
      diagnosis of water and electrolyte disturbances postoperatively is important for an adequate
      fluid and drug administration. However, identifying the causes is challenging/ ambiguous in
      clinical practice. Levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) might contribute to a straightforward
      diagnosis, though, its measurement is cumbersome. ADH is derived from a larger precursor
      peptide along with copeptin, which is a more stable peptide directly mirroring the production
      of ADH. Copeptin can be assayed readily in plasma. Aim: To investigate whether copeptin can
      accurately diagnose postoperative disturbances of water homeostasis (i.e. Diabetes insipidus
      and SIADH) in a cohort of patients undergoing intracranial tumor surgery.
