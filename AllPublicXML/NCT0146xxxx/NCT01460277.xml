      The purpose of this current prospective study is to assess and compare the effects of a
      hydrotherapy exercise programme against a conventional land-based exercise programme in
      individuals with hemiplegia. Both exercise interventions aim at improving posture, balance
      and weight-bearing capability. Patients were randomized to the hydrotherapy or conventional
      therapy groups according to balance function (Berg Balance Scale score) and age (age&lt;59 and
      &gt;60 years). The physical examination consisted of (1) a lower-limb motor function recovery of
      the paretic side score according to the 6-stage Brunnstrom scale, (2) the hemiplegic limb
      strength measured by the Motricity Index, (3) the strength of ankle dorsiflexors and
      plantarflexors by manual muscle testing, (4) the spasticity of the ankle score by Modified
      Ashworth Scale, (5) the trunk function through the Trunk Control Test, (6) the postural
      control assessed by Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients and (7) the functional
      status measured with the Functional Independence Measure. Postural sway was evaluated with a
      pressure platform by using the variables of center of pressure (COP) displacements in the
      mediolateral (ML) and anteroposterior (AP) directions. The results will be collected and
      evaluated using statistical programme SPSS.

    <description>The conventional exercise intervention used no water-based exercises but land-based exercises. The exercise program consisted of 5 minutes of warm-up, 10 minutes of lower-extremity stretching exercises, 10 minutes of lower-extremity strengthening exercises, 20 minutes balance and gait training (walking, side stepping), 5 minutes of a light cool down, and 10 minutes of gentle stretching out of the water.</description>
