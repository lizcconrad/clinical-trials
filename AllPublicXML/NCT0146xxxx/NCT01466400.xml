  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that there will be no difference in the breath hydrogen excretion between
      the 2 different prebiotic formulas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is looking at how a formula with one of two different prebiotic blends may
      alter the hydrogen level in an infant's exhalations in the hours after feeding. Higher levels
      for a longer period may signal higher levels of short chain fatty acids and bifidobacteria,
      both beneficial for gastrointestinal health. The higher levels may be the result of the
      formula undergoing a slower digestion, producing more fermentation.

      The study will compare a formula, similar to one currently on the market, with added
      prebiotics using a special breathing mask designed to be held to the infant's mouth and nose
      long enough to capture the infant's exhaled breath which will then be tested for Hydrogen
      content.
