      The purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy of Amniotic fluid Lamellar Body
      Counting for Evaluating of Fetal Lung Maturity.

    <textblock>
      Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is one of important cause of mortality in neonates. This
      study was designed to evaluate the amniotic fluid lamellar body counting for predicting fetal
      lung maturity.

    <description>Diagnosing of immaturity is based on the following criteria: 1-Physical examinations such as: nasal flaring, retraction, grunting, and tachypnea. 2-Oxygen needing more than 24 hours with three chest x-ray findings.</description>

    <description>fluid samples were obtained by amniocentesis during normal delivery or before rupturing the membrane in cesarean. The samples were sent to the lab as soon as possible and after centrifuging with 500 round per minute for 3 minutes, they were placed in the cell counter machine (STKR coulter).</description>
