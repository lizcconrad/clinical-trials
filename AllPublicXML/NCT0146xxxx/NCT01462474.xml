    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Famitinib is a tyrosin-inhibitor agent targeting at c-Kit, VEGFR2, PDGFR, VEGFR3,
      Flt1 and Flt3. Phase I study of mono famitinib has shown that the drug's toxicity is
      manageable.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the safety and tolerance of concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy with famitinib for patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
