      The purpose of this study was to assess efficacy and tolerability of travoprost 0.004% vs.
      bimatoprost 0.01% during the after office hour period (4 pm to 8 pm) in subjects with
      open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension after 6 weeks of treatment.

    <description>IOP was measured at three after office hour evaluation time points (4 pm, 6 pm, and 8 pm) for an overall mean. The three timepoints correspond to 20, 22, and 24 hours post dose. Efficacy analysis was performed for one eye only, i.e., the designated study eye. Per-protocol dataset was pre-specified for this non-inferiority analysis.</description>

        <title>Overall Mean Intraocular Pressure (IOP)</title>
        <description>IOP was measured at three after office hour evaluation time points (4 pm, 6 pm, and 8 pm) for an overall mean. The three timepoints correspond to 20, 22, and 24 hours post dose. Efficacy analysis was performed for one eye only, i.e., the designated study eye. Per-protocol dataset was pre-specified for this non-inferiority analysis.</description>
