  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this secondary data analysis is to determine whether pain due to a combination
      of both cardiac and non cardiac sources operates as a mediator of behavior change, an area
      that has not been previously evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a secondary data analysis of an existing dataset generated from The Healthy Behavior
      Trial, an NHLBI-funded randomized controlled trial that enrolled 660 post-coronary
      angioplasty patients between October 1999 and March 2001. This study employed a behavioral
      intervention to motivate PCI patients to adopt health behaviors in order to reduce major
      cardiac and neurologic morbidity and mortality. Patients in the experimental arm were told
      their estimated biologic age (calculated from the health risk assessment) and risk factors
      were presented in terms of &quot;biologic age reduction&quot; that could be achieved if a change was
      made in each health behavior area. Those in the control arm were provided with risk factors
      (also obtained from the health risk assessment) and told that changing each health behavior
      could &quot;increase your lifespan.&quot;

      Specific Aims:

      Utilizing 12 month longitudinal data for patients with cardiovascular disease who have
      undergone coronary angioplasty we will:

      Specific aim 1: Determine if pain is a mediator of health behavior change over 12 months.

      Specific aim 2: Assess behavior change patterns over 12 months, stratifying for degree of
      pain, depression and/or stress.

      Specific aim 3: Evaluate the effect of pain on quality of life (physical, social,
      role-physical, role-emotional, vitality, mental health, bodily pain and general health
      domains), combined major cardiac and neurologic morbidity/mortality and hospitalizations over
      12 months.

    <description>Health behavior will be examined in five areas: overall physical activity, strength training, aerobic activity, weight loss, and smoking cessation. Successful health behavior change will be defined as &quot;action&quot; (engaging in the behavior &lt; six months) or &quot;maintenance&quot; (engaging in the behavior â‰¥ six months to five years), according to the Transtheoretical Model. We will use self-reported data.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Within-patient change from baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 health survey will be the primary measure of quality of life. Each of the eight individual domain scores will be evaluated (physical, social, role-physical, role-emotional, vitality, mental health, bodily pain and general health) and the within-patient change from baseline to 12 months will be calculated. The physical and mental component summary measures will also be calculated, as will the within-patient change from baseline to 12 months for the component scores. We will assess these measures as both continuous and dichotomous measures.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  all patients in the database who had participated in the Healthy Behavior Trial. The
             Healthy Behavior Trial was a randomized controlled trial of a psychoeducational
             intervention designed to motivate multi-behavior change (changing 2 or more
             cardiovascular risk factors) in post-coronary angioplasty patients over the course of
             24 months.
