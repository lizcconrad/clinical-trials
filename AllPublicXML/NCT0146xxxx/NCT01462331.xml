  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to re-confirm the already established health effects and dose
      tolerance of Isomalto-oligosaccharide or IMO, which is a general health/functional food
      ingredient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Isomalto-oligosaccharide (IMO) is a mixture of natural resistant carbohydrates consisting of
      short-chains of glucose molecules. IMO is made by enzymatic conversion of starch and uses as
      a health food ingredient with health benefits of a low calorie sweetener, prebiotic and
      dietary fiber. IMO have been ingested by humans for last many centuries as it is naturally
      found in rice miso, sake and soy sauce. IMO already got approval from FDA (GRAS) and from
      Health Canada.

      There are number of published studies (in humans and animals) regarding the health benefits
      of IMO as an effective prebiotic, and its role in improving overall human gastric health.
      Studies also showed that IMO have found to be most tolerable with least adverse effects
      compared to other short-chain resistant oligosaccharides. Current clinical studies are
      conducted to verify the above given health benefits in BioNeutra's manufactured
      VitaSugar/VitaFiber-IMO products which including quantitative analysis of Bifidobacteria
      spp., Lactic acid bacteria group and clostridium spp. The production of short-chain
      fatty-acids (SCFA) and effect on blood glucose level are also analyzed in addition to the
      dose tolerance in term of lower and upper permissible dosage with resultant adverse effects
      if any are also observed.
