  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, the incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is approximately 3.5
      cases per 100,000 persons per year. Approximately 13,000 people were diagnosed with AML in
      2009 and 9,000 died of the disease, making AML the 6th leading cause of cancer death. Over
      the past three decades, AML survival has improved for younger patients with 5-year survival
      rates of greater than 60% for adults under the age of 45 years likely owing to improvements
      in induction and consolidation chemotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      (HSCT) and supportive care. Post-remission therapy with high-dose cytarabine-based regimens
      after cytarabine and anthracycline based induction has improved disease free and overall
      survival at the expense of increased treatment related mortality limiting its use in many
      older patients and those with significant comorbidities. Although allogeneic HSCT remains the
      standard of care for patients with poor risk AML or relapsed disease, advanced age,
      comorbidities and donor availability preclude this option for a large number of patients
      making improvement in the tolerability and efficacy of induction therapy an important goal.

      Over half of newly diagnosed AML patients are over 65 years of age with a third over the age
      of 75 years. Unlike younger patients, the prognosis of elderly patients with AML is still
      dismal with five-year survival rates of less than 10% for patients over the age of 65 years.
      For the last thirty years, induction therapy with standard dose cytarabine with an
      anthracycline has remained the standard of care for elderly patients with AML. In the
      elderly, complete response rates to induction chemotherapy are lower than younger patients at
      40 to 60% with median survival approaching 12 months. New strategies using novel agents to
      increase the sensitivity of malignant myeloid precursors to standard induction chemotherapy
      may improve complete response and relapse rates without increasing treatment related
      mortality.

      Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)

      The myelodysplastic syndromes are neoplasms of hematopoietic progenitor cells characterized
      by ineffective hematopoiesis and increased risk of transformation to AML. Clinically,
      patients develop symptoms related to with cytopenias, typically progressive anemia with or
      without thrombocytopenia or neutropenia that is unrelated to a defined reversible cause such
      as nutritional deficiency. Histologically, MDS is suggested by the presence of dysplasia in
      &gt;10% of cells in one or more myeloid lineage on bone marrow evaluation. Characteristic
      cytogenetic abnormalities also aid in making the diagnosis of MDS.

      The incidence of MDS in the U.S. has been estimated at 3.4 cases per 100,000 people per year
      with the incidence increasing 10 fold in people over the age of 70. Risk factors for the
      development of MDS include advanced age, male sex, and prior exposure to DNA-damaging
      chemotherapy or radiation therapy, typically for treatment of other malignancies. As a group,
      patients with advanced MDS and those with MDS progressing to AML have treatment resistant
      disease with low response rates and short durations of response after induction therapy.

      The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) for primary MDS assigns four MDS risk
      categories (Low, INT-1, INT-2, High) based on bone marrow myeloblast percentage, specific
      cytogenetic abnormalities, and number of cytopenias to estimate survival and risk of
      transformation to AML. Low and INT-1 risk MDS patients have a median survival of 5.7 and 3.3
      years, respectively, in the absence of therapy. Advanced MDS patients in IPSS risk groups
      INT-2 and High fare much less well with median survival of 1.1 and 0.4 years, respectively.
      INT-2 and High-risk MDS is also associated with a higher risk of transformation to AML. In
      addition, hematopoietic precursors from patients with advanced MDS more frequently express
      the multi-drug resistance (MDR1) gene product P-glycoprotein, possibly explaining the low
      response rates and short duration of responses in this group after conventional induction
      therapies. A Phase III trial of the P-glycoprotein inhibitor valspodar in combination with
      mitoxantrone, etoposide and cytarabine in relapsed or refractory AML and high-risk MDS failed
      to show improved outcomes with P-glycoprotein inhibition. As such, novel therapeutic
      strategies to overcome the intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy seen in advanced MDS are
      needed to improve induction chemotherapy as primary therapy and as a bridge to allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplant.

      Given the relatively long survival and low rate of progression to AML seen in patients with
      IPSS Low and INT-1 risk disease, allogeneic transplant is typically reserved for those who
      fail conservative management with erythropoiesis stimulating agents, G-CSF, hypomethylating
      agents such as azacitidine or decitabine, lenalidomide, or immune suppression therapy. For
      patients 60 years of age and younger with advanced MDS (INT-2, High), allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplant is the most appropriate therapy as it prolongs life expectancy.
      Due to advanced age and significant co-morbidities, allogeneic hematopoietic transplant is
      not an appropriate treatment modality for a large number of patients with advanced MDS. In
      addition, stem cell donors are not available for all patients. For patients with advanced
      MDS, hypomethylating agents or enrollment on clinical trials are both appropriate treatment
      options given the poor outcomes in this patient population. A phase III open-label,
      randomized trial of azacitidine versus conventional care regimens in advanced MDS showed
      superior overall survival for patients treated with azacitidine (24.5 versus 15.0 months, HR
      0.58; 95% CI 0.43-0.77). Although decitabine has activity in MDS, it has not been shown to
      prolong survival in advanced MDS to date. In a phase III study comparing decitabine to
      supportive care, decitabine showed a superior response rate and delayed the time to the
      development of AML.

      Anthracyclines in AML therapy

      Anthracycline chemotherapy agents (daunorubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone) are highly active
      in AML and are an essential part initial induction therapy in those fit for intensive
      chemotherapy. The optimal dose of anthracycline to maximize response and survival while
      preserving safety is still being determined. For daunorubicin, a Phase III randomized study
      of younger patients ages 17 to 60 years with AML demonstrated that standard dose cytarabine
      100 mg/m2 daily for 7 days in combination with daunorubicin 90 mg/m2 daily for 3 days was
      superior to daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 daily for 3 days with improved complete remission rates
      (70.6% vs. 57.3%, p&lt;0.001) and median overall survival (23.7 vs. 15.7 months, p=0.003).
      Toxicity was not significantly different between the two groups. A similar Phase III study in
      AML patients 60 years of age or older compared daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 to 90 mg/m2 for 3 days
      in combination with cytarabine 200 mg/m2 daily for 7 days. Although the complete remission
      rate was higher in patients receiving the 90 mg/m2 daunorubicin dose (64% vs 54%, p=0.002),
      no difference was seen in survival. Notably, patients aged 60-65 years receiving higher
      daunorubicin dose had superior complete remission rates, event-free survival and overall
      survival. To date, no head-to-head comparisons of daunorubicin at 60 mg/m2 versus 90 mg/m2
      have been published.

      Histone deacetylases and their inhibitors in AML and MDS

      HDAC inhibitors have shown activity in Phase I monotherapy trials for AML and advanced MDS. A
      Phase I trial of panobinostat as monotherapy in primarily AML yielded transient hematologic
      responses with reduction in peripheral blood blast counts in 8 of 11 patients consistent with
      the documented in vitro activity of the drug. Major toxicities included nausea, diarrhea,
      hypokalemia, anorexia, thrombocytopenia and reversible QTcF prolongation. Similar responses
      with rare complete responses have also been seen with the HDAC inhibitors romidepsin and
      MGCD0103 in AML and MDS.

      Synergy between HDAC inhibitors and anthracyclines

      As monotherapy, HDAC inhibitors are unlikely to impact the treatment of AML and advanced MDS
      although there is a strong biologic rationale for use of these agents in combination
      therapies. By inhibiting deacetylation of histones, HDAC inhibitors generate a more open
      chromatin structure more susceptible to the DNA damaging effects of anthracycline
      chemotherapeutic agents, in some instances when administered 48 hours after the HDAC
      inhibitor. In vitro, HDAC inhibitors potentiate the cytotoxic effects of anthracyclines in
      leukemia cell lines. Panobinostat, specifically, acts synergistically with the anthracycline
      doxorubicin to induce DNA damage, increase histone acetylation and activate programmed cell
      death in AML cell lines and primary AML cells. The administration of the anthracycline
      daunorubicin with panobinostat is predicted to be synergistic in vivo and may improve
      complete response and relapse rates for AML.

      Proper sequencing of HDAC inhibitors with anthracyclines will likely be important to the
      success of these combinations. Pretreatment with HDAC inhibitors prior to anthracycline
      exposure may provide synergistic effects as well by increasing nuclear DNA exposure to
      anthracycline. In cultured MCF-7 breast cancer cells, treatment with the HDAC inhibitor
      vorinostat leads to chromatin decondensation which is maximal after 48 hours of HDAC
      inhibitor treatment. In this system, co-administration of vorinostat and epirubicin did not
      lead to increased apoptosis whereas 48 hour pre-incubation with vorinostat led to synergistic
      increases in apoptosis associated with increased nuclear accumulation of epirubicin and
      increased DNA damage. In AML, maximal epigenetic effects appear to occur at about 48 hours
      after HDAC inhibitor exposure as well.

      Anticancer activity of DAC inhibitors

      Alterations in chromosome structure play critical roles in the control of gene transcription.
      These epigenetic alterations include modification of histones and others proteins by
      acetylation and/or phosphorylation. Normally, these modifications are balanced finely and are
      highly reversible in normal tissues, but they may be imbalanced and heritable in tumor cells.
      DAC inhibitors increase histone acetylation, thereby modulating the expression of a subset of
      genes in a coordinated fashion. Several tumors suppressor genes associated with the malignant
      phenotype are repressed by epigenetic mechanisms in sporadic cancers. Thus therapy with DAC
      inhibitors may alter tumor phenotype and inhibit growth in such tumors.

      Multiple hallmarks of cancer are regulated by acetylation/deacetylation:

        -  DAC inhibition targets both histone and nonhistone proteins. Targeting the acetylation
           status of nonhistone, tumor-associated proteins that mediate proliferation may be the
           underlying antitumor mechanism of DAC inhibitors.

        -  Nonhistone proteins regulated by acetylation include α-tubulin, p53, HIF-1α, and HSP90.
           These proteins are substrates of DACs.

        -  The ability of a single agent to target multiple molecular features of tumor cells may
           result in good efficacy against a range of different tumor types.

        -  HSP90 is involved in protein stability and degradation; the inhibition of HSP90 affects
           protein turnover in diseases such as multiple myeloma and B-cell malignancies.

        -  Acetylated HIF-1α is degraded and can no longer act as a tumor growth factor. Class II
           DAC inhibitors target histone deacetylase (HDAC or DAC) 6, resulting in increased
           acetylation of HIF-1α and decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thereby
           inhibiting angiogenesis.

        -  Both acetylation and ubiquitylation often occur on the same lysine residue, but these
           processes cannot occur simultaneously. Acetylation allows for increased stability, and
           ubiquitylation leads to protein degradation. Therefore, DACs decrease the half-life of a
           protein by exposing the lysine residue for ubiquitylation.

      Panobinostat (LBH589)

      Panobinostat (LBH589) is a deacetylase inhibitor (DACi) belonging to a structurally novel
      cinnamic hydroxamic acid class of compounds. It is a potent class I/II pan-DAC inhibitor
      (pan-DACi) that has shown anti-tumor activity in pre-clinical models and cancer patients.
      Deacetylases (DAC) target lysine groups on chromatin and transcription factors and various
      non-histone proteins such as p53, tubulin, HSP90 and Rb. Panobinostat is formulated as an
      oral capsule and a solution for intravenous (i.v.) injection. Both the oral and i.v.
      formulations are currently being investigated in ongoing Phase I and Phase II studies in
      advanced solid tumors and hematological malignancies.

      Inhibition of DAC provides a novel approach for cancer treatment. Histones are part of the
      core proteins of nucleosomes, and acetylation and deacetylation of these proteins play a role
      in the regulation of gene expression. Highly charged deacetylated histones bind tightly to
      the phosphate backbone of DNA, inhibiting transcription, presumably, by limiting access of
      transcription factors and RNA polymerases to DNA. Acetylation neutralizes the charge of
      histones and generates a more open DNA conformation. This conformation allows transcription
      factors and associated transcription apparatus access to the DNA, promoting expression of the
      corresponding genes. The opposing activities of two groups of enzymes, histone
      acetyltransferase (HAT) and DAC control the amount of acetylation. In normal cells a balance
      exists between HAT and DAC activity that leads to cell specific patterns of gene expression.
      Perturbation of the balance produces changes in gene expression.

      Several lines of evidence suggest that aberrant recruitment of DAC and the resulting
      modification of chromatin structure may play a role in changing the gene expression seen in
      transformed cells. For example, silencing of tumor suppressor genes at the level of chromatin
      is common in human tumors and DAC complexes have been shown to be crucial to the activity of
      the AML-specific fusion proteins PLZF-RAR-α, PML-RAR-α, and AML1/ETO. DAC inhibitors (DACi)
      have been shown to induce differentiation, cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in cultured tumor
      cells, and to inhibit the growth of tumors in animal models. In addition, DACi have been
      shown to induce expression of p21, a key mediator of cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and
      cellular differentiation.

      Tumor growth inhibition and apoptosis in response to DACi treatment may also be mediated
      through changes in acetylation of non-histone proteins (e.g., HSP90, p53, HIF-1α, α-tubulin).
      For example, the chaperone protein HSP90 has been shown to be acetylated in cells treated
      with DACi. Acetylation of HSP90 inhibits its ability to bind newly synthesized client
      proteins, thus preventing proper client protein folding and function. In the absence of HSP90
      function, misfolded proteins are targeted for degradation in the proteasome. Many proteins
      that require HSP90 association are critical to cancer cell growth, including ErbB1, ErbB2,
      AKT, Raf, KDR, and BCR-ABL. Acetylation of HSP90 in cells treated with DACi inhibits the
      chaperone function of HSP90, leading to degradation of the client proteins and eventual cell
      death.

      The potential clinical utility of the use of DACi in cancer therapy was first suggested by
      the activity of the DACi, sodium phenylbutyrate, against acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).
      An adolescent female patient with relapsed APL, who no longer responded to all trans-retinoic
      acid (ATRA) alone, achieved a complete clinical remission after treatment with a combination
      of ATRA and the DACi sodium phenylbutyrate.
