  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir (DTG, GSK1349572) is an integrase inhibitor that is currently in Phase 3
      clinical development for the treatment of HIV infection. As HIV-infected subjects may also be
      receiving methadone for opioid dependence, an evaluation of the potential interaction between
      DTG and methadone is warranted. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether
      concomitant administration of DTG can affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of methadone. As a
      secondary endpoint, the PK of DTG will be compared to historical data. This study will be
      open-label with subjects receiving DTG and stable doses of methadone. The study will be
      conducted at one center in Canada in adult male and female subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open label methadone- doltegravir (DTG, GSK1349572) drug interaction study
      consist of 2 periods. Subjects must be opiate-dependent and are HIV sero-negative and are on
      stable dose of methadone 14 days prior to pre-screening. After meeting all eligible
      criterions, subjects will remain on their individual methadone dose for 3 days in period 1.
      In period 2, subjects will continue on their individual stable dose of methadone and will
      receive 50 mg DTG every 12 hours for 5 days. Pharmacokinetics will be collected on Day 3 of
      period 1 and Day 5 of period 2. Safety measurements will be routine chemistry, haematology
      and urinalysis. Pharmacodynamic parameters for pupillometry and opioid symptom questionnaire
      will be collected at the same timepoints as for the pharmacokinetics. Subjects will be
      discharged after the last PK sample has been collected. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14
      days after the last dose of study drug. This study will be conducted at one centre in Canada.

             methods listed in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the
             product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize
