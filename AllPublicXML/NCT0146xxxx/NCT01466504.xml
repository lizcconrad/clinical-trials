  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin toxicity is a frequently observed side effect in the era of &quot;molecularly targeted
      therapies&quot;. Skin toxicity following administration of protein kinase inhibitors such as
      sorafenib, regorafenib, lapatinib, sunitinib, and others can be debilitating to the patient,
      resulting in dose reduction and discontinuation of treatment. The mechanisms of skin toxicity
      induced by targeted chemotherapy, such as sorafenib or regorafenib, are poorly understood.
      Further research is warranted to better understand the pathophysiology of drug-related skin
      toxicity in this setting and develop correction strategies. This study tests the hypothesis
      that sorafenib and regorafenib interfere with p63 expression and keratinocyte differentiation
      and skin remodeling.

      Eligible study participants will be evaluated clinically for evidence of skin toxicity during
      their visits to the outpatient Oncology clinics. Study participants will undergo skin
      biopsies before sorafenib or regorafenib treatment is initiated and once rash develops or 12
      weeks into treatment with sorafenib or regorafenib. Skin biopsies will be performed in
      Oncology clinics by the study investigators and clinic support staff.

      Study participants will undergo both skin biopsies regardless of whether they develop a rash.
      In patients who develop a rash the most representative lesion will be biopsied. A normal
      appearing area of skin will be biopsied in participants who do not develop a rash.

      skin biopsies will be performed using a 4mm biopsy punch. Participants will undero 2 skin
      biopsies - one prior to starting sorafenib or regorafenib, the other once rash develops. If a
      rash does not develop within 84 days a biopsy of normal skin will be done.
