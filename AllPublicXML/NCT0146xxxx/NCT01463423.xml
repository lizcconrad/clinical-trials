    <textblock>
      A research study using a method of treating lung cancer with focused radiation called
      Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of individualizing the dose of radiation used to treat lung tumors with SABR
      based on tumor-specific factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy has emerged as an important and effective new treatment
      modality for lung tumors, but optimal dose regimens have not been fully established.
      Significant toxicity can be observed with the most commonly used dose regimens, implying that
      developing treatment regimens that optimize treatment based on tumor-specific factors could
      be of clinical benefit. This study will test a risk-adapted approach to SABR delivery aimed
      at maximizing tumor control while minimizing toxicity.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Limited primary or metastatic lung tumors with no evidence of uncontrolled
             extrathoracic metastases

          -  Up to 4 lesions may be included, with none larger than 5 cm if there are more than
             one, or up to 7 cm if there is a single tumor

          -  Both peripheral and central tumors are accepted for this trial.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years old

          -  Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this
             trial.

          -  Note: Patients may be enrolled more than once (e.g. for a new tumor)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of uncontrolled extrathoracic metastases

          -  Contraindication to receiving radiotherapy.

          -  Contraindication to receiving radiotherapy

          -  Age &lt; 18 years old. Children are excluded because lung malignancies rarely occur in
             this age group. Furthermore, treatment requires a great deal of patient cooperation
             including the ability to lie still for several hours in an isolated room.

          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded; as well as women of child-bearing
             potential who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of birth control
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) to avoid pregnancy for the
             duration of the study. Male subjects must also agree to use effective contraception
             for the same period as above. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.
