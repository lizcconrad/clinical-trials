  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot two- center study to determine if aztreonam lysine for inhalation AZLI
      can be safely and self-administered in lung transplant recipients with newly diagnosed
      bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, grade 1 (BOS) and obtain pilot data regarding its effect
      on lung function in order to appropriately design and power a larger multicenter randomized
      study.

      The hypothesis is that AZLI is a safe and effective treatment for declining lung function in
      lung transplant recipients with early stage BOS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung transplantation is increasingly employed as a therapy for patients with advanced lung
      disease including cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or emphysema. Despite
      significant short-term improvements in life quality and measures of lung function after lung
      transplantation, long-term outcomes are disappointing primarily due to the development of a
      condition of airway fibrosis known as bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). It is hypothesized that
      aztreonam lysine for inhalation (AZLI) is a safe and effective treatment for declining lung
      function in lung transplant recipients with early stage BOS. In order to test the hypothesis,
      the investigators seek to establish the safety of AZLI in a two-center cohort of 30 lung
      transplant recipients with BOS treated intermittently for 5 consecutive study months and
      determine if this treatment leads to improvement or stabilization of lung function. The
      intervention will involve open label treatment with AZLI, in addition to usual transplant
      care, administered for 3 intermittent courses, 28 days each, over a 5 month study period..
      Bronchoscopy, pulmonary function testing, and laboratory testing will be performed on a
      regular basis during study enrollment consistent with each center's usual standard clinical
      care. Patients will have a baseline screening visit, one month and five month study visit..
      The study will take two years to complete from the start of funding. After a start-up period
      of 2 months, a total of 30 patients will be enrolled over 12 months across the two centers
      (15 patients each at DUMC and UCLA). Each enrolled patient will complete 5 months of
      intermittent therapy, and complete baseline, month 1 and month 5 visits. Over the next 6
      months the study database will be finalized, statistical analysis will for primary and
      secondary outcomes will be performed leading to the generation of either a study abstract or
      manuscript.

    <time_frame>Baseline, month 1</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a commonly used, well validated measure of global health related quality of life. The survey was self-administered. There are 8 subscales which combine to form a Physical Component Score (PCS) and a Mental Component Score (MCS). We analyzed within subject changes to the PCS and MCS at month 1 vs. 0. MCS and PCS scores are relative to a US population mean of 50. The higher the score, the better one perceives his quality of life. A change in score of 4 points or more is considered clinically meaningful. Scores represent Median Absolute Difference. The SF-36 was completed 14-35 days after the start of months 1 AZLI courses and compared to study month 0 (baseline/prior to 1st dose).</description>

    <description>Microbiology data was collected when performed for SOC purposes on BAL or sputum samples. Baseline and 1 month value represents the culture final report value (0,1+, 2+, 3+, 4+) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

    <description>The study team is measuring the change in neutrophils AFTER treatment. They will compare a SOC BAL taken after AZLI with the BAL taken within 90 days of AZLI initiation (pre or baseline measure). The post AZLI BAL measurement time range is 15 days after first course of AZLI up to last day of the 3rd and final course of AZLI (over a period of 5 consecutive months).</description>

        <description>Microbiology data was collected when performed for SOC purposes on BAL or sputum samples. Baseline and 1 month value represents the culture final report value (0,1+, 2+, 3+, 4+) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A value of zero represents no Pseudomonas aeruginosa sputum or bronchoalveolar fluid. A value of 4 represents high amounts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa sputum or bronchoalveolar fluid.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, month 1</time_frame>
        <population>The statistical analysis was unable to be performed due to insufficient number of paired observations. Only 9 of 30 enrolled had baseline microbiology data, 3 were cultured positive for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. Only 1 of the 3 had a subsequent SOC BAL sample collected. Therefore, only raw data is entered for the one subject.</population>

          <title>Among Patients Colonized With Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, Change in Infection Burden as Measured by the Culture Final Report (0,1+, 2+, 3+, 4+) of in Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Sputum or Bronchoalveolar Fluid.</title>
          <description>Microbiology data was collected when performed for SOC purposes on BAL or sputum samples. Baseline and 1 month value represents the culture final report value (0,1+, 2+, 3+, 4+) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A value of zero represents no Pseudomonas aeruginosa sputum or bronchoalveolar fluid. A value of 4 represents high amounts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa sputum or bronchoalveolar fluid.</description>
          <population>The statistical analysis was unable to be performed due to insufficient number of paired observations. Only 9 of 30 enrolled had baseline microbiology data, 3 were cultured positive for Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. Only 1 of the 3 had a subsequent SOC BAL sample collected. Therefore, only raw data is entered for the one subject.</population>

        <title>Change in Global Health Related Quality of Life, Measured by Serially Self-administered Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36) at Baseline (Prior to AZLI First Dose) and During AZLI Therapy at Month 1</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is a commonly used, well validated measure of global health related quality of life. The survey was self-administered. There are 8 subscales which combine to form a Physical Component Score (PCS) and a Mental Component Score (MCS). We analyzed within subject changes to the PCS and MCS at month 1 vs. 0. MCS and PCS scores are relative to a US population mean of 50. The higher the score, the better one perceives his quality of life. A change in score of 4 points or more is considered clinically meaningful. Scores represent Median Absolute Difference. The SF-36 was completed 14-35 days after the start of months 1 AZLI courses and compared to study month 0 (baseline/prior to 1st dose).</description>

        <title>Change in Respiratory-specific Health Related Quality of Life, Measured by Serially Self Administered St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) at Baseline (Prior to AZLI First Dose) and During AZLI Therapy at Month 5.</title>
        <description>The SRGQ measures activities, symptoms, and impacts of living with a pulmonary condition. We analyzed the change to the within-subject Total score month 5 vs 0. Total score ranges from 0-100 with a smaller value representing better respiratory-specific QOL. A change in score of 4 points or more is considered clinically meaningful. Scores represent Median Absolute Difference in theTotal Score. The SGRQ was completed 14-35 days after the start of month 5 AZLI courses and compared to study month 0 (baseline/prior to 1st dose).</description>
