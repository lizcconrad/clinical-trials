      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that untrained subjects who have diabetes or
      pre-diabetes can operate the investigational Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS) and
      obtain valid glucose results.

    <description>Untrained subjects with diabetes self-test fingerstick blood using the Apollo Evolution Investigational Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS). BGMS results are compared with capillary plasma BG results obtained with a Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) Analyzer. YSI Analyzer BG results are used to calculate the number of BGMS results within +/- 15mg/dL (&lt;75mg/dL YSI capillary plasma) or +/- 20% (&gt;=75mg/dL YSI capillary plasma). Site staff tested in parallel after subjects.</description>

          -  A condition, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the subject at risk or
             influence the conduct of the study or interpretation of the results. The reason for
             exclusion will be documented by the professional staff.

        <title>Percent of Venous Blood Glucose Results Within +/- 15mg/dL (&lt;75mg/dL) or Within +/- 20% (&gt;=75mg/dL) of Laboratory Glucose Method</title>
        <description>Study staff tested subject venous blood using an investigational Blood Glucose Monitoring System (BGMS). Venous BGMS results are compared with venous plasma BG results obtained with a Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) Analyzer. YSI venous plasma results are used to calculate the number of BGMS results within +/- 15mg/dL (&lt;75mg/dL YSI venous plasma) or +/- 20% (&gt;=75mg/dL YSI venous plasma).</description>
        <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
        <population>609 venous BG results(203 subjects x 3 test strip lots) were available. Three subjects did not have successful venipunctures so no blood obtained. BGMS testing was not performed with one subject's blood sample. Study staff tested each subject venous blood sample using 3 test strip lots.</population>

Apollo Evolution Investigational BG Monitoring System : Untrained subjects with diabetes perform self Blood Glucose (BG) tests with capillary fingerstick blood and AST of the palm using the Apollo Evolution meter and an investigational sensor. Study staff test subject venous blood. All BG results are compared to a reference laboratory glucose method. Untrained subjects complete basic tasks using the User Guide and provide feedback.</description>
