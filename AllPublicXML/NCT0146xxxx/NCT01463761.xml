  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sports training aims to enhance an athlete's performance (overcompensation). To do that, the
      athlete must go through periods of fatigue and lower performance (overreaching). When the
      training plan is balanced, this fatigue is short and reversible.If the training load is too
      heavy or if recuperation periods are too short, it can lead to persistence fatigue that may
      only be reversible in the long term. This state of fatigue is part of the broader clinical
      picture of overtraining, which includes stark changes in performance as well as mood and
      sleep disorders. Many prediction and characterization methods based on biological markers
      have been evaluated, but they have not been put into practice in sports training due to
      obstacles such as reliability, interindividual variability and high costs. This study aims to
      evaluate a new approach based on the variability of an individual's heart rate (RR
      variability), which is a way of measuring autonomic nervous system (ASN) activity. It is
      non-invasive, low-cost, and has already proven useful in athlete health monitoring.

      The investigators propose to describe the variation of these ANS regulation factors over a
      full year, in a population of high-level athletes, in order to measure changes in regulation
      which may be predictive of potential fatigue and intolerance to physical training, if such a
      syndrome came to be observed among the study group.

    <description>The questionnaire is self-administered. It includes two parts. The first part consists of several questions regarding sleep during the previous night. The second part aims to evaluate the physical exertion load during the previous day's training session(s). Participants will fill one questionnaire/day for a whole week. Each questionnaire period must coincide with a training period (interseason, volume, intensity, or competition.)</description>
