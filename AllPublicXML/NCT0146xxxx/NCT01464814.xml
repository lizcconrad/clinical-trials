  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of the probiotic KE-99 Lactobacillus
      casei when administered with omega-3 fish oil on probiotic viability, fecal make-up and
      gastrointestinal (GI) health in healthy adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled, crossover clinical trial to determine the effects
      of KE-99 Lactobacillus casei with omega-3 fish oil, a probiotic purported to promote
      beneficial effects in gastrointestinal (GI) health. The study will last approximately three
      weeks with subjects attending a screening visit and four follow-up visits.

      The study will involve subjects taking the probiotic product (KE-99 + fish oil)and placebo,
      each for seven days (as per sponsor guidance), in random order, with a seven day washout in
      between (as per sponsor guidance). Fecal analyses will be done at the beginning and end of
      each seven day supplementation period so that the number of live KE-99 in feces can be
      determined with higher numbers being positive (indicates more live KE-99 survived digestion).

      Although the study population will be comprised of generally healthy adults that do not have
      GI disorders or symptoms, the sponsor hypothesizes that there may be beneficial effects in GI
      health with the KE-99 + fish oil supplementation. A six item questionnaire will be used to
      assess changes in GI health (e.g. abdominal pain, bloating and gas) with lower incidence
      indicating positive effects with regard to GI health.
