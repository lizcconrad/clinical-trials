      The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in posture, flexibility, muscle
      strength, functional capacity, heart rate(HR), peripheral oxygen saturation, systolic blood
      pressure, diastolic blood pressure and intensity of pain in chronic low back pain underwent
      to Isostretching and GPR.

      It was selected 40 patients, from 40 to 59 years old, with chronic low back pain from CESUMAR
      Physiotherapy Clinic-Schoo. These were evaluated before and after treatment regarding posture
      by SAPO computer program; flexibility for lumbar Schober testing, sit and reach; muscle
      strength by dynamometry for trunk extensors and the maximum repetition test in a minute to
      abdominal and trunk extensors; functional capacity by Rolland-Morris Questionnaire; pain by
      visual analog scale; heart rate(HR) by polar frequencymetric; peripheral oxygen saturation by
      Finger Pulse Oximeter; and systolic and diastolic blood pressure with a Sphygmomanometer. The
      sample was divided in two groups (1-GPR with 11 patients, 2-Isostretching with 10 patients).
      All patients were accompanied by an individual treatment program composed by 12 sessions of
      45 minutes, twice a week. It was considered statistically significant p values &lt;0.05 obtained
      from the Student's t test.

    <description>It was measured systolic blood pressure (SBP) with a Sphygmomanometer at start and for every 15 minutes in 10 sessions therapy. Blood pressure measurement was obtained by arterial occlusion by inflation of the cuff, correlating to the auscultation of the heartbeat with the values recorded in the column of mercury. The sounds perceived during the blood pressure measurement procedure are called Korotkoff sounds, and classified into five phases, with phase 1 (first sound) corresponding to the value of systolic blood pressure (SBP).</description>

    <description>All of patients were accompanied by an individual treatment program composed by 12 sessions of 45 minutes, twice a week. The Isostretching method includes therapeutic different postures, lying, sitting or standing, and the positions were selected according to the postural changes of each patient, identified in the assessment. The Isostretching protocol involves nine positions held for a period of nine breaths, and every three cycles, the patient should rest for a period. The physical therapist used verbal commands to emphasize pursed lip breathing, self growth, curvatures correction and isometric of abdominal, paravertebral, quadriceps and gluteal muscles with the aim of optimizing the stretching and discouraging compensatory movements.</description>

    <description>All patients were accompanied by an individual treatment program composed by 12 sessions of 45 minutes, twice a week, involving a series of active gentle movements and postures aimed at realigning joints, stretching shortened muscles and enhancing the contraction of antagonist muscles, thus avoiding postural asymmetry. The positions were selected according to the postural changes of each patient, identified in the assessment and these therapeutic postures imply an active involvement of the patient. The protocol includes three therapeutic postures, lying, sitting or standing, to be held for 15 minutes each. The physical therapist used verbal commands and manual contact to maintain the alignment and make the necessary postural corrections, with the aim of discouraging compensatory movements.</description>
