      The purpose of this study is to analyze and identify pre-, intra-, and post- operative
      parameters that predict Steal-Syndrome with distal malperfusion after Arterio-Venous Fistulas
      (AVF) as primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints are pre-, intra-, and post- operative
      parameters that predict patency and fistula maturation.

      This is a prospective study where the research team will acquire data from the patients after
      they have signed the informed consent form. Data will be collected before, during and after
      the Arterio-Venous Fistula(AVF)placement, and during follow-up at predefined time
      intervals:Pre-Operative, Intra-operative, Post-operative, 5-10 days, 4-6 Weeks, 6 Months, and
      1 year. These parameters include Digital Brachial Index (DBI) (assessed by Doppler derived
      brachial artery blood pressure/ photoplethysmographically derived finger blood pressure),
      flow and pulsatility measurements (derived by duplex ultrasound and pulse volume recording).
      Assessment of flow and pulsatility will be performed in the artery proximal and distal to the
      AVF, as well as in the venous outflow. In addition, Demographic parameters and patient
      comorbidities will be acquired and procedure specific parameters (e.g. location of the
      fistula) will be documented. During each follow up, clinical evaluation for Steal-Syndrome
      will be conducted. Steal-Syndrome was defined according to the guidelines of the Society of
      Vascular Surgery (SVS): Asymptomatic (pulse deficits, doppler signal attenuation, and distal
      flow reversal) Mild Ischemia: slight coldness and numbness that occurs only during dialysis,
      may be self-limited, and may resosolve without treatment, and Severe Ischemia: Can be
      permanent and may be associated with constant pain, severe numbness, digital cyanosis or
      gangrene, finger contracture, or amputation of a digit hand or forearm. The necessity for and
      type of re-intervention at the AVF will be documented. Acquisition of data will in no way
      change the standard of care used in these patients / operations.

      Data analysis will be performed after enrolment of 100, 250 and 500 patients.
