  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that problem based learning (PBL) in patient education positively affects
      self-care agency of lifestyle changes after an event of coronary heart disease (CHD). The
      investigators therefore aim to determine whether long-term follow-up in primary health care
      in patient education involving PBL affects self-care behaviour in terms of patients' beliefs,
      self-efficacy and empowerment to make lifestyle changes. The general aim is to evaluate if
      PBL in patient education after CHD affects long-term self-care in relation to present
      lifestyle goals. Another aim of the study is to perform an economic assessment of long term
      effects of life style changes reached by using PBL after en event of CHD.

    <textblock>
      Even though the convincing evidence of that self-care such as regular exercise and/or stop
      smoking alters the course of events after an event of coronary heart disease (CHD), risk
      factors remain. Outcomes can improve if core components of secondary prevention programmes
      are structurally pedagogically applied using adult learning principles e.g. problem based
      learning (PBL). Until now, most education programs for patients with CHD are not based on
      such principles and primary health care lacks structure in the follow-up of self-care goals
      of the patients. All patients will receive conventional care from their general practitioner
      and other care providers. They will randomly be allocated to an intervention that consists of
      a problem based patient education program (1 year) in PHC by trained district nurses
      (tutors). Patients in the control group will not attend a PBL group but receive mailed
      patient information during the 1 year.

    <description>The experiment group will enter a PBL patient education that is characterised by autonomous learning. The patients work together in small groups. Focus is on lifestyle changes. Starting point of learning is the patient's individual life style goals. Thirteen meetings during 1 year for 2 hours; weekly for the first month, every second week next two months and the last meetings 16, 20 and 26, 39 and 52 weeks after start. The programme shall be completed 1 year after start. The patients work with starting triggers such as pictures, texts, or concrete materials. Nurses work as tutors (after completion of a tutorial education) during the meetings using a problem based model to support patients formulate issues and goals to work with during the year. When the patients do not solve question the possibility of inviting e.g. a GP, dietician, pharmacist or physiotherapist is possible.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients of all ages with CHD verified by MI and/or Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
             (PCI) and/or coronary artery by-pass surgery (CABG) within 12 months before planned
             start of the intervention.

             cardiac medication not substantially changed during the last month, completed heart
             school in hospital care (if applicable), listed at one of five specific primary health
             care centres agreed to join the project at time of inclusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Planned CABG or other causes demanding continued cardiologist care; e.g. on-going
             contact with heart failure clinic due to drug titration or investigations e.g.
             myocardial scintigraphy to detect ischemia before a new PCI

          -  Life expectancy ≤ 1 year, documented psychiatric disease that render difficulties to
             cooperate with other people or obvious abuse of alcohol or narcotics.
