      This study will investigate the relationships between subjective cognitive complaints,
      neurocognitive deficits, and work productivity in participants with Major Depressive Disorder
      (MDD), before and after 8 weeks of treatment with an antidepressant medication. Our
      hypothesis is that, in working participants with MDD of at least moderate severity,
      neurocognitive deficits will predict poorer work functioning and productivity.
