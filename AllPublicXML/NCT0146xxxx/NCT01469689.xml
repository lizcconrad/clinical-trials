  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Web based cognitive behavioural therapy (webCBT) for depression is recommended by NICE but
      analysis of the geographic distribution of one webCBT site showed 15-fold variation in use
      across Britain. Such variation is unlikely to be from differences in prevalence. Raising
      awareness of webCBT could benefit many people with depression but it is not clear how
      direct-to-patient promotion online or via the media, compares with GP centred methods. This
      pilot cluster randomised controlled trial will explore the use of online methods to raise
      awareness in preparation for subsequent study comparing different approaches.

      In a pilot cluster randomised trial the investigators will explore the feasibility and likely
      impact of online methods of raising awareness of webCBT, assessing how many people with
      depression respond to geographically restricted Google and local website advertisements. The
      investigators will explore costs of recruitment and define and document the best online
      methods that might subsequently be used in a definitive trial comparing online with mass
      media and GP centred methods for raising awareness. The investigators will compare
      intervention with control areas to estimate impact on registration levels and compare rate of
      completion of webCBT of these 'additional' registrants with other registrants.
      Recommendations will be made for a subsequent trial comparing online with other methods.
