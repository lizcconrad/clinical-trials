  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The surgical management of high-risk endometrial cancer often involves an extensive operation
      to remove lymph nodes as sites of possible cancer spread.

      18F-FDG PET/CT imaging is increasingly being used to identify sites of cancer spread and
      recently groups have used an intra-operative gamma probe to better localize metastatic
      disease. In this pilot study, patients with newly diagnosed early stage, high-risk
      endometrial cancer undergoing primary surgery will have a pre-operative PET scan and
      intra-operative localization of metastatic lymph nodes with the use of a gamma probe. A
      complete lymphadenectomy will follow and ability to detect positive lymph nodes of both PET
      scan and the intra-operative probe will be calculated.

      This study addresses the feasibility of an FDG detection gamma probe in addition to a
      pre-operative PET/CT for lymphatic mapping in women with clinical early stage high risk
      endometrial cancer. The study will also evaluate the role of identifying metastatic lymph
      nodes intraoperatively that would otherwise be clinically negative.
