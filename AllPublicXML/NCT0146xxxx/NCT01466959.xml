  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An alternative to systemic heparin anticoagulation for HD is citrate dialysate (CD). CD
      contains a small amount of citric acid rather than acetic acid as the acidifying agent. The
      use of citrasate may lead to lower heparin requirements in hemodialysis. This is a
      randomized, double blinded, two-period crossover trial in HD patients to compare the effect
      of citrasate dialysis (CD) and usual acetic-acid based dialysate (AD) on heparin dose.

    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a randomized, double-blind, two-period crossover trial in
      chronic HD patients to compare the effect of citrasate dialysate (CD) and usual acetic-acid
      based dialysate (AD) on the cumulative intradialytic heparin dose. There is a four week run
      in phase followed by two weeks of intervention AD or CD followed by the remaining AD or CD
      intervention.

      The primary outcome is change in intradialytic heparin dose achieved with citrasate compared
      with acetate dialysate. Secondary outcomes are the effect of CD compared with AD on systemic
      anticoagulation, bleeding time after HD, metabolic parameters, dialysis adequacy,
      inflammation, hemodynamic stability, and intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of the
      dialyzer clotting score.
