        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy 18 to 55 years old male or female subjects (Healthy is defined as absence of
             clinically relevant abnormalities identified by detailed medical history, complete
             physical examination, including blood pressure and heart rate measurements, 12-lead
             ECG and clinical laboratory tests).

          -  Volunteers' BMI - Body Mass Index must range from 18.5 to 24.9 (Dietary Guidelines for
             Americans), however, it can range to 15% of the upper limit (18.5 to 28.63) and total
             body weight &gt;50kg.

          -  Signed and dated Informed Consent Form by the subject or legally acceptable
             representative. If subject and/or legally acceptable representative is unable to read
             the Informed Consent Form, an impartial witness may sign it.

          -  Subjects willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory
             tests and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of hematological, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal,
             cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological, or allergic clinically significant
             disease (including drug allergies, except for seasonal allergies, asymptomatic,
             untreated at the time of dosing).

          -  Any condition that may possibly affect the drug absorption (e.g. gastrectomy).

          -  Volunteer presenting a drug abuse history [patients making use of marijuana and
             hashish will be excluded if they used these drugs in less than three months before the
             medical appointment, and volunteers who have used drugs such as cocaine, phencyclidine
             (PCP), crack and heroin, will be excluded if they used them in less than one year
             before the medical appointment].

          -  A positive drug test in urine (Methamphetamine, Opiate, Morphine, Marijuana, Cannabis,
             Amphetamine, Cocaine, Benzodiazepine, and Benzoylecgonine) or a positive test for
             alcohol before admission during periods 1 and 2.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for women or 14
             drinks/week for men (1 serving = 150 mL of wine or 360 mL of beer or 45 mL of
             concentrated liquor) within 6 months from selection.

          -  If volunteer have participated in any experimental study or have taken any
             experimental drug within 6 months prior to baseline (ANVISA: RDC Resolution No. 34,
             June 3, 2008).

          -  Blood Pressure at screenning on a supine position ≥140 mm Hg (sistolic) or ≥90 mm Hg
             (diastolic), ina single measure (confirmed by a single measure repeated, if necessary)
             after at least 5 minutes of rest.

          -  12-lead ECG demonstrating QTc&gt; 450 msec or QRS interval&gt;120msec at screening visit. If
             the QTc exceeds 450 msec or QRS interval exceeds 120ms, the ECG should be repeated
             twice and the average of the three QTc values should be used to determine patient's
             eligibility.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women, women of childbearing potential who are unwilling or
             unable to use a non-hormonal acceptable contraception method, as described in this
             protocol, from at least 14 days before the first dose of study medication.

          -  Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or
             5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of study medication.
             Phytotherapic medicine and phytotherapic supplements should be discontinued 28 days
             before the first dose of study medication. With one exception,
             acetaminophen/paracetamol can be used at doses of 1 g/day. The limited use of
             nonprescription medications not considered as affecting the patient's safety or the
             general study results may be allowed on a case by case basis after sponsor's approval.

          -  Blood donation of approximately 500 mL within 3 months before dosage.

          -  Known hypersensitivityto Ibuprofen or chemically related compounds;

          -  - Sensitivity History to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to comply with the Lifestyle Guidelines described in this
             protocol.

          -  Other psychiatric or severe acute or clinically chronic condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with participation in the study or
             administration of investigational product, or which may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the opinion of the investigator, would make
             the patient inadequate to enter this study.

          -  A positive beta HCG test in women.

          -  Volunteers that are members of the Clinical Research Center or their relatives or
