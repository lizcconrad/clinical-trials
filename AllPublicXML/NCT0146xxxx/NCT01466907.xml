  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to examine to what extent a one year population of stroke patients
      at a university hospital had well regulated risk factors and health problems one year after
      stroke, and if a structured nurse-led previous follow-up in the intervention group including
      referrals if needed could influence health outcome and risk factors one year after stroke.

      The follow-up protocol was categorized into Risk factors, Patients' self-reports, and Other
      health problems. Referral was sent to a physician if medical interventions were needed
      regarding risk factors measured above the limits as stated in the follow-up protocol in
      accordance with guidelines,and/or if any self-reported health problems were stated by the
      patients, or had been detected by the Specialist Nurse. Primary outcome was comparison
      between the intervention group and control group at one year after stroke regarding
      proportion of regulated risk factors, and self-reports on health outcome. Results of the two
      follow-ups of the intervention group were also compared.
