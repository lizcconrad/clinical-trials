    <textblock>
      Two different treatments were given to large angle horizontal strabismus (eso and exotropia)
      adult patients who agree to participate of the study. Inform consents were required for
      participants. Group 1 (12 patients) received conventional recess-resect surgery plus
      intraoperative injection of botulinum toxin A (5U). Group 2 (11 patients) received only
      conventional recess-resect surgery. The patients were randomly located in one of the groups.
      The angles of horizontal deviation were compared between the groups before and six months
      after treatment.

    <textblock>
      Patients underwent recess/resection surgery on the non-fixating eye using conventional
      technique under local anesthesia. The extent of surgery was determined based on our usual
      amounts. Before re-attaching the recessed muscle to the sclera, 5 units of botulinum toxin in
      0.1 ml of hyaline solution were, or 0.1 ml of hyaline solution alone were was injected into
      the posterior muscle belly by the surgeon who was unaware of the contents of each syringe.
