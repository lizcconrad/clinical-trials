      Operations in the uterus are currently possible using a hysteroscope. One serious though rare
      complication of such procedures is the development of intra-uterine adhesions. There
      currently are no methods to prevent this. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety of
      using hyaluronic gel after hysteroscopic surgery.

      Operations in the uterus are currently possible using a hysteroscopic approach. Intrauterine
      procedures include; polypectomy, myomectomy, removal of lost IUD,removal of a septum and
      more. One serious though rare complication of operative hysteroscopy is the development of
      intra-uterine adhesions. Such adhesions, also known as asherman's syndrome, can cause serious
      consequences such as infertility and miscarriage. The hypothesis is that the removal of the
      endometrium and the exposure of ra uterine wall to each other can cause attachment and
      adhesions. the treatment is to mechanically break the adhesion. recurrence is however common.
      There currently are no methods to prevent adhesions following curettage or hysteroscopy. The
      aim of this study is to evaluate the safety of using hyaluronic gel after hysteroscopic
      surgery. At a later research, the efficacy of barrier gel will be measures.
