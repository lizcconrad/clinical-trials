      To test the hypothesis that leukocyte filtering during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) might
      reduce the inflammatory response and protect the lungs against the acute injury
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The extension of the systemic inflammatory response observed after
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in cardiac surgery is associated to postoperative pulmonary
      dysfunction degree. The leukocyte depletion during CPB can modify that response. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate the effects of leukocyte filtering on the inflammatory response
      and lung function in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.

      METHODS: After approval by the institutional ethical committee, a prospective randomized
      study was performed to compare nine patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting
      (CABG) using leukocyte filtration in the arterial line (LG-6, Pall Biomedical Products) and
      eleven others submitted to standard CPB. Chest CT, oxygenation analysis and a complete
      leucocyte count were performed before surgery. After intravenous anesthesia induction,
      patients were mechanically ventilated with tidal volume of 8 mL.kg-1, with FiO2 0.6, and PEEP
      of 5 cm H2O, except during CPB. Haemodynamic data, PaO2/FiO2, shunt fraction, interleukins,
      elastase and myeloperoxidase were evaluated before and after CPB, at the end of surgery, 6,
      12 and 24 hours after surgery. Chest CT was repeated on the first postoperative day. Data
      were analyzed using two-factor ANOVA for repeated measures.
