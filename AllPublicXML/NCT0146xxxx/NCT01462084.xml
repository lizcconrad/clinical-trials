      Prospective, randomized, blinded, cross-over study assessing the effectiveness of adaptive
      servo-ventilation (ASV) in treating patients who have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
      complicated by central sleep apnea (CSA) due to the chronic use of opioid medications
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial seeks to determine the efficacy and patient comfort of ASV and bi-level positive
      airway pressure (PAP) modes for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), complicated
      by CSA secondary to opioid use. Subjects will be randomized to one of two groups, utilizing a
      cross-over design to evaluate the two modes with the subject as their own control.

      Subjects will be asked to undergo two PSG studies; one with ASV titration and one with
      bi-level treatment, using the current pressure prescription. The study comprises two visits.
      Subjects will be asked to complete patient satisfaction questionnaires following their PSG
      studies. It is anticipated that total subject participation will be no longer than one month.

    <description>Adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) is a form of positive airway pressure (PAP) that is delivered based on the needs of the individual. ASV adjusts to the breathing events the individual is experiencing and provides enough PAP to resolve the breathing event. This is a crossover study, so all patients enter both treatment groups.</description>

          <title>Adaptive Servo-Ventilation (ASV)</title>
          <description>Adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) is a form of positive airway pressure (PAP) that is delivered based on the needs of the individual. ASV adjusts to the breathing events the individual is experiencing and provides enough PAP to resolve the breathing event. This is a crossover study, so all patients enter both treatment groups.</description>

          <title>Bi-Level PAP</title>
          <description>Bi-level pressure delivers two pressures, IPAP and EPAP. Both pressures are fixed and do not adjust based on the individuals breathing events. This is a crossover study, so all patients enter both treatment groups.</description>
