    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. Evaluate the validity of using abnormal characteristics of the pneumothorax line, as
           evaluated from chest X-ray film, as the operative indications for video-assisted
           thoracic surgery (VATS) on primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP).

        2. Through a randomized double blind controlled trial on patients whose PSP was caused by
           lung bullae, evaluate the effectiveness of pleurodesis in terms of the rate of
           recurrence of PSP and the trauma of the operation on patients.

        3. Based on the findings, establish selection standards for the timing of surgery to treat
           PSP by VATS and establish technical specifications for performing operations on
           different types of lung bullae. The goal is to improve the diagnosis and treatment of
           PSP so as to reduce the recurrence rate of pneumothorax, reduce the trauma of operation,
           shorten hospital stays and postoperative recovery time, and provide better services for
           returning to everyday life and improving the quality of life for patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. patients in whom obvious bullous forms are seen in PSP pneumothorax lines, or whose
             pneumothorax lines are rough and interrupted with or without thoracentesis, thoracic
             close drainage

          2. patients whose lung compression exceeded 30% for the first incidence of pneumothorax

          3. patients between the ages of 14 and 40, with normal vital signs (body temperature,
             breathing, blood pressure, pulse) and normal results on routine examination (routine
             blood test, liver and kidney functions)

          4. no language barrier, such as surdimutism, aphasia

          5. patients who voluntarily joined the group and signed the informed consent after
