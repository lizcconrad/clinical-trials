  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether partial irradiation of the liver
      and liver cell transplantation can reduce the need for dietary and medical management or
      could possibly eliminate the need for a special diet and medications to treat this disease
      for patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) by normalizing phenylalanine levels in the body.
      Phenylalanine (Phe) is a substance needed in the body that can only be obtained from the
      foods people eat. People with PKU cannot get rid of Phe in their body. Large amounts of Phe
      can cause problems, such as deterioration of mental function. At the present time, liver cell
      transplants are experimental and have been done in only a limited number of human subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human phenylketonuria (PKU) results from phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency, and
      represents one of the most common and extensively studied single-gene Mendelian disorders in
      humans. Unfortunately, optimum clinical outcome demands lifelong dietary restriction through
      adherence to an unpalatable and expensive artificial diet. Challenges in maintaining
      traditional therapy lead to increasing phenylalanine (Phe) levels in patients as they
      approach adulthood with an incumbent severe burden of psychosocial and intellectual
      difficulties. The recent introduction of the new medication Sapropterin for treatment of PKU
      has improved Phe control and dietary tolerance in some patients, but at enormous cost to
      patients and insurers for the FDA designated orphan product. Thus, there is an unmet need for
      novel therapies to correct PKU. PAH is almost exclusively expressed in the liver in humans.
      The main objective of the current proposal is to determine the feasibility of hepatocyte
      transplantation to correct the biochemical (and ultimately, clinical) features of PKU.

    <description>Subjects will undergo CT-based simulation and treatment planning for radiation therapy. Once a suitable hepatocyte donor is found and the cell count and viability is acceptable for transplantation, patients will receive Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) in one fraction(10 Gy)to the right lobe of the liver (but not exceeding 50% of the liver mass).</description>

    <intervention_name>Hepatocyte Transplant</intervention_name>
    <description>Within a maximum of two days after hepatic irradiation,the right or main portal vein will be occluded transiently (60-90 min)to provide a compensatory mitotic signal to donor hepatocytes. Directly following this transient occlusion of the portal vein, donor hepatocytes will be transplanted into the irradiated portion of the recipient's liver. If at 6 months we see an improvement in PHE tolerance but not normalization (i.e. PHE levels from 6 mg/dl to 10 mg/dl) on an unrestricted PHE diet, we will recommend re-transplantation with a goal of complete correction of PKU. Subjects will be re-evaluated every 6 months for re-transplantation.</description>

    <intervention_name>Liver Evaluation</intervention_name>
    <description>Prior to the hepatocyte transplant subjects will undergo a liver evaluation which is standard for all patients who have whole organ transplants at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC. The evaluation includes immunosuppression medication education, psychological assessment, bloodwork to assess blood count, blood and tissue type, blood chemistries, immune system function and certain infectious diseases and abdominal ultrasound to assess blood flow to the blood vessels in the liver.</description>

    <intervention_name>Psychological Assessment</intervention_name>
    <description>Subjects may undergo a psychological assessment at least 6 months post-transplant which will include a semi-structure open ended interview as well as the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II assessment and Beck Depression Inventory. If subjects undergo these assessments, they will be compared to those obtained pre-transplant to determine whether an improvement is associated with the transplant procedure. In addition, if subjects are experiencing depression, they will be referred for further care.</description>
