  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multicenter study of the Gender Solutions Natural Knee Flex System when
      used in primary total knee arthroplasty. The purpose of the study is to obtain short-, Mid-,
      and long-term clinical outcomes and implant survivorship data for the Gender Solutions
      Natural Knee Flex System.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Survival and outcome data on the Gender Solutions Natural Knee Flex System will be done by an
      analysis of standard scoring system, radiographs and adverse event records. Survivorship will
      be evaluated by monitoring the frequency and incidence of adverse events, serious adverse
      events, adverse device effects, serious adverse device effects, and unanticipated adverse
      device effects. Outcomes will be measured by comparing the overall pain and function
      performances (based on the Knee Society Scoring System), survivorship, subject quality of
      life and radiographic parameters of study subjects receiving the Gender Solutions Natural
      Knee Flex System.

          -  Patient qualifies for a total knee arthroplasty based on physical exam and medical
             history including at least one of the following: osteoarthritis, inflammatory
             arthritis, post-traumatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or valgus, varus, or
             flexion deformities;

          -  Patient is willing and able to provide written consent;

          -  Patient is willing and able to cooperate in the required post-operative therapy;

          -  Patient is willing and able to complete scheduled follow-up evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has previous history of infection in the affected joint and/or a local or
             systemic infection that could affect the prosthetic joint;

          -  Insufficient bone stock on femoral or tibial surfaces;

          -  Skeletal immaturity

          -  Neuropathic arthropathy

          -  Stable, painless arthrodesis in a satisfactory functional position;

          -  Severe instability secondary to the absence of collateral ligament integrity;

          -  Patient has rheumatoid arthritis and an ulcer of the skin or a history of recurrent
             breakdown of the skin because of their risk of postoperative infection is greater;
