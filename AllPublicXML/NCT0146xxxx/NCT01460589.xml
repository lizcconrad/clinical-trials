      This study sets up the final study end point and three detailed goals as the following.

      The main objective of study: This trial is done to assess the safety and benefit of early
      adjuvant chemotherapy from 10 to 14 days after surgery compared with conventional
      commencement after 2weeks for treatment of patients with colon cancer.

      Detailed goal of study:

      The primary endpoint: This study is designed to assess whether early commencement of adjuvant
      chemotherapy improves the 3-year disease-free survival, overall survival and recurrence rate.

      The secondary endpoint: This study aims to compare short-term cumulative complications
      between early and conventional commencement of adjuvant chemotherapy after laparoscopic
      resection of colon cancer. This study will also assess the quality of life and side effects
      of chemotherapy.
