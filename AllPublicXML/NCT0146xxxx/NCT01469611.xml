      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  determine the maximally-tolerated dose (MTD) and/or maximum-feasible dose (MFD) of
           JX-594 administered by biweekly intravenous (IV) infusion.

        -  determine the safety of JX-594(TK- GM-CSF+ Wyeth strain vaccinia) administered by
           biweekly IV infusion.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, dose-escalation trial in patients with advanced colorectal
      carcinoma (CRC) that have failed both oxaliplatin based and irinotecan based prior
      chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease. Patients will receive treatment at one of three
      dose levels in a sequential dose-escalating design.

      Three patients will be treated at each dose level unless a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is
      observed. Enrollment will proceed to the next dose level if 0 of 3 patients experiences a
      DLT; if one of the first 3 patients experiences a DLT, additional patients will be enrolled
      until a second patient experiences a DLT (which defines the toxic dose) or until six total
      patients have been treated at that dose level, whichever comes first. If a second DLT is not
      experienced within that cohort, dose escalation may continue.

      Patients will be enrolled a minimum of 14 days after the first treatment of the immediately
      preceding patient for the first patient in any cohort or all remaining patients in a cohort
      with DLT.

      If 2 DLTs are observed within a cohort, enrollment into the cohort will cease and the dose
      level immediately preceding that dose will be determined to be the MTD. Regulatory
      Authorities and the IRB will be notified as required if any patient dies within 28 days of
      product administration due to a serious and unexpected ADR that is determined by the
      Investigator to be possibly or probably related to JX-594.

      Once the MTD and/or MFD is defined, an additional 3-6 patients may be enrolled at that dose
      level. Note: once the MTD and/or MFD is defined, treatment of additional patients at this
      dose level will no longer require inter-patient delays of 14 days.
