      The purpose of this study is to examine the short term efficacy of the MRH system as well as
      determine if operating room time is decreased using this simple, two-tray system.

    <textblock>
      The main goal of Revision Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) is to restore the patient's hip
      function by repairing the patient's kinematics. However, a revision hip surgery represents a
      challenge for even the most experienced surgeon. Loss of bone stock, joint stability,
      infection, fracture, trochanteric non-union, and difficulty in implant or cement removal are
      all potential issues that a surgeon must consider for each presenting patient. These
      challenges require hip implant systems to provide an intraoperative flexibility that is not
      normally required for primary THA. The Lima Modular Revision Hip System uses modular stem and
      neck components to allow for surgical versatility when selecting leg length, offset and
      version. The purpose of this study is to examine the short term safety and efficacy of the
      Modular Revision Hip System (MHRS) using radiologic success and Harris Hip Scores as
      endpoints. The study will take place at multiple sites across the United States and will
      include only subjects who meet the indications for use criteria for the Modular Revision Hip
      system and who are candidates for revision hip replacement surgery. Target enrollment will be
      200 subjects with up to 25 subjects at 15 sites across the United States.

    <description>The Harris Hip Score was developed to evaluate hip function in patients with traumatic disorders of the hip, but it is now commonly used to follow patients after surgery for a degenerative disorder of the hip (Harris et al., 1969). The score is broken down into 4 areas (pain, function, deformity and range of motion), with the best possible score being 100. 44 points are allotted for pain, 47 for mobility/function, 5 for range of motion and 4 for absence of deformity. Grading for the Harris Hip Score: Excellent (90-100), Good (80-90), Fair (70-79) and Poor (&lt;70).</description>
