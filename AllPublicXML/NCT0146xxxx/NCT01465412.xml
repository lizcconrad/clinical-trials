  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of preladenant after
      administration of a single 5 mg oral dose of preladenant in participants with hepatic
      impairment and healthy volunteers. Part 1 of this study compares healthy volunteers with
      participants with mild hepatic impairment. Part 2 compares healthy volunteers with
      participants with moderate hepatic impairment. Healthy volunteers in each part of this study
      are to be matched with participants with hepatic impairment by race, age, gender, and body
      mass index (BMI). The primary hypotheses are that in participants with mild or moderate HI,
      the area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to time of the last
      quantifiable concentration (AUC0-t) of preladenant is similar to that observed in matched
      healthy volunteers, so that the mean ratio of hepatic impaired/healthy is contained within
      the interval [0.50, 2.00].
