  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of an impact evaluation (IE) of the Scaling up Handwashing with Soap
      (HWWS) and Total Sanitation and Sanitation Marketing (TSSM) projects of the Water and
      Sanitation Program (WSP) of the World Bank. The objective of this study is to estimate the
      causal impact of the HWWS and TSSM interventions on the health and welfare of the rural poor
      in six developing countries: Peru, Tanzania, Senegal, Vietnam, Indonesia, and India. The IE
      will assess the impact of exposure to the HWWS and TSSM promotion on individual-level hygiene
      and sanitation practices, and on the health and welfare of children 0-5 years old. By
      introducing exogenous variation in handwashing and sanitation practices (through exposure to
      the HWWS and TSSM promotion), the IE will also answer a number of important questions related
      to the effect of the intended behavioral change (handwashing and improved sanitation) on
      health and welfare, thus providing information on the extent to which these behaviors alter
      intended development outcomes. This study uses a cluster-randomized experimental design,
      whereby the geographic units called clusters (e.g. village, commune, ward, depending on
      administrative structure of country) are randomly assigned to receive certain components of
      the Handwashing and Sanitation interventions in the case of treatment arms, and no
      Handwashing or Sanitation intervention in the case of control arms. . The final sample for
      the evaluation will consist of approximately 14,000 households, randomly selected, with at
      least one child between 0 and 24 months of age at baseline. Data will be collected from these
      14,000 households (approximately 54,781 subjects) through household surveys, anthropometric
      measurements, blood and stool samples, direct observations of behaviors, and community
      surveys. The data collected will be analyzed using a differences in differences approach,
      where possible, and the results will be disseminated to country officials and others
      stakeholders.

    <description>Total Sanitation and Sanitation Marketing (TSSM) program is designed to promote demand for and supply of improved sanitation. On the demand side, it includes &quot;Community-Led Total Sanitation&quot; (CLTS). On the supply side, TSSM incorporates sanitation marketing interventions. Both CLTS and sanitation marketing draw heavily on the behavior-change communication and social marketing approaches that have been well developed in other sectors. The basic TSSM approach also builds sustainability and scalability through the strengthening of the national level sanitation sector enabling environment.</description>

    <description>The Handwashing with soap (HWWS) behavior change program expands and improves existing hygiene behavior change efforts with new and innovative promotional approaches in order to generate widespread and sustained improvement in handwashing with soap practices. These approaches include social marketing to deliver handwashing messages; broad and inclusive partnerships with government, private commercial marketing channels, and concerned consumer groups and NGOs.</description>
