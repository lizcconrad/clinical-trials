    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the impact of i) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
      combined with exercise, ii)CBT combined with euthymic therapy, and iii) 'Cognitive Behavioral
      Analysis System of Psychotherapy' (CBASP) on psychometric and immunological measures in
      patients with major depression.

    <textblock>
      The interest of the investigation is to compare the impact of CBT combined with exercise, CBT
      combined with euthymic therapy and CBASP on depression and further psychopathological
      variables (assessed at 5 points).

      Previous findings indicate increased concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines in
      depression. A bidirectional relationship between depression and immunological alterations has
      been suggested: On the one hand pro-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to depression, on
      the other hand depression-linked changes (e.g. a reduction of activity, increased
      stress-sensitivity) may lead to increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore,
      this study is also supposed to investigate the influence of above mentioned interventions on
      pro-inflammatory cytokines. Using a waiting group, potential changes in psychometric and
      biological parameters without any intervention are controlled. Assessments take place at
      baseline, after 4 weeks of treatment, after 8 weeks of treatment, after 16 weeks of treatment
      and 6 months follow up.

      200 patients with Major Depression (DSM IV, BDI II at baseline ≥18) will be included.
      Patients will be randomized and assigned to one of the 4 groups.
