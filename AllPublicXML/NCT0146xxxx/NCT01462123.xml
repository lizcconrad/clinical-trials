  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, post-polypectomy surveillance intervals are determined by combining endoscopic and
      pathologic data. Real-time imaging technologies, have shown promising results in
      discriminating adenomatous from non-adenomatous polyps.

      The &quot;resect and discard strategy&quot; for small polyps (based on real-time assessment of the
      histology and on the endoscopic resection without pathological examination) has been shown to
      be cost-effective in simulation models. No data exist about the impact of this strategy in
      clinical practice.

      The aim of present study was to assess whether the systematic use, in the everyday clinical
      practice, of the &quot;resect and discard strategy&quot; allows to correctly manage patients with small
      colonic polyps.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  surveillance interval was not necessarily directed by endoscopic findings (history of

          -  colonoscopy was performed without NBI technology

          -  at least one lesion &gt; 10 mm or &lt; 10 mm but with morphologic features suspect for
             malignancy (depressed or ulcerated lesions) was detected

          -  caecal intubation was not accomplished

          -  polyps could not be resected for concomitant anticoagulation treatment, 7) polyps were
