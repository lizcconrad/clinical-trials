      Is a one-year intervention with Treadmill Desks associated with increased employee daily
      physical activity and decreased sedentariness.

      36 employees with sedentary jobs (87 + 27 kg, BMI 29 + 7 kg/m2) used a Treadmill Desk for one
      year. Daily Physical Activity, work performance, body composition, and blood variables were
      measured at Baseline and 6 and 12 months after the Treadmill Desk intervention.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be recruited regardless of race/ethnicity.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Definite termination criteria.

               -  Request by subject to leave study.

               -  Evidence of deliberate non-compliance (e.g.; placing activity instruments on
                  another individual, deliberate destruction of instruments).

               -  Pregnancy.

               -  Alcohol abuse; elicit drug abuse.

               -  Development of chronic condition that is likely to impact on metabolic variables
                  or requiring medications likely to impact on metabolic variables or likely to
                  result in subject being unable to participate (e.g., Grave's disease,
                  hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis requiring steroids or limiting mobility,
                  congestive cardiac failure, neurological disorder such as multiple sclerosis or
                  stroke).

               -  Development of acute condition that is likely to impact on metabolic variables or
                  requiring medications likely to impact on metabolic variables or likely to result
                  in subject being unable to participate (e.g., motor vehicle accident with
                  multiple fractures, myocardial infarction, major depression).

        Potential termination criteria.

        Development of acute or chronic condition that may impact on metabolic variables or
        requiring medications likely to impact on metabolic variables or likely to result in
        subject being unable to participate. Subjects will be reviewed on a subject-by-subject
        basis and will be reported to the Safety-Monitoring Panel. Specific action plans are
        pre-assigned for:

          -  Diabetes (two fasting plasma glucose values &gt;126 mg/dl). Here, glycosylated hemoglobin
             will be measured three monthly (by the study) and subjects referred to their local
             physician for preventative screening. Subjects will be excluded from further study
             with any glycosylated hemoglobin value of &gt;8% or symptomatic hyperglycemia.

          -  Depression or low mood. Here, all patients will be asked to be evaluated by their
             primary care physician and if appropriate referred to a psychiatrist. The opinion of
             the psychiatrist will be used to determine continuance or termination in the protocol.

        This does not represent a comprehensive listing of criteria or causes. All subjects who
        withdraw or whom are withdrawn from the study or whom are considering/being considered for
        withdrawal will be referred to the Safety-Monitoring Panel. These subjects' data will be
        scrutinized (whether terminated or not) separately to assess for association of
        intervention with a specific adverse outcome.
