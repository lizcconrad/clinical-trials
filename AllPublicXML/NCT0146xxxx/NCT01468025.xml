  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research protocol will compare Theramine to a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
      (NSAID) in the treatment of chronic back pain. The study will examine the efficacy and
      tolerability of Theramine alone in patients with chronic back pain in comparison to the
      NSAID, Naproxen, and the co-administration of Naproxen with Theramine.

      After informed consent and screening, volunteers will be entered into a double blind,
      randomized, three-armed trial, with 40 patients in each group. Patients will receive either
      Naproxen 250 mg daily, Theramine 2 capsules two times daily, or the co-administration of
      low-dose Naproxen 250 mg daily with Theramine 2 capsules two times daily for 28 days.
