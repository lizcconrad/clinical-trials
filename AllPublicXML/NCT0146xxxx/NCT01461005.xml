    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is skeletally mature (21-85 years old).

          -  Patient has degenerative spondylolisthesis (Grade 1-3) with objective evidence of
             neurologic impairment, kyphosis, and/or failed previous fusion (pseudarthrosis) at
             index level.

          -  Capable and willing to comply with the requirements unique to the study, adhere to the
             post-operative treatment and management program, and return for required follow-up
             examinations.

          -  Surgeon has determined that DSS™ System is an appropriate treatment for the patient
             without regard to the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The need for interbody cages, allograft, or any other assistance during surgery.
             Device is only to be used with autograft per FDA approved indications.

          -  Any medical, mental or surgical condition precluding the potential benefit of spinal
             surgery or surgery in general.

          -  Acute or chronic systemic, spinal or localized infections.

          -  Active, severe systemic and metabolic diseases.

          -  Obesity defined as Body Mass Index &gt; 35.

          -  Subject is pregnant or interested in becoming pregnant in the next 36 months.

          -  Dependency on pharmaceutical drugs, drug abuse, or alcoholism.

          -  Lack of patient cooperation.

          -  Foreign body sensitivity to the implant material.

          -  Degenerative scoliosis greater than 25 degrees.

          -  Grade 4 degenerative spondylolisthesis (&gt;75% slip).

          -  Significant osteopenia A screening questionnaire for osteopenia, SCORE (Simple
             Calculated Osteoporosis Risk Estimation), will be used to screen patients who require
             a DEXA bone mineral density measurement. If DEXA is required*, exclusion will be
             defined as a DEXA bone density measured T score of ≤ -1.0 (The World Health
             Organization definition of osteopenia).

          -  Soft tissue deficit not allowing wound closure.

          -  Congenital abnormalities, tumors or other conditions that would prevent secure
             component fixation that has the potential to decrease the useful life of the device.

          -  Inadequate pedicles or vertebral body geometry of the thoracic, lumbar and sacral
             vertebrae.

          -  Bony lumbar spinal stenosis not related to the primary degenerative spondylolisthesis
             indication.

          -  Pars defect.

          -  Clinically compromised vertebral bodies at affected level due to current or past
             trauma.

          -  Prisoner or ward of the state.

          -  Currently in litigation regarding a spinal condition.

          -  Known allergy to titanium, titanium alloys, CoCrMo, polyethylene or MR contrast
             agents.

          -  Is currently involved in a study of another investigational product for similar
             purpose.
