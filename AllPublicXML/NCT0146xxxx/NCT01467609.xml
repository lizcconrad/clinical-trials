  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pillcam colon capsule (PCC) endoscopy is a novel strategy tool to inspect colon mucosa. The
      aim of the present study is to evaluate if PCC endoscopy is able to precisely investigate
      patients with ulcerative colitis and reach high consistency to conventional colonoscopy.

      Symptomatic patients with confirmed ulcerative colitis (UC) were enrolled in this prospective
      single-center study. No sooner had patients gone through Pillcam colon capsule (PCC)
      endoscopy solution than they got conventional colonoscopy which is recognized as the &quot;gold
      standard&quot; examination technique. The extent of mucosal damage and inflammatory lesions during
      both modalities were recorded for comparison. In addition, the regimen of bowel preparation,
      completion rate, colonic cleanliness, compliance or adverse events were analyzed.
