  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP) is a form of apheresis and photodynamic therapy in which
      the peripheral blood is treated with 8-methoxypsoralen, which is then activated with UV
      light. ECP is currently a standard therapy for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and is also
      effective for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The investigators would like to study the
      outcomes (response rates) of patients receiving ECP treatment and other factors relating to
      their disease and treatment, as well as procedural events, such as complications.

      The investigators intend to report outcomes from the inception of this procedure at
      Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) in May 2008 through 9/30/11. Additionally, the
      investigators would like to maintain a prospective database of these patients so that new
      patient data can be collected for updating of outcomes.
