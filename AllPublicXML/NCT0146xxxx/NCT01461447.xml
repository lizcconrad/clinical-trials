  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and immunogenecity of a third MVA in the
      HIVIS 03 volunteers who have received 3 HIVIS DNA vaccines followed by boosting with 2 MVA
      vaccines.

      The investigators postulate that the Immune responses that were observed in the HIVIS 03
      trial are likely to wane over time. To date it is unknown how these responses should best be
      maintained. In this study the investigators seek to boost immune responses, especially the
      antibody responses induced by the second MVA boost.

      Since the HIV specific antibodies were induced only after the second MVA injection, it is
      hypothesized that a 3rd MVA will give rise to even higher and sustained antibody titers.

          1. Have completed the HIVIS03/TaMoVac01 WP1 protocol and received the active vaccine

          2. Willing to undergo counseling and HIV testing

          3. Are not infected by HIV infection as indicated by a negative PCR reaction against HIV.

          4. Able to give informed consent

          5. Resident in Dar es Salaam, and willing to remain so for the duration of the study

          6. At low risk of HIV infection, defined as the absence of an identifiable risk factor/
             behavior:

               -  sexual partner with HIV

               -  sexual partner with unknown HIV serostatus who is also unwilling to use
                  protective condoms consistently in all sexual relations

               -  sexual partner is known to be at high risk for HIV

               -  more than one sexual partner in the last 6 months.

               -  history of being an alcoholic [as medically defined or more than 35 units /week]

               -  History of STI within past 6 months.

          7. Verbal assurances that adequate birth control measures are used not to conceive/father
             a child during the study and up to 4 months after the 3rd MVA vaccine injection

          8. Have a negative urinary pregnancy test for females

          9. ECG findings that neither pose a risk for the vaccination nor preclude evaluation of
             peri/myocarditis.

         10. Be willing to practice safe sex for the duration of the study to avoid sexually
             transmitted infections including HIV.

         11. Good health as determined by medical history, physical examination, clinical judgment
             and by key laboratory parameters

        Reference ranges will be in accordance with data generated at MUHAS for hematology values,
        and biochemical parameters. Exclusion by presence of Diabetes mellitus will be based on the
        WHO cut-off value of a Fasting Blood Glucose &gt;7.8 mmol/l

        No grade 1 or higher routine laboratory parameters (see section on appendix 3 DAIDS chart
        for Definitions). Hence lab parameters have to be as follows:

          -  Hb &gt;10.5g/dl

          -  White blood cell count &gt;1,300/mm3

             complete urinalysis (UA). If microscopic UA confirms evidence of hematuria or if
             proteinuria ≥ 1+, the volunteer is ineligible).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active tuberculosis or other systemic infectious process elicited by review of
             systems, physical examination and laboratory detection. Such as detection of Hepatitis
             B surface antigen, or active syphilis.

          2. Have a history of immunodeficiency, chronic illness requiring continuous or frequent
             medical intervention

             not exclusionary but should be given at least 2 weeks before or after HIV immunization
             to avoid potential confusion of adverse reactions}.
