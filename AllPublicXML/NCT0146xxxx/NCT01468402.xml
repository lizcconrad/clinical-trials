      The purpose of this study is to determine predictive factors in the pelvic magnetic resonance
      in the response of arterial embolization of uterine leiomyoma.

      This study followed symptomatic premenopausal women with uterine leiomyoma who underwent
      uterine artery embolization (UAE). Treatment was accompanied by magnetic resonance imaging of
      both the volume of the entire uterus and the leiomyomas one month before and six months after
      UAE. This patients were treated at the Uterine Leiomyoma Sector of the Department of
      Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medicine College of the University of São Paulo. In this study,
      the investigators examined 179 leiomyomas in 50 patients.

    <description>The leiomyomas were evaluated individually. MR was used to evaluate morphology: the radiological dimension(s) of the leiomyoma and uterus and the volume. The number of leiomyoma fibroid, and their location in the myometrium was classified. Perfusion and the characterization of the T2 signal were also evaluated.</description>
