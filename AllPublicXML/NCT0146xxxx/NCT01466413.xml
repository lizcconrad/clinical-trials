  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an early phase study comparing two fixed dose of the study compound ELAPR and a
      Restylane® Vital Light (control), by multiple intradermal injections to a 3cm x 3cm area of
      the upper arm dermis. All subjects will receive three treatments, 3 weeks apart. Each
      treatment will consist of 16 injections in total, each 10mm apart in a grid formation over a
      3cm x 3cm area of the mid - to deep dermis of the medial aspect of the upper arm. Each
      injection will consist of 20-30ul of product delivered using a 30Gx¼&quot; needle.

      Each subject will also receive Restylane® Vital Light (control) to the opposite arm following
      the same treatment regimen and using the same technique. A 4mm skin biopsy will be taken from
      each of the implant sites from Cohort A subjects (including replacements) on Day 169, and
      from Cohort B subjects (including replacements) on Day 85. The biopsy will encompass the
      needle point tattoo at the centre of the implant site. The biopsy site will be closed with a
      single stitch followed by standard aftercare procedures with stitch removal 7 to 10 days
      later.

    <description>Patients with an even subject identification number (SIN) (02, 04, 06, 08, 10, 12, 14, 16) will have ELAPR to the right arm and the control to the left, where patients with an odd subject identification number (01, 03, 05, 07, 09, 11, 13, 15) will have the ELAPR to the left arm and the control to the right.
Patients will receive either device ELAPR002c or ELAPR002e. This will alternate to minimise bias between the right and left arms.
The first group of eight patients (01 - 08) will have their biopsy performed at day 169. The second group of eight patients (09 - 16) will have their biopsy at day 85.</description>
