  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to determine the personal and organizational conditions that are most
      conducive to the widespread adoption by community-based organizations (CBOs) of effective
      programs for reducing the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
      Taking a brief, single-session counseling program (called &quot;Mujer Segura&quot;) that has been
      proven effective in reducing HIV and STIs in female sex workers who work in Mexican cities
      along the U.S. border, this project will study the implementation of the program in CBOs in
      12 additional cities throughout Mexico to determine how best to ensure that the program
      remains true to the original model and retains its effectiveness. Mexico has been chosen
      because HIV is a global problem that respects no international borders, and because HIV
      prevention programs that can be implemented in settings with limited resources are urgently
      needed in many parts of the world.

    <measure>Reduction in HIV and STI incidence relative to control group</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Female sex worker (FSW) participants will be tested at baseline and 6-month follow-up for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and Chlamydia. Incidence rates for all infections at 6-month follow-up will be compared between the theory-based Mujer Segura group (N=40 per clinic) and the standard counseling group (N=40 per clinic).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction in number of unprotected sex acts relative to control group</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Female sex worker (FSW) participants will be assessed at baseline and 6-month follow-up using self-report measures of frequency of protected and unprotected sex acts with male clients. Changes in frequency at 6-month follow-up will be compared between the theory-based Mujer Segura group (N=40 per clinic) and the standard counseling group (N=40 per clinic).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fidelity to Mujer Segura intervention model</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Counselors at each CBO will be assessed for their fidelity to the intervention protocol and assigned a numerical score. This number will be used to determine possible correlations between levels of fidelity and the efficacy of the Mujer Segura intervention at each clinic.</description>
