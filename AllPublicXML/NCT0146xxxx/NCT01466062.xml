    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is considered a serious adverse event (SAE): results in death or is life-threatening, results in admission or prolongation of hospitalization, results in congenital anomaly or persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is an important medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent serious outcome. AEs were categorized by severity (mild, moderate, severe) and relationship to treatment (probably, possibly, probably not, not related). Please see Adverse Events section below for more details.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is considered a serious adverse event (SAE): results in death or is life-threatening, results in admission or prolongation of hospitalization, results in congenital anomaly or persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is an important medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent serious outcome. AEs were categorized by severity (mild, moderate, severe) and relationship to treatment (probably, possibly, probably not, not related). Please see Adverse Events section below for more details.</description>
