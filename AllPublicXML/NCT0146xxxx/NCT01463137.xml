    <textblock>
      A study investigating six different versions of a computerized attention bias modification
      internet program in the treatment of social phobia / social anxiety disorder.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that individuals with social phobia have attention biases, often
      focusing on aversive stimuli or avoiding aversive stimuli. Computerized training programs
      have been developed to implicitly direct the users attention towards a neutral,
      non-threatening stimuli. In this study, such a program will be compared with a program that
      implicitly directs the users' attention towards threatening cues. Pre/post-measurements will
      be compared in a sample of individuals that meet diagnostic criteria of Social Anxiety
      Disorder. Participants will be randomized to one of three groups, receiving one of the two
      variants of the attention bias modification program or a control training program.

    <description>Computerized, internet-based control training program. Participant is exposed to a pair of words -- either neutral-negative, neutral-positive, or negative-positive -- for 500ms-1000ms, followed by a probe (&lt; or &gt;) in the previous position of ONE of these words and is then asked to press the corresponding arrow button on a keyboard. A total of 192 word pairs are shown during a session. One third is neutral-negative, one third is neutral-positive, and one third is negative-positive. The probe follows the more positive word and the more negative word with equal frequency.</description>

    <description>Computerized, internet-based control training program. Participant is exposed to a pair of words or a pair of faces -- either neutral-negative, neutral-positive, or negative-positive -- for 500ms-1000ms, followed by a probe (&lt; or &gt;) in the previous position of ONE of these words or faces and is then asked to press the corresponding arrow button on a keyboard. A total of 96 word pairs and 96 face pairs are shown during a session. One third is neutral-negative, one third is neutral-positive, and one third is negative-positive.

A total of 192 word pairs are shown during a session, of one third is the neutral-negative, one third is neutral-positive, and one third is negative-positive. The probe always follows the more positive word.</description>
