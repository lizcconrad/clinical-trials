    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B is a form of liver disease caused by a DNA-virus, called hepatitis B virus (HBV).
      Infection can result in an inflammation of the liver parenchyma with various clinical
      manifestations ranging from an asymptomatic course to jaundice. After contact with the virus
      the immunological response of the host determines the clinical outcome leading to either
      viral clearance or a chronic infection.

      Although several factors are responsible for the development of chronic HBV-infection, one of
      the factors is a weak and transient CD8+ T-cell responses after HBV infection. In chronic
      hepatitis B, inflammation can lead to scarring which is the driving force to fibrosis and
      cirrhosis. Some immunological parameters, like a newly discovered subset of IL-17 producing T
      helper cells (Th17 cells), may influence the disease progression of HBV. In the cirrhotic
      patient, eventually there is an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) leading to
      liver failure.

      Recent literature in Asian patients with chronic hepatitis B showed that serum HBV viral load
      is a strong predictor for the development of cirrhosis, independent of hepatitis B e- antigen
      status and serum alanine transaminase level. It is unclear whether these results can be
      extrapolated to non-Asian (Caucasian and African) populations because of differences in host
      (HLA background) and viral (HBV genotype) factors.

      The aim of this study is to elucidate the question whether historic HBV viral load is
      associated with the risk of HBV-related cirrhosis or mortality in a cohort of non-Asian
      individuals with chronic hepatitis B infection.

      During one visit, the nurse will assess the quality of life of the included patients with the
      use of a health assessment questionnaire. This questionnaire is derived from a standardized
      questionnaire to assess the quality of life in patients, the SF-36. Participation will
      require a single visit to the outpatient clinic of Public Health Service. During this visit a
      short history and physical examination related to chronic liver disease will be performed.
      During the same visit a single venapunction and a single hepatic elastography (fibroscan)
      will be performed.
