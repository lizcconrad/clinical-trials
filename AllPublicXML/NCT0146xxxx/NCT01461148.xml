  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced microsatellite unstable (MSI-H) colorectal cancer will be vaccinated
      with three so called frame shift peptides (FSPs), AIM2(-1), HT001(-1) and TAF1B(-1) combined
      with Montanide® ISA-51 VG. By this, an immune response directed against MSI-induced FSPs that
      are shared by the majority of MSI-H colorectal cancers can be induced. The aim is to show
      that vaccination against MSI-induced FSPs is safe and can induce or enhance immune responses
      against MSI-H colorectal cancer-associated antigens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is initiated to evaluate vaccination with MSI-specific FSPs in patients
      with MSI-H colorectal cancer. Specifically, the present study aims at the following
      questions:

        -  Evaluation of potential toxicity of the FSP AIM2(-1), HT001(-1), TAF1B(-1)

        -  Evaluation of the immune response in patients with advanced MSI-H colorectal cancer
           before vaccination and after vaccination with the FSP AIM2(-1), HT001(-1), TAF1B(-1)

      In this context, the present study shall demonstrate whether application of FSP in a
      vaccination approach is associated with the induction of peptide-related toxicity. Hence, the
      study marks the first step towards the application of FSP in humans, as it provides
      information on the safety of FSP as vaccination agents for the first time. Moreover, the
      study shall provide initial information, whether vaccination with FSP can induce FSP-specific
      immune responses in patients with MSI-H colorectal cancer. Thus, it shall provide
      information, whether FSPs AIM2(-1), HT001(-1), and TAF1B(-1) have the potential to elicit
      peptide-specific immune responses and therefore represent suitable targets for the induction
      of tumor antigen-specific immune responses in patients with MSI-H tumors.

      The present study marks an important milestone towards a potential application of
      MSI-specific FSP as therapeutic agents in the management of patients with MSI-H tumors,
      particularly patients with MSI-H colorectal cancer. Long-term goal of this approach is to
      develop novel tools for (1) the palliative and/or adjuvant therapy of patients with advanced
      MSI-H colorectal cancer and (2) the preventive application of FSPs in mutation carriers of
      the HNPCC/Lynch syndrome.
