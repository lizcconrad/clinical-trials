  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) has been proposed as an effective method of reducing
      progression of both keratoconus and corneal ectasia after surgery, as well as possibly
      decreasing the steepness of the cornea in these pathologies. During previous studies of the
      CXL procedure, the surface epithelial cells have been removed. Transepithelial crosslinking
      in which the epithelium is not removed has been proposed to offer a number of advantages over
      traditional crosslinking including an increased safety profile by reducing the risk for
      infection as no epithelial barrier will be broken, faster visual recovery and improved
      patient comfort in the early postoperative healing period.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the difference between two regimens of
      transepithelial crosslinking. The study will compare two riboflavin dosing regimens during
      the crosslinking procedure. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of transepithelial corneal collagen crosslinking performed with riboflavin 0.1% for
      reducing corneal curvature. Safety and efficacy outcomes will then be compared between the
      treatment groups. In particular, we will compare the two groups with regard to their efficacy
      in reducing corneal curvature. Secondary outcomes will include visual acuity. Safety
      assessments will include a tabulation of adverse events, patient symptoms, loss of visual
      acuity, changes in endothelial cell density, slit lamp examination of the cornea and lens,
      and contact lens tolerance for contact lens wearers

    <description>The change in manifest refraction spherical equivalent from baseline will be evaluated at 12 months. As a secondary analysis of this endpoint, a repeated measures analysis of variance will be conducted to assess the profile of the treatments across time at 1,3, and 6 months to look at the effect of wound healing on this variable.</description>

    <description>Change in BSCVA (best spectacle corrected visual acuity) and UCVA (uncorrected visual acuity) compared to the baseline examination will be evaluated at 12 months postoperatively.
