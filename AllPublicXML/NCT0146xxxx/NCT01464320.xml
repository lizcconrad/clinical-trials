    <textblock>
      To assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ABT-614 in subjects with type 2
      diabetes and chronic kidney disease with albuminuria and to determine whether ABT-614 reduces
      glomerular filtration rate.

      This Phase 1b, single-site, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study will be
      conducted in three Periods; Baseline, Dosing and Outpatient. Eligible adult male and female
      subjects with type 2 diabetes and CKD (chronic kidney disease) with albuminuria will be
      selected to participate.

      Eighteen subjects will be selected to participate in the Baseline Period to ensure that 16
      subjects are enrolled in the Dosing Period. Subjects who are eligible from Screening will be
      confined to the study site beginning on Day -2 (the day before the Baseline Period infusion).
      On Day -1, subjects will be administered an iothalamate infusion to measure baseline GFR
      (glomerular filtration rate). Subjects who continue to be eligible on Day 1 will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a 10 mg dose of ABT-614 or matching placebo
      daily, for 15 days.

      On Day 15 subjects will be administered a second iothalamate infusion. Plasma and urine
      samples for ABT-614 and iothalamate will be collected. Subjects will be released from
      confinement on Day 20 after the completion of all study procedures including the 120-hour
      blood sample collection. Thereafter, subjects will return for outpatient visits on Days 25
      and 30 as well as 30 days after the last dose of study drug. A ± 2 day window will be
      permitted on the 30-day Follow-up Visit to accommodate subject scheduling.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Male or female aged between 19 and 70 years, inclusive, at time of consent.

          2. Type 2 diabetes receiving at least one anti-diabetic medication for at least one year
             at the time of Screening.

          3. Hemoglobin A1c &lt; 12% at the time of Screening.

          4. Estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 30 mL/min calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault
             Formula at the time of Screening.

          5. Urinary albumin to creatinine ratio 100 to 5000 mg/g creatinine at the time of
             Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. History of unusual or allergic reaction to iodine, to products containing iodine (for
             example., iodine containing foods) or to other radio-opaque agents.

          2. Subject history of epileptic seizures or convulsions.

          3. Clinically significant cardiac disease or family history of long-QT syndrome and/or
             subject and/or family history of unexplained, sudden cardiac death. History of
             myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass graft is not exclusionary if
             occurrence is ≥ 12 months prior to the administration of study drug and the subject
             does not have conduction abnormality and has been stable without intervention,
             symptoms of ischemia or an increase in cardiovascular medications. Electrocardiography
             (ECG) should be compared with historical to ensure no new clinically significant
             changes have occurred.

          4. History of gastric surgery, cholecystectomy, vagotomy, bowel resection or any surgical
             procedure that might interfere with gastrointestinal motility, potential hydrogen (pH)
             or absorption.

          5. Clinically significant respiratory (except mild asthma), gastrointestinal,
             hematologic, neurologic, thyroid or any uncontrolled medical illness or psychiatric
             disease or disorder.

          6. Screening ECG with clinically significant abnormalities and/or confirmed Screening
             QTcF prolongation more than 430 milliseconds for males and 450 milliseconds for
             females or ECG with second or third degree atrioventricular block.
