      The purpose of the study is to compare the 3 ointment formulations containing LEO 29102 plus
      calcipotriol and Daivonex® ointment and Diprosone® ointment and to compare LEO 29102 plus
      calcipotriol to LEO 29102 alone and to calcipotriol alone in the same ointment vehicle, using
      the psoriasis plaque test modified from the method developed by KJ Dumas and JR Scholtz.

             on psoriasis vulgaris (e.g., corticosteroids, retinoids, immunosuppressants) within

          -  Subjects who are known or, in the opinion of the investigator, are unlikely to comply

             state).

          -  Subjects who are in an exclusion period in the National Biomedical Research Register
             of the French Ministry of Health at randomisation.

          -  Subjects under guardianship, hospitalized in a public or private institution, for a
