    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the minimum effective volume of local anesthetic (50:50
      mixture of 0.5% levobupivacaine and 2% lidocaine) required to produce an effective US-SCB for
      surgical anesthesia in 50% of patients and to calculate the effective volume required to
      produce an effective US-SCB in 95% of the patients (MEAV95) in elderly group (&gt;65 years) and
      in middle aged group (&lt;45years) of patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We believe that known data regarding the minimum anesthetic volume required for effective
      US-SCB from middle age population can not be applicable to the elderly population since our
      preliminary data, presented at Euroanesthesia meeting in Amsterdam, 2011, and published in
      abstract form in the European Journal of Anaesthesiology, showed that involutional changes of
      brachial plexus in elderly, assessed by measuring the cross-sectional area (CSA) of brachial
      plexus at the first rib, allowed a 35% reduction in local anesthetic volume for an effective
      US-SCB for surgical anesthesia in elderly patients in comparison with the younger patients.

    <description>The study method is a step-up/step-down sequence model where the dose of local anesthetic for the following patient is determined by the outcome of the preceding block. The starting dose of 50:50 mixture of 0.5% levobupivacaine and 2% lidocaine is 30 mL. In the case of block failure, the dose will be increased by 5 mL. Conversely, block success will result in a reduction in dose by 5 mL. A blinded assistant will assess sensory and motor blockade in each nerve territory ( the median, radial, ulnar and musculocutaneous) at 5-min intervals up to 30 min after completion of US-SCB. Effective US-SCB will be defined as complete sensory blockade in the distribution of the radial, ulnar, median and musculocutaneous nerve.</description>
