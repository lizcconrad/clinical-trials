      Aims of the study:

      This is a single blind randomized-controlled trial to test the feasibility and the effects of
      a task oriented training on locomotor function, mobility and balance in multiple sclerosis
      subjects with moderate gait impairments (EDSS 4 - 5,5). The control group will not be treated
      with a specific physical therapy (usual care).

      Subjects and methods:

      60 multiple sclerosis patients will be recruited in an outpatient rehabilitation clinic
      (Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Ferrara).

      Informed consent will be obtained. Participants will be randomized to (TOCT) task-oriented
      training (experimental group) or usual care (control group) through a randomization
      stratification approach, according to a block randomization of 6.

      The experimental group will receive 10 task-oriented training sessions over 2 weeks (5
      sessions/week=intensive training). Three subjects with a supervisor physiotherapist will take
      part at the TOCT.

      Feasibility outcome will be measured with a specific questionnaire. Treatment efficacy
      outcome measures will be clinical test for gait speed (10m walking test), walking endurance
      (six minute walking test), balance (Dynamic Gait Index) and mobility (Time Up and Go Test); a
      structured interview for the performance(Lower Extremity Mal); self-assessment questionnaire
      for motor fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale FSS), multiple sclerosis physical and psychological
      impact (multiple sclerosis impact scale MSIS-29), walking ability (multiple sclerosis walking
      scale MSWS-12).

      Outcome measures will be assessed the week before the treatment (T0), after the treatment
      (T1) and at 3 months follow-up (T2) to evaluate treatments retention, by a clinician blinded
      to the treatment.

    <description>Functional Circuit include 6 different work-stations in which patients exercise for 5 minutes in each one : 3 minutes exercises and 2 minutes rest. Total training takes about 30 minutes (2 laps/session over 60 minutes).
Walking endurance is trained by 30 minutes walking on the treadmill including rests if necessary.
It is a progressive circuit and subjects, while exercising, receives feedback (visual and auditory) by the physiotherapist. Rests are used to discuss about difficulties and to provide further feedbacks. One task oriented session may include up to 3 patients and lasts 120 minutes. At the end of the 2 weeks an exercises brochure will be given to patients so that they can independently train for 3 month. Independent home training takes about 90 minutes.</description>

    <description>The control group will not receive any specific rehabilitation treatment for gait performance and mobility improvement (usual care). At any case, the control group will be authorized, at will, to exercise in non-rehabilitative contexts (i.e. swimming, walking, yoga) or do physical rehabilitation in rehabilitative gyms not directly addressed to gait, mobility or balance training such as stretching exercises, active and passive mobilization and Bobath neurorehabilitation or similar.</description>
