  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) affects more than 5 million Americans and is a major source of morbidity
      and mortality. Despite optimal management, over half of patients with HF suffer from pain,
      dyspnea, fatigue, and depression that diminish quality of life (QoL). HF care also exacts a
      huge financial toll with yearly costs of $35 billion. Although consensus guidelines call for
      providing palliative care (PC) to patients with HF to relieve suffering and improve QoL, few
      receive it. The overall aim of this project is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      to determine if an interdisciplinary PC intervention (Symptom Management Service-HF [SMS-HF])
      provided concurrently with standard cardiology care improves symptoms, QoL and satisfaction,
      and reduces resource utilization in outpatients with Class II-IV HF compared to standard
      cardiology care alone. Subjects assigned to the SMS-HF group will receive a 6-month
      interdisciplinary PC intervention based on the investigators successful SMS model of
      outpatient PC for oncology patients and focused on assessment and management of physical,
      emotional, social, and spiritual distress and discussion of treatment preferences.
      Innovations of this study are that it will rigorously assess the impact of the SMS-HF on
      patient outcomes and on resource utilization, a key component to ensuring program
      sustainability. The investigators research team of PC and HF experts is recognized for its PC
      research and has a proven record of collaborating, conducting RCTs of PC interventions, and
      studying outpatients with HF. The environment at UCSF is highly supportive of innovative
      research and of sustaining programs with demonstrated improvements in patient outcomes and
      operational effectiveness. The overall goal is to use the results from this study to support
      an application to the NIH for a multi-center RCT of the SMS-HF and to study similar models of
      concurrent PC for patients with other serious illnesses.

    <description>Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, 3-months and 6-months The CES-D is a 20-item measure that includes items pertaining to a range of depressive symptoms. Each symptom is assessed 'in the past week' and recorded on a 4-point numeric scale (0= &quot;rarely or none of the time&quot; to 3= &quot;most or all of the time&quot;) providing a composite score (range 0 - 60). A score of 16 or higher is generally used to denote the presence of significant depressive symptoms.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized to the SMS-HF group will receive a comprehensive PC consultation by the interdisciplinary PC team at each site consisting of a nurse practitioner, physician, social worker and chaplain with 6 months of follow up. All members of the PC team are experienced PC clinicians. The SMS-HF intervention is based on National Quality Forum preferred practices and the National Consensus Project guidelines for quality PC. The SMS-HF will include assessment and management of symptoms, particularly focused on depression, pain and dyspnea, and a discussion of goals of care.</description>

    <description>The symptom management service for heart failure (SMS-HF) will begin in the hospital where the patient will be seen daily until discharge and continue with at least 6 contacts over the next 6 months with the first outpatient contact occurring in person in the HF clinic within a month of discharge. Of the subsequent 5 monthly contacts, at least 2 will be in person with the remainder by telephone. Additional contacts between the SMS-HF team and patient will be scheduled as needed. Patients discharged to a site other than home will have monthly contacts by telephone until they are able to attend the clinic. We will assess changes in depression, pain, dyspnea, and quality of life from baseline to 6 month follow-up.</description>
