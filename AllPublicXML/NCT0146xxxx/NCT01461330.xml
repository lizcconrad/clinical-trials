    <textblock>
      Data obtained in hypertensive patients without diabetes suggest that increased association of
      non-pharmacological treatment in patients with diabetes and hypertension may be associated
      with an improvement in blood pressure control. Despite the beneficial results found, is not
      yet known the magnitude of the effect of a DASH diet associated with the stimulus of physical
      activity on BP in patients with type 2 diabetes. The beneficial effects on blood pressure of
      an additional non-pharmacological intervention to drug therapy may have an even greater
      impact in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension The aim of this study is to evaluate
      the effect of changes in lifestyle on blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes and
      hypertension resistant to treatment.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of changes in lifestyle on blood pressure in
      patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Secondary objectives are: Assess whether the
      prescription of a DASH-type diet and encouragement for physical activity through use of
      pedometers, can improve blood pressure control in patients with type 2 diabetes and
      hypertension resistant to treatment.

      Forty type 2 diabetic with resistant hypertension outpatients were included in a randomized
      clinical trial: treatment 1- DASH diet + encouragement for physical activity through use of
      pedometer; treatment 2- ADA diet + usual exercises. The duration of each treatment are four
      weeks. The patients included should have performed Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring
      (ABPM) to exclude white-coat effect, ie when there are abnormal in the measurement of office
      blood pressure (equal to or above 140/90 mm Hg) and normal blood pressure by ABPM during the
      awake period (equal to or below 135/85 mm Hg). Twenty-four hour records with concurrent 24h
      urinary collections (protein intake estimative), clinical and laboratory evaluation were
      performed at baseline and after 4 weeks. Serum fatty acids were measured in total lipids by
      gas chromatography.
