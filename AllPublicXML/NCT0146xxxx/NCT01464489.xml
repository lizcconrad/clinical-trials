      The investigators hypothesized that increasing the cardiac output by use of atropine in
      children might result in a reduction of the intubation time needed to facilitate tracheal
      intubation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine TimeEI with a low dose of
      esmeron (rocuronium) (0.3 mg.kg-1) for achievement of successful tracheal intubation
      conditions during intravenous (i.v.) anaesthesia using propofol and alfentanil in children
      and to determine whether administration of i.v. atropine (atropine sulphate) (10 μg.kg-1)
      during anaesthesia induction reduced these times.

    <description>Tracheal intubation was attempted was predetermined according to the up-and-down method, starting with 120 s, in both groups. If intubation was successful (unsuccessful), the assigned intubation time was decreased (increased) by one interval for the next patients in that group, respectively. In this study, the investigators adopted 69, 83, 99, 120, 144, 173, and 208 s, since these intubation times have equal intervals (0.08) on a logarithmic scale.</description>
