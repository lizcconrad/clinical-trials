    <description>Study has a dose escalation phase (Part A) and dose confirmation phase (Part B). Participants in the dose escalation phase will receive 1 of 6 doses of LY3007113 administered orally every 12 hours for at least one cycle. Participants in the dose confirmation phase will receive the maximum tolerated dose from the dose escalation phase administered orally every 12 hours for at least 1 cycle. Three days prior to the start of the first cycle, participants will receive 1 dose at their assigned level to allow for the collection of single dose pharmacokinetics. Participants may continue on study drug until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other withdrawal criterion is met.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have histological or cytological evidence of a diagnosis of cancer that is advanced

          -  For Dose Escalation (Part A): cancer, either a solid tumor or a lymphoma

          -  For Dose Confirmation (Part B): cancer, either a solid tumor or a lymphoma

          -  Have the presence of measureable or non-measureable disease (Part A) or measureable

             14 days for nonmyelosuppressive agents

          -  Have an estimated life expectancy of greater than or equal to 12 weeks

          -  For Dose Confirmation (Part B): Have symptomatic central nervous system malignancy or
             metastasis

          -  Have an acute leukemia

          -  Have a history of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma
             in-situ of the cervix), unless in complete remission and stopped all therapy for that
             disease for a minimum of 3 years

          -  Have received an autologous or allogeneic stem-cell transplant within 75 days of the
