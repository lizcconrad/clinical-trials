  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uncontrolled high blood pressure (HBP) is a major public health concern and leading cause of
      cardiovascular disease worldwide. The HBP crisis is particularly onerous to African Americans
      as they are disproportionately more susceptible to HBP than non-Hispanic White Americans.
      Poor adherence to prescribed medication regimens is a major problem, as only about half of
      patients who have been diagnosed with hypertension adhere to prescribed medications. Mobile
      phones and text messages are becoming widely integrated into routine daily life and may offer
      a simple and non-labor intensive strategy for improving the quality of medication management
      through enhancing medication adherence. This proposed research will be conducted in two
      distinct phases addressing three specific aims. For Specific Aim 1 (Phase I), the
      investigators propose to conduct focus groups with participants from the investigators target
      population in order to obtain feedback to guide the development of a mobile phone text
      message system that seeks to improve adherence to antihypertensive medications. For Specific
      Aim 2 (Phase II), the investigators propose to pilot test the newly developed text message
      intervention with a randomized controlled trial. For Specific Aim 3 (Phase II), the
      investigators propose to ascertain participant perceptions of intervention effectiveness and
      satisfaction in order to guide further system refinement. In Phase I, African Americans with
      uncontrolled hypertension (n=24-32) will be recruited to take part in one of four focus
      groups that will help guide the development of the text message intervention. In Phase II,
      African Americans with uncontrolled hypertension will be randomized to receive usual care
      (n=30) vs. the text message intervention (n=30). The primary outcome in this pilot will be
      change in medication adherence at one month follow-up; secondary outcomes include change in
      medication self-efficacy and systolic and diastolic blood pressure at one month follow-up, as
      well as participant satisfaction with the text message intervention. The proposed research
      will utilize the Wayne State University (WSU) Center for Urban Studies to conduct high
      quality and professionally run focus groups, the WSU Division of Computing and Information
      Technology's Broadcast Message Service infrastructure for the delivery of text messages, the
      WSU Center for Health Research for statistical analysis and grant management assistance, and
      a diverse study team from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds at WSU. As a result, the
      proposed research leverages the considerable local resources to investigate an innovative and
      much needed intervention for this high-risk population.
