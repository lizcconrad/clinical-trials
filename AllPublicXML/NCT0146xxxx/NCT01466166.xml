  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to observe patients being treated with KRYSTEXXA in a
      standard healthcare setting in order to evaluate the frequency and severity of infusion
      reactions, anaphylaxis and immune complex related events. Additionally, serious adverse
      events associated with KRYSTEXXA therapy will be identified.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, multicenter, open-label, single-arm observational study of KRYSTEXXA 8 mg
      i.v. every 2 weeks in adult hyperuricemic patients with gout refractory to conventional
      therapy. Approximately 1500 patients will be enrolled in order to observe treatment of up to
      500 patients at approximately 300 centers in the United States (US). Study duration is
      approximately 63 weeks, including 51 weeks of treatment and 12 weeks of follow-up. The
      proposed patient number and 1 year duration of the study will significantly extend the
      patient exposure to KRYSTEXXA compared with the pre-marketing controlled clinical trials.

      The design of this study follows the FDA-approved Full Prescribing Information for the use of
      KRYSTEXXA and allows for capturing additional data related to the safety and efficacy of
      KRYSTEXXA within the standard healthcare setting.

        The patient population in this study will be hyperuricemic (serum uric acid (SUA) &gt; 6
        mg/dL) adult men and women (age 18 or greater) diagnosed with chronic gout and who are
        refractory to conventional therapy. Gout refractory to conventional therapy occurs in
        patients who have failed to normalize SUA and whose signs and symptoms are inadequately
        controlled with xanthine oxidase inhibitors at the maximum medically appropriate dose or
        for whom these drugs are contraindicated. To enter this study, the patient and the
        physician must have decided to begin treatment with KRYSTEXXA.
