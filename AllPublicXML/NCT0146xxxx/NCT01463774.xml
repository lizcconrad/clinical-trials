  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of a fixed dose combination
      tablet of canagliflozin and metformin immediate release (IR) in comparison with the
      individual components of canagliflozin and metformin IR.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (identity of study drug will be known to volunteer and study staff),
      single-center study to evaluate the bioequivalence of canagliflozin and metformin when
      administered orally (by mouth) as individual components (ie, separate tablets of
      canagliflozin and metformin) (Treatment A) and when administered as a fixed dose combination
      tablet (ie, canagliflozin and metformin in the same tablet) (Treatment B). Healthy volunteers
      participating in the study will be randomly (by chance) assigned to receive Treatment A
      followed by Treatment B or Treatment B followed by Treatment A with a period of approximately
      15 days between treatments.
