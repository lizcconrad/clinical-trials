      The purpose of this clinical trial is to compare the effect of different direct pulp capping
      methods on human pulpal response in the terms of inflammation &amp; dentinal bridge formation.
      Methods: Eight patients providing 32 sound first premolars are selected. As recommended by
      ISO / TC 7405 pulpal exposure will be performed through a class I cavity. Four groups of
      eight specimens each will be defined according to the pulp capping method. Group A, will
      receive chemical set calcium hydroxide (Dycal). Group B, will receive mineral Trioxide
      Aggregate (MTA) according to manufacturer's instruction. Group C, will receive MTA and after
      its primary setting, within 15 minutes, the cavity is restored in the same appointment. Group
      D, will receive Multical as a direct pulp capping agent. Specimens will be assessed in the
      terms of dentinal bridge formation, its appearance compared to natural dentin, its thickness
      and inflammatory pulpal response. The last item will be scored 0-3 in which 0 corresponds to
      none, 1 to minimal, 2 to moderate and 3 to severe inflammation. In case of an abscess or true
      tissue necrosis, a score of 4 will be given as recommended by ISO / TC 7405.
