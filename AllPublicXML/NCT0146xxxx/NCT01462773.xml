      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and dose limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) of VELCADE when administered in combination with interferon-alpha-2b
      (IFN-α-2b) to patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.

      The primary objective of this study is to:

      • Determine the safety, tolerability and DLTs of VELCADE when administered in combination
      with interferon-alpha-2b (IFN-α-2b) to patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to:

        -  Document any objective anti-tumor responses that may occur in response to this treatment
           regimen.

        -  Document the time to tumor progression in patients receiving this treatment regimen.

        -  Measure levels of the cell cycle proteins p21 and p27 in PBMCs and tumor biopsies
           obtained pre-study and during week 4 of Cycle 1 (Day 26).

        -  Conduct histologic evaluations of microvessel density, tumor apoptosis and lymphocytic
           infiltrates within tumor biopsies obtained pre- and post-study.

        -  Measure plasma levels of bFGF and VEGF over the course of the study.

        -  Monitor the effects of proteasome inhibition on the biological activity of IFN-α within
           immune cells by measuring Jak-STAT signal transduction in patient PBMCs.

    <description>A standard method for the design of this study. Initially, three patients will be treated at a starting dose of VELCADE (1.0 mg/m2). If one of the three patients demonstrates a DLT, then an additional 3 patients will be treated at that dose level. If only one of the six show DLT, then the next cohort of three patients will be entered at the next dose level (1.3 mg/m2). If two or more of the six demonstrate DLT, no further patients will be treated at that dose level. The highest dose level at which less than 2 patients experienced DLT will be expanded to six patients.</description>

After three patients have received 5 weeks of therapy (1 cycle) at the initial dose of VELCADE (1.0 mg/m2, Cohort 1) with no dose limiting toxicity, the dose will be raised to 1.3 mg/m2 for the next cohort of three patients. If this dose level is well-tolerated in three consecutive patients, the dose of VELCADE will be raised to 1.6 mg/m2.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  must have histological or cytological diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma and clinical
             evidence of metastatic, non-resectable regional lymphatic, or extensive in transit
             recurrent disease. Patients who have had resected metastases will also be eligible
             provided they have measurable disease.

             measurable lesion.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥ 60%).

             method of birth control (ie, a hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine device, diaphragm
             with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of the study.
             Male subjects must agree to use an acceptable method for contraception for the
             duration of the study.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function.

          -  Prior Therapy: Patients with an ECOG performance status of ≤ 2 will be eligible for
             this protocol regardless of the number of prior treatments provided they have
             recovered from the reversible effects of prior therapy. Patients are permitted to have
             received therapy with adjuvant IFN-α2b, if it was completed &gt; 6 months prior to
             enrollment in the current study.

          -  Patients with brain metastases are eligible for entry into the study, but must have
             received definitive therapy consisting of external beam radiation therapy, gamma knife
             therapy or surgical resection and be clinically stable. Four weeks after the
             definitive therapy is completed, repeat MRI or CT scans must demonstrate stabilization
             of disease, and there must be no requirement for Decadron. If the patient does not
             have brain metastases, then only one brain CT or MRI is required prior to enrollment
             on study.

               -  Patient has an absolute neutrophil count of &lt; 1.0 x 109/L within 14 days before
                  enrollment.

          -  Patient has a calculated or measured creatinine clearance of &lt; 30 mL/minute within 14
             days before enrollment.

             central nervous system disease.

          -  Patient has ≥Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy within 14 days before enrollment.

          -  Patient has hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron or mannitol.

          -  Female subject is pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Received other investigational drugs with 14 days before enrollment.

          -  Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this

Folllowing cycle 1, bortezomib was administered in combination iwth IFN-a. Bortezomib was administered in escalating doses to cohorts of 3 patients.</description>

          <title>Determine Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) of VELCADE When Administered in Combination With IFN-α-2b to Patients With Metastatic Malignant Melanoma.</title>
          <description>A standard method for the design of this study. Initially, three patients will be treated at a starting dose of VELCADE (1.0 mg/m2). If one of the three patients demonstrates a DLT, then an additional 3 patients will be treated at that dose level. If only one of the six show DLT, then the next cohort of three patients will be entered at the next dose level (1.3 mg/m2). If two or more of the six demonstrate DLT, no further patients will be treated at that dose level. The highest dose level at which less than 2 patients experienced DLT will be expanded to six patients.</description>
