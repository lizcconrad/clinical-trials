  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-center, two-cohort, three-period study in healthy adult subjects.
      Approximately 16 healthy subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 1 to provide data from 14
      evaluable subjects. Approximately 12 healthy subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 2 to provide
      data from 10 evaluable subjects. Subjects will have a screening visit within 30 days prior to
      the first dose of study drug, three treatment periods, and a follow-up visit 7-14 days after
      the last dose of study drug. There will be a washout period between Period 1 and Period 2 but
      no washout between Period 2 and Period 3. Day 1 of Period 3 will start the day after the last
      day in Period 2. The study will be conducted on an out-patient basis except for days where
      serial pharmacokinetic sampling and safety assessments are scheduled.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5xULN (isolated
             bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin
             &lt;35%).

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator feels that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

             result within 3 months of screening

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study as defined in the

             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Lactating females.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.
