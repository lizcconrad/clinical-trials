  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mental imagery has been used in a variety of pathological instances in support to classical
      therapeutic treatments. The aim of the present study was to observe the effect of internal
      Kinesthetic and external Visual Imagery to improve proprioceptive feedback in low back pain.
      Fifty-five subjects with a history of low back pain were included in two experimental groups
      who used mental imagery and one control group who did not. The results showed the
      effectiveness of the Internal Kinesthetic Imagery to improve the accuracy of repositioning of
      lumbo-sacral spine that may subsequently improve the quality of the proprioceptive input. The
      possibility to use effectively mental imagery, as a part of proprioceptive rehabilitation
      process, is the principal outcome of this study.

        Fifty-five patients, with a history of common low back pain, have participated to the
        study. The subjects have been randomly distributed in two experimental groups and one
        control group. The gender, age, weight and height characteristics of the three groups
        (Visual Imagery Group, VIG; Kinesthetic Imagery Group, KIG; and Control Group, CG) are
        presented in Table 1. The patients presented no history of neurological or psychiatric
        disease, and gave their informed written consent.
