    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multicenter study of the LPS-Flex Porous Femoral Components when used
      in primary total knee arthroplasty. The purpose of the study is to obtain short-, mid-, and
      long-term clinical outcomes and implant survivorship data for the NexGen LPS-Flex Porous
      Femoral components.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Survival and outcome data on the NexGen LPS-Flex Porous Femoral Components will be done by an
      analysis of standard scoring system, radiographs and adverse event records. Survivorship will
      be evaluated by monitoring the frequency and incidence of adverse events, serious adverse
      events, adverse device effects, serious adverse device effects, and unanticipated adverse
      device effects. Outcomes will be measured by comparing the overall pain and function
      performances (based on the Knee Society Scoring System), survivorship, subject quality of
      life and radiographic parameters of study subjects receiving the LPS-Flex Porous Femoral
      Components.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient 18-75 years of age, inclusive;

          -  Patient qualifies for a total knee arthroplasty based on physical exam and medical
             history including at least one of the following: rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis,
             traumatic arthritis, polyarthritis, collagen disorders, avascular necrosis of the
             femoral condyle;

          -  Post-Traumatic loss of joint configuration, particularly when there is patellofemoral
             erosion, dysfunction or prior patellectomy;

          -  Moderate valgus, varus, or flexion deformities;

          -  Patient has undergone a study related informed consent process;

          -  Patient is willing and able to provide written consent;

          -  Patient is willing and able to cooperate in the required post-operative therapy;

          -  Patient is willing and able to complete scheduled follow-up evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has previous history of infection in the affected joint and/or a local or
             systemic infection that could affect the prosthetic joint;

          -  Insufficient bone stock on femoral or tibial surfaces;

          -  Skeletal immaturity;

          -  Neuropathic arthropathy;

          -  Osteoporosis or any loss of musculature or neuromuscular disease that compromises the
             affected limb;

          -  Stable, painless arthrodesis in a satisfactory functional position;

          -  Severe instability secondary to the absence of collateral ligament integrity;

          -  Patient has rheumatoid arthritis and an ulcer of the skin or a history of recurrent
             breakdown of the skin because of their risk of postoperative infection is greater;

          -  Patient has a known sensitivity or allergy to one or more of the implanted materials;

          -  Patient is pregnant or considered a member of a protected population (e.g., prisoner,
             mental incompetence, unable to understand what clinical trial participation entails,
             etc.)
