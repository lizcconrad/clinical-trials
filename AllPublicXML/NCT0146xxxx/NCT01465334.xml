  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to examine how two separate groups of 17p deletion Chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) participants respond to sequential treatment with this particular
      combination of drugs. The two groups are those participants who have previously received
      treatment for their CLL and those who have not yet received any treatment. The combination of
      drugs is Ofatumumab and High-Dose Methylprednisolone (HDMP) first followed by Ofatumumab and
      Alemtuzumab. All three drugs are FDA approved and have known activity in treating 17p CLL. We
      hope that by combining these drugs together in this study, they will have more benefit than
      each one alone and that the subjects' CLL will be significantly impacted.

      There are three possible components to the treatment in this study:

      Part A - Ofatumumab + HDMP

        -  A maximum of 4 cycles of 28 days. Ofatumumab and HDMP will be given intravenously.
           Ofatumumab will given on days 1, 8, 15 and 22. HDMP will given on days 1, 2, and 3.

      Part B - Ofatumumab + Alemtuzumab

        -  Subjects who have not experienced a Complete Response with no residual detectable
           disease after Part A will continue on to Part B.

        -  A maximum of 6 cycles of 28 days. Ofatumumab will be given intravenously on day 1 and
           Alemtuzumab will be given as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection on days 1, 3, 5,
           8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24 and 26.

      Part C - Maintenance with Ofatumumab + Alemtuzumab

        -  Subjects who have experienced at least stable disease in Parts A and B can continue on
           to Part C. Subjects who are eligible may instead proceed to stem cell transplantation
           after Parts A and B.

        -  Part C is a maximum of 26 cycles of 28 days. Ofatumumab will be given intravenously
           every other cycle. Alemtuzumab will be given as a subcutaneous injection every 14 days.

      During all cycles subjects will also have clinical exams, and blood tests; imaging tests (CT
      scans), bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and serum pregnancy tests (if applicable) will occur
      at various intervals.

All toxicities encountered during the study will be evaluated according to the NCI criteria and recorded prior to each course of therapy.</description>
