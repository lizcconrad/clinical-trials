  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The next four decades will see a marked expansion of the elderly population in Ireland, in
      particular people aged over 80 yrs. Persons aged over 80 are the highest consumers of
      prescription medicines in Ireland and have the highest prevalence rates of major
      polypharmacy. Polypharmacy is intimately linked with serious adverse drug events (ADEs) and
      consequent major morbidity and mortality. Epidemiological data from the Unites States
      indicate that ADEs is the fifth most common cause of death nationally. Experts suggest that
      effective evidence based interventions can be applied to this major public health problem.

      A recently described approach to hospitalised older patients' medication optimisation is that
      of Spinewine and colleagues at Louvain University, Belgium. In this model, a pharmacist with
      expertise in geriatric pharmacotherapy routinely reviews the prescriptions of older patients
      from admission to discharge. The pharmacist provides a detailed pharmaceutical care plan for
      older patients and their carers where appropriate as well as feedback information to
      prescribers in the event of detecting instances of probable medication inappropriateness.
      Whenever an opportunity for medication optimisation is identified, the pharmacist discusses
      the opportunity with the prescriber who can accept or reject the intervention. At discharge
      from hospital, the pharmacist also provides written and verbal information on treatment
      changes to the patient / caregiver and GP. The intervention therefore represents a
      comprehensive pharmaceutical care approach that is based upon careful review and subsequent
      consensus on individualised pharmacotherapy. In an RCT comparison of this approach with
      standard care, older patients in the intervention arm of the study had significant
      improvements in medication appropriateness (medication appropriateness index (MAI), Beers'
      criteria, and Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders (ACOVE) criteria.). Expert pharmacist
      review of older peoples' medication in hospital is a proven intervention in term of reducing
      inappropriateness of medication.

    <description>The researcher will apply the pharmacist intervention to the cases randomised to this arm of the study. This consists of an expert pharmacist review of the patients prescribed medications at the time of recruitment into the study. Recommendations following the intervention will be communicated both verbally and in writing to the medical team with primary responsibility for the patient. Recommendations arising from the intervention will be printed out and inserted into the patients' notes, in addition to the relevant registrar being informed in person or via the telephone.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients aged 65 years and over presenting to CUH Accident and Emergency
             Departments with acute illness for admission under a medical team will be eligible for
             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age less than 65 years.

          2. Patient to be admitted under the care of a Geriatrician Psychiatrist of Old Age or
             Clinical Pharmacologist, or having been admitted under these services or attended
             their outpatient clinics in the previous 12 months. (These doctor groups are likely to
             minimise inappropriate medications in this population).

          3. Terminally ill patient attended by palliative care team.

          4. Critically ill patient e.g. admitted to Intensive Care Unit.

          5. Patients who do not wish to participate in the study.

          6. Patients whose hospital physician does not wish to participate in the study ver, its
             efficacy in terms of ADE prevention is not yet demonstrated.
