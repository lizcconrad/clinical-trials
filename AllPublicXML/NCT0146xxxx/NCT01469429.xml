    <textblock>
      This randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best way to give lyophilized
      black raspberries in preventing oral cancer in high-risk patients previously diagnosed with
      stage I-IV or in situ head and neck cancer. Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to
      keep cancer from forming. The use of lyophilized black raspberries may prevent oral cancer.
      Studying samples of oral cavity scrapings, blood, urine, and saliva in the laboratory from
      patients receiving lyophilized black raspberries may help doctors learn more about changes
      that occur in DNA and the effect of lyophilized back raspberries on biomarkers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the adherence of post-surgical head and neck (HN) cancer patients to clinical
      trial design expectations and define tolerability and potential adverse effects of long-term
      black raspberry administration in this patient cohort.

      II. Determine the effects of dose and delivery vehicle on the degree of uptake of black
      raspberry components in target oral tissues of post-surgical HN cancer patients over time and
      determine the relationships between adherence/exposure data and uptake.

      III. Determine the ability of black raspberries to modulate patterns of gene expression
      within key regulatory pathways in &quot;at-risk normal&quot; oral mucosa of post-surgical HN cancer
      patients that would favor the inhibition, delay or reversal of oral carcinogenesis.

      IV. Determine the persistence of modulation of &quot;berry-responsive genes&quot; for 2 years following
      commencement of black raspberry treatment and preliminarily define rate of recurrence and
      second primary oral cancers in a former oral cancer patient sub-cohort.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive lozenge placebo orally (PO) four times daily (QID).

      ARM II: Patients receive lyophilized black raspberries lozenge PO QID.

      ARM III: Patients receive Saliva Substitute placebo PO QID.

      ARM IV: Patients receive lyophilized black raspberries Saliva Substitute PO QID.

      In all arms, treatment continues for 6 months. Oral cavity scrapings, blood, urine, and
      saliva samples are collected periodically for laboratory analyses.

      After completion of study treatment, some patients are followed up at weeks 1-5 and then at
      2, 6, 12, and 18 months.

    <measure>Define tolerability and potential adverse effects of long-term black raspberry administration of post-surgical HN cancer patients</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Use diaries and collection of &quot;empties&quot; over 6-month treatment period. Test both measures simultaneously using global test. Two measures tested individually at alpha=0.05 if global test is significant. First check for interaction effect between dose and delivery with double-sided test at alpha=0.01. If that isn't significant, use data from both doses to perform a double-sided alpha=0.05 on difference in compliance between delivery methods. Dose response effect in compliance also tested. Exploring for interaction effects with continued tobacco use vs not and oral cavity patients vs others.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Effects of dose and delivery vehicle on the degree of uptake of black raspberry components in target oral tissues of post-surgical HN cancer patients over time and determine the relationships between adherence/exposure data and uptake.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>A double-sided test at alpha=0.05 and a mean summary across the repeated measures to test the difference in delivery methods will be used. Relationship between diary compliance and empties records and the two berry components measures over time will be modeled. The critical statistical result from this analysis will be the degree to which the individual patient's trends in the compliance measures correlate with the trends for the two components measured. Interaction effects with continued tobacco use will also be checked.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between change in gene expression within key regulatory pathways and dose and delivery method</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Using qRT-PCR measurements for each of 8 genes. Multiple endpoint approach for each gene will be used. Linear mixed models will be used for the repeated measures. Global test at 0.05 to decide superior delivery method. Mean summary statistic across the repeated measures will be used. Interaction effect of dose and delivery tested. Test for interaction of tobacco use at 0.05. Proc Mixed used to estimate both within person (over time changes) and between person relationships across berry components and pathway measures.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sustainability of the measures within genes found to show significant berry effects beyond the 6-month exposure period</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Slopes of change (toward baseline) estimated. Hypothesis testing to rule out chance as explanation of changes toward baseline in the berry exposed groups. Relationship between sustainability and the delivery dose studied. Effects on sustainability of continued or changing tobacco use will be estimated. Measures during extended follow-up that are clear indicators of efficacy will be collected.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible subjects includes all adult HN cancer patients who have been previously
             diagnosed with Stage 1-4 and in-situ squamous cell carcinoma within the past 36 months
             (mos); with or without further adjuvant therapy and have been determined to be disease
             free at the time of consent

          -  Patients must be able to take nutrition/medications orally

          -  Have no prior history of intolerance or allergy to berry or berry-containing products

          -  Patients taking cyclooxygenase (COX)-1/COX-2 inhibitors (Indomethacin, Ibuprofen,
             celebrex) chronically, herbal supplements, who cannot be taken off the
             medication/supplement due to their clinical condition are eligible to participate in
             the study but should document daily doses of these medications in their logbooks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of intolerance (including hypersensitivity or allergy) to berry or
             berry-containing products

          -  Inability to take oral nutrition/liquids or history of aspiration pneumonia

          -  Pregnant women: Although there are no known adverse effects of black raspberries upon
             the fetus, if patients become pregnant during period of lyophilized black raspberries
             (LBR) administration, then LBR will be discontinued and patient will be removed from
             the study; we should however emphasize, given this is a food based-study, that risks
             are likely extremely low even though a participant should become pregnant; as such, we
             are not recommending active contraception for women, but rather if participants become
             pregnant, that they notify their study doctor, and that they will likely be removed
             from study; there are no expected or logical risks if men were to father a child, and
             as such, no contraception will be recommended for men

          -  Inability to grant informed consent

          -  Strict Vegetarians will be excluded from the study; it was found that consuming one
             portion per day of fruit or vegetables resulted in a significant decrease in oral
             cancer incidence; in those persons consuming multiple portions each day, there was a
             50% reduction in risk; we assume that strict vegetarians will consume multiple
             portions each day of foods with chemopreventive activity and therefore inclusion of
             these individuals would have a negative impact on the study; there are several reports
             in the literature that herbal or multivitamin/mineral supplements have no effect on
             oral cancer incidence
