    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the effect of Clarithromycin on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      LY2216684 in healthy participants. Side effects will be documented. There will be 2 study
      periods (5 and 9 days) and follow up will occur at least 7 days after the last dose.
      Screening is required within 45 days prior to the start of the study.
