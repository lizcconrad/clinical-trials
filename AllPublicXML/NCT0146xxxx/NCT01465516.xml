      Hypothesis Response guided therapy improves significantly the overall SVR in Hispanics
      compared to historical control. There is no difference in SVR between patients with an
      undetectable HCV RNA at week 8 and week 28 who received a 4 week lead-in of PR plus 24 weeks
      of PR+BOC based treatment and patients with detectable HCV RNA at week 8 and undetectable HCV
      RNA at week 24 who received a lead-in of PR plus 32 weeks PR+BOC followed by based therapy
      and 12 weeks of PR.

      STUDY DESIGN AND ENROLLMENT Open label single arm pilot study enrolling Hispanic patients
      with HCV genotype 1 and naive to pegylated interferon and BOC treatment.

      Definition of BOC RGT:

      All patients will receive 4 weeks of PR (lead-in), and BOC will be added at the beginning of
      week 5. Patients who have an undetectable HCV RNA at week 8 and week 24 will receive 24 weeks
      of PR and BOC (28 weeks total treatment); patients who have a detectable HCV RNA at week 8,
      but an undetectable HCV RNA at week 24, will receive an additional 32 weeks of PR and BOC,
      followed by 12 weeks of PR (48 weeks total treatment).

      Patients with cirrhosis or bridging fibrosis (Stage 4 fibrosis) will receive 4 weeks of lead
      in followed by 44 weeks of BOC and PR (total 48 weeks).

    <description>Historical group will be a continuous group of Hispanic patients with genotype 1 who were naive to treatment and completed or initiated 48 weeks of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Patients, who discontinued the treatment due to side effects, adherence issues, or treatment failure, will be included and analyzed based on intention to treat analysis. All patients will be stratified according to their SVR, relapse and no response rate. RVR, EVR, and ETR will be also collated and compared to the study group.</description>

Using the RGT guidelines in patients who are previously untreated: all patients will receive a lead-in treatment of PR for 4 weeks, then BOC will be added to PR for 4 weeks; based on patient's week 8 HCV RNA results</description>

             investigator, an acute decrease in hemoglobin by up to 4 g/dL (as may be seen with
             ribavirin therapy) would not be well tolerated.
