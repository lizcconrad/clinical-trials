      Primary Objective:

      The objective of the study is to investigate the effect of a specific frequency of
      Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) on glycemic control and quality of life in patients
      with type 2 diabetes and who are in stable good glycemic control and using 1 insulin
      injection daily.

      The research question is:

      Does a less intensive frequency of SMBG in insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes, who
      are in stable good glycemic control, using 1 insulin injection daily, lead to a clinically
      relevant increase of HbA1c (an increase of 0.5%) and what is the effect on quality of life?

      Secondary objectives:

      The secondary objectives is to investigate the effect of a specific frequency of SMBG on the
      number of hypo and hyper glycaemia, number of extra diabetes-related contacts with the health
      care provider, and the diabetes medication.

      SUMMARY

      Rationale:

      Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is an important tool in diabetes care to achieve and
      maintain good glycemic control. But how often 'should' the patient measure the capillary
      glucose concentration? There is no general agreement between professionals, and there is no
      evidence for a specific frequency and timing.

      Objective:

      The objective of the study is to investigate the effect of a specific frequency of SMBG on
      glycemic control and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes and who are in stable
      good glycemic control and using 1 insulin injection daily.

      Study design:

      An open Randomised Controlled Trial.

      Study population:

      Patients with insulin-treated diabetes type 2, &gt; 18 years of age, using 1 insulin injection
      daily, performing SMBG &gt; 1 year, HbA1c ≤ 58 mmol/mol (&lt; 7.5%) in the preceding 12 months,
      sufficient knowledge of the Dutch language, no hypo-unawareness, no serious co-morbidity

      Intervention:

      Patients are instructed to measure their blood glucose concentrations 4 times per day
      (pre-prandial and before bedtime) one day weekly in group A, one day per two weeks in group B
      and one day monthly in group C. Patients are asked to keep a diary with the readings and the
      probably extra measurements, including the reasons.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      The main study parameters are glycemic control and quality of life. A difference of &gt; 0.5% (&gt;
      5.5 mmol/mol) in HbA1c is considered to be relevant. Quality of life is measured with 3
      validated questionnaires.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness:

      Patients in this study are used to perform SMBG. During the study, they are asked to monitor
      their glucose concentrations in a controlled, specific frequency (different kind of usual
      care are compared). And they are asked to fill in 3 questionnaires in the beginning and at
      the end of the study. Extra HbA1c measurements can be necessary. No side effects are
      expected, but safety is incorporated through HbA1c measurements every 3 months and every 3
      months the diary will be discussed in the scheduled visits. Furthermore, extra measurements
      are allowed when necessary.

    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary study parameter is quality of life. The quality of life is measured by 3 validated questionnaires: the 12-item Short Form Health Survey, the 20-item Problems Areas in Diabetes Scale (PAID) and the 13-item Summary of Diabetes Self care Activities. Furthermore, the glucose concentrations measured by SMBG should be between 4-7 mmol/l, preprandial and between 8-10 mmol/l before bed time. The endpoint is the number of glucose concentrations who are out of range at every 4th week.The number of hypo and hyperglycaemia are reported in the diary.</description>
