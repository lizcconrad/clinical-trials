  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and fatty liver hepatitis (NASH) are very common in
      the Western world and strongly associated with obesity. No known effective treatment is
      known. From animal studies, it is known that the compound resveratrol perhaps has the
      potential to neutralize obesity-induced diseases. Resveratrol is already widely used as a
      food supplement though the precise effects are unknown. This project focuses on the effect of
      Resveratrol on fatty liver disease. The researchers plan to investigate the effects of
      Resveratrol or placebo treatment for 6 months on NAFLD/NASH in obese patients.

      Obesity is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis
      (NASH) and recently, low-grade inflammation has been hypothesized to be the causative link.
      From animal studies, it is known that the compound resveratrol (RES) has strong
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and perhaps the potential to neutralize
      obesity-induced diseases. RES is already widely used as a food supplement though the precise
      effects are unknown. This project focuses on the effect of RES on fatty liver disease. In a
      double-blind controlled clinical trial, the researchers investigate the effects of RES 500 mg
      or placebo treatment x 3 daily for 6 months on NAFLD/NASH in 48 obese patients in a
      double-blind, randomised, controlled clinical trial. The researchers hypothesize that RES
      improves the ALT levels and reduces liver fat and inflammation assessed by MR spectroscopy
      and histological evaluation.
