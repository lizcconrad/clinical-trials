  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imatinib 400mg daily is the current NICE-approved standard treatment for newly diagnosed
      Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML). 5 yr follow up of CML patients treated in this way indicates
      an 89% probability of progression-free survival. Imatinib is not tolerated or effective in
      some patients however, and a proportion of patients become resistant to the drug. SPIRIT 2
      study aims to establish whether a new drug, dasatinib, is superior to imatinib in terms of
      event free survival and therefore will be an effective first-line therapy for newly-diagnosed
      CML patients. This study will also provide crucial long-term survival, quality of life and
      health economic data to assist health care providers and managers to determine the most
      cost-effective drug therapy for CML.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          2. Patients must have all of the following:

               -  be enrolled within 3 months of initial diagnosis of CML-CP (date of initial
                  diagnosis is the date of first cytogenetic analysis)

               -  cytogenetic confirmation of the Philadelphia chromosome or variants of (9;22)
                  translocations

               -  patients may have secondary chromosomal abnormalities in addition to the
                  Philadelphia chromosome.

               -  &lt; 15% blasts in peripheral blood and bone marrow;

               -  &lt; 30% blasts plus promyelocytes in peripheral blood and bone marrow;

               -  &lt; 20% basophils in peripheral blood,

               -  100 x 109/L platelets or greater

               -  no evidence of extramedullary leukaemic involvement, with the exception of the
                  hepatosplenomegaly.

          3. Written voluntary informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with Ph-negative, BCR-ABL-positive, disease are NOT eligible for the study.

          2. Any prior treatment for CML with: any tyrosine kinase inhibitor (eg imatinib,
             dasatinib); busulphan; interferon-alpha; homoharringtonine; cytosine arabinoside; any
             other investigational agents (hydroxycarbamide and anagrelide are the only drugs
             permitted). NB patients will be ineligible for the study if they have received ANY
             prior therapy with interferon-alpha or imatinib. NO exceptions.

          3. Patients who received prior chemotherapy, including regimens used in peripheral blood
             progenitor cells (PBPCs) mobilisation for haematopoietic progenitor-cell
