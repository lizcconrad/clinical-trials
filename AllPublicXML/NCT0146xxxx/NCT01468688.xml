    <description>The study will comprise of 2 parts. A dose escalation and a dose expansion part. Patients will receive increasing doses of BKM120 (40, 60, 80, 100 mg) in combination with 400mg imatinib daily until maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and rapid phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined. 35 patients will enter the expansion phase with 18 patients having a pharmacokinetic (PK) run-in period of 8 days receiving imatinib monotherapy or BKM120 monotherapy.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age

          2. WHO performance status (PS) of 0-2

          3. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of GIST that is unresectable or metastatic

          4. Available tissue specimen:

               -  Dose-escalation cohorts: patients must have available archival tumor tissue which
                  can be shipped during the course of the study

               -  Dose-expansion cohort: patients must have available archival tumor tissue which
                  can be shipped during the course of the study and must agree to a fresh
                  pre-treatment biopsy.

          5. Failed prior therapy with imatinib followed by sunitinib for the treatment of
             unresectable or metastatic GIST. Note the following specific criteria for the two
             phases of the trial:

               -  Dose-escalation cohorts: patients who failed prior therapy with imatinib and then
                  have failed therapy with sunitinib. Treatment failure may be due to either
                  disease progression on therapy (both imatinib and sunitinib) or intolerance to
                  therapy (sunitinib). Dose-escalation cohort patients may have had additional
                  lines of therapy not limited to imatinib and sunitinib.

               -  Dose-expansion cohort: patients must have documented disease progression on both
                  imatinib and sunitinib. In addition, patients may have had no more than two lines
                  of prior therapy (i.e. treatment with imatinib followed by treatment with
                  sunitinib).

               -  Adjuvant imatinib will not count as a prior course of imatinib for the purposes
                  of this criterion

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous treatment with PI3-K inhibitors

          2. A medical history of any of the following mood disorders as judged by the Investigator
             or a psychiatrist:

               -  Medically documented history of or active major depressive episode, bipolar
                  disorder (I or II), obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, a history of
                  suicidal attempt or thoughts, or homicidal thoughts (immediate risk of doing harm
                  to others)

               -  ≥ CTCAE grade 3 anxiety

          3. When completing the patient questionnaires at screening:

               -  Meets the cut-off score of ≥ 10 in the nine item depression scale of the Patient
                  Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) or a cut-off of ≥ 15 in the Generalized Anxiety
                  Disorder Assessment (GAD 7) mood scale respectively, or

               -  Selects positive response of 1, 2, 3 to question number 9 regarding potential for
                  suicidal thoughts or ideation in the PHQ-9 (independent of the total score of the
                  PHQ-9)

          4. Severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator could cause unacceptable safety risks or compromise compliance with the
             protocol (e.g. acute or chronic liver, pancreatic, severe renal disease considered
             unrelated to study disease, chronic pulmonary disease including dyspnea at rest from
             any cause).

          5. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (defined as HbA1c &gt; 8%)

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
