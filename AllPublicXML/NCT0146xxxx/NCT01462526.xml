  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current screening methods for glaucoma detection are not perfect and nearly half of those in
      the United States with glaucoma go undiagnosed. Minority populations are even less likely to
      be diagnosed. Better screening methods are needed to identify the undiagnosed and to provide
      them care that can help them retain good vision.

      Glaucoma is often more severe in one eye and this fact can be exploited in screening tests.
      The investigators plan to use a novel screening device that very accurately records the
      pupillary response from each eye. It is likely that patients with glaucoma will have abnormal
      responses when measured, and by comparing responses between the two eyes the investigators
      will be able to determine who has glaucoma. If this test works well, it will provide a
      low-cost way to screen populations at risk for glaucoma. Furthermore, this research will
      expand the knowledge base regarding how pupil responses to light differ between persons with
      and without glaucoma. Insights gained from this study will be useful in the development of an
      effective screening tool in the detection of glaucoma.

      Glaucoma is often asymmetric in nature, and an afferent pupillary defect (APD) is frequently
      present in persons with glaucoma. The investigators propose to conduct a clinic-based
      prospective study to assess the accuracy of using a binocular pupillographic device (RAPiD,
      Konan Medical, USA) to detect people with glaucoma. This device is designed to record and
      analyze pupil responses at multiple, controlled stimulus intensities, while using varied
      patterns and color stimuli.

      The asymmetric nature of glaucoma suggests that a high proportion of persons with glaucoma
      will have an APD (although many may be subtle and would be missed with less refined testing
      methods). When glaucoma patients have severe nerve damage or when field loss is bilateral and
      symmetric, an APD may not be present or may be too small to detect. Noting this limitation,
      the investigators will compare pupillary responses to stimuli at different locations (for
      example the superior compared to the inferior hemifield) to determine whether the
      investigators can detect asymmetric glaucoma damage within the same eye. In addition, it is
      likely that the pupil response in glaucoma will be diminished when compared to normal, which
      will also help with detection.

      Aim1: To examine the amplitude, latency and velocity of the pupil light reflex by optimizing
      its measurement to stimuli of various intensities and colors, and to characterize the
      variability of this response in normal subjects.

      Aim2: To quantify the amount of structural loss (retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and
      optic nerve head parameters) and functional loss (visual field mean deviation) necessary for
      an APD (as detected by RAPiD) to manifest.

      Aim3a: To develop an algorithm that best discriminates those with and without glaucoma by
      individual or combined use of 1) detecting an APD between the two eyes, 2) comparing pupil
      responses in different parts of the visual field within the same eye, and 3) comparing
      responses of diseased eyes to responses of &quot;normal&quot; eyes.

      Aim 3b: To assess the validity of this algorithm in glaucoma detection and to assess the
      reproducibility of the pupil response measurements at a follow-up visit within 7 months.

        Patients with glaucoma, glaucoma suspects, or ocular hypertension who present to the
        glaucoma service at the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute. We will also recruit normal
        subjects from the accompanying persons of patients attending examinations who are not blood
        relatives of the patient.
