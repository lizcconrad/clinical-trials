      Background:

      - AZD7451 is a drug that may help interfere with brain tumor cell growth. It can prevent
      glioma cells from entering into normal brain tissue, and slow or stop the growth of
      additional tumors. Researchers want to see if AZD7451 is effective against gliomas that have
      not responded to surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy.

      Objectives:

      - To see if AZD7451 is a safe and effective treatment for gliomas that have not responded to
      standard treatments.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have gliomas that have not responded to standard
      treatments.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, blood and urine
           tests, heart function tests, an eye exam, and imaging studies.

        -  Participants will take AZD7451 daily by mouth for 28-day cycles of treatment.

        -  Participants will keep a medication diary and record any side effects. Treatment will be
           monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.

        -  Treatment will continue as long as there are no serious side effects and the tumor does
           not start growing again.

      BACKGROUND:

      Recurrent glioma patients have very limited treatment options. A major cause of gliomarelated
      morbidity and mortality is the extensive infiltrative and invasive nature of glioma cells.
      Thus, inhibition of glioma invasion is a potentially promising strategy.

      Work in the Neuro-Oncology Branch laboratory of Dr. Howard Fine has identified TrkA as an
      important signaling receptor for mediating glioma cell invasion. Both genetic and
      pharmacological inhibition of Trk potently inhibits glioma invasion and tumor progression in
      vitro and in vivo. AZD7451 is a first in-class inhibitor of Trk.

      OBJECTIVES:

      To establish the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of continuous twice a day AZD7451 dosing in
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma not on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED).

      To generate pharmacokinetic data on continuous twice a day AZD7451 dosing.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Patients with histologically proven glioblastoma are eligible for this study. Patients should
      have failed prior standard treatment with radiotherapy.

      DESIGN:

      This study will accrue up to 60 evaluable patients. Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients will receive
      continuous AZD7451 twice a day orally for 28 days. The MTD will be based on the tolerability
      observed during the first 4 weeks of treatment only. Up to three patients may be enrolled
      simultaneously at each dose level. The dose of AZD7451 can be progressively escalated if only
      0/3 or 1/6 patients experience a dose limiting toxicity at the prior dose level.

      At the end of Cycle 1, patients may choose to continue to receive AZD7451 until disease
      progression or until they experience unmanageable drug related toxicity, as long as they are
      continuing to derive clinical benefit and do not fulfill any of the criteria for removal from
      protocol therapy. Each cycle during this extension period will last 28 days.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients with histologically proven malignant primary gliomas who have progressive
             disease after radiotherapy will be eligible for this protocol.

          -  Patients must have an MRI scan performed within 14 days prior to registration and on a
             fixed dose of steroids for at least 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased between
             the date of imaging and registration a new baseline MRI is required.

          -  Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be
             eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply:

               1. Patients will be eligible four weeks after surgery if they have recovered from
                  the effects of surgery.

               2. Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for
                  eligibility into the study. To best assess the extent of residual disease
                  postoperatively, an MRI should be done:

          -  no later than 96 hours in the immediate post-operative period or

          -  at least 4 weeks post-operatively, and

          -  within 14 days of registration, and

          -  on a stable steroid dosage for at least 5 days.

        If the 96 hour scan is more than 14 days before registration, the scan needs to be
        repeated. If the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and registration, a
        new baseline MRI is required on a stable steroid dosage for at least 5 days.

          -  Patients must have failed prior radiation therapy.

          -  Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) (if the patient is
             deemed by the treating physician to be cognitively impaired or questionably impaired
             in such a way that the ability of the patient to give informed consent is
             questionable) to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study.

          -  Patients must be greater than or equal to18 years old, and must have a life expectancy
             &gt; 8 weeks. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use
             of AZD7451 in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but
             may be eligible for future pediatric trials.

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60

          -  Patients must be at least 4 weeks from radiation therapy. Additionally, patients must
             be at least 6 weeks from nitrosoureas, 4 weeks from temozolomide, 3 weeks from
             procarbazine, 2 weeks from vincristine and 2 weeks from last bevacizumab
             administration. Patients must be at least 4 weeks from other cytotoxic therapies not
             listed above and 2 weeks for non-cytotoxic agents (e.g., interferon, tamoxifen)
             including investigative agents. With the exception of alopecia, all toxicities from
             prior therapies should be resolved to CTCAE less than or equal to grade 1.

          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (WBC greater than or equal to
             3,000/microl, ANC greater than or equal to 1,500/mm(3), platelet count of greater than
             or equal to 100,000/mm(3), and hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 gm/dl), adequate
             liver function (AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5 times ULN
             and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN), and adequate renal function
             (creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN and/or creatinine clearance greater
             than or equal to 50 cc/min calculated by Cockcroft-Gault) before starting therapy.
             Patients must also have serum potassium greater than or equal to 3.5 mmol/L,
             magnesium, phosphate and calcium levels within normal levels; supplementation is
             allowed. In cases where the serum calcium is below the normal range, 2 options would
             be available: 1) the calcium adjusted for albumin is to be obtained and substituted
             for the measured serum value. Exclusion is to then be based on the adjusted for
             albumin values falling below the normal limit. 2) Determine the ionized calcium
             levels. Exclusion is then to be based on whether these ionized calcium levels are out
             of normal range despite supplementation. These tests must be performed within 14 days
             prior to registration. Eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by transfusion.

          -  Patients must either not be receiving steroids, or be on a stable dose of steroids for
             at least five days prior to registration.

          -  The effects of AZD7451 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and
             because AZD7451 is known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men
             must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or herpartner is
             participating in this study, the treating physician should be informed immediately.

          -  A 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to be performed within 2 weeks of trial entry with
             QTc less than or equal to 470 msec.

          -  Patients must have normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF greater than or
             equal to 55% or normal by NIH Clinical Center criteria).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients who, in the view of the treating physician, have significant active hepatic,
             renal, pulmonary or psychiatric diseases are ineligible.

          -  2 Prior treatment with AZD7451.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to active metabolites or excipients of AZD7451.

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular event (e.g. myocardial infarction, angina
             pectoris, coronary artery bypass graft, angioplasty, vascular stent, superior vena
             cava syndrome (SVC), New York Heart Association (NYHA, Appendix I) classification of
             heart disease &gt;2 within 6 months before entry; or presence of cardiac disease that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia.

          -  Hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, including transient ischemic attacks and other central
             nervous system bleeding in the preceding 6 months that were not related to glioma
             surgery. History of prior intratumoral bleeding is not an exclusion criterion;
             patients with history of prior intratumoral bleeding, however, need to undergo a
             non-contrast head CT to exclude acute blood.

          -  Ventricular arrhythmias requiring continuous therapy or asymptomatic sustained
             ventricular tachycardia within 12 months before study entry. Continuous or
             intermittent atrial fibrillation requiring treatment. Patients with significant ECG
             abnormalities such as complete left bundle block and third degree heart block are not
             eligible.

          -  QTc prolongation with other medications that required discontinuation of that
             medication.

          -  Congenital long QT syndrome or 1st degree relative with unexplained sudden death under
             40 years of age.

          -  QTc with Bazett s correction that is unmeasurable, or &gt;470 msec on screening ECG.
             (Note: If a subject has a QTc interval &gt;470 msec on screening ECG, the screen ECG may
             be repeated twice (at least 24 hours apart). The average QTc from the three screening
             ECGs must be less than or equal to 470 msec in order for the subject to be eligible
             for the study. Patients who are receiving a drug that has a risk of QTc prolongation
             excluded if QTc is greater than or equal to 460 msec.

          -  Any concurrent medication that may cause QTc prolongation or induce

        Torsades de Pointes 1) Drugs listed in Appendix H, Table 2, that in the investigator s
        opinion cannot be discontinued are allowed; however, must be monitored closely.

          -  Concomitant medications that are moderate or potent inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4
             are not permitted within the specified wash-out periods prior to or during treatment
             with AZD7451

          -  Patients with a history of corneal disease such as corneal ulcers, corneal
             dystrophies, keratoconus.

          -  Refractory nausea and vomiting or significant gastrointestinal impairment, as judged
             by the investigator, that would significantly affect the absorption of AZD7451,
             including the ability to swallow the oral solution.

          -  Patients known to have active hepatitis B or C (testing not required for entry on
             study).

          -  Other concomitant anti-cancer therapy except corticosteroids.

          -  Patients with a peripheral neuropathy CTCAE &gt; 1 in the prior 4 weeks or active muscle
             diseases (including dermatomyositis, polymyositis, inclusion body myositis, muscular
             dystrophy and metabolic myopathy) or family history of myopathy. Patients with
             pre-existing renal disease including glomerulonephritis, nephritic syndrome, Fanconi
             syndrome or renal tubular acidosis.

          -  Evidence of active infection or active bleeding diatheses.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AZD7451 is an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with AZD7451, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with AZD7451. Female patients must have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of
             dosing if of child-bearing potential or must have evidence of non-childbearing
             potential by fulfilling one of the following criteria at screening:

          -  Post-menopausal defined as aged more than 50 years and amenorrheic for at least 12
             months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments.

          -  Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy, bilateral
             oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation.

          -  Patients known to have a malignancy (other than their malignant glioblastoma) that has
             required treatment in the last 12 months and/or is expected to require treatment in
             the next 12 months (except for non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ in the
             cervix or ductal carcinoma in situ).

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks or incompletely healed surgical incision before starting
             therapy.

          -  Patients known to be HIV-positive (testing is not required for entry on study) and on
             combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for
             pharmacokinetic interactions with AZD7451. In addition, these patients are at
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
