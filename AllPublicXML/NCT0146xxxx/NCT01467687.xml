    <description>Statistical comparison of verapamil blood levels obtained over 72 hours when dosed with either the Verelan PM capsule or Synerx Pharma verapamil controlled release capsule. The comparison will compare Cmax and AUC and provide 80 to 125% confidence intervals for the values.</description>

        for HIV, HbsAg or HCV. Positive test results for drugs of abuse or alcohol. Subjects whose
        sitting blood pressure is less than 110/60 mmHg at screening or 100/55 mmHg prior to dosing
        in each period.

        Subjects whose pulse is lower than 55 b.p.m. at screening or 50 b.p.m. prior to dosing in
        each period.

        Subjects whose PR interval is &gt;190 msec at screening and &gt;200 msec prior to dosing in each
        period.

        Subjects whose QTc interval is &gt;450 msec at screening and prior to dosing in each period.

        Subjects who have used any drugs or substances known to be strong inducers and/or
