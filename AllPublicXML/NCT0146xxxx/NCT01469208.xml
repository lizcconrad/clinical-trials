  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hope to determine if music therapy will have beneficial effects on
      physiologic parameters, behavioral states, and pain scale evaluations in infants with
      gastroschisis defects and if music therapy promotes parental/caregiver relaxation and
      demonstrates to the parent/caregiver that music is an effective tool to calm and soothe their
      infant at risk for chronic gastrointestinal discomfort.

      Babies will be enrolled during the perinatal period, with therapy to begin after surgical
      repair of the gastroschisis defect and when the neonatologist deems the baby stable enough
      for music therapy intervention. Enrolled subjects may receive up to 3 music therapy
      sessions/week and these sessions may continue until discharge. There is no follow up after
      discharge.

      Each one hour session (20-30 minutes of music and 30 minutes of quiet) will include:

        1. Pre music therapy behavior state will be assessed using CRIES scale and recorded.

        2. Five minutes of baseline vital signs will be recorded.

        3. Music therapy lasting 20-30 minutes, will start. Music therapist will use guitar and lap
           harp to perform live lullaby tupe music with or with out vocals. Decibel levels will be
           maintained at 65-75dB. Session will stop if infant shows any signs of
           distress/agitation. Vital signs will be collected every 1-4 minutes during music
           session.

        4. After session behavior state using CRIES scale will be recorded.

        5. Family/caregiver will be given a questionnaire to fill out.

        6. 30 min of quiet will start.

        7. At the end of quiet time, behavior state and vital signs will be recorded for the last
           time.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to starting the music therapy session, family/caregivers, if present, will be informed
      of study session progression. They will be reminded of appropriate behavioral protocol to
      maintain therapeutic environment during session - i.e. minimal taking &amp; touching, cell phones
      off etc. A &quot;Do Not Disturb - Music Therapy Session in Progress&quot; will be posted outside pts
      room on the door.

      Behavioral state data and vitals signs collected during sessions will be entered into a
      database. Also recorded, will be general information about the baby and its mother, such as,
      gestational age, apgar scores, mothers age and race, number of days post surgical repair etc.
