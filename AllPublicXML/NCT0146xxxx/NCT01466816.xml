  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The investigators hypothesize that a change in dietary fat quality (an increase in
      unsaturated fatty acids) may modulate fuel partitioning within the type 2 diabetic muscle
      towards less accumulation of lipid metabolites and an improved insulin sensitivity.

      Objective:

        1. The contribution of dietary vs endogenous fat sources to lipid overflow in the
           circulation and to skeletal muscle lipid uptake and storage in obese insulin resistant
           subjects vs obese insulin sensitive controls.

        2. The acute effect of meals with various fatty acid composition ((high saturated (SFA) vs
           polyunsaturated (PUFA) vs monounsaturated (MUFA)) on skeletal muscle lipid uptake and
           storage, fatty acid mediated gene expression and postprandial insulin sensitivity in
           obese insulin resistant subjects.

      Study design: single-blind randomized cross-over trial

      Study population: obese males (35-70 years) with or without insulin resistance

      Intervention:

        1. 1 test meal

        2. 3 test meals with a different fatty acid composition

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      More insight whether dietary fat quality may modulate circulating lipids and skeletal muscle
      fatty acids handling, and may affect oxidative capacity and lipid storage in parallel to an
      increased insulin sensitivity.
