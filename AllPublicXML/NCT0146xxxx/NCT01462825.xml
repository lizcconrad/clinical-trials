      The purpose of this study is to determine the inhibiting effects of a single consumption of
      tomato ketchup on inflammation which will be induced ex-vivo in human blood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The consumption of tomatoes and tomato products has been associated with a lower risk of
      developing cardiovascular disease and some types of cancer. Tomatoes and tomato products
      provide a good source of antioxidants (lipophilic and hydrophilic). The major tomato
      antioxidants comprise lycopene, α-tocopherol and ascorbic acid. It has been reported that
      these antioxidants in isolated form exert directly or indirectly anti-inflammatory effects in
      vitro. Studies with tomatoes or tomato products revealed that the observed anti-inflammatory
      effects could not be caused by the presence of only one antioxidant. It was suggested that
      these effects were due to the combination of antioxidants.

      In recent cell culture studies with human endothelial cells we have shown that tomato ketchup
      exerts significant anti-inflammatory effects, which could be related to the particular
      composition of antioxidants, i.e. lycopene, ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol. Since, however,
      the relevance of the observed anti-inflammatory effects for humans is entirely unknown, the
      present pilot study aims to assess the acute effects of a single tomato ketchup consumption
      on ex vivo elicited inflammation in a small group of healthy volunteers.
