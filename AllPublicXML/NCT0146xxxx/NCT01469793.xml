  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, dose-escalating study will assess the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of DMOT4039A in participants with unresectable pancreatic or
      platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Cohorts of participants will receive multiple ascending
      intravenous doses of DMOT4039A.
