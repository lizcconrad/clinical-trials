      This is a dose finding pilot study to evaluate the safety and determine the maximum tolerated
      dose of the combination of carfilzomib and pomalidomide with dexamethasone (CPD) in patients
      with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma followed by a phase II expansion at the MTD to
      evaluate efficacy.
