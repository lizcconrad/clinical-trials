  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics, lipid lowering effect and
      lipidomic profiles of 8-weeks rosuvastatin treatment by OATP1B1 genotype in hyperlipidemia
      patients.

      Within 3 weeks prior to the first administration of study drug, volunteers who agreed the
      participation of this study by their written consent will undergo screening, including
      physical examination and clinical laboratory test etc, to evaluate whether they are eligible
      to participate in this study. Study drugs will be administered at about 9 A.M. in the morning
      of the first drug administration day, after blood collection for evaluation of
      pharmacokinetics, lipid profiles, metabolomics and urine collection for metabolomic and
      genetic analyses.

      Subjects should take the investigational product by themselves every morning for 8 weeks. On
      the days of 2nd, 4th, 6 and 8th week, blood collection for evaluation of pharmacokinetics,
      lipid profiles, metabolomics and urine collection for metabolomics will be conducted by
      visiting the clinical trials center. On the days of 2nd, 4th and 6th week, the study drug
      will be taken after blood and urine collection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults aged 35 to 55 years at the time of screening

          -  Serum LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) level â‰¤130 mg/dL

          -  Must be reliable and willing to make themselves available during the study period

          -  Must be willing to give blood sample for genotyping

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A subject with present clinical manifestation or past medical history of hepatic,
             renal, respiratory, neurologic, hematologic, oncologic, psychiatric, cardiovascular or
             endocrine disease, except hyperlipidemia and mild hypertension (SBP &lt; 160 mmg, DBP
             &lt;100 mmHg).

          -  Administration of lipid lowering agent within 2 weeks before the first study drug
             administration.

          -  A subject with a history of gastrointestinal disease or surgery (except simple
             appendectomy or repair of hernia), which could influence the absorption of the study
             drug.

          -  A subject with a history of drug abuse, or a positive urine drug screening test

          -  A subject who takes or should take any medication that can influence lipid lowering
             effects or metabolic profiles of the study drug during the study period.
             (Investigators judge the wash-out period of the previously used medication before the
             administration of the study drug.)

          -  A subject who has participated in any other clinical trial within 3 months before the
             study drug administration.

          -  A subject who is judged to be ineligible to participate in the study due to abnormal
             clinical laboratory results or other reasons by investigators.
