    <textblock>
      A post-marketing uncontrolled observational study to explore and describe the effectiveness
      of adalimumab, as prescribed according to the local product label, in patients with
      moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in China.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This post-marketing, multi-center, uncontrolled observational study will be conducted in an
      open-label, non-interventional setting, for RA patients using commercially available
      adalimumab administered subcutaneously (SC). Adalimumab effectiveness will be assessed based
      on data from clinic visits beginning at Baseline and continuing per standard of care for RA.
      The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of adalimumab in improving patients'
      disease activity measured by Disease Activity Score (DAS28) at Week 12. The maximum
      observation period for each patient is approximately 52 weeks, as long as the patient
      continues to receive adalimumab injections. The study was terminated due to low enrollment.

    <measure>Number of Participants With at Least a Moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A EULAR response reflects improvement in disease activity and attainment of a lower degree of disease activity based on the Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 score. The DAS28 score ranges from 0-10, with higher scores indicating more disease activity.
A Good Response is defined as an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of more than 1.2 compared with Baseline and attainment of a DAS28 score of less than or equal to 3.2.
A Moderate Response is defined as either:
an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of greater than 0.6 and less than or equal to 1.2 from Baseline and attainment of a DAS28 score of less than or equal to 5.1 or, an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of more than 1.2 from Baseline and attainment of a DAS28 score of greater than 3.2.
No Response is defined as either an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of less than or equal to 0.6, or an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of greater than 0.6 and less than or equal to 1.2 and attainment of a DAS28 of more than 5.1</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12, 26</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 is a validated index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and general health are included in the DAS28 score. Scores on the DAS28 range from 0 to 10. A DAS28 score &gt; 5.1 indicates high disease activity, ≤ 5.1 indicates moderate disease activity, ≤ 3.2 indicates low disease activity, and ≤ 2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index is a patient-reported questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It consists of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and daily activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With at Least a Moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Response</title>
        <description>A EULAR response reflects improvement in disease activity and attainment of a lower degree of disease activity based on the Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 score. The DAS28 score ranges from 0-10, with higher scores indicating more disease activity.
A Good Response is defined as an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of more than 1.2 compared with Baseline and attainment of a DAS28 score of less than or equal to 3.2.
A Moderate Response is defined as either:
an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of greater than 0.6 and less than or equal to 1.2 from Baseline and attainment of a DAS28 score of less than or equal to 5.1 or, an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of more than 1.2 from Baseline and attainment of a DAS28 score of greater than 3.2.
No Response is defined as either an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of less than or equal to 0.6, or an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of greater than 0.6 and less than or equal to 1.2 and attainment of a DAS28 of more than 5.1</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With at Least a Moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Response</title>
          <description>A EULAR response reflects improvement in disease activity and attainment of a lower degree of disease activity based on the Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 score. The DAS28 score ranges from 0-10, with higher scores indicating more disease activity.
A Good Response is defined as an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of more than 1.2 compared with Baseline and attainment of a DAS28 score of less than or equal to 3.2.
A Moderate Response is defined as either:
an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of greater than 0.6 and less than or equal to 1.2 from Baseline and attainment of a DAS28 score of less than or equal to 5.1 or, an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of more than 1.2 from Baseline and attainment of a DAS28 score of greater than 3.2.
No Response is defined as either an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of less than or equal to 0.6, or an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of greater than 0.6 and less than or equal to 1.2 and attainment of a DAS28 of more than 5.1</description>
