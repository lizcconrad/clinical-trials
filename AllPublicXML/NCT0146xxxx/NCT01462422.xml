      This study compares two community-level strategies: selective administration of 800 mcg
      sublingual misoprostol to women at 350 mL blood loss for secondary prevention of postpartum
      hemorrhage (PPH) with universal use of 600 mcg oral misoprostol at the time of delivery for
      primary prevention of PPH. The study hypothesizes that at community-level births, secondary
      prevention for women is non-inferior (based on clinical parameters) to universal prophylaxis
      provided to women for primary prevention of PPH. This cluster-design non-inferiority trial
      has the potential to inform service delivery programs on clinical outcomes, program
      feasibility, cost and acceptability of two different community models of PPH care using
      misoprostol.

      Rationale for Research: There is an absence of concrete data on the programmatic and
      cost-effectiveness of different service delivery models for prevention and treatment of
      postpartum hemorrhage with misoprostol, prompting a discussion of whether resources are best
      spent on misoprostol for primary prevention at lower levels (with treatment carried out at
      higher levels via referral) or whether immediate proactive treatment strategies should be
      considered. As the training and policy implications of universal prevention versus selective
      treatment approaches vary, simple and effective service delivery models are urgently needed
      to help governments and organizations decide how to best focus their limited resources. This
      study proposes to study the efficacy of a hybrid strategy (i.e., secondary prevention) that
      combines elements of prevention and treatment. Results of this study could provide a new
      model of care that will medicate fewer women, save costs and address the clinical conundrum
      of guessing at the safety of administering a prevention dose of misoprostol followed quickly
      by a larger treatment dose.

      Study design: This randomized cluster trial will recruit women with deliveries attended by
      auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) that occur at homes or at health sub-centers. ANMs will be
      randomized to administer the intervention as described in the primary or secondary prevention
      arm.

    <description>A 20% rate of post delivery Hb ≤7.8 gm/dL in the study arm with women receiving selective administration of 800 mcg sublingual misoprostol is non-inferior to a 13% rate of post delivery Hb ≤ 7.8 gm/dL in the study arm with women receiving universal 600 mcg oral misoprostol prophylaxis.</description>

    <description>The cost-effectiveness of the two interventions will be compared.

Rare side effects include: abdominal pain from uterine cramping, seizures and palpitations (only with overdosing). All women in both study arms, including those in the secondary prevention arm who do not receive the study drug, will be asked if they experienced any of these symptoms.</description>
