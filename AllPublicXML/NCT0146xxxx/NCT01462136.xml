        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects between 18 and 75 years of age and with a body mass index ≥
             19 to ≤ 32 kg/m2, and weight of ≥ 40 kg.

          2. Normal renal function (Group I), or pre-existing renal impairment (Groups II- IV). The
             disease process responsible for the underlying renal dysfunction must be stable at the
             time of study entry, and the subject cannot have had episodes of acute renal disease
             in the year prior to dosing.

          3. Two CrCl determinations obtained during the screening portion of the study, with the
             lower value within 25% of the higher value.

          4. Females of child-bearing potential (defined as less than one year post-menopause) are
             eligible for enrollment if they are not breast feeding, they have a negative serum
             pregnancy test before study entry, and they are willing to use a highly effective
             method of contraception* for at least three months before study drug administration,
             during the study, and for at least one month after study completion.

          5. Subjects in stable health as judged by the investigator based on the laboratory
             criteria and no clinically significant findings on the medical history or physical
             examination.

          6. Subjects who are willing to comply with all study activities and procedures and have
             provided written informed consent prior to any study procedures and have signed and
             dated a HIPAA authorization form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis

          2. Unstable cardiovascular disease,

          3. Uncontrolled hypertension, asthma, diabetes (type I or type II), thyroid disease, or
             seizure disorder.

          4. Myasthenia gravis, or any other neuromuscular disorder.

          5. Known infection with Hepatitis B (antigen positive), Hepatitis C (antibody positive),
             or HIV.

          6. Active malignancy; carcinoma in situ of the prostate or the skin (basal cell or
             squamous cell) are permitted.

          7. Presence of functioning transplant organ or blood procedure.

          8. Significant change in either over-the-counter or prescription medications or
             supplements within the two weeks prior to dosing, defined as any new medication or any
             dosage adjustment that is significant in the judgment of the investigator and the
             medical monitor.

          9. Use of drugs known to cause renal disease such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
             drugs in the two weeks prior to dosing.

         10. History of significant hearing loss or a family history of hearing loss, excluding age
             related (≥ age 65) hearing loss. A prior diagnosis of sensorineural hearing loss or
             Ménière's disease.

         11. Clinically significant illness, including viral syndromes within three weeks of
             dosing.

         12. Current participation in a clinical study of an investigational product.

         13. Taken any investigational medication/therapy within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever
             is longer, before dosing of ACHN-490 Injection.

         14. Consumed more than 28 units of ethanol per week at any time in the 6 months before
             dosing (1 unit of ethanol is equivalent to 8 ounces of beer, 4 ounces of wine, or 1
             ounce of spirits) or history of alcoholism and/or drug/chemical abuse. Also,
             consumption of any amount of ethanol within 48 hours of ACHN-490 Injection dosing.

         15. Donated more than 500 mL of blood within 60 days prior to signing the informed consent
             form.

         16. Previous participation in this or any other ACHN-490 Injection study.

         17. Known hypersensitivity to Aminoglycosides or any component of the ACHN-490 Injection.

         18. Any other medical, psychological, or social condition which, in the opinion of the
             principal investigator (PI) or the medical monitor, would prevent the subject from
             fully participating in the study, would represent a concern for study compliance or
             would constitute a safety concern to the subject.

         19. An employee of the investigator or study center with direct involvement in the
             proposed study or other studies under the direction of that Investigator or study
             center, or a family member of the employee or investigator.
