  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of CDX-1127, a therapy that targets the immune system and may act to promote
      anti-cancer effects. The study enrolls patients with hematologic cancers (certain leukemias
      and lymphomas), as well as patients with select types of solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CDX-1127 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called CD27 found on
      certain immune cells and also on certain hematologic tumor cells and may act to promote
      anti-tumor effects.

      This study will evaluate the safety and activity of escalating doses of CDX-1127 in patients
      with B-cell and T-cell hematologic malignancies known to express CD27 and solid tumors that
      are more likely to be responsive to the immune system.

      Eligible patients who enroll in the dose escalation portion of the study will be assigned to
      one of 5 dose levels of CDX-1127. This first phase of the study will test the safety profile
      of CDX-1127 and will assess which dose to test in future studies.

      During the Expansion phase, cohorts of approximately 15 patients each will receive the study
      treatment to continue to evaluate the safety profile of CDX-1127 and to determine if it has
      an effect on their cancer. Expansion cohorts may be limited to one or more tumor types.

      Patients enrolled in the study may receive study treatment for up to 5 cycles, until their
      disease has progressed or until it is necessary to stop the treatment for safety or other
      reasons.

      All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if their cancer is
      responding to treatment and for any side effects that may occur.

    <description>Patients will initially receive a single dose of CDX-1127, followed by a 28-day observation period and a Multi-Dose Phase (one &quot;cycle&quot; of 4 weekly doses of CDX-1127). All patients with stable disease who do not experience a DLT or start alternate anti-cancer treatments may then be eligible for a Retreatment Phase (up to 4 additional &quot;cycles&quot;). Patients with confirmed partial response or complete response will be followed for response duration and may be eligible for additional cycles of treatment at the time of relapse/progression.
The dose of CDX-1127 given for the Dose Escalation phase will depend on the cohort each patient is assigned to, and will range between 0.1 and 10.0 mg/kg of CDX-1127.</description>
