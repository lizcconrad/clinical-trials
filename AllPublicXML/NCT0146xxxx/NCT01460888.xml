    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of olaparib in combination with radical radiotherapy in patients with oesophageal cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>MTD will be determined by the number of patients experiencing dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in each treatment cohort, using a 3+3 dose escalation schedule. A DLT is determined as grade 4 oesophagitis or dysphagia, or any other grade 3 toxicity. DLTs will be assessed weekly during treatment (day -3 to week 5), 10-14 days after completing treatment, weekly for a further 3 weeks and 3 months after completing treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessed at all study visits, up to 3 years post treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicity of treatment will be assessed via collection of adverse events, categorised by the NCRI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) V3. Adverse event data will be collected continuously from screening, with patients seen weekly during their treatment, 10-14 days after treatment completion, weekly for 3 further weeks, 3 monthly until 1 year then 6 monthly until 3 years.</description>
