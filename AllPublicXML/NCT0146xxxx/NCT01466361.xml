    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the ability of a nicotine lozenge to relieve craving for a
      cigarette compared to a matched placebo (a placebo is like sugar pill and contains no
      active).

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Nicotine Cravings VAS Scores in Light Smokers</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 minutes post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Participants completed a nicotine craving assessment consisting of following five items: I have a desire for a cigarette right now, if it were possible I would smoke right now, All I want right now is a cigarette, I have an urge for a cigarette, I crave a cigarette right now. All participants indicated their craving intensity on a pre-drawn 100 mm scale ranging from 0 (disagree) to 100 (agree). At the end of the craving assessment period, mean VAS score (in mm) was measured.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Responders With Improved Craving Scores in Heavy and Light Smokers Group</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline prior to provoked craving paradigm, baseline post provoked craving paradigm</time_frame>
    <description>Responders were defined as participants with an increase of at least one point (on the 100 point VAS scale) from baseline prior to provoked craving paradigm (B1) to baseline post provoked craving paradigm (B2) on the average cravings score. Percentage of these responders was calculated to evaluate the provocation rate.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 0 minute, 60 minutes and 5 days post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>AE was defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment/s.
SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death; is life threatening; requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization results in disability/ incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Nicotine Cravings VAS Scores in Light Smokers</title>
        <description>Participants completed a nicotine craving assessment consisting of following five items: I have a desire for a cigarette right now, if it were possible I would smoke right now, All I want right now is a cigarette, I have an urge for a cigarette, I crave a cigarette right now. All participants indicated their craving intensity on a pre-drawn 100 mm scale ranging from 0 (disagree) to 100 (agree). At the end of the craving assessment period, mean VAS score (in mm) was measured.</description>
