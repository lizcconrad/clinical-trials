  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the relationship between changes in plasma cortisol and symptom
      reduction resulting from individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) participating
      in an 8-week program of mindfulness-based stretching and breathing exercise. The
      investigators hypothesize that at the completion of participation in the 8-week program,
      exercise-induced symptom reduction will be associated with changes in cortisol levels.

      This study will employ an intent-to-treat design to evaluate the relationship between
      exercise-induced posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom reduction and exercise-induced
      changes in cortisol level. The participants consist of nurses and the intervention will be
      conducted at the Clinical and Translational Science Center of the University of New Mexico.
      The study was approved by the Human Research Protections Office of the university. Nurses who
      are screened positively for PTSD will be randomly assigned to either control or exercise
      group. At baseline and in weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16, immediately after the phlebotomy for serum
      cortisol, the investigators will ask the participants to rate the severity of their PTSD
      symptoms using the PTSD Checklist (PCL).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in PTSD Checklist - Civilian Version (PCL-C) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-C is a 17-item self-report instrument that measures the symptoms of PTSD. A total score, ranging from 17 to 85, is found by summing the scores of the 17 items. Higher values are considered to be a worse outcome. The inclusion criteria in the PTSD symptomatic group is a PCL-C total score of at least 28 with a score of 3 or higher on 1 or more items.To detect a reduction in PTSD symptom severity with a 2-sided 5% significance level and a power of 80%, the mean difference of PCL-C scores of 5.16 or greater requires a sample size of 20 participants for Exercise and Control groups, given an anticipated dropout rate of 10%. Data analyses are conducted using an a priori intention-to-treat approach. The analysis for the between-group differences of the intervention is conducted using t-tests comparing Exercise and Control groups at post-intervention. The analysis for the within-group difference is conducted using repeated measures ANOVA for both groups at baseline and week 8.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in serum cortisol levels at 8 weeks. Serum cortisol samples were collected at 8:00 Ante Meridian (AM). The changes are calculated from two time points as the values at 8 weeks minus the values at baseline.</description>

The intervention consists of stretching and balancing movements combined with breathing and a focus on mindfulness.Over the course of 8 weeks, the intensity of the exercise increases, but the sequence of the movements is the same.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in PTSD Checklist - Civilian Version (PCL-C) Score</title>
        <description>The PCL-C is a 17-item self-report instrument that measures the symptoms of PTSD. A total score, ranging from 17 to 85, is found by summing the scores of the 17 items. Higher values are considered to be a worse outcome. The inclusion criteria in the PTSD symptomatic group is a PCL-C total score of at least 28 with a score of 3 or higher on 1 or more items.To detect a reduction in PTSD symptom severity with a 2-sided 5% significance level and a power of 80%, the mean difference of PCL-C scores of 5.16 or greater requires a sample size of 20 participants for Exercise and Control groups, given an anticipated dropout rate of 10%. Data analyses are conducted using an a priori intention-to-treat approach. The analysis for the between-group differences of the intervention is conducted using t-tests comparing Exercise and Control groups at post-intervention. The analysis for the within-group difference is conducted using repeated measures ANOVA for both groups at baseline and week 8.</description>
