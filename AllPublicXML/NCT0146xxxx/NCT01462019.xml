  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inadequate care during pregnancy and postpartum are predisposing factors for the emergence of
      nipple fissures. The therapeutic approach of nipple trauma care guidelines aimed at the
      breast and the appropriate techniques for breastfeeding. These measures, however, have a much
      more preventive than curative, it is not, in most cases, sufficient to power the closing of
      nipple trauma. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      phototherapy device designed specifically for the treatment of nipple trauma.

    <description>wounds nipple will be measured weekly in the initial assessment and for six consecutive weeks, using a digital caliper and classified at the beginning and end of treatment according to Pereira et al (1998).

    <description>the participants of this group will receive, in addition to guidance on the breast care and proper techniques for feeding, phototherapy applications through photobiomodulador a device developed specifically for the treatment of nipple injuries. The parameters for applications are: continuous mode of emission, power output 10 mW, wavelength infrared (scanning from 880 to 904 nm) fluence of 4 J / cm ² and total application time of 10 minutes.
The application of the device will be three times per week on alternate days for seven consecutive weeks, totaling 21 sessions.</description>
