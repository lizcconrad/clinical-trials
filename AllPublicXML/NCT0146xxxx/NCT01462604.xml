    <textblock>
      This is a 6-week, single arm, pilot study to test the study procedure, educational materials,
      and measurement instruments for the educational intervention in HER2 overexpressing
      metastatic or advanced breast cancer patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60 subjects with HER2+ metastatic or advanced breast cancer who meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study. All subjects will receive
      education intervention for 6 weeks including education on Day 0, follow-up phone calls on Day
      1 and Day 7, reminder phone calls before Week 3 and 6 visit and telephone hot line number.
