  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patient numbers with metabolic syndrome and diabetes have doubled in the last decade.
      Data that physical exercise ameliorates the metabolic syndrome are convincing, although the
      mechanisms of the effect in man are not clear. Numerous endocrine or molecular mechanisms
      modified by physical exercise are known to be hypoxia-sensitive, i.e. by hypoxia-inducible
      factor-1 (HIF-1) regulation. Thus, relative hypoxia may link physical exercise and
      modification of endogenous metabolism. Medical communities seem ill equipped to address the
      primary issues involved. The investigators have experience with normobaric &quot;hypoxia chambers&quot;
      and will now test a (physical exercise) training program, using state-of-the-art assessments
      available nowhere else in Germany. The investigators will compare hypoxia chamber, to ambient
      training, to test the notion that specific exercise conditions could regulate specific
      molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome. Indeed, hypoxia
      chamber training could be superior to conventional training in terms of reducing
      cardiovascular risk factors or improving fitness. The investigators will test overall
      metabolism-related effects with a metabolic chamber. The investigators will test local
      metabolism with microdialysis during exercise routines, and the investigators will perform
      fat and muscle biopsies to investigate tissue-related effects. The investigators include
      experience from a broad-ranging spectrum. The investigators findings might improve
      understanding mechanisms linking physical exercise and endogenous metabolism. Furthermore,
      they could influence decision-making regarding non-pharmacological interventions.
