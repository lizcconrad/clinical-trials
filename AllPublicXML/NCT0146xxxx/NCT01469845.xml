  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute bronchiolitis is a common, distressing illness affecting children. A virus infects the
      lungs, and then the airways become blocked, leading to difficulties with breathing. It is the
      most common reason why children are admitted to hospital, with 1-3% of all children admitted
      to hospital during their first winter, creating enormous strains on NHS services. The
      majority of those admitted with the condition are under six months of age and the associated
      stress for parents is considerable. After forty years of research the best treatment we have
      is supportive care and oxygen.

      Recent research suggests that salt water, sprayed as a mist so that the children can breathe
      it in ('nebulised 3% hypertonic saline') might help children with acute bronchiolitis.
      Scientists think that the salt water changes the mucus which blocks the airways so that it
      can be cleared more easily. Three small research studies all suggested that a child's time in
      hospital could be reduced by a quarter by using this treatment. If this was true, it would be
      good for children, their families and the children's wards trying to cope with the large
      numbers admitted with bronchiolitis every year.

      To decide whether this treatment should be used throughout the NHS, we need to run a
      randomised controlled trial of hypertonic saline in a large number of children. The trial
      will tell us if adding saline to usual care reduces distress in both children and parents, as
      well as whether it reduces the length of time they stay in hospital. We will then know if the
      treatment is the best thing for children with bronchiolitis and whether it provides the NHS
      with good value for money.
