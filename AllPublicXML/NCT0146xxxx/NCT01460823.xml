  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying a new way of doing cochlear implant surgery called
      &quot;Percutaneous Cochlear Implantation&quot;. In this surgery, instead of doing a mastoidectomy where
      about 30ml of bone is removed, the investigators use image-guided technology (similar to GPS
      systems used to guide automobile travel) to drill directly from the surface of the skull to
      the cochlea, removing less than 2ml of bone. To use this technique, three markers (or anchor
      screws) are screwed into the bone around the ear. Next, an x-ray of the head (called a CT
      scan) is taken. Using this CT scan, a path to the inner ear (cochlea) is planned and a drill
      guide (Microtable) is made that mounts on the anchor screws. A drill will be attached to the
      guide and used to drill a path from the surface of the skull to the inner ear (cochlea). The
      implant electrode will be threaded through this path. All of these procedures take place
      under general anesthesia.

    <description>A successful percutaneous cochlear implantation is one where the facial nerve was not damaged during the procedure and the surgeon did not resort back to the standard implantation method. We will measure the percentage of participants who underwent successful cochlear implantation via the percutaneous method.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18-80 year old patients undergoing cochlear implantation who are able to participate
             in the informed consent process.

          -  Pre-operative CT scan of head performed as standard of care for cochlear implant
             work-up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with co-morbidities so severe that the potential additional operating room
             time is deemed to be too significant of an operative risk. This assessment is made by
             the local institutions pre-operative work-up.

          -  History of allergic reaction/intolerance of local anesthesia and/or epinephrine.

          -  History of allergic reaction to titanium.

          -  Patients with severe anatomical abnormality of the temporal bone.

          -  Patients with severe chronic ear disease for whom traditional mastoidectomy might
             offer benefit.

          -  Females who are pregnant.
