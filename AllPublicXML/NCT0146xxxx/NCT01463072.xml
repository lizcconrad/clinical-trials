      This phase II trial studies the side effects of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
      formulation in treating older patients with breast cancer that has spread from where it
      started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or other places in the body
      (metastatic). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
      formulation, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the tolerability (grade 2-5 toxicity, neuropathy grade 2
      or higher, need for dose reductions, or delays) of weekly nab-paclitaxel (paclitaxel
      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation) in older adults with locally advanced or
      metastatic breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the efficacy (response and time to progression) of
      weekly nab-paclitaxel in older adults with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer using
      a stratification factor based on patient age (at least 5 patients age 75 years or older and
      no more than 15 patients age 65-70 years).

      II. To explore predictors of the need for dose reduction, dose delays, or grade 2-5 toxicity
      and neuropathy grade 2 or higher based on a cancer-specific geriatric assessment.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

    <description>Rates and associated 95% exact Clopper and Pearson binomial confidence limits will be estimated.

    <time_frame>30 days after completion of last course of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Rates and associated 95% exact Clopper and Pearson binomial confidence limits will be estimated for objective response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) and clinical benefit rate (CR + PR + stable disease [SD]) as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Progression free survival will be estimated using the product limit method of Kaplan and Meier.</description>

    <time_frame>30 days after completion of last course of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>General linear models and graphical methods will be used to explore factors as identified by a cancer-specific geriatric assessment that may be predictive of toxicity/dose reduction or dose delays. Assessment consists of an evaluation of the individual's functional status, comorbid medical conditions, cognition, nutritional status, psychological state, and social support.</description>
