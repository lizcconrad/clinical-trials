  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the overall analgesic effect of a single oral dose of etoricoxib
      compared to ibuprofen in participants with moderate-to-severe primary dysmenorrhea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants who meet all the study entry criteria will be randomly allocated to 2 possible
      sequences of the 2 treatment regimens over the course of 2 menstrual cycles.

      In treatment sequence 1, participants will receive etoricoxib 120 mg daily in menstrual cycle
      1, and ibuprofen up to 2400 mg/daily in menstrual cycle 2. In treatment sequence 2,
      participants will receive ibuprofen up to 2400 mg/daily in menstrual cycle 1 and etoricoxib
      120 mg daily in menstrual cycle 2.

    <measure>Total Pain Relief Score Over the First 6 Hours (TOPAR6) After the Initial Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>TOPAR6 was calculated by multiplying the pain relief (PR) score (0- to 4-point scale, with 0=None, and 4=Complete for pain relief) at each time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point, and summing these weighted values up to 6 hours post the initial Day 1 dose. The range of TOPAR6 score is 0 to 24, with increasing scores indicating greater pain relief.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sum of Pain Intensity Difference Scores Over the 6-Hour Time Period (SPID6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Intensity Difference (PID) score is the difference between the baseline pain intensity (PI) score and the PI score recorded at each time point post initial dose, as calculated by subtracting the pain intensity at each of the subsequent time points from the baseline pain intensity score; therefore, it is on a -1 to 3 scale, with a large value representing a greater treatment effect. SPID6 is derived by multiplying the PID score at each time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point, and summing these weighted values up to 6 hours and it is on a scale of -6 to 18.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Participant Global Evaluation of Pain at 6 Hours After the Initial Dose (GLOBAL6)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The GLOBAL6 was recorded by the participant at 6 hours (or at the time of rescue medication use) after taking the first dose of study medication. The GLOBAL6 uses a pain relief scale of 0 to 4, where 0 = poor pain relief, 1 = fair pain relief, 2 = good pain relief, 3 = very good pain relief, and 4 = excellent pain relief.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Participant Global Evaluation of Pain at 24 Hours After the Initial Dose (GLOBAL24)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The GLOBAL24 was recorded by the participant at 24 hours (or at the time of rescue medication use) after taking the first dose of study medication. The GLOBAL24 uses a pain relief scale of 0 to 4, where 0 = poor pain relief, 1 = fair pain relief, 2 = good pain relief, 3 = very good pain relief, and 4 = excellent pain relief.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Time to &gt;=1 Unit Improvement From Baseline in Pain Intensity During the 6 Hours After the Initial Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The time to a change from baseline in pain intensity score of &gt;=1 unit on the pain intensity scale was calculated. The pain intensity scale rates participant pain on a scale of -1 to 3, with larger values associated with greater treatment effect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak Pain Intensity Difference (PID) During the 6 Hours After the Initial Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Peak PID during the 6 hours post initial dose is defined as the maximum PID score recorded during first 6 hours after the initial dose of study medication. PID is evaluated on a scale of -1 to 3, with larger values representing a greater treatment effect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak Pain Relief (Peak PR) During the 6 Hours After the Initial Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Peak PR during the 6 hours post initial dose is defined as the maximum PR score
recorded during the first 6 hours after the initial dose of study medication. PR is recorded on a scale of 0 to 4, with 0 = no pain relief, 1 = little pain relief, 2 = some pain relief, 3 = a lot of pain relief, and 4 = complete pain relief.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Using Rescue Medication 24 Hours After the Initial Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Hours</time_frame>
    <description>Acetaminophen 250 mg, isopropylantipyrine 150 mg and anhydrous caffeine 50 mg (Saridon) was provided to each participant as rescue medication. Participants were permitted to take 2 tablets at a time and up to 3 doses within 24 hours of dosing of study drug for rescue purposes.</description>

    <description>PID during the 12 hours following the initial dose is defined as the maximum PID score recorded during first 12 hours after the initial dose of study medication. PID is evaluated on a scale from 0 to 3, with 0 = no pain, 1 = slight pain, 2 = moderate pain, and 3 = severe pain.</description>

        <description>The Pain Intensity Difference (PID) score is the difference between the baseline pain intensity (PI) score and the PI score recorded at each time point post initial dose, as calculated by subtracting the pain intensity at each of the subsequent time points from the baseline pain intensity score; therefore, it is on a -1 to 3 scale, with a large value representing a greater treatment effect. SPID6 is derived by multiplying the PID score at each time point by the duration (in hours) since the preceding time point, and summing these weighted values up to 6 hours and it is on a scale of -6 to 18.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With a Global Evaluation of Study Medication of Good, Very Good, or Excellent at 24 Hours After the Initial Dose</title>
          <description>At 24 hours following the initial dose of study medication, participants were asked to rate their perception of pain control as poor, fair, good, very good, or excellent. The number of participants that reported good, very good, or excellent pain control at 24 hours post initial dose were summed.</description>
          <population>The population consisted of all participants that received at least one dose of study treatment and completed the assessment at 24 hours post initial dose of study medication</population>
