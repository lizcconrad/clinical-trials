      Evidence supporting use of bioabsorbable polymer drug eluting stents (BP-DES) is uncertain.
      Thus the investigators planned a meta-analysis to compare outcomes of BP-DES versus PP-DES in

      Evidence supporting use of bioabsorbable polymer drug eluting stents (BP-DES) is uncertain.
      Previous studies suggested that BP-DES are at least as effective as durable polymer drug
      eluting stents (PP-DES). Thus the investigators planned a meta-analysis to compare outcomes
      of BP-DES versus PP-DES in obstructive coronary artery disease. Medline and Web databases
      were searched for studies comparing BP-DES and PP-DES for obstructive coronary disease,
      reporting rates of overall mortality, target lesion revascularization (TLR), myocardial
      infarction (MI), binary restenosis and late lumen loss (LLL) with a follow-up ≥ 6 months.
      Odds ratios (ORs) will be computed from individual studies and pooled according to a fixed
      effect (e.g. inverse variance weighting) or random effect model in case of statistical
      heterogeneity. Given the a priori heterogeneous nature of the observational analyses,
      separate subgroup analysis of studies with PLA bioabsorbable polymer loaded with biolimus A19
      (BP-BES) is prespecified.
