  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventavis it's a treatment for pulmonary hypertension, administered by an inhaler called
      I-Neb.

      In these patients, the non compliance of the treatment becomes its ineffective and increases
      the complications and mortality of the disease.

      It is therefore important to know which the adherence of patients to their treatment is and
      try to promote it.

      One possibility to reach a good level of adherence is the patient education regarding the
      drug administration and also to comply as better is possible the recommendations of the
      physician.

      For this reason, the objective of our study is to demonstrate improvement in the level of
      treatment compliance when they follow a strategy of continuing education, assessed by the
      device and software called Insight.

      The only special procedure to participate in the study then is that patients involved could
      receive more training than usual.

      Investigators expect involving in this study around 50 patients in treatment with Ventavis
      and diagnosed of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension in 10-12 hospitals throughout Spain.

      The patients who participated in the study will be followed for 12 months from inclusion in
      the study and will perform around 5 visits in total.
