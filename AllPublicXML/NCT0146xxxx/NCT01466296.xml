      The overall objective is to improve the functional status of Middle East adolescents with
      disabilities due to cerebral palsy (CP) and disabilities in adults due to cerebro-vascular
      stroke (Hemiplegia) by a collaborative Jordanian-Israeli-Palestinian-Moroccan applied
      research project.

      Specific objectives are:

      To compare the efficacy of two rehabilitation technologies to facilitate neural
      reorganization, transfer and retention of treatments results to improve walking in real life
      situations The investigators suggest a new approach of treatment intervention that will
      induce unexpected changes of underfoot slopes during walking and will force the central
      nervous system (CNS) to react and solve problems.

      The investigators also propose that the new approach will have a significantly superior motor
      function improvement that will be transferred to real environmental settings and be retained
      for long periods of time.

      Research methods and materials

      Subjects:

      A total of 166 subjects will be studied in two groups of handicapped persons:

        1. 83 Teenagers with cerebral palsy: the CP group

        2. 83 Subjects with chronic hemiparesis: the HP group

      Each group will be sub-divided into three secondary groups, having similar age distributions
      and level of motor function for the two different therapy approaches:

        -  21 Treadmill exercise training

        -  21 Training by randomized perturbations wearing the Random Shoe system

        -  21 Training with dummy shoes without perturbations

      The time flow protocol:

      Recruiting subjects according to inclusion/exclusion criteria

      The subjects will be tested with the following measures (see arms)at

        -  T0 before starting the interventions to form a base line

        -  T1 after 12 weeks of intensive treatments 3 x week 45 min.

        -  T2 6 months after T1, after the treatment was stopped, to check retainment of results of
           the treatments after a period of normal daily schedule of the subject

      The treatments will start in a week from T0 The T1 will be performed in a week after the
      treatment was completed The T2 will be performed 6 months (take or leave 2 weeks) after T1, 6
      months after treatment was stopped.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>10 meter walk test (10MWT)</measure>
    <description>10-meter walk test (Rossier &amp; Wade, 2001) will assess normal walking speed. The participant walks a straight path distance of 10 meters at normal walking speed with time recorded. The test will be performed twice with the number of steps counted. The tester or an assistant remains near the participant to prevent a fall or injury if they appear unsteady.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6 Minuets Walk Test (6MinWT)</measure>
    <description>The 6-minute walk test (Enright, 2003) will be used to assess walking endurance. Subjects are instructed to cover as much distance as possible while walking around a marked course for 6 minutes. A member of the research staff will closely monitor the subjects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mechanical Efficiency</measure>
    <description>Mechanical efficiency will be measured by the stair-climbing test (SCT) (Bar-Haim, et al. 2004; 2008). Metabolic cost is predicted from heart rate during the external work while stair-climbing and mechanical efficiency is calculated.</description>

    <description>Each subject will undergo 36 intervention sessions, 3 times per week over 12 weeks. Each session will last up to 45 minuets, depending on the subject's endurance. During each session the subject will perform basic stretching and muscle strengthening, then wear the random shoes and perform a set of exercises following specific verbal tasks, e.g., &quot;Walk 5 strides forward,&quot; or, &quot;Walk to the right side until I ask you to stop.&quot; During this stage of walking the device will impose perturbations in the range tolerated by the subject.
