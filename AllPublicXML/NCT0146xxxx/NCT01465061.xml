      With the rise of usage of the internet, online social networks have recently been gaining
      popularity. Joining these groups can be beneficial to patients with chronic medical illness,
      such as psoriasis.This was a cross-sectional online survey of psoriasis patients in the
      Philippines who are members of online support groups. The survey was conducted for a period
      of three months.The purpose of the research project was to describe the demographics, disease
      characteristics, activities and benefits of online support groups to Filipino patients with
      psoriasis. The extent to which members experience empowering processes and outcomes was also
      evaluated.
