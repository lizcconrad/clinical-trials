    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia, Europe and North America. The aim of the trial is to
      evaluate safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body)
      of NNC-0156-0000-0009 (nonacog beta pegol, N9-GP) in previously treated children with
      Haemophilia B.

    <measure>Incidence of Inhibitory Antibodies Against Coagulation Factor IX (FIX) Defined as Titre Above or Equal to 0.6 Bethesda Units (BU)</measure>
    <time_frame>From 0 to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Inhibitors were analysed with either the Nijmegen modified factor IX Bethesda assay or a heat/cold Nijmegen modified factor IX Bethesda assay. Number of subjects who developed inhibitory antibodies against factor IX are reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Inhibitory Antibodies Against Coagulation Factor IX (FIX) Defined as Titre Above or Equal to 0.6 Bethesda Units (BU)</measure>
    <time_frame>From week 52 until the last patient has completed the trial (no later than 31-Oct-2018)</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Bleeding Episodes During Prophylaxis</measure>
    <time_frame>From 0 to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of bleeding episodes per subject during routine prophylaxis was assessed using the individual annualised bleeding rates (bleeding episodes per subject per year).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Haemostatic Effect of N9-GP in Treatment of Bleeding Episodes by 4-point Categorical Scale for Haemostatic Response (Excellent, Good, Moderate and Poor)</measure>
    <time_frame>From 0 to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Description of the haemostatic effect of nonacog beta pegol when used for treatment of bleeding episodes was measured and listed according to the four point scale for haemostatic response as below:
Excellent - abrupt pain relief and/or clear improvement in objective signs of bleeding within 8 hours after a single infusion.
Good - noticeable pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within 8 hours after a single injection.
Moderate - probable or slight beneficial effect within the first 8 hours after the first injection but requiring more than one infusion within 8 hours.
Poor - no improvement, or worsening of symptoms within 8 hours after two injections.
A success rate was calculated based on counting good or excellent as successes and poor and moderate as failures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incremental Recovery at 30 Minutes (IR30min)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 (30 minutes after first exposure)</time_frame>
    <description>The incremental recovery was calculated by dividing the baseline-subtracted factor IX activity (U/mL) measured in plasma 30 min after dosing by the dose injected at time 0 expressed as U/kg body weight.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trough Level (Single-dose )</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 (one week after first exposure)</time_frame>
    <description>The mean pre-dose factor IX levels was measured with the one-stage clotting assay during the trial. Geometric mean of the lowest activity of factor IX recorded at week 0 (immediately before next dose was given).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trough Level (Steady State)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The mean pre-dose factor IX levels was measured with the one-stage clotting assay during the trial. The estimated mean of the lowest activity recorded immediately before next dose was given from week 4 to week 52. The analysis is based on a mixed model on the log-transformed plasma concentrations with subject as a random effect and the mean trough level is presented back-transformed to the natural scale.</description>

        <title>Haemostatic Effect of N9-GP in Treatment of Bleeding Episodes by 4-point Categorical Scale for Haemostatic Response (Excellent, Good, Moderate and Poor)</title>
        <description>Description of the haemostatic effect of nonacog beta pegol when used for treatment of bleeding episodes was measured and listed according to the four point scale for haemostatic response as below:
Excellent – abrupt pain relief and/or clear improvement in objective signs of bleeding within 8 hours after a single infusion.
Good – noticeable pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within 8 hours after a single injection.
Moderate – probable or slight beneficial effect within the first 8 hours after the first injection but requiring more than one infusion within 8 hours.
Poor – no improvement, or worsening of symptoms within 8 hours after two injections.
A success rate was calculated based on counting good or excellent as successes and poor and moderate as failures.</description>

          <title>Haemostatic Effect of N9-GP in Treatment of Bleeding Episodes by 4-point Categorical Scale for Haemostatic Response (Excellent, Good, Moderate and Poor)</title>
          <description>Description of the haemostatic effect of nonacog beta pegol when used for treatment of bleeding episodes was measured and listed according to the four point scale for haemostatic response as below:
Excellent – abrupt pain relief and/or clear improvement in objective signs of bleeding within 8 hours after a single infusion.
Good – noticeable pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within 8 hours after a single injection.
Moderate – probable or slight beneficial effect within the first 8 hours after the first injection but requiring more than one infusion within 8 hours.
Poor – no improvement, or worsening of symptoms within 8 hours after two injections.
A success rate was calculated based on counting good or excellent as successes and poor and moderate as failures.</description>
