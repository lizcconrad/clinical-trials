      Everolimus in refractory testicular germ cell cancer. Everolimus 10 mg /day/ is administered
      to the patient until progression, unacceptable toxicity, complete response or inability of
      the subject to comply with study requirements. Feasibility of surgical resection will be
      assessed after every 2 cycles of the treatment in patients with partial response.

      Treatment Schedule: Everolimus will be administered at a dose of 10mg/day orally once a day.
      One cycle of therapy consists of 28 days.

      Estimated duration of treatment: Until progression, unacceptable toxicity, complete response
      or inability of the subject to comply with study requirements.

      Feasibility of surgical resection will be assessed after every 2 cycles of the treatment in
      patients with partial response.

             abnormality that would impair, in the judgment of investigator, excess risk associated
             with study treatment, or which, in judgment of the investigator, would make the
             patient inappropriate for entry into this study,
