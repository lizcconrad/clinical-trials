      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the risk of serious asthma-related events
      (asthma-related hospitalizations, endotracheal intubations, and deaths) in children 4-11
      years old taking inhaled fluticasone propionate/salmeterol combination is the same as those
      taking inhaled fluticasone propionate alone.

    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Composite endpoint was defined as clinically relevant endpoint that is constructed from combinations of other clinically relevant endpoints of serious asthma outcomes (i.e., asthma-related hospitalization, asthma-related endotracheal intubation, or asthma-related death). Hospitalization was defined as an inpatient stay or a &gt;=24-hour stay in an observation area in an emergency department or other equivalent facility. Time to first event in the composite endpoint of serious asthma-related outcomes over the 6-month study treatment period was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. An estimate of absolute risk difference and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were also included. The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population included all participants randomized to study drug and who took study treatment.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With at Least One Asthma Exacerbation Over the 6-month Study Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with asthma exacerbation over the 6-month study treatment period are presented. Participants from mITT population with screening childhood asthma control test (C-ACT) scores of 20 or higher, one exacerbation in the previous year, and either low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) + one or more adjunctive therapy or medium-dose ICS monotherapy or medium-dose ICS and one or more adjunctive therapy as prior asthma therapy were included for this endpoint. Time to first exacerbation analyzed using a cox proportional hazards regression model. The number of asthma exacerbations were compared between treatments using a negative binomial regression model. The modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population consisted of the ITT participants with a different data cut-off for supportive analyses of the primary composite safety endpoint.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Withdrawn From Study Treatment Due to Asthma Exacerbation Over the 6-month Study Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>An exacerbation is defined as deterioration of asthma requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection) for at least 3 days (up to 10 days) or a single depot corticosteroid injection. Number of participants experiencing at least one exacerbation from mITT population were included for this endpoint. The number of participants withdrawn from study treatment due to asthma exacerbation over the 6-month study treatment period are presented.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Rescue-free Days Over the 6-month Study Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Rescue-free days were days without use of rescue albuterol/salbutamol (other than pre-exercise treatment) over the 6-month study treatment period. The mean percentages of rescue-free days over the months 1-6 (defined as treatment days 2-182) are summarized. Number of participants over treatment days 2-182 from mITT Population were included for this endpoint.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Asthma Control Days Over the 6-month Study Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>An asthma control day is one on which rescue albuterol/salbutamol use was recorded as 0, no night time awakenings were recorded, no asthma exacerbations were recorded, no work, school, or daycare days were missed by caregiver or participant due to asthma, coughing symptom score was &lt;=1 and wheezing symptom score was 0. The mean percentages of asthma control days over the months 1-6 (defined as treatment days 2-182) are summarized. Number of participants over treatment days 2-182 from mITT Population were included for this endpoint.</description>

      <recruitment_details>A total of 6250 participants were enrolled and randomized to study treatments; total 6208 participants took at least one dose of study drug.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants aged between 4 to 11 years having asthma, defined by the regional asthma guidelines for at least 6 months, having history of at least one occurrence of treatment with systemic corticosteroid and with no change in asthma therapy for the last 4 weeks from first visit were enrolled for the study.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants were randomized to either FSC or FP, and the treatment dose was based on participants' asthma control status. There was no intent to compare the dosage levels received, therefore participants were combined for comparison regardless of dosage. In this treatment arm, participants received one of following treatments: FSC 100/50 microgram (µg) or FSC 250/50 µg as one inhalation twice daily (BID) (approximately 12 hours apart) via Dry powder inhaler (DPI) during the 6 month treatment period. Rescue medication (albuterol/salbutamol) via metered dose inhaler (MDI) was permitted during study treatment.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Experiencing an Event in the Composite Safety Endpoint of Serious Asthma Outcomes ( Asthma-related Hospitalization, Asthma-related Endotracheal Intubation, or Asthma-related Death)</title>
        <description>Composite endpoint was defined as clinically relevant endpoint that is constructed from combinations of other clinically relevant endpoints of serious asthma outcomes (i.e., asthma-related hospitalization, asthma-related endotracheal intubation, or asthma-related death). Hospitalization was defined as an inpatient stay or a &gt;=24-hour stay in an observation area in an emergency department or other equivalent facility. Time to first event in the composite endpoint of serious asthma-related outcomes over the 6-month study treatment period was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. An estimate of absolute risk difference and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were also included. The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population included all participants randomized to study drug and who took study treatment.</description>

        <description>Number of participants with asthma exacerbation over the 6-month study treatment period are presented. Participants from mITT population with screening childhood asthma control test (C-ACT) scores of 20 or higher, one exacerbation in the previous year, and either low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) + one or more adjunctive therapy or medium-dose ICS monotherapy or medium-dose ICS and one or more adjunctive therapy as prior asthma therapy were included for this endpoint. Time to first exacerbation analyzed using a cox proportional hazards regression model. The number of asthma exacerbations were compared between treatments using a negative binomial regression model. The modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population consisted of the ITT participants with a different data cut-off for supportive analyses of the primary composite safety endpoint.</description>
