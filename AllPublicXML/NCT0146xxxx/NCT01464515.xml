  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first feasibility study in order to test if deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
      (TMS) treatment with high frequency (10Hz) will improve the symptoms of patient MCI (Mild
      Cognitive impairment). The hypothesis of the study is that high frequency treatment with deep
      TMS will improve the daily functioning of patients who suffers from MCI.

             lify functioning.

          3. Scored of one standard deviation below the average (according to standardization of
             age and years of schooling) in the memory index and Mindstream test, without any major
